Two members of a Delaware conservative policy group and a state lawmaker are among four individuals who sued the state's environmental agency this week over a tightening of state ""cap and trade"" controls on power-plant carbon dioxide emissions.
\
A researcher with the Dover-based Caesar Rodney Institute and Rep. Harold ""Jack"" Peterman, R-Milford, filed the challenge in Superior Court, along with Christian Hudson, of Hudson Management and Sam Yoder & Sons in Greenwood, and CRI board member John Moore, chief executive of Acorn Energy.
\
Targeted by the action were Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control cuts in allowable carbon dioxide emissions by the state's largest power plants. The cuts were approved late last year.
\
The limits were originally imposed in 2008 after Delaware joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, formed by Northeast states when efforts to develop a nationwide cap and trade program for carbon dioxide broke down.
\
The suit claims DNREC violated the state's constitution in November by adopting, without a three-fifths majority of the General Assembly, regulations that reduced annual limits on power-plant emissions. The change made it likely that future pollution credits would be more scarce, driving up their cost and, eventually, the cost of electric power, the lawsuit claims.
\
""Multiple parties warned DNREC this decision was a potential violation of the Delaware Constitution in public comment sessions but the comments were ignored,"" David Stevenson, director of CRI's Center for Energy Competitiveness, said in a written statement released Thursday.
\
DNREC Secretary Collin P. O'Mara said the law that allowed Delaware's participation in RGGI also allows the agency to adjust emissions caps. He added the recent changes were approved through a process that allowed for public review and participation.
\
""RGGI has been recognized as the most cost-effective way of achieving emissions reductions, and will likely serve as one of the models for the new [national] greenhouse gas rule for power plants,"" O'Mara said.
\
Delaware and Maryland are part of what is now the nine-state RGGI. New Jersey dropped out in 2011. Under the program, power plants buy credits, or allowances, for each ton of carbon dioxide released, with auction proceeds widely used for energy-related programs.
\
In practice, actual emissions credit costs have been far lower than the $10 or more per ton rate expected when the program was under development. Credit costs during an auction in November averaged around $3 per ton, with Delaware's total proceeds since 2008 now at about $45.9 million.
\
Scientists have long pointed to carbon dioxide as a leading greenhouse gas pollutant, linked to rising global temperatures and climate change. Emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and other greenhouse cases could push global average temperatures up several degrees by the turn of the century, researchers have warned, triggering changes in climate patterns, more extreme weather and rising sea levels, among other consequences.
\
RGGI states originally agreed to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 2014 and then reduce emissions by 10 percent between 2015 and 2019. But the global recession and increasing use of natural gas instead of coal for power-plant fuel drove emissions down far faster, leading RGGI states to approve a 45 percent reduction in the 2014 target.

\
A regional cap-and-trade program raised more money than expected in its most recent auction, meaning more money for state energy efficiency programs.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a nine-state program designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and fund programs that promote energy efficiency and renewable power and lower electric bills.
\
In its June 5 quarterly auction, it raised $124.5 million, a record amount for a three-month period. It was the first time since 2010 that all of the allowances were sold in two consecutive quarters.
\
Under the program, power plants and other polluters have limits on how much carbon dioxide they may emit. Their owners can buy allowances to go over that limit. The program was seen as a model for a national cap-and-trade program, but Congress did not pass one.
\
As power producers make their plans for the next several years, they are trying to ensure they have enough emission permits to meet their projected needs. Companies buy permits to match what they they think they'll need, based on their expectations of future auctions, said Collin O'Mara, state natural resources secretary. He is also chairman of RGGI.
\
Money from the program had been down in recent years due largely to the economic downturn, as well as the increased use of natural gas, which emits less carbon than coal when burned. But revenues were boosted when the program recently announced it would reduce the number of allowances that were available.
\
Of the $124.5 million, Delaware's share was $4.64 million. Two-thirds of that will go to the Sustainable Energy Utilitiy, Delaware's not-for-profit energy efficiency program.
\
The rest will go toward other state programs like the weatherization program and the low-income heating assistance program LIHEAP, as well as an alternative fuel vehicle project.
\
O'Mara called the initiative ""an effective way to realize environmental goals.""

\
Lawmakers plan to tackle a daunting task in the coming months: putting a price on the right to emit greenhouse gases.
\
Those gases -- primarily carbon dioxide -- are linked to warming temperatures and changing climate patterns across the globe. President Barack Obama and key members of Congress see emissions reductions as a necessary step after years of inaction.
\
Earlier this month, a coalition of corporations and environmental groups that includes the DuPont Co. offered its own input: a 24-page proposal outlining a model regulatory scheme. The document describes a ""cap-and-trade"" program, in which emissions from greenhouse gas-intensive sectors would be capped at a certain level and companies would receive allowances to release the gases.
\
Companies who cut emissions below the capped level could sell their allowances on an open market. The goal would be to slash emissions 80 percent by 2050, compared with 2005 levels.
\
""We're quite confident that it's something that the U.S. and global economies can do in a very manageable way, and if done carefully, create some new market opportunities,"" said Michael Parr, senior manager of government affairs for DuPont, a founding member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership.
\
The group's 31 members comprise utilities, manufacturers, oil and chemical companies, automakers and environmental and public interest groups.
\
Other members with local connections include American International Group, Exelon, NRG Energy and General Motors.
\
The group hopes its plan, hammered out after two years of negotiations, can inform the debate in Congress. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has made climate-change legislation a top priority. She chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, of which Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., is a member and chairman of a key subcommittee.
\
Carper said Boxer has asked him to play a lead role in developing climate-change legislation, which he hopes to introduce by the end of spring. The Delaware senator said he has worked with the climate partnership since the group formed, and the approach laid out in the blueprint largely mirrors his own favored approach.
\
""It's very difficult to build consensus around an issue as complicated and as contentious as climate change,"" Carper said. ""Having a very broad coalition, like USCAP, is a huge help.""
\
Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said several developments bode well for climate-change legislation: the arrival of a new president and new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the growing cooperation of businesses and the realization that such legislation will open up new market opportunities.
\
""I think all these things combined will give us the opportunity to see something happen in the course of this year,"" said Castle, who supports a cap-and-trade program.
\
The newest member of Delaware's delegation, Democratic Sen. Ted Kaufman, also supports a cap-and-trade scheme: ""Cap-and-trade, designed carefully, is the best way to make pollution expensive -- and it gives businesses the incentive to find new products and processes, to cut costs by cutting emissions,"" he said.
\
Already here
\
The concept is not new: Ten Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, including Delaware, participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program targeting electric utilities, the country's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union instituted a carbon-trading system in 2005.
\
DuPont and others already participate in trading on the Chicago Climate Exchange, a voluntary cap-and-trade system. On the federal level, a cap-and-trade program enacted in the 1990s helped reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide.
\
But the scale of a federal cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases would likely dwarf other efforts and affect the price of electricity, gasoline and consumer goods.
\
Some experts predict the market for carbon will become the largest commodity market in the world.
\
The climate partnership's plan would cover large greenhouse gas-emitting facilities and carbon emissions from other fossil-fuel users.
\
The program would set limits for emissions at 2005 levels, cutting greenhouse gases as much as 20 percent by 2020, 42 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050.
\
Under USCAP's plan, a ""significant"" amount of emission allowances would be given away free at the program's beginning, with the goal of phasing out free allowances as low-carbon technologies gain traction.
\
The partnership's plan recommends permitting up to 3 billion tons a year of carbon offsets, overseen by a Carbon Market Board. Carbon offsets represent emissions that are reduced or avoided through third-party projects.
\
The blueprint calls for federal investments in low-carbon technologies to help ensure that emissions are reduced. John Byrne, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Delaware, said such spending is vital to help reduce carbon emissions.
\
But he said it's an open question whether such efforts should come before a cap-and-trade program, or run simultaneously with such a program.
\
""The real way to tackle this problem in the near term may be to emphasize ... energy efficiency, conservation and renewables,"" said Byrne, a member of a working group of the 2007 Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""These will lower carbon emissions, and can be more effective than trying to cap the emissions of the auto industry and the power sector.""
\
Some environmental groups have taken aim at provisions of the climate partnership's blueprint, including its reduction targets, the use of carbon offsets and its proposal to give away, rather than auction off, many of the initial allowances.
\
""Were such a proposal to be enacted into law, it would fail to achieve the emission reductions we need in the U.S. and would undermine our ability to meaningfully and credibly engage in international climate negotiations,"" said Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth.
\
Tax alternative
\
Another debate centers on the best approach to greenhouse gas regulation: a cap-and-trade scheme or a straight tax on emissions. The CEO of oil giant Exxon Mobil has come out in favor of a carbon tax, as have several members of Congress and economists.
\
""Every approach to climate change necessarily will involve higher energy prices,"" says a recent report from a group called the U.S. Climate Task Force. ""By capturing those price increases in a tax, this program can rebate its revenues and sharply reduce both the direct costs of the tax for most businesses and people, as well as most of the indirect costs.""
\
DuPont's Parr said a carbon tax would offer no guarantee of any environmental benefits.
\
""The beauty of cap-and-trade it that it provides environmental certainty -- you know what reductions you're going to get,"" Parr said.
\
Another strike against a carbon tax: It's probably a non-starter in Congress.
\
""As a political matter, I think it's not likely that we could get 60 votes, or even 51 votes, for a carbon tax,"" Carper said.
\
Carper agreed that the economic downturn was likely to color the political debate on greenhouse gas regulations. But the senator and others think a carbon-constrained world will open up new market opportunities that could counter any economic injury.
\
""Over time,"" Byrne said, ""I think a carbon cap-and-trade will help our economy, not harm our economy -- if it's done properly.""

\
Three little words played an outsized role in lifting Christine O'Donnell's primary campaign over Rep. Mike Castle's bid for the Republican spot in this year's U.S. Senate campaign.
\
Cap and trade.
\
Long associated with programs born 20 years ago under Republican President George H.W. Bush, cap and trade was until recently a label for complicated market- and auction-based strategies used to control acid rain, smog and greenhouse gases.
\
Last week, however, cap and trade became a stripped-down surrogate for the running national debate over energy policy, the environmental cost of American dependence on fossil fuels and the price of paying now, or later, for carbon dioxide emissions.
\
Cap and trade surfaced repeatedly last week among conservative candidates and Republican primary voters enraged over Republican Rep. Mike Castle's decision to support legislation that would make utilities pay more, now, to control CO2 emissions blamed for rising global temperatures.
\
The issue helped O'Donnell beat Castle, wrecked Michele Rollins' bid for the nomination as the Republican House candidate, and battered the campaigns of other moderate Republicans and Democrats around the country.
\
""I think it got hijacked by politics,"" said Liz Martin Perera, the Union of Concerned Scientists' climate change representative in Washington.
\
""It was easy to call it 'cap and tax' and start messaging to Americans who don't know any better that 'Crazy people in Washington are trying to triple your energy costs.' ""
\
David Anderson, a spokesman for Republican House primary winner Glen Urquhart, saw things differently.
\
""Most people are concerned about jobs and the fact that this would kill jobs,"" Anderson said. ""There's no real evidence that it would do anything for the environment, and we don't believe that's the way we need to approach clean energy. You don't impoverish the American people to do it.""
\
Conservatives' doubts about cap and trade have been growing since it emerged as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
\
The approach sets a broad cap, or limit, on total tons of pollution to be emitted each year, then sets up up markets where power plants and other smokestack owners can buy, sell and trade rights to those tons of emissions.
\
Scientists say the system has led to drastically reduced levels of forest- and lake-ruining acid rain caused by sulfur dioxide pollution. The trading system allowed cleaner industries to sell credits to plants with dirtier smokestacks that needed more time to control pollution or found it cheaper to wait.
\
""The emissions reductions were achieved for sulfur dioxide in about half the time anticipated, for about one-fifth the cost,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who has sponsored several bills to cut smog, acid rain and greenhouse gas emissions over the years.
\
Reports by the Environmental Protection Agency and private researchers reached the same conclusion. The EPA recently estimated that sulfur dioxide control measures, led by cap and trade, produced $122 billion in health and environmental benefits this year, for about $3 billion in costs.
\
Those claims were viewed skeptically by Todd Wynn, vice president of the Cascades Policy Institute, a free-market think tank in Oregon. Wynn said that easier and relatively cheap solutions were available to utilities confronted with acid rain program limits. In contrast, any attempt to cap carbon dioxide emissions to fight climate change will be unavoidably expensive.
\
""Carbon dioxide is extremely hard to take out of the processes that uphold and maintain our standard of living,"" Wynn said. ""It's much harder than it was for sulfur dioxide. Ultimately, it's not going to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, it's going to drive up costs.""
\
Higher costs for conventional fossil-fuel energy will make solar, wind and other green or renewable energy sources more competitive, Wynn said, but individuals will still wind up paying higher prices, in some cases for less-reliable electricity.
\
""Access to reliable and affordable energy is the lifeblood of our economy and our standard of living,"" Wynn said, adding that Congress should allow the market and technological innovators to find solutions, rather than dictate costs through carbon taxes.
\
Election hot button
\
Wynn's stand against cap and trade -- if not his reasoning -- was duplicated around the primary landscape last week, with voters frequently mentioning Castle's House vote last year in support of a cap-and-trade bill, part of an Obama administration-backed drive that eventually died with the threat of a Senate filibuster.
\
The longtime incumbent's arguments that he supports scientifically justified approaches never came up.
\
""I think the big thing was, once Castle voted for cap and trade, he lost all of us,"" said Sussex County Republican Elaine A. Moreland. ""It's going to hurt the economy for sure.""
\
Jason O'Neill, a Bear-area Republican and former secretary of the party committee's Colonial Region, said Castle's vote for cap and trade helped doom him with conservatives like himself.
\
""It's the biggest assault on people for energy costs,"" O'Neill said, adding that such a policy is one of the reasons that ""if you go to Europe, you can't go to a restaurant and get ice cubes.""
\
The issue looks likely to continue leading to the November election.
\
During a candidate debate in Wilmington last week, O'Donnell pledged to oppose cap-and-trade programs and predicted that it will ""cause household utility bills to skyrocket.""
\
""Cap and trade, while it might sound like a good thing, achieving clean energy, it does not do that. It will raise our utility bills and create a new commodities market at your expense,"" said O'Donnell, who could not be reached Tuesday.
\
Anderson, Urquhart's spokesman, branded cap and trade a disaster.
\
""It's wrong on two scores. It will totally exacerbate the economic turmoil in this country by raising utility rates and raising gasoline costs, and on the other side it will basically make some people billionaires off our pain,"" Anderson said.
\
""It's almost like a taxation where we the public don't even get the money -- it's a wealth transfer, as opposed to anything that will benefit the economy.""
\
Democratic U.S. House candidate John Carney could not be reached. Carney, however, has publicly supported cap-and-trade approaches to greenhouse gas controls, and made enforcement of the already established regional cap-and-trade program a part of his 2008 gubernatorial primary platform.
\
Daniel F. McElhatton, spokesman for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Chris Coons, said that Coons is ""certainly in line"" with Castle's moderate approach and willingness to consider cap and trade.
\
""Our perspective is that what comes out of the O'Donnell campaign and conservative talk shows and folks who just say no to anything,"" McElhatton said. ""They have no plans. Delaware is on the receiving end of a lot of pollution. If we can reduce that, we should.""
\
Katie Dickens, a Castle spokeswoman, said that the longtime Delaware lawmaker supported the program in part to help the nation move toward energy independence, a goal favored by conservatives.
\
Castle supporters pointed out that Delaware has a been a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state plan to cap and reduce carbon dioxide missions from power plants by 10 percent by 2019.
\
That only widened the debate, Dickens said.
\
""They started calling for [Gov. Jack] Markell to take us out of RGGI,"" Dickens recalled.
\
Brian Selander, Markell's chief spokesman, said he was unaware of any calls to pull the plug on RGGI.
\
""There's not been a strong call for the state to abandon this initiative, probably because Delaware benefits from it,' Selander said. ""The initiative has helped create jobs, reduce energy use and allows consumers to save money -- and will hopefully continue to do so in the future.""
\
Delaware has raised more than $17 million from sales of Delaware utility company credits for carbon dioxide emissions. Nearly all the money has been earmarked for subsidies to support green energy use and development, low-income energy assistance and greenhouse gas reduction projects. Costs per ton for the credits have been only a small fraction of the amounts predicted when the program began; none has been blamed for raising utility bills.
\
'Rallying cry'
\
Anthony Leiserowitz, a Yale University research scientist and director of the Yale Project on Climate Change, said Tuesday that the public remains largely uninformed on cap and trade, despite its emergence as an ""innovative"" solution to the problem of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions blamed for changing climate and rising global temperatures.
\
Scientists and environmental groups have argued that something has to be done to account for those emissions.
\
Most world governments, including the United States, allow utilities and autos to release carbon dioxide without accounting for the health and environmental consequences. That makes fossil fuels artificially cheap, because the price of oil and coal doesn't include the cost of climate change or respiratory diseases.
\
""I would say, as someone who studies public perception and opinions on the issues, that most people didn't know about it and weren't aware of it,"" said Leiserowitz.
\
""It has become increasingly a rallying cry of tea party candidates, many of whom have actually made cap and trade and, more broadly, opposition to the idea of global warming a way to distinguish themselves,"" Leiserowitz said. ""The issue, strangely enough, became a way to say 'I am more conservative than you, because I don't support cap and trade.' ""

Although cap and trade would cost U.S. industry about $800 billion over the next 40 years, it would save twice that amount in environmental and other benefits, according to a Brookings Institution analysis.

CRITICS:
\
Individual electric bills will go through the roof, and it would be a huge economic burden on the U.S. economy, causing loss of jobs.

Anthony Leiserowitz, a Yale University research scientist and director of the Yale Project on Climate Change, said Tuesday that the public remains largely uninformed on cap and trade, despite its emergence as an ""innovative"" solution to the problem of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions blamed for changing climate and rising global temperatures.
\
Scientists and environmental groups have argued that something has to be done to account for those emissions.
\
Most world governments, including the United States, allow utilities and autos to release carbon dioxide without accounting for the health and environmental consequences. That makes fossil fuels artificially cheap, because the price of oil and coal doesn't include the cost of climate change or respiratory diseases.
\
""I would say, as someone who studies public perception and opinions on the issues, that most people didn't know about it and weren't aware of it,"" said Leiserowitz.
\
""It has become increasingly a rallying cry of tea party candidates, many of whom have actually made cap and trade and, more broadly, opposition to the idea of global warming a way to distinguish themselves,"" Leiserowitz said. ""The issue, strangely enough, became a way to say 'I am more conservative than you, because I don't support cap and trade.' ""

SUPPORTERS:
\
Although cap and trade would cost U.S. industry about $800 billion over the next 40 years, it would save twice that amount in environmental and other benefits, according to a Brookings Institution analysis.
\
CRITICS:
\
Individual electric bills will go through the roof, and it would be a huge economic burden on the U.S. economy, causing loss of jobs.

ACROSS BORDERS
\
OUR VIEW
\
There are good grounds for optimism this Earth Day. Granted, this spring's international report affirming global warming invoked daunting scenarios. But increasingly industries and governments are heeding the alarms of scientific monitors.
\
In the United States, of course, this federal administration is determinedly skeptical and a grudging negotiator of environmental regulation within and across borders. But even Bush officials have conceded that the Arctic is melting out from under polar bears and spiking utility and petroleum demands necessitate alternatives.
\
And the U.S. Supreme Court just told off the Environmental Protection Agency for evading new vehicle emissions standards on carbon dioxide that 11 states want, led by California. States have united in other lawsuits in lower courts to raise the bar on regulation -- for example, the mercury dispute in which Delaware is a party.
\
In fact, the environmental leaders today are working at the state level. Their push is shoving federal inertia out of the way.
\
The National Governors Association notes that 45 state executives singled out energy sources and conservation in their new-year addresses. And most want to pursue renewable wind, solar, hydro and biofuel projects. Sponsorship of research facilities, infrastructure building and business tax incentives are on their agendas.
\
U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, the Delaware Democrat who was formerly governor, is goading the federal administration again to reduce air pollution on a faster time table by 2015. His latest version of cap-and-trade legislation includes carbon dioxide as well as limits on mercury, nitrogen and sulfur emissions. His co-sponsors in the Senate mirror the states in the environmental vanguard.
\
The political climate has changed too in Washington with the loss of Republican control. Sen. Carper remarked, ""I think people feel what was an impossible dream might be possible in this Congress."" But if the environmental message hasn't sunk in the capital, the states will come knocking.

The News Journal
\
A sharp green line divides the environmental stands of Democratic and Republican candidates for Delaware's open seats in Congress.
\
Voters have been denied a chance, however, to see that divide.
\
The state's only public, nonpartisan congressional candidate forum on environmental issues was scuttled this week when Republican Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell -- who hammered primary opponent Mike Castle for his vote on cap-and-trade pollution controls -- did not reply to repeated invitations to participate.
\
Glen Urquhart, Republican candidate for the House, separately declined to attend, citing other commitments. Both Democratic candidates had accepted the invitation.
\
Those no-shows have drawn criticism from Democratic candidates and some voters. The state has a big stake in many environmental issues: smog standards, clean energy, toxic-waste cleanups, groundwater contamination, control of farmland runoff, greenhouse-gas emissions, rules for federal dredging projects, climate change, sea-level rise and river water standards.
\
""The environment should be an issue, but they're not addressing it,"" said Cynthia J. O'Neil, a Hockessin-area resident and registered Independent. ""There are certainly environmental issues that are important in a state like Delaware, where we have a high cancer rate, and there are problems with air quality and water quality.""
\
The planned Oct. 12 forum was sponsored by some of Delaware's largest environmental and citizen groups, including Delaware Nature Society, the League of Women Voters, the National Wildlife Federation and the Jewish Federation of Delaware.
\
""We've had this scheduled since May,"" said Brenna Goggin, of the Delaware Nature Society. ""We told all the candidates, 'If you win the primary, we'd like you to join our forum.' ""
\
Goggin said the environment appears to have taken a back seat in this election.
\
""With all the issues right now, the environment, unfortunately, isn't in the top five. At least it doesn't seem that way, given the fact that this was the only event focused entirely on those issues,"" she said.
\
Neither O'Donnell's campaign nor Urquhart's responded to repeated requests for comments on the forum or for details on their environmental positions.
\
Samuel B. Hoff, a professor in the history and political science department at Delaware State University, said the candidates should not be permitted to evade questions on their environmental positions.
\
""Environmental issues are absolutely critical to Delaware,"" Hoff said. ""We have the issue of the Delaware River dredging. We have the fact that all three counties have failed air-pollution standards put out by the EPA. There are groundwater problems throughout the state.""
\
""It certainly should be something that the candidates should be concerned about,"" Hoff said, ""and they should be called to account to answer in terms of their positions.""
\
Democratic Senate candidate Chris Coons and Democratic House candidate John Carney questioned their opponents' decisions to skip the debate.
\
""I think that our state deserves concrete answers on important policy issues,"" Coons said Thursday. ""That's what this campaign should be about. Much of the national media is focused on things that I think don't matter as much to Delaware as jobs, the economy, the environment and moving the country forward.""
\
A Carney spokesman, said Carney had been looking forward to the debate.
\
""He's disappointed that Christine O'Donnell and Glen Urquhart decided not to attend, since there are clear differences between the candidates with regard to protecting our environment.""
\
Coons, New Castle County executive and a former County Council president, puts his views on energy, the environment and offshore drilling on his campaign website. He also talks at length on the topic.
\
O'Donnell doesn't use the word environment anywhere on her key Web pages. A statement under the heading of ""Energy"" notes: ""Supports a market-based approach to energy solutions that will keep competition high and energy prices low.""
\
A separate Twitter page entry on O'Donnell's site declares: ""Delaware, you didn't trade Cap-and-Trade Castle for Cap-and-Trade Coons. Eye on the ball.""
\
Coons said he supports efforts to control greenhouse gases blamed for rising global temperatures and changing climate. But Congress is unlikely to approve the House-passed version of the cap-and-trade bill that would cap industrial carbon dioxide emissions and allow low-polluting companies to sell permits to pollute to others. The program is intended to provide economic incentives for companies to clean up their act.
\
Delaware Rep. Mike Castle, one of eight Republicans to vote for the bill in the House, became a lightning rod for conservative wrath over the issue, with local voters and national figures alike making cap-and-trade a tea party mantra. Tea party candidates claim the program would cost billions.
\
""I think our government has a critical role to play in supporting and sustaining innovation and creativity as we move toward a future where more of our energy comes from U.S. sources and more of our energy comes from renewable sources,"" Coons said. ""To suggest that we need less government involvement in protecting the environment, in advancing alternative energy, in fighting for our manufacturing companies through trade and exports, I think, is wrong-headed.""
\
Coons said he believes ""climate change is real and that human activity is contributing to it,"" potentially with disastrous long-term consequences. But he also said the United States needs to ""find a solution that does not needlessly shackle American manufacturing and industry,"" while also demanding other nations commit to reductions.
\
Carney, a former lieutenant governor, has stressed his conservation and clean-air credentials for years. While lieutenant governor, he broke with Gov. Ruth Ann Minner and supported an offshore wind-turbine project. More recently he has opposed the White House on offshore drilling in the Atlantic.
\
""I understand the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring clean water and fresh air for future generations,"" Carney said Thursday. ""That's why I stood up to President Obama and opposed his plan to drill for oil off the coast of Delaware. It's a risk to our environment and our economy that we just cannot afford to take.""
\
Carney also has pressed for expanded investigations of possible environmental links to the state's cancer incidence and death rate. His campaign has pledged ""to identify federal funding for a statewide body burden study to better detect any contaminants in our air, water, or environment that put Delawareans at risk.""
\
Urquhart has joined O'Donnell in attacking cap-and-trade, saying on his website only that it ""caps our opportunities and trades away our jobs. We must stop this bad policy which is fundamentally wealth and redistribution to the richest corporations.""
\
The Republican also claimed the federal government has ""gone overboard"" in efforts to protect the environment and conserve open space,"" but provides no details. In his platform summary, he contends environmental regulations promulgated by agencies go far beyond the law enacted by Congress.
\
Helene L. Tankersley, a Millsboro-area Republican, said concerns about the nation's limping economy are more important than the environment for now.
\
""We don't follow that as much as what affects our family and the people I see around us -- the raises that we don't get any more, especially in Social Security, and Medicare costs went up for me,"" she said. ""Everything is going up, and that's what we're worried about.""
\
In northern Delaware, Stenning Woods resident and Democrat David Stewart said he was unhappy over the skipped debate.
\
""They absolutely should be talking about it,"" he said. ""I grew up in the Newport area, not far from the DuPont federal Superfund site. We never knew that was out there"" until the Environmental Protection Agency proposed adding the now-stabilized site to its list of the nation's most-hazardous landfills in 1987.

\
A 10-state regional cap-and-trade program is looking to tighten up pollution limits ahead of a more robust economic recovery, and in the process seeking to pump more money into state programs fostering renewable energy and efficiency programs.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which began operating roughly four years ago, set a goal of reducing emissions in the 10 states it covered to 165 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. Scientists say increasing man-made CO2 emissions, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, is the leading cause of climate change.
\
Due to the unexpected economic collapse, as well as the increasing use of natural gas instead of coal, energy efficiency, and other factors, emissions fell to an even lower level - 91 million tons, said Collin O'Mara, Delaware natural resources secretary. He's also the chairman of the initiative.
\
The nonprofit that runs the program earlier this month proposed lowering the cap to the current level 91 million tons, requiring generators to keep reducing emissions even as economic activity grows. The cap would fall by 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2020.
\
""We wanted to make sure the cap reflected the current reality,"" O'Mara said.
\
But observers note that carbon reductions in recent years have come from forces beyond the program's control, and question whether it has truly been a good example of a cap-and-trade program at work.
\
Under the program, power plants are limited in how much carbon dioxide they may emit, and their owners can purchase allowances to go over that limit. The program was seen as a model for a national cap-and-trade program, but that failed in Congress several years ago.
\
The nonprofit also proposed reducing the number of allowances by 45 percent, in an effort to increase their prices, driving more funds to the carbon-reduction programs in the states. New Jersey dropped out of the program in 2011, with Gov. Chris Christie citing the low selling price of the allowances.
\
Last month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed lowering the cap as part of his State of the State address.
\
If the plan works as imagined, funds to the state programs could double by 2020, with $2.2 billion more for those projects.
\
Most of the states involved in the program, including Delaware, will be able to make the change on the regulatory level, without having to run it through their legislatures, O'Mara said. This will include public hearings, he said. He expressed confidence the changes would be easily approved in every state remaining in the program.
\
He said most of the public pushback against the proposal to reduce the total cap has come from people who believe climate change is not the result of human activity.
\
The economic changes behind the proposal are evident in Delaware.
\
Delaware had 10 coal-burning power plant units when the initiative started: four at NRG's Indian River Power Plant, and others at the former Conectiv plant, now owned by Calpine; and at the Dover Energy Center; and Invista in Seaford.
\
By the end of the year there will be just one at Indian River, with many of the other coal units in the state having converted, or on track to convert, to burning natural gas.
\
Meanwhile, new natural gas projects have been increasingly planned, including the Garrison Energy Center in Dover, a Calpine project. Despite some increase in manufacturing from recessionary lows, emissions of various pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide, have fallen, in large part because of the fuel conversion, O'Mara said. Combined heat and power technology and efficiency upgrades at those facilities have helped, too, he said.
\
Delaware has seen carbon emissions fall by 29 percent from 2000 to 2010, more than any other state in the country, O'Mara said.
\
The initiative's cost to the average resident within the states is 38 cents a month, O'Mara said. It's less in Delaware, although he did not know the exact amount.
\
Delaware received $5.7 million from the initiative in 2012, 65 percent of which went to the Sustainable Energy Utility, a not-for-profit agency that operates energy efficiency and solar programs. The rest goes to other state efficiency programs.
\
The SEU has had problems doing as much as its organizers would have liked, as funding from the initiative has lagged far below amounts that were originally projected. It has been planning to use the funding to perform a limited reprise of its popular energy efficiency grant program, formerly funded with stimulus money.
\
Jim Black of the Partnership for Sustainability said the initiative has been helpful in raising money for energy efficiency projects in Delaware. But he said the money doesn't add up to much, since the largest emitting states, like Pennsylvania, have not been participating. If they did participate, there would be considerably more money raised, he said.
\
""When it comes right down to it, the only states that are participating are states that don't have fossil fuels"" as a homegrown industry, he said.
\
Sen. Greg Lavelle, R-Sharpley, said he hopes the economy picks up someday. If it does, consumers could feel the pinch of lower emission limits proposed for this program.
\
""My concern is, if you do that, what does it do to energy prices?"" he said of the proposed change.

\
The Bush administration on Tuesday approved a plan to cap and reduce mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants, under a strategy critics said is a boon to utilities and a setback for air quality.
\
Supporters said the plan frees utilities to use cost-effective methods for curbing emissions, eliminating the need for government-prescribed solutions and equipment. Opponents said the change gives power plants too much time and discretion.
\
Delaware regulators greeted the plan with skepticism Tuesday. The proposal would mainly affect Conectiv Energy's Edgemoor site in east Wilmington and NRG Energy's Indian River power plant near Millsboro.
\
""Some would view the proposal as a rule to protect utilities against Clean Air Act requirements,"" said Ali Mirzakhalili, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control air quality management administrator. ""I'm not very hopeful.""
\
None of the requirements announced Tuesday would affect Occidental Chemical's plant near Delaware City, which uses large amounts of mercury to make chlorine and other products. Occidental's Delaware plant ranks as one of the nation's top individual mercury pollution sources. It releases several times more mercury and mercury compounds than Edgemoor or Indian River, according to federal records.
\
Mercury is toxic to the nervous system and can stunt the development of children's brains. About 630,000 children nationwide are found to have unsafe mercury levels in their blood annually, according to federal studies. More than 40 states - including Delaware - advise against eating fish from their waters because of mercury contamination.
\
The Environmental Protection Agency rule, developed to settle a lawsuit filed by environmental groups, would amend current mercury control requirements and establish a market-based system allowing utilities to buy and sell ""credits"" for mercury emissions. Total allowable releases would be reduced nationwide by 50 percent between now and 2020. Continued reductions afterward would push the total reduction to 70 percent.
\
""We believe that the Clean Air Mercury Rule, in conjunction with the Clean Air Interstate Rule that was signed last week, will protect all Americans, especially women of child-bearing age, from unsafe levels of mercury from power plants,"" said Jeffrey Holmstead, the EPA's top air pollution official.
\
A similar system already operates for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides to help control acid rain and smog.
\
Solutions or more pollution?
\
Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, an industry coalition and lobbying group, said in a prepared statement that the cap-and-trade program would provide incentives to develop superior mercury control technologies while also protecting consumers and energy supplies.
\
Others said the EPA rules actually could lead to increased mercury releases in some parts of the country because caps are set well above actual current emissions in some states. Companies in those areas could increase pollution by adding new plants or expanding production, or could sell credits to utilities in states with older plants, allowing pollution there to continue or increase.
\
Eventual costs to utilities for the program were estimated at $750 million, compared with about $17 billion for the interstate controls on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides announced last week.
\
Holmstead said the proposed ""mercury rule"" marked the first formal action of its type by any nation and said it would curb emissions faster than regular Clean Air Act requirements.
\
The sources
\
Mercury enters the environment from a variety of sources, with the incineration of medical and municipal waste accounting for the largest share. Large boilers, mining operations, some types of chlorine production, spills and natural sources also contribute to the total.
\
Worldwide, the United States accounts for about 3 percent of total mercury releases.
\
EPA officials estimate that American power plants produce only about 3 percent of the total deposits of mercury onto American soil from all sources worldwide.
\
Under the administration's new rules, mercury emissions deposited in the United States that are considered to be the most hazardous to people will fall fastest.
\
""These rules focus on the type of mercury that deposits locally and creates the type of hot spots people are concerned about,"" Holmstead said.
\
'A stalling mechanism'
\
Arthur Stamoulis, a policy analyst for the Clean Air Council in Delaware, a nonprofit environmental group, said the EPA's approach could weaken efforts to control other hazardous pollutants. Current mercury control rules also have the potential to reduce arsenic, cadmium and chromium emissions, Stamoulis said. Those benefits could be lost if the rules are rewritten.
\
""This deeply flawed regulation is simply a stalling mechanism that will allow big energy companies to avoid taking responsibility for their pollution for another decade,"" he said.
\
Castle, Biden, Carper critical
\
Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said in a prepared statement that the EPA rule sets a ""dangerous precedent"" and that existing technology can reduce emission at a reasonable cost.
\
Bill Yingling, a spokesman for Conectiv Power Delivery, said the company generally considers cap-and-trade approaches the most cost-effective route to emissions reductions.
\
Meredith Moore, spokeswoman for NRG Energy, said the company would have preferred to see mercury rules developed through legislation like the Bush administration's ""Clear Skies"" pollution control plan. That measure, however, stalled in a Senate committee earlier this month.
\
Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who led a push for alternatives to the Clear Skies plan, said the EPA's mercury plan will fail to adequately protect residents of Delaware and the rest of the nation.
\
""The administration appears to have traded in its responsibility to regulate mercury under the Clean Air Act in favor of pushing a weak standard that would let many of the country's dirtiest power plants off the hook,"" said Carper, senior Democrat on the Senate's Clean Air, Climate Change and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee.
\
Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del, said the administration proposal ignored the hazards created by mercury in the environment.
\
""I am tired - and I know that most Americans are, too - of the age-old argument that Othe cost of doing business' requires us to accept poor air quality, contaminated soil, or dangerous levels of mercury and other toxins in our rivers and streams,"" Biden said.

Delaware's Sustainable Energy Utility has lost one of its two co-chairman less than a week before the agency's board was to consider a reorganization that may have altered the set-up where two people share direction of the governing body.
\
John Byrne, a University of Delaware professor who was a key player in the birth of the energy conservation agency in 2006, submitted his resignation Friday to Gov. Jack Markell. The remaining co-chairman is state Sen. Harris McDowell, a Wilmington Democrat.
\
In a letter to Markell, Byrne said he felt the discussion of SEU reorganization was a good time for him to bow to competing demands on his time and step down from the board.
\
Byrne, along with a group of other environment, business and academic officials, has formed the nonprofit Foundation for Renewable Energy & Environment to perpetuate the type of work he has been involved in through the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at UD, of which he is director.
\
Byrne accepted the role as chairman of that foundation and says he needs to devote more energy and time to getting it under way.
\
Byrne, who is often sought out as a volunteer consultant on renewable energy and efficiency projects, said in his letter he is confident that the SEU will be able to continue its work ably under the direction of McDowell and Markell.
\
The SEU was set up to create and execute programs to reduce carbon emissions in Delaware primarily using money coming to the state through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
\
That program coordinates states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region in a cap-and-trade system for pollution and carbon control. Money made through the purchase and sale of emission credits goes back to the states to support programs to cut carbon emissions.
\
In Delaware, that has involved grants for residents and business to make energy conservation improvement -- such as heating/air conditioning replacements. It also involved a complex program that used money from bond sales to pay for such work on state buildings, with the borrowing repaid using a portion of the savings on energy bills.

Delaware environmental chief Collin O'Mara has one big item to take care of before he leaves his job in Gov. Jack Markell's cabinet this summer to run the National Wildlife Federation.
\
""I won't be starting until July, after session, because it's still critically important that we make progress on the water package,"" O'Mara said Thursday morning when pressed about word of his coming departure. ""Given that a third of the state right now is flooded out, there's no more important day to be talking about the water initiative.""
\
O'Mara, in an interview Thursday, made it clear that he planned to work to the very end of the General Assembly session for passage of Markell's Clean Water tax proposal. The initiative includes a statewide assessment on property, piggybacked on property tax bills, that would average about $45 for most residents to finance investments in wastewater, stormwater management, drinking water protection and waterway cleanup projects.
\
The news of O'Mara's move rippled out in emails and phone calls soon after The National Wildlife Federation held its annual gala at the Renaissance Washington Hotel in the nation's capital on Wednesday. The event's headliner was former President Bill Clinton, who was honored during the event. O'Mara's selection as the group's new president and chief executive was discussed openly at the gathering, and forced O'Mara to announce his departure plans a little sooner than planned after The News Journal contacted him.
\
O'Mara said he was approached by an executive recruiter to consider the top job with the Reston, Va.-based foundation, replacing retiring president Larry Schweiger. But he also said that the foundation's expansive mission and goals for conservation, wildlife protection, public education along with its No Child Left Inside"" efforts fit with his own.
\
""I was not looking for anything. I love being here. I think that I have the best job in the state,"" O'Mara said. ""I can't imagine leaving for any other position other than the National Wildlife Federation.""
\
In a statement released Thursday, Markell said O'Mara's tenure had been marked by a ""commitment to improving our environment and the health of Delawareans.""
\
""When he moves on in July, he will leave a strong and capable team prepared to build on a legacy of remarkable improvements to the quality of life in our state, including huge reductions in air pollution and impressive upgrades in our ability to deal with major storms,"" Markell said.
\
O'Mara, 35, left a city environmental and economic policy post in San Jose, Calif., in 2009 to join Markell's administration as secretary of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.
\
He became the youngest state cabinet secretary in the nation at the time and presided over an eventful five years at DNREC. That period saw the administration enact a comprehensive recycling program, increase public attention to climate change and coastal storm and flood hazards. He also reorganized his agency to emphasize climate and clean energy priorities and also managed the often controversial oversight of the Delaware City Refinery's shutdown, salvage and restart.
\
""Collin is a tireless leader with a deep understanding of conservation issues and a strong, entrepreneurial spirit,"" Deborah Spalding, chairwoman of the federation's board of directors, said in the written statement. ""His track record in implementing innovative solutions to conservation challenges and his experience in managing large, complex organizations with a diverse stakeholder base are key skills that will be critical in taking the federation forward in the coming years.""
\
O'Mara said the opportunity arose at a time when the national group was gearing up for a grass-roots push to support climate change resilience and conservation - an issue he has pressed steadily since arriving at DNREC.
\
""The organization was very focused in the last few years on congressional climate policy,"" O'Mara said. ""Obviously the opportunity for that in the next few years is zero, so the focus is to work community by community, state by state, and try to spur investments in conservation and restoration.""
\
The National Wildlife Federation, founded in 1936, has a $100 million budget, a 400-member staff and 48 state affiliates, including the Delaware Nature Society, which said it was looking forward to continued work with O'Mara and the national group.
\
""We will work diligently to fulfill the vision the secretary had for Delaware through clean water, energy sustainability, and a changing climate,"" the society said in a written statement.
\
O'Mara listed state air quality gains among his most significant achievements since coming to Delaware, including drastic pollution reductions at the state's 10-dirtiest power plants and active state participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state power plant emission cap-and-trade program aimed at cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, a leading pollutant linked to global warming.
\
During his term, O'Mara also led a successful Markell administration push for a statewide recycling program and goal. He also launched the Delaware Bayshore Initiative, aimed at both conserving habitat along a more-than 200,000 acre landscape bordering Delaware Bay and supporting a tourism-based economic development drive centered on the area.
\
The Delaware City Refinery both shut down and reopened during O'Mara's tenure, with plant owners facing state pressure to both reduce emissions and modernize the refinery's wastewater systems. Critics have pointed out that the work remains unfinished, and that the refinery managed to install a massive crude-by-rail off-loading terminal during that time, however, with little public review or oversight.
\
House Natural Resource Committee Chairman Debra Heffernan, D-Edgewood Hills, said O'Mara had done well. ""I think he's done an excellent job with a lot of innovative things we've done to move Delaware forward, in environmental regulation, through reorganizing the department, things like that,"" Heffernan said. ""We're sorry to see him go, but I'm hoping in his new role he can bring some national environmental attention to the things we're doing.""
\
But Heffernan also said that loss of the veteran secretary could make it more difficult for Markell's water proposal. ""I think after yesterday's massive rains and flooding in many areas throughout the state, it shows how important it is. But I just think it's going to be difficult because so many are still hurting from the downturn in the economy,"" she said.
\
O'Mara said he plans to continue living in Wilmington for the foreseeable future, commuting to the federation's main offices in Reston, Va., just outside Washington. He is married to Lindsay Crawford O'Mara, an attorney who now serves as Markell's education policy adviser. The couple has a young daughter, Riley Elizabeth.
\
Although O'Mara's salary was not released, his predecessor received total compensation of more than $360,000 in the organization's fiscal year that ended in August 2012, including a base salary of $297,461, according to the nonprofit's tax filing . O'Mara's cabinet secretary salary this year is $127,500, state records show.

ROTARY CLUB: The Rotary Club of Wilmington meets weekly at the Hotel du Pont. The frequency of the group's meetings was incorrect in a front-page story Friday about a joint appearance of Christine O'Donnell and Chris Coons at the Rotary Club.
\
The News Journal
\
WILMINGTON -- Republican Christine O'Donnell continued to claim Thursday that electing Democrat Chris Coons to the U.S. Senate would cost the average Delaware family $10,000 in new taxes and energy costs.
\
But O'Donnell's math doesn't add up, and she did not answer reporters' requests for clarification as she left the Hotel du Pont on Thursday.
\
Coons has been vague about the income level at which he believes some Americans should pay higher taxes when the Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of the year. His campaign did not respond to requests to more fully detail his position.
\
""A vote for my opponent will cost the average Delaware family instantly up to $10,000 in the coming tax hikes and his vote for cap-and-trade,"" O'Donnell told a crowd of 250 media and Wilmington Rotary Club members in the hotel's Gold Ballroom. ""Most of us can't support that.""
\
O'Donnell made a similar claim Wednesday night during a nationally televised debate with Coons at the University of Delaware.
\
""It's a scare tactic. It's a distortion and not based in reality,"" Coons spokesman Daniel McElhatton said after Thursday's debate.
\
Coons has suggested that couples earning more than $250,000 a year should continue to get tax cuts. His website, however, says ""High-Income Bush Tax Cuts Should Expire on Schedule.""
\
""I don't think we should draw an arbitrary line at $250,000,"" Coons said Wednesday. ""... Every increased tax cut, every extension that's given, is going to cost, it's going to increase the deficit, it adds to the debt.""
\
Regarding O'Donnell's other claim, about cap-and-trade, Coons has said he supports efforts to control greenhouse gases blamed for climate change through a system of capping carbon emissions and making the biggest polluters pay for their emissions. The legislation has been stalled in the Senate for more than a year.
\
O'Donnell based the $10,000 added family burden on the assumption that Congress will allow the Bush-era cuts to expire and will approve a House version of the cap-and-trade legislation.
\
To justify the claim, the O'Donnell campaign pointed to studies from the conservative Heritage Foundation and the Tax Foundation.
\
In a study released Wednesday, the Tax Foundation found that a married couple earning $50,000 a year with two children would pay an additional $2,833 in taxes if the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire.
\
On the impact of potential energy legislation, O'Donnell's campaign pointed to past Heritage Foundation reports.
\
In fact, estimates of the controversial proposal's costs vary wildly, and are closely related to the political and business interests of the agencies producing the estimates.
\
The Heritage Foundation estimate claimed that under cap-and-trade, costs would increase by about $1,200 per household for electricity alone.
\
In contrast, the Environmental Protection Agency's analysis placed the number closer to an average household impact of $80 to $111 per year, while the Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost at $175 per year.
\
Even at the high range, the additional burden for a median Delaware family would be $4,033, less than half of O'Donnell's claim.
\
The monthly Rotary Club luncheon was packed with dozens of national and international reporters drawn to Delaware to follow O'Donnell, the Tea Party Express-backed candidate who has run for the Senate three times.
\
During their 45-minute encounter, Coons and O'Donnell repeated much of what they said Wednesday night about abortion, the national deficit, education reform, Afghanistan war policy and the environment.
\
Candidates' questions
\
The candidates had an opportunity to ask each other two questions.
\
Coons asked O'Donnell if she stood by statements she made Wednesday that she doesn't support abolishing the U.S. Department of Education.
\
O'Donnell said she did, but criticized the federal government's growing role in education. She said decisions about reforming schools should be made at the local level. ""A one-size-fits-all policy does not help with the individual needs of each student in the classroom,"" O'Donnell said.
\
In between the candidate-to-candidate rounds, four Rotary Club members asked questions.
\
Paul Seitz asked what legislation they would sponsor in the Senate that didn't have to do with taxes or health care.
\
Coons said he would seek changes to the ""anti-competitive provisions of the Wall Street reform bill"" that he says could harm Delaware's corporate law, bankruptcy and credit card industries.
\
""There are some elements to that bill that are going to be very harmful to Delaware's financial services sector,"" said Coons, the second-term New Castle County executive.
\
Veterans' health care
\
O'Donnell said she would pursue legislation to allow veterans to get vouchers to use private physicians and ""for basic medical care"" instead of relying on Veterans Affairs hospitals. She said veterans in Kent and Sussex counties shouldn't have to drive to the VA Medical Center near Elsmere for ""regular checkups.""
\
Coons has labeled O'Donnell's plan as privatizing veterans' medical care. O'Donnell said she got the idea from VA hospital workers and that it would require private physicians to be certified by the VA to receive medical vouchers.
\
""This is such a great idea that my opponent has had to mischaracterize what the vouchers system is all about,"" O'Donnell said.
\
Cutting the deficit
\
Given the $13 trillion -- and rising -- national debt, Bill Allan asked the candidates whether they would cut Medicare, the military or raise taxes to rein in future deficits.
\
""I would do neither of those,"" O'Donnell responded.
\
O'Donnell said the federal budget can be balanced by going after ""waste, fraud and abuse"" in Medicare and education programs.
\
Coons has supported reforming agricultural subsidies, cutting congressional salaries, canceling contracts for helicopters and planes the military doesn't want and adopting Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' plan for cutting $100 billion from the Pentagon's budget over the next five years.
\
""You can't deal with the question by simply talking about waste, fraud and abuse or saying you're going to freeze nondefense discretionary spending,"" Coons said.
\
Voter reactions
\
Kate Cowperthwait, an independent voter from Wilmington, said Coons' performance in the debate made her feel more comfortable voting for him.
\
""I see a real clear difference,"" Cowperthwait said. ""I felt that he answered clearly and concisely, and I realized how much experience he has.""
\
Chris Sailer, a Democrat from Wilmington, said he remained undecided after watching the debate.
\
""I was surprised at how well Christine stood up to Chris, who is a very good debater,"" said Sailer, a business consultant.

Pay attention to what Bush didn't acknowledge
\
Our president, who is above the law, discussed the intelligence finding that Iran stopped its nuclear weapon development program about five years ago. Though this information was greeted with approval throughout most of the world, he insisted that Iran was still a menace to world peace.
\
President Bush used this release of previously classified information to take credit for what he called a reform in U.S. intelligence operations.
\
He did not discuss the reasons for reform or admit any impropriety in the White House. He did not discuss the pressure put upon CIA staff in early 2003 to resurrect and reinterpret flimsy and doubtful information to fit his propaganda for an unnecessary war against a weak nation.
\
He did not mention that he encouraged or permitted his vice president to bully CIA staff. In 2003 Vice President Cheney made a series of very unusual trips to CIA headquarters to make its reports fit White House fantasies.
\
The president did not explain why he forgot his promise to remove from the White House anyone involved in exposing Valerie Plame, a secret agent.
\
An Associated Press analysis in the Dec. 5 News Journal quoted Karim Sadjadpour, an expert on Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: ""The Bush administration has perhaps even less credibility now in Beijing and Moscow than Iran's clerics.""
\
It will be interesting to observe what kinds of reform will take place in Bush's last year in office.

Colonial students recycle their plastic milk bottles
\
I am a fourth-grade teacher in the Colonial School District. The district also switched to plastic milk bottles. I was concerned about the ecological impact of the bottles. After talking about the impact on the environment with my students, they decided they would like to do something to help.
\
After breakfast and lunch, my students bring their bottles back to the classroom, where they are washed and dried. On Monday, we collect the bottles for recycling. Half of a large green trash bag is filled with a week's worth of plastic bottles.
\
They are proud of what they are doing, and I am proud of them. They have taken the initiative to improve the environment.

School recycles milk bottles with city's help
\
Wilmington City Councilman Bud Freel was responsible for bringing the city's recycling program to Stubbs School last year. After changing to plastic milk bottles, we are able to recycle them as well.
\
Our cafeteria has gone from 16 bags of trash per day to three. The staff and students are good about making sure all recycled materials are placed into the containers provided. It has become a wonderful habit for us.
\
I encourage schools to contact the City of Wilmington to participate in the program.

\
Finally Congress deals with polluting emissions
\
Americans are calling on our leaders to take decisive action to address the damaging impact of greenhouse gas emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Congress answered. Sen. Tom Carper and Rep. Mike Castle of Delaware were among those taking important steps forward to confront global climate change.
\
The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee sent the Climate Security Act to the full Senate. The bill requires cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from the largest polluters, provides greater resources to renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies, and includes measures to protect wildlife habitat and natural resources most threatened by climate change.
\
Thanks to the significant efforts of Carper, a member of the committee, the bill also highlights the need to reduce mercury and other air pollutants.
\
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Clean Energy Act of 2007, which raises the fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks for the first time in more than 30 years. The bill also repeals subsidies for the oil and gas industries, and directs this money toward incentives for renewable energy and conservation. Castle was one of only 14 Republicans to vote for the bill, placing the importance of the issue above politics.
\
Delawareans can be proud of the roles our federal delegation have played in breaking political gridlock and moving toward solutions.

Cap-and-trade approach works with conservation
\
Last week, the Lieberman-Warner climate change bill was reported out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on an 11-8 vote. I applaud Sen. Thomas R. Carper for voting to move the bill on to full Senate discussion.
\
The Nature Conservancy has characterized this vote as a watershed moment -- the first time a comprehensive cap-and-trade bill has been sent to the Senate floor with committee endorsement.
\
Delawareans need to understand the significance of global warming, as it will have implications for our state. Implicit in the bill and the vote is recognition that reducing the negative effects of climate change is good for the environment and good for business.
\
The Lieberman-Warner bill is a strong starting point to reduce U.S. carbon emissions. The bill's comprehensive approach recognizes the importance of addressing all major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and the role that forest conservation and restoration can play in combating climate change. The bill recognizes the dramatic impact climate change will have on plants, wildlife and natural areas and the importance of conserving and managing natural systems, such as coastal wetlands, that can buffer effects of climate change.
\
The Nature Conservancy's mission is to preserve and protect the lands and waters that plants, animals and people need to survive. Thus we are heartened by the bill, in particular the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the principal source of land acquisition funding for national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and other public lands.
\
The cap-and-trade approach provides the greatest assurance that emissions will be reduced in likely the most cost-effective way to address climate change. The inclusion of forest carbon is another way to keep costs down and enable emissions targets to be met. Assuring carbon market access for international activities to reduce deforestation will be important.
\
I urge Delawareans and our congressional delegation to work together to sustain this momentum, to influence other national leaders and ultimately get permanent and positive climate change legislation.

Manufactured homes' value in community rose
\
The executive director of the First State Manufactured Housing Association apparently lacks information she needed to properly inform readers. A provision to list the past three years' rent was designed for people considering purchase of a home in leased land community. Five years of past rent information was requested, but some land owners could not find their records that far back.
\
There is further evidence of land owners' unwillingness to communicate with home owners. The owner of my community, Wild Meadows, waited from Aug. 2 until Oct. 24 for a response to a letter that was sent to him, when he was cornered at Legislative Hall during a hearing on Senate Bill 122 and House Bill 258. He refused to discuss the residents' desire to purchase the community.
\
He told our association president that he would call when he wanted to sell. A phone call on Aug. 3 would have been more courteous.
\
At an average cost of $100,000 per home for 224 homes at the time of purchase, our investment in our community was more than $22 million. It is much higher now. The Wild Meadows community owners' appraiser valued the property at $6.3 million at an appeals hearing before the Dover assessor.
\
What consideration is given to the home owners' investment, considering the unlimited rent increases and no required accounting by land owners?

\
NEWARK -- The demise of federal ""cap-and-trade"" legislation that would have made carbon-based fuels more expensive poses a major setback to ""clean-energy"" industries that major corporations, Delaware and other states were banking on for future jobs and economic growth, industry and government officials said Monday.
\
At a University of Delaware ""clean-tech"" forum, speakers said Congress is unlikely to resurrect a House-passed bill that would have capped industrial carbon dioxide emissions and allowed low-polluting companies to sell permits to pollute to others.
\
Such a system was intended to provide economic incentives for companies to clean up their act, and would have boosted the prospects of companies selling equipment producing clean energy -- such as DuPont -- or capturing carbon emissions. Supporters say that would have generated jobs.
\
Now that a conservative electoral wave has buried cap-and-trade, advocates for clean technology enterprises are looking for a new strategy.
\
Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., spoke for many when he said: ""What do we do, give up? I don't think so. You have to move forward.""
\
State officials had high hopes that solar development research, such as the work touted Monday by DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman, could help on that path.
\
Federal policymakers may need to reach out to industries that make environmentalists uneasy, officials said at the ""Creating the Clean Energy Economy.""
\
Putting a price on carbon emissions was highly desirable because of the long-term stability it would have provided, said Dirk Matthys, chairman and CEO of Gamesa Technology Corp., which makes wind turbines at a reclaimed steel works outside Philadelphia.
\
The company has been considering getting into the domestic offshore wind business, possibly building plants to make huge turbines if the U.S. offshore wind industry took off.
\
But without a price tag affixed to carbon emissions, alternative energy generators will continue to struggle to be competitive with electricity generated from coal, or oil or natural gas.
\
An alternate approach Matthys said might form a fallback strategy would be establishment of a national renewable-energy standard requiring utilities to buy a set percentage of their energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. Delaware has a version of this in place, with electric utilities required to buy 25 percent of their power from clean sources by 2025.
\
Carper said a nationwide standard also is unlikely in a Congress now divided and aware of voter opposition to anti-carbon plans that might raise electric prices for consumers already struggling to make ends meet.
\
He advocated a ""first cousin"" of the renewable energy approach, which he said stands some chance of passage in the coming year. Adding nuclear and ""really clean coal"" to sources qualifying for a renewable -- or clean power -- standard could help get it passed, Carper said.
\
Even natural gas, a fossil fuel with fewer carbon emissions than coal, could be added to the mix. The nonrenewable sources could be phased out over time, he said.
\
Carper's comments were a reference to a plan floated by U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last week, which would require utilities to buy 25 percent of their load from low-pollution sources, including nuclear, by 2025, and 50 percent by 2050.
\
""There is a great opportunity to create jobs if we can figure out a way to create energy in ways that are less offensive to our environment,"" Carper said.
\
The clean-energy standard Carper discussed is ""a good start,"" Matthys said. ""It's politically more digestible.""
\
But even that plan found opposition in Delaware among both environmentalists and tea party supporters, who campaign heavily against cap-and-trade as a ""hidden tax.""
\
Thurman Brendlinger, of the Clean Air Council, said affixing cost on carbon emissions was vital to transitioning to a clean-energy economy. His group was hesitant to call natural gas clean because it is a fossil fuel, and ""so-called clean coal we want to get away from as well.""
\
Chad Tolman, of Delaware's chapter of the Sierra Club, said coal gasification is unproven, new methods of extracting natural gas risk environmental contamination, and nuclear energy carries major risks.
\
At the other end of the spectrum was Russ Murphy, founder and executive director of the 9-12 Delaware Patriots, which opposed cap-and-trade. His group will be holding statewide meetings, starting with one in Bowers Beach on Wednesday, to discuss the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Northeast regional version of cap-and-trade, which he said will lead to higher utility bills.
\
Such approaches won't help because many pollutants blow in from other regions and other countries, he said.
\
""There's got to be a level playing field worldwide, not just here in America,"" Murphy said.
\
The global market also was on the minds of Gov. Jack Markell, who just returned from a recent trade mission to the Far East, and Ellen Kullman, CEO of the DuPont Co., which is investing heavily into photovoltaic materials for solar panels and sees rapid growth in that sector around the world.
\
Markell noted that Asian companies -- and nations -- are pressing for development of solar industries, noting the manufacturing prowess of China, as well as Taiwan, the home country of Motech, which has a small solar-panel factory in Newark.
\
""It is clear these countries are absolutely playing to win,"" Markell said. ""I am absolutely convinced that when we step it up a notch, as we absolutely must, we will prevail.""
\
Adding solar manufacturing jobs will be challenging, because Chinese factories are able to beat domestic factories on price, said Collin O'Mara, Delaware's natural resources secretary. Consumers may be willing to pay more for quality, but a solar panel can only be so good, he said.
\
""We need to figure out how we can make ourselves more cost-competitive, or risk becoming professional consumers,"" O'Mara said.
\
Energy efficiency can create jobs here, O'Mara said. ""You can't retrofit a home from China,"" he said.
\
Kullman said her company's work with solar panels -- building thin-film solar cells and components for solar modules -- has been booming, and sales are expected to double by 2014. She touted her company's commitment to biofuels like cellulosic ethanol and biobutanol.
\
Michael Chajes, engineering dean at UD, said that with the proper government price signals in place, the logical clean-energy jobs to come to Delaware would come from building wind-turbine blades. They're huge, and with their intricate design, it's better to make them nearby than transport them, he said.
\
Research and development would also be a natural jobs creator in Delaware, although ""it may not be as massive as manufacturing,"" Chajes said.
\
Without reliable government policy, though, companies are unable to make long-term decisions, said Robert Birkmire, director of the Institute for Energy Conversion, a longtime solar research lab at UD. Support for research and development is a critical way to keep the country competitive, he said.
\
""This is a booming area, and we are going to be left in the dust if we aren't able to change this,"" Birkmire said. ""What we need is a national energy strategy.""
\
Former Sen. Ted Kaufman said that strategy needs to be sold in a certain way to get through Congress.
\
""Making the argument for climate change is a great argument to make, I think it's going to kill us. But the argument has to be about jobs,"" Kaufman said.

\
Five years ago, sobered viewers streamed from theaters showing the documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" many resolving to push for change to curtail carbon emissions from power plants, factories and homes to lessen the impact of climate change.
\
The film catalyzed calls for a major shift in U.S. energy policy away from power plants using coal, oil or natural gas -- which poured tons of carbon into the air each day -- and toward major investment in carbon-free generation of power from sources like wind, solar, geothermal -- and even nuclear plants.
\
Today, despite predictions no less dire, advocates for such renewable, carbon-free sources of electricity are in full defense mode, as recession-battered consumers blanch at the modest added costs required to shift to cleaner power and resurgent Republicans rail against government subsidies or carbon-control programs that might add costs for businesses and ""kill jobs.""
\
""Five years ago, the world was ending,"" said James Cotton, a Connecticut-based energy consultant who has worked on Delaware utility rate cases. But Americans today are ""much more concerned with the here and now, getting Mom into a good nursing home, getting to pay for it.""
\
In Congress, two initiatives to press utilities to buy renewable energy -- a national emission cap-and-trade system and a national requirement that a percentage of a utility's power come from renewable sources -- are dead for now because of Republican opposition. Already a victim of early budget-cutting deals are tax credits for renewable energy production and a loan guarantee program important to firms looking to finance construction of wind or solar farms.
\
Meanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he plans to pull his state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state cap-and-trade program designed to support energy efficiency and renewable power programs. New Hampshire may not be far behind. Similar calls for withdrawal surfaced -- and were rebuffed -- in Delaware.
\
The renewable power industry is reeling.
\
Developers installed half as much wind power in the U.S. in 2010 as they did in 2009, with no signs of a sustainable turnaround, according to IHS Global Insight.
\
In Delaware, the slump hit the spotlight last month when NRG-Bluewater said it would slow down its plans for a wind farm off the shore of Delaware, citing Congress' cutbacks to renewable energy programs.Bluewater is among several offshore wind projects that have struggled for financing or buyers for the higher-priced power.
\
NRG has until Thursday to decide whether to back out of the Bluewater project, or face paying an additional $4 million to Delmarva Power under their power purchase contract.
\
Peter Kelley of the American Wind Energy Association said new installations during the first quarter are up, but the ""boom-bust"" cycle will continue as long as Congress keeps renewing wind subsidies just before they expire.
\
""It takes the industry a while to recover from another one of these bouts of uncertainty,"" he said.
\
Cost -- and politics
\
The biggest obstacle facing renewable energy is cost: Electricity generated by wind and solar farms still costs more than power generated by fossil fuels, particularly now that natural-gas prices are very low because so much of it is available due to fracking of large reservoirs in U.S. shale formations.
\
Solar prices are coming down as photovoltaic cell advances multiply, and companies like General Electric contend it will be able to compete without subsidies in two or three years.
\
And the impact on consumers is not heavy to subsidize even a project like the Bluewater Wind farm -- just about $1 a month on the average residential bill. But many consumers do not know that, and are spooked by renewable energy opponents who contend the cost to a homeowner is in the thousands of dollars annually.
\
And the political marketplace had changed.
\
A major argument for renewables was the prediction that grid electricity prices would, in time, go high. That forecast was built not only on the assumption of high natural-gas prices and growing demand in a healthy economy, but a projection that Congress would take some kind of action to make carbon emissions -- and hence power generated by carbon-spewing fossil fuel plants -- more expensive, analysts say.
\
Both the Democratic and Republican candidates for president in 2008 said they supported a national initiative to cap carbon emissions and require power producers to trade allowances.
\
But after the election and the subsequent financial crisis, the 2009 effort to enact a cap-and-trade law stalled and, the next year, Democrats lost their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Driven in part by the tea party movement, Republicans have opposed cap-and-trade, abandoning the platform of their 2008 presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain.
\
Conservative Democrats, eyeing the 2010 election returns, also have pulled back, worried about powerful political arguments contending that the cost of carbon controls would make industry hesitant to hire and hurt job markets in areas reliant on coal production.
\
Rep. John Carney, D-Del., points to a long list of near-party-line votes in the House this year that undermine efforts to combat carbon emissions, including the defeat of a bill that would have stated human activity is causing climate change.
\
It's hard to argue for new investments in renewable energy in that kind of political environment, he said. He notes that traditional fuels have been subsidized for years, but that isn't cutting through the opposition's hard line, he said.
\
""Frankly, even if you have doubts about the climate change science, why would you take a chance for future generations? I think that's not being responsible stewards of the planet,"" Carney said.
\
Dover Downs CEO Ed Sutor said he's all for businesses going green; his own casino hotel converted 22,000 lightbulbs to LEDs, which consume less power.
\
But when it comes to government programs that subsidize renewables and put a price on carbon, that's too much in this economy, he said, voicing a concern of many in the business community.
\
""It does not work. It pushes the cost down to the individual consumer,"" Sutor said. ""Right now, that's something that's hard to swallow when people are out of work, working less, over time making less money.""
\
Some wind, solar growth
\
A new blast of renewable power also was intended to address the expected need for more and more power, said Amy Grace, analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
\
But with the economic downturn, those projections of explosive energy usage were delayed, slowing the need to add new power plants, Grace said.
\
It's easier to choose a renewable source for a new power plant than it is to replace a functioning one, she said.
\
""We are playing at the new demand margins of the economy, and that has shrunk as the economy has shrunk,"" said Peter Kelley of the American Wind Energy Association.
\
Despite their struggles, renewable energy industries can point to some success in recent years.
\
Americans used 16 times more on-shore wind power in 2010 than they used in 2000, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
\
And U.S. consumers used almost twice as much solar power in 2010 as they did in 2000, according to the EIA. It costs far less today than it did several years ago for a resident or business to install a solar array.
\
But put together, wind and solar still make up just about 1 percent of the nation's energy consumption, ""a drop in the bucket in the U.S. because of the overall size of the energy demand,"" said Michael Kanellos, editor in chief of Greentech Media, a Web site and consulting firm.
\
Renewables overall make up 7 percent of U.S. energy usage, with hydropower as the leading source, according to the EIA.
\
Growth in areas like wind and solar will help boost that number to 10 percent by 2035, if U.S. energy policy stays largely the same, that office projected. But the 2035 lineup of fuels used in this country will remain very similar to today's roster, according to the EIA.
\
In its projection, oil -- the fuel of choice for automobiles -- will remain king, followed by natural gas and coal, all roughly in their current percentages of the overall energy pie.
\
Renewables have been helped by state policies that require utilities buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources, said Matt DaPrato, an analyst with IHS. Delaware requires utilities to buy incrementally more power from renewables, topping out at 25 percent by 2025. Twenty-nine states have these ""renewable portfolio standards.""
\
But the patchwork of differing state policies -- constantly changing -- adds up to confusion for developers, DaPrato said. A single national policy would be the key to drive demand for renewables, since the market is not doing it for itself, DaPrato said.
\
Renewables here to stay
\
There was a time not too long ago that the market was demanding wind power, without the need for new government help.
\
Natural gas spiked in the summer of 2008, and at those prices, utilities in this region found wind power an acceptable, lower-priced substitute when they needed to buy on the spot market, DaPrato said. At the time, the EIA projected natural gas would become less and less of a part of the nation's energy mix as time went by.
\
But hydrofracking has in the years since unlocked natural gas from the Marcellus Shale, which the agency now says will supply the nation with natural gas for 110 years. That drove down gas prices considerably, and has led to declines in customers' utility bills.
\
Natural gas emits less carbon than coal when combusted.
\
""We're like the Saudi Arabia of natural gas and we're not taking advantage of it,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Alaron Energies of Chicago. ""These are viable, proven fuels,"" as opposed to renewables, which he called expensive and less proven.
\
Kanellos believes renewables will come roaring back. Fossil fuel prices remain unstable; national security concerns about foreign oil remain. Natural-gas prices will rise again, because consumption will become so high that the U.S. will need to become a net importer, he said.
\
Nuclear, until recently seen as a clean-energy answer, suffered in the Fukushima meltdown in Japan, he said.
\
No matter the other factors, in the end, environmental concerns will remain, Kanellos said. That, he said, will keep renewables a part of the political debate for years to come.
\
""Not even the hardest climate skeptic wants to live down the road from a coal plant,"" he said.

\
Two members of a Delaware conservative policy group and a state lawmaker are among four individuals who sued the state's environmental agency this week over a tightening of state ""cap and trade"" controls on power plant carbon dioxide emissions.
\
The a researcher with the Dover-based Caesar Rodney Institute and Rep. Harold ""Jack"" Peterman, R-Milford, filed the challenge in Superior Court, along with Christian Hudson, of Hudson Management and Sam Yoder & Sons in Greenwood and CRI board member John Moore, chief executive of Acorn Energy.
\
Targeted in the suit are Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control cuts in allowable carbon dioxide emissions by the state's largest power plants. The limits were originally imposed in 2008 after Delaware joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, formed when efforts to develop a nationwide cap and trade program for CO2 broke down.
\
The suit claims that DNREC violated the state's constitution in November by adopting, without a three-fifths vote by the General Assembly, regulations that reduced annual limits on power plant emissions. The change made pollution credits more scarce, driving up their cost and, eventually, the cost of electric power, the lawsuit claimed.
\
""Multiple parties warned DNREC this decision was a potential violation of the Delaware Constitution in public comment sessions but the comments were ignored,"" David Stevenson, director of CRI's Center for Energy Competitiveness, said in a written statement released today.
\
Scientists have long pointed to carbon dioxide as a leading greenhouse gas pollutant, linked to rising global temperatures and climate change. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel burning and other greenhouse cases could push global average temperatures up several degrees by the turn of the century, researchers have warned, triggering changes in climate patterns, more extreme weather and rising sea levels, among other consequences.
\
RGGI states originally agreed to stabilize CO2 emissions from power plants and then reduce emissions by 10 percent between 2015 and 2019. But the global recession and increasing use of natural gas instead of coal for power plant fuel drove emissions down far faster, leading to RGGI state approval of a 45 percent reduction in the 2014 target.
\
Delaware and Maryland are part of RGGI. New Jersey dropped out in 2011. Under the program, power plants buy credits, or allowances, for each ton of carbon dioxide released, with auction proceeds widely used for energy-related programs.
\
DNREC has not yet commented on the legal action.

\
What would you do to reduce the federal deficit?
\
Coons:
\
Just as I did in New Castle County, I will bring fiscal responsibility back to Washington. The best way to reduce our deficit is help the 35,000 out of work Delawareans get back to work. We need to make the words ""Made in America, Manufactured in Delaware"" real again. This is why my first focus is going to be job creation by investing in companies that create jobs in America, ending the tax breaks for those who ship jobs overseas, and providing more help for small businesses.
\
O'Donnell:
\
The federal deficit for 2010 was nearly $1.3 trillion, slightly less than last year's record deficit of $1.4 trillion. These numbers are alarming because as we continue to run our government with a deficit, our national debt explodes, and will eventually cause our entire economic system to collapse. This administration continues to overspend our tax dollars while pretending the situation is not as serious as it is.
\
In order to reduce the deficit, I would fight to cancel unspent stimulus funds (the stimulus cost us nearly $1 trillion but lost us 2.5 million jobs), propose a freeze on all non-defense discretionary spending at current rates or lower, identify programs in the Federal budget that can be eliminated, reduced, transferred to states or localities, and divest all assets acquired in connection with the financial crisis and recession.
\
In addition, we waste billions of dollars each year in waste, fraud and abuse. For example, we sent $2.6 million to China to teach prostitutes how to drink responsibly. We waste $100 billion in Medicare abuse alone - false claims and fraud. We must crack down on this in order to begin to strengthen the budget once again.
\
What is your top recommendation for health care reform?
\
Coons:
\
Everyone in Delaware has a story to tell about health care and the longstanding need to fix our nation's health care system. I support the President's landmark healthcare bill - but we need to do more to improve the system to ensure accessibility and affordability for all Americans and for the businesses where they work.
\
O'Donnell:
\
No one is disputing whether or not our health care system needs to be reformed. Yet, somewhere during the course of public debate, we've confused coverage with care. Our goal is to make quality, affordable health care accessible to all Delawareans.
\
Even with the recent massive government takeover of the healthcare system, our most vulnerable are still left without access to quality healthcare. Through Obamacare, we were promised that medical costs would be kept low. Yet, government spending on health care will be about $115 billion more than we were promised, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Under Obamacare we were promised more people would have health insurance, yet the opposite has happened and there are even more uninsured Americans than before. According to the Census Bureau, the number of uninsured patients has increased. A key reason is because new costs imposed on businesses have forced them to drop their health plans, leaving even more people without health insurance.
\
In order to clear the path for real reform that addresses rising healthcare costs, we need to fully repeal Obamacare. Real reform should allow consumers the ability to purchase policies across state lines. Reform should include portability, which allows consumers to take their policy with them when they change jobs. And, to address the issue of rising costs, we need to enact tort reform that enables doctors to practice medicine preparing for the examination room, not the courtroom. Yet in tort reform, we must also make sure that those who are victims of medical malpractice are protected. This delicate balance can be achieved if we stop catering to special interests.
\
What is your position on abortion and why?
\
Coons:
\
I understand how tough a decision to start a family can be, and I recognize how personal of an issue it is. I believe that decisions about a woman's health, including issues surrounding pregnancy should be left to her and her doctor. I fully support a woman's right to choose, and abortions need to be safe, legal and rare.
\
O'Donnell:
\
We've seen a profound loss of respect for the dignity of all human life at all ages reflected in our policy, both fiscal and social. Anyone who has seen a sonogram understands that human life begins at conception, and as a result society needs to do whatever it can to protect it.
\
Although we all may not agree on this issue, we can all agree that parents should be notified when minors are seeking this risky surgical procedure. At the very least, we can all agree that no one's hard-earned federal tax dollars should be used to fund abortions.
\
How would you change America's immigration policy?
\
Coons:
\
We need strong, humane and effective immigration reform that strengthens our borders, has new tools to hold employers accountable for employing those who here illegally, and is aggressive about finding those who wish to do us harm. We also need to be realistic and build in a pathway to legal status for the millions of hard working immigrants who are already here and are willing to learn English, pay a fine for coming here illegally, and move to the back of the line for citizenship.
\
O'Donnell:
\
Our country has always welcomed those seeking greater opportunity and liberty to our shores, especially those escaping tyranny, political persecution and those who have critical skills that our businesses need. Yet, our entire system of immigration is in need of reform. No reform can be undertaken until we secure our borders and stop the current flow of illegal immigrants into our country. We must control our borders using physical and technological barriers.
\
When our border is secure, we should further address other immigration issues, including a means of welcoming and keeping track of temporary workers who come to our country to help meet the needs of American businesses.
\
Yet, when we give special privileges to those who willfully break our laws, as my opponent suggests, we are cheating those who honor our laws. Furthermore, we are sending a message that our immigration laws are merely suggestions - if you get away with breaking them, we'll grant you residency.
\
How would you change energy policy?
\
Coons:
\
We need to build a 21st century energy system that is sustainable, protects our environment, and breaks our dependence on foreign oil. In the Senate, I will push for new investments that move us toward those goals to create sustainable, permanent jobs in Delaware and around the country.
\
O'Donnell:
\
We must support market-based solutions toward achieving the next alternative energy source. Our country is dependent on unstable and hostile nations such as Russia and Venezuela for the oil that keeps the engine of our economy churning. Yet, America has ample oil and natural gas resources underneath her own soil. We must work to wean ourselves off of foreign oil while supporting our own domestic drilling and exploration.
\
With the best interest of Delaware families in mind, I will vigorously oppose Cap and Trade legislation that will ration energy and cause household utility bills to skyrocket. My opponent is joining Harry Reid in supporting this national energy tax. He also claims to support environmental policy, but wants to turn New Castle County into a concrete jungle. It seems his commitment to environmental policy depends on his own financial gain, as his family business stands to earn millions through the passage of Cap and Trade.
\
Was the TARP program a success? Why? If not, what would you have done instead to rescue banks?
\
Coons:
\
TARP played a role in saving our economy from collapse - but it was done without enough accountability and transparency.
\
O'Donnell:
\
TARP and bailouts are counterproductive and I am completely opposed to them. The real solution would have been to get the government out of the housing industry so the banks would never have been in trouble in the first place. The federal government created massive incentives to give loans to unqualified borrowers, which created a market for shady derivatives bundling these loans that helped lenders off-load these risks, and we shouldn't be surprised at the result when that market crashed.
\
Would you vote to help states whose unemployment benefits have run dry?
\
Coons:
\
Yes. Those funds are meant to be a bridge for folks transitioning between jobs, and for too many families they are the only resources saving them from financial ruin. That's why my first priority in the Senate will be pushing legislation that will get our economy back on track and create jobs.
\
O'Donnell:
\
The top action we can take to address this is to get people back to work. I support new innovative approaches to unemployment benefits that are working at the state level, such as Georgia Works. Georgia Works is a successful program where unemployment insurance recipients are placed in real part-time jobs with real employers, with the employer deciding whether to hire them at the end of a 6-week trial period. This has resulted in faster returns to work, less unemployment payments and lower state unemployment taxes.
\
Does the Medicaid system need to be reformed? If so, how?
\
Coons:
\
Medicaid needs to be fully funded to help states address the fiscal crises that are forcing them to cut services and jobs. This program is a lifeline for thousands of Americans, and we need to protect it. I support efforts by the federal government and by states to more effectively root out Medicaid and Medicare fraud that diverts needed health care resources from other patients with pressing medical needs.
\
O'Donnell:
\
There is no question that both Medicare and Medicaid need to be reformed. According to a Heritage study, the Obama cuts to Medicare Advantage will hit low-income seniors and the disabled with disproportionate cuts. About 70 percent of the cuts will be imposed on those with incomes below $32,400 a year (in today's dollars).
\
With Medicaid coverage, access to doctors is limited because the provider payment rate is so low that many doctors refuse to take Medicaid patients, and the traditional formula for state-federal cost sharing is hardly equitable, as it benefits lower-income Americans in some states while discriminating against lower-income Americans in other states.
\
All of these features need to be changed to ensure better, more equitable care.
\
What would you do to create jobs?
\
Coons:
\
As a United States Senator I will work with business and state and local governments to create and retain high quality jobs for all Delawareans by rewarding companies that create jobs here in America and ending the tax breaks that encourage companies to send jobs overseas. I will fight to make permanent the R and D tax credit. We also need to do more to invest in companies that invest in us. That's why I'll also fight in Washington for a clean energy export initiative, new low interest loans and new tax incentives that will encourage small and medium sized businesses to do they do best - grow new jobs.
\
O'Donnell:
\
The best thing the government can do is get out of the way of small business owners and entrepreneurs and roll back regulations that prevent job creation. The growth of our economy must come from our private businesses, not from government spending.
\
We need to create an environment in which people can be innovators who are able to turn their ideas into thriving businesses. That means making sure the government doesn't burden these small businesses with more taxes and regulations that prevent them from growing.
\
This November the senate will vote on massive tax increases that will have an impact on just about every Delawarean. The Senator that we elect on November 2nd will go to Washington immediately and vote on those tax hikes. We must vote for a Senator who is committed to stopping all of these job-killing tax increases.
\
My opponent is proposing more of the same government hand-outs for big businesses. Instead of spending, I am proposing policies that immediately help the middle-class get back to work:
\
1. Stop the massive tax hikes coming this January that will have a devastating impact on small businesses and middle-income families.
\
2. Permanently eliminate the Death Tax. This will create 1.5 million jobs as well as allow family-owned businesses and farms to stay in operation when a loved one passes.
\
3. Propose a temporary two-year holiday on the Capital Gains tax. This will give businesses and investors the money they need to reinvest in their business and see real economic growth sustained by hard work and a good business model, not by tax dollars.
\
What affect has the federal stimulus program had on Delaware and the nation? Was it a success?
\
Coons:
\
The stimulus was an invaluable tool that allowed states including Delaware to retain jobs in during a very difficult time. There are folks answering 911 calls in New Castle County, working in the Amtrak shops in Bear, and teaching in our schools today because of those resources.
\
O'Donnell:
\
The so-called stimulus bill that was pushed through Congress by Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi spent a trillion dollars. We were warned that if we didn't pass the stimulus, unemployment would top 8 percent. Since it was passed our economy has lost 2.5 million jobs and unemployment has been over 9.5% for more than a year. Rather than grow jobs, the stimulus wasted billions for projects such as $2.6 million to train prostitutes in China to drink responsibly and studying exotic ants in Africa. According to the U.S. Treasury Department (10/15/2010), every Delawarean now owes $54,328 and $356,997 in unfunded liabilities.
\
Even the President now admits there was never any such thing as ""shovel-ready projects."" The so-called stimulus has only served to break promises and weaken our economy even more. We must enact policies that bring about economic recovery based on private businesses and help all unemployed Americans immediately get back to work. To do that we need to stop the massive tax hikes coming this January, help small business owners keep their doors open, and eliminate the 55% death tax coming this January so that families don't need to experience a devastating loss of their business or farm after they've already experienced the devastating loss of a loved one.
\
What is the best way to reduce greenhouse gases and what role should the federal government have?
\
Coons:
\
The best way to reduce greenhouse gasses is to invest in the clean energy solutions that will also break our dependence on foreign oil and create good jobs for Delaware. The federal government's role must be to foster innovation and give new tools and incentives to companies who are pushing these emerging technologies.
\
O'Donnell:
\
The Federal government should focus its efforts on the rational regulation of scientifically-demonstrable pollution, including appropriate penalties for polluters. But, we cannot afford to implement a devastating national energy tax such as the Obama administration's Cap and Trade proposal.
\
Should Don't Ask, Don't Tell be abandoned as a policy?
\
Coons:
\
Yes, we need to open up the ranks of our military to all who wish to serve. It's a national security issue above all else, which was made clear after 9/11 when we were short of foreign language experts due to policies like this that close the doors of service for too many men and women in the armed services.
\
O'Donnell:
\
Policy positions affecting combat readiness and unit cohesion should be determined by experienced combat leaders and service chiefs. Social policies should not be imposed on the military by politicians or activist judges. The Pentagon is currently undertaking a thorough analysis of the impact, costs and benefits, and recommendations regarding the current policy, due December 1st.
\
How should we pay for the growing cost of Social Security?
\
Coons:
\
The way to keep Social Security solvent for generations to come is to get the millions of unemployed back to work and balance the federal budget - both of which I will focus on in the Senate.
\
O'Donnell:
\
According to the most recent report from the trustees of the Social Security program, the program's trust fund will be completely depleted in 2037. Yet politicians today continue to spend Social Security taxes not on benefits for current retirees, but for pork barrel boondoggles like a $50 million indoor rain forest in Iowa and a $500,000 teapot museum. If elected to the Senate, I would fight to stop the raid on the Social Security trust fund by proposing that Social Security contributions from workers be sequestered from the general treasury, where the money is easily raided by irresponsible politicians.
\
We must keep our promises to both today's and tomorrow's seniors. Social Security is going bankrupt. Doing nothing is not an option.
\
What is the greatest threat to national defense and how should it be addressed?
\
Coons:
\
Our biggest threat continues to be terrorism in all of its forms - from Al-Qaeda to our ongoing challenges in Afghanistan to the threat of loose nukes. We need a well-trained, sophisticated national security and intelligence capability, and policies and practices that recognize the link between security, development, fair trade and human rights.
\
O'Donnell:
\
The greatest threat to American's security is the threat of Iran getting nuclear weapons. Not only will this spur a regional arms race, but Iran would also be able to arm terrorists who could bring nuclear weapons to our shores.
\
Therefore, it is important that we have success in Afghanistan and not withdraw until certain benchmarks are in place. My opponent says that is unrealistic, yet many critics said the same of Iraq. Those benchmarks must include a representative government that serves the needs of its people and is able to defend itself.
\
We need to use all elements of our national power to fight Islamic extremism in Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere. We must take all necessary measures to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to terrorist states like Iran, and reverse the nuclear program in North Korea which has proliferated nuclear know-how in the past.
\
Much of this depends on our relationship with China. China is not doing all it can to pressure North Korea, nor is it doing anything to pressure those companies that are not cooperating with the Iran gasoline embargo. Because we owe so much of our national debt to China, we are not in a strong position to fully engage in serious discussions. For the sake of our national security, we must get this debt under control and stop spending!
\
What should be done on a federal level to improve schools in Delaware and nationwide?
\
Coons:
\
We need to start with a focus on improving early childhood education by strengthening Head Start, Early Head Start and high-quality pre-K programs. I support efforts, like Race to the Top, which reward states that create innovative, collaborative plans for education reform with resources to make those reforms a reality. We need to ensure that best intentions regarding improving our schools at the federal level engage all stakeholders -- parents, teachers, administrators, state officials, school boards, and students -- in the process.
\
O'Donnell:
\
We can do better than what we are offering Delaware families. No child should be trapped in a failing school. It is appalling that with all the money we are putting towards education, good teachers are still forced to buy their own classroom supplies. Our goal is to make every school better and see the dropout rate reduced.
\
To improve education we must not simply throw more money at a broken system. We need to work with teachers and parents to create a real solution that addresses the root problem. Education funding should flow primarily from the people most invested in the success of schools, those at the state and local levels. However, the federal government has become a major funder of local education. Therefore, we must improve oversight of education appropriations to ensure our dollars go directly to improving education, not funding more bureaucracy.
\
We must support all programs that provide parents with maximum choice of schools for their children, including giving options to parents to transfer their children from failing schools to schools that work, whether they are government schools or not.
\
What's one thing voters should know about you?
\
Coons:
\
As the election draws near, I'd like voters to know that I would be honored to be their voice in the United States Senate. I am proud to have grown up in Delaware and to have returned here to marry my wife, Annie, and raise our three children here. If Delawareans stand with me on November 2nd, I'll stand with them for the next four years.
\
O'Donnell:
\
Making the decision to run in this special election was not an easy one, knowing I would be going against my own party leadership and challenging politics as usual here in Delaware. Yet, our so-called leaders both in Washington and Dover have lost their way. As a result, Delaware families are struggling. We can't continue to spend our way to recovery and tax our way to prosperity.
\
My opponent is trying to mischaracterize who I am and is making false claims about my experience. I hold a Graduate Fellowship in Constitutional Government from the Claremont Institute and have been working directly with leaders in Washington to shape federal policy for well over ten years. I have the policy experience to know how Washington works. Yet, I have enough real life experience to know how Washington should work.
\
Too many politicians go to Washington with more concern for their next election than the next generation. I've seen how Washington can be dominated by special interests and self-interests and that's why I want to go there to serve the people of Delaware and promote your interests.
\
Our leaders have lost their way and that is what brought our nation to the brink of bankruptcy. With your vote I'll go to Washington and do what you'd do. Please vote O'Donnell for U.S. Senate on November 2nd.
\
What person has inspired you the most?
\
Coons:
\
My parents. Their tireless work ethic and commitment to our community set a real example for me and my brothers - one that I hope to pass on to my own children.
\
O'Donnell:
\
Obviously my family is a great source of inspiration for me, yet I have heard countless stories along the campaign trail of families struggling and preserving in these hard economic times. These stories of how families are facing adversity and coming out stronger inspire me to keep going in the face of our own attacks on the campaign trail.
\
On a more global level, the role Pope John Paul II played in the collapse of the Soviet Union in the face of so much opposition also inspired me. I can only hope that in the course of my life I will have the strength to do what is right, and endure hardships and persevere, no matter the consequences.
\
What will you do to unite Americans?
\
Coons:
\
Americans are tired of politics as usual. They are looking for leaders who will come together to face the huge challenges we face in this country. When I'm in the Senate I will work with anyone who will stand with me in the best interest of the people of Delaware.
\
O'Donnell:
\
My entire candidacy has been about putting the political process back in the hands of the people and restoring accountability. My campaign has been about fighting for the people and sending someone to Washington who will stand up to the special interests and break up the back room deals.
\
In these trying times Delaware needs a Senator who puts the needs of others before her own. We need to restore the sense that elected office means service to those whom you represent. We need leaders who will sacrifice for the needs of others.
\
To get our country back on track, those serving in Washington must be committed to a cause greater than themselves.
\
For me, that cause is the people of Delaware. I am asking for your vote on November 2nd so that I can go to Washington and serve your interests ... not political special interests.
\
What sets America apart from so many other nations is that we were not born of tribal, religious, or ethnic distinctions. America was born of ideas and ideas are what unite us. And I think that is what we are seeing in this election cycle--a uniting of Americans concerned for the welfare of our country, and Americans who are concerned about the economy and the looming fiscal crisis of our nation. These are Americans who are sick of business-as-usual politics in Washington where those who supposedly represent us chip away our liberty with each law and regulation they pass. I, too, am concerned about the path of our great country, and I will help to unite Americans by supporting policies that will get America back on her feet, and back to the limited government principles on which she was founded - the Constitution.

19,"
What beautiful blue skies and crisp white clouds! That was the conclusion I made as I looked over the slides from my new camera when I returned from Philmont Scout Ranch in the summer of 1957.
\
I had grown up in southern New Jersey and was not used to such skies. I was accustomed to gray, dreary, polluted skies that plagued that part of the country then.
\
Today, the air of the Midatlantic region is much cleaner. Blue skies are common. A prime reason for this improvement is the Clean Air Act, passed in 1970.
\
I started my environmental research career in graduate school in the 1960s with studies on how to document pollution in the lower non-tidal Delaware River. The river was in horrible condition. I soon concluded the problem was a legal, not a scientific, one.
\
I escaped for a number of years to Bermuda, Canada and California to pursue PhD research in the pristine blue waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
\
In the early 1970s, I accepted a faculty position at the University of Delaware and returned to studies of the Delaware River and Bay. While environmental problems remain, there have been dramatic improvements over the past 40 years. The Delaware River in the Philadelphia area, once devoid of oxygen in the summer and almost lifeless, has had one of the most dramatic improvements of any urban river in the world.
\
The water quality improvements are due much to the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act, as are the improvements of many other waterways of this nation.
\
In the 1980s, I served on a committee for the state of Maryland, providing advice on research related to electrical power generation. Congress was considering several bills for controlling sulfur emissions to reduce acid rain. Among the problems from acid rain was acidification of lakes and ponds causing dramatic declines in fish populations.
\
As chair of the research committee, I wrote to sponsors of these bills urging inclusion of monitoring to evaluate the success of controlling emissions. The Acid Rain Program was started in 1990 as an amendment to the Clean Air Act, sulfur emissions were reduced, and monitoring provided evidence of significant improvements in air and water from the program. The controls that were implemented were based on a successful market-based cap-and-trade program.
\
Cleaning up our air and waters in the 1970s was relatively direct.
\
Smokestacks and effluent pipes were obvious point sources of the filthy air and fouled waters. There was opposition to the laws with claims that controls would be too expensive and would destroy parts of U.S. industry. There is ample evidence today that the opposite occurred. The environmental improvements had massive health and environmental benefits and contributed to economic growth and prosperity.
\
The acid rain assessment and controls were more difficult. Concerns about economic disaster if controls were mandated, again were not correct. Sulfur emissions have dropped dramatically and most cost-benefit analyses show much higher benefits than costs.
\
Today, we face a more complex and indirect problem with carbon emissions. There is overwhelming evidence that increased carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels is leading to changes in climate and hydrology on a global scale with multiple ill effects for human health, environmental stability and global security. Also, there is evidence that the surface waters of the entire world ocean are becoming more acidic from the increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere with deleterious impacts on marine resources.
\
Attempts to legislate controls on carbon emissions are under severe attack by vested interests with claims that any such restraint will destroy the U.S. economy. Legislators who voted for a carbon cap-and-trade bill last year have been attacked and some lost their seats in the fall election. There is a level of anti-government negativity based more on emotion than on information that appears to fuel this opposition. Some version of carbon control is economically feasible and an absolute necessity. As an environmental scientist with expertise and experience related to the global carbon cycle, I am disappointed that conventional wisdom gives little hope for passage of energy and climate legislation in the near future.
\
We have made great strides in improving our environment using direct government regulations and market-based cap-and-trade instruments.
\
Having grown up in the Midatlantic region before the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and having practiced in this region as an environmental researcher and teacher for almost four decades, I see dramatic improvements here and nationwide.
\
In addition to opposition to new environmental protection, the basic goals of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act are under attack again. I do not want to return to the filthy air and fouled waters of my childhood because of anti-government opposition to environmental protection. I do not want my grandchildren to grow up in a world threatened by the myriad impacts from climate change because our politicians are afraid of the opposition.
\
While many other issues appear to be more urgent, we cannot allow gutting of the valuable environmental protections of the past 40 years.
\
They must be protected and Congress must also pass some form of energy and climate bill.

\
It's a good year to be a Republican running for office, political analysts say, pointing to significant victories in recent races.
\
Republicans won governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia in 2009 and, earlier this year, the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts held for decades by Democrat Edward Kennedy, who died in August.
\
So why hasn't the Delaware GOP identified its top candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives seat it has held for 17 years?
\
G. Terry Madonna, who directs the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall University and has a doctorate in political history from the University of Delaware, has no idea.
\
""I don't get it,"" Madonna said Friday. ""I guess it's on hold. ... Because given this environment, which so favors Republicans -- if it can happen in New Jersey and Massachusetts, you've got to wonder why it couldn't happen in Delaware, why Republicans aren't climbing out of their socks to run.""
\
The GOP's perennial statewide victor -- Mike Castle -- has held the seat since 1993. But last year, he decided to run for the Senate seat held for almost four decades by Democrat Joe Biden, who moved off Capitol Hill to the vice president's office.
\
Almost half (47 percent) of Delaware's 612,409 voters are registered as Democrats. About 30 percent are Republicans.
\
John C. Carney Jr., two-time lieutenant governor, is the headline candidate on the Democratic side. Political novice Scott Spencer has filed to force a Democratic primary. And several third-party candidates -- Douglas Allen Campbell Jr. (Delaware Constitution Party), Earl Lofland (Delaware Constitution Party), and Brent Wangen (Libertarian) -- have filed official papers with the Federal Election Commission.
\
A line of hopeful successors is forming on the GOP side, but none is considered the flag bearer by party insiders.
\
Two Republicans -- businessman Fred Cullis of Hockessin and Rose Izzo, who recently moved to Brandywine Hundred from Pennsylvania, according to her campaign Web site -- have filed with the FEC. A third -- Kevin Wade of New Castle -- announced his candidacy late last year and said he mailed his papers to the FEC about two weeks ago.
\
""There is an active effort to identify and recruit a viable candidate,"" said Don Mell, a Republican political strategist. ""But I do not believe the viable candidate has been identified or self-selected yet.""
\
Tom Ross, chairman of the Republican State Committee, said he expects other developments soon.
\
""We're at the point where you'll start to see things start to jell here in the near term,"" he said. ""We have some announced candidates and some filed candidates talking about important issues. At this point, none of them has the name ID yet that's necessary to win an election. ... We're very confident we will have a candidate -- not only a serious candidate, but one that will win this election.""
\
'People are mad'
\
Carney, who lost a hard-fought Democratic primary for governor in 2008, won't dabble in the horse-race aspects of this race. After eight years as Gov. Ruth Ann Minner's lieutenant and a 15-month gubernatorial campaign, he has name recognition. He also has more than $500,000 in his treasury and no fearsome rival yet.
\
""I'm spending all my time talking to people, and that's more important in this campaign than ever,"" he said. ""People are mad, anxious, worried and sick and tired of what's going on in Washington.
\
""At some point, [the GOP will] settle on an opponent and we'll have a vigorous campaign, I'm sure,"" he said. ""But people are sick and tired of Democrats and Republicans trying to fight and score political points. They're more interested in leaders who come up with solutions and come together for the common good.""
\
Ross said more than name recognition will be necessary for Carney.
\
""At the end of the day, I'm not sure what John Carney is going to run on,"" he said. ""He can't run on his record of service in the Carney-Minner administration. He can't run on the national agenda of the Democratic Party. The voters are roundly rejecting that. What we're going to look for is someone who wants to talk about spending, job creation, getting taxes under control and getting our house in order to get the economy rolling.""
\
The GOP state convention is in May, and Mell said it would be important to have a top candidate's name in circulation by the end of April at the latest.
\
One problem, he said, is that the party does not have the depth of potential candidates that it should have.
\
""We have the Red Sox, but we don't have the Blue Rocks,"" Mell said, ""because of some previous leadership issues that occurred before Tom Ross. If an organization doesn't encourage new, young blood to take responsibility and power, it ends up with few choices.""
\
Madonna said a dark horse -- a political novice, a previous unknown -- could have decent prospects in a year like this, which he says is the best for Republican candidates since 1994.
\
""Because this election is so nationalized, the backgrounds and experience of candidates make less of a difference,"" he said. ""Now what matters is what side of the national picture are you on? Are you an Obama guy? Do you support the stimulus and the bailouts, cap-and-trade? Are you that committed a Democrat? Or are you running against the reform agenda and the recession-fighting measures of Obama? The Obama people have to defend the recessionary measures and explain why the economy is not better.
\
""So you can take some of these not-well-knowns and they could win,"" he said.
\
Wade agrees.
\
""Republicans haven't done enough to earn the trust yet of the voters,"" he said. ""Groups like the Tea Party movement, the Founders Values, the 912 Patriots of Delaware -- they're very active. They have trouble finding rooms large enough for their meetings. They are people who have not had a strong interest in politics before. They've been busy living their lives and they don't care about carrying a political scorecard with them. Now they're very alert to the problems and they're just up [in] arms.
\
""Someone -- a Republican or Democrat or third party -- has to take a message to them that they can understand and trust. I'm working on it.""
\
Ross says Delaware voters will be impressed with the candidate the Republicans present.
\
""It's early now,"" he said. ""But people are paying attention. A candidate with the right message and the right resources would be able to convince people in Delaware that John Carney doesn't represent the direction we need to go in as a state or a nation.""
\
Madonna remains surprised at the thin field.
\
""Almost everywhere else, Republicans have candidates running. There are nine running against [Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman] Patrick Murphy,"" he said. ""Go around the country, and they're lining up to run against Democratic incumbents.""
\
Is someone out there waiting for a better opportunity down the road?
\
""In Delaware, there's no 'down the road' for Republicans,"" Madonna said. ""This is an open seat. Is there an election down there? I don't see it.""

The Washington Post asked political experts whether the Republican Party would win in November with a negative strategy. Responses below from Christine Todd Whitman, Scott Keeter, Martin Frost and Newt Gingrich.
\
CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, Chair of the Republican Leadership Council; governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001
\
In many respects, it is both comfortable and easy to be in the opposition; pointing out what is wrong with the majority party's proposals has a deceptive appeal. But the Republican Party cannot afford to simply be the party of no; we need to provide a compelling counterpoint to the Obama administration's tax-spend-and-borrow policies.
\
People want leaders to tell them where we need to be going, and denigrating the majority party is not a road map that they can follow. While the Democrats seem to have done a good job of ignoring public concerns with the recently passed health bill, if the Republicans only resort to chants of ""kill the bill,"" without offering viable remedies, we gain no advantage. The second risk here is marginalization; on health care, if voters start to see benefits or even a lack of disaster from the recently passed legislation, Republicans could be in jeopardy over our doomsday predictions.
\
In every issue being discussed today there are Republican alternatives. Let's start there and give the voters a real choice going into November.
\
SCOTT KEETER, Director of survey research at the Pew Research Center.
\
However one characterizes the Republican Party's strategy, there's no indication right now that it is hurting them politically. Congressional trial heat polls show the GOP at parity with the Democrats. Polls asking which party could do a better job on important issues have found the Republicans matching or gaining ground on the Democrats on handling the economy, health care and the deficit. And Republicans are more enthusiastic than Democrats about voting this year.
\
All of this has led to speculation that the GOP might make large gains this fall, perhaps comparable to those in 1994. But there are important differences between 2010 and 1994. One is that the overall image of the Republican Party is considerably more negative now (46 percent favorable) than it was in 1994 (63 percent favorable). Similarly, fewer people now than in 1994 say that the Republican Party is doing a good job of offering solutions to the country's problems (29 percent now, 41 percent in 1994). Of course, economic conditions are much worse than in 1994. This makes the fall election more of a referendum on the incumbent party than a choice between Democratic and Republican ideas. If the economy rallies, what the GOP offers and how the party is viewed are likely to become more important to voters.
\
MARTIN FROST, Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 1995 to 1998; representative from Texas from 1979 to 2005
\
Running strictly on a strategy of ""no"" is dangerous for any party. In 1994 the Republicans opposed much of what President Bill Clinton sought legislatively, but they did have some positive talking points -- for example, their Contract with America. When I was chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 1996 and 1998, we combined a positive message with a critique of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and picked up a total of 14 seats -- not enough to take the House back but close enough that Democrats could win in a good year. Democrats in 2006 and 2008 ran against President George W. Bush on the Iraq war; they also emphasized legislative goals such as improving health care and working for a cleaner environment and energy independence.
\
I am reluctant to give Republicans advice, but they will need to join the debate on the economy if they expect to make significant gains. It won't be enough for them simply to be against health-care reform and against large deficits -- particularly the latter, since their party was spending freely when they were in control. Both parties will need specific job-creation proposals and will need to convince the public that they have a clear vision of how to improve the economy. If both parties fail on this, then Democratic and Republicans incumbents could have a very rough time. We may see an election in which incumbents of the out party are defeated along with incumbents of the majority party. Then it will just be a question of who is left standing.
\
NEWT GINGRICH, Republican speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999
\
No and yes is the winning strategy for Republicans.
\
We should firmly say no to bad policies and enthusiastically say yes to good policies to draw a clear distinction between our vision for America and the left's job-killing, tax-increasing, deficit-increasing, big-bureaucracy, Washington-centered, politician-dominated vision.
\
We should say no to 16,000 new IRS agents who would become ""health policemen."" We should say no to a cap-and-trade bill that would raise the cost of energy and drive jobs out of the United States.
\
We should enthusiastically say yes to good solutions that fit our values and principles. We are for litigation reform to bring down the cost of health care. We should be for reforms to save $70 billion to $120 billion a year that the incompetent bureaucracy currently pays to crooks in Medicare and Medicaid. We can be for drilling offshore now to create American jobs and keep Americans' money here now.
\
We can be for real school reform to help poor children get good educations. We can be for trying terrorists in military tribunals. There are many things to say yes to.

NEWARK -- More sharp differences emerged Saturday between Delaware's major-party congressional candidates -- Democrat John Carney and Republican Glen Urquhart -- during a candidate forum at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Newark.
\
The men shared the dais for an hour with Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Chris Coons, discussing a challenging list of issues that face the United States, including energy, the environment, abortion, foreign relations and the economy. Moderator Allan Loudell of WDEL Radio (1150 AM) presented questions from the audience of about 85 and followed up with some of his own.
\
Coons' Republican opponent -- Christine O'Donnell -- was conspicuously absent until all the others had gone. She had planned to skip the Newark forum entirely, sending her sister to represent her. But Friday night, her campaign told forum organizers she would stop by for five minutes, make a statement and leave. She apologized to organizers Saturday for misunderstanding the timing and the format of the forum.
\
To be sure, these candidates face a long grocery list of requests in this midterm election year -- debates, forums, community appearances, interviews. Absences could be strategic decisions, campaign miscues, last-minute triage or a combination of factors.
\
Urquhart and O'Donnell both have decided not to attend a debate on environmental issues Tuesday night at the Jewish Community Center in Talleyville. Urquhart's campaign says he will be at a GOP rally at Bogey's in Middletown instead. O'Donnell will face Coons on Wednesday night in a debate at the University of Delaware, with live coverage by CNN.
\
Saturday, a few questions on the environment arose -- before O'Donnell arrived -- and clear distinctions were evident between Carney and Urquhart on that and other topics.
\
*On the debate over global warming, Carney believes scientists around the planet have concluded that human behavior is contributing to a precipitous warming trend in the Earth's climate, a trend that endangers many creatures and habitats. He believes it is urgent to change course and that ""we have to start coming up with global agreements, national policy and individual action.""
\
Urquhart sees climate change as a constant cycle -- ""it gets colder, it gets hotter."" He says scientific evidence shows the planet is getting colder now, not hotter and that there is ""no relationship documented between human activity and climate change.""
\
He sees the debate as an effort by some to make big money on cap-and-trade policies that allow businesses to exceed emission limits if they pay fees to the government.
\
Carney said denying the scientific evidence is ""a very, very dangerous thing"" and the world cannot afford to start the debate again.
\
Coons agreed with Carney and said efforts to promote alternative energy sources -- solar cells, fuel cells, offshore wind farms -- are essential.
\
""This is not some abstract issue that we can afford to wait 50 years to do something about,"" he said. "" ... To dismiss this as a bailout for billionaires is a failure to grasp the scientific evidence and the economic opportunity.""
\
*On the Delaware River dredging project, intended to increase capacity for the ports that depend on it, Carney takes a cautious approach. He said the Army Corps of Engineering should honor the state permit process, which would include analysis of what toxins might be stirred up from the sediments in the riverbed.
\
Urquhart says the nation needs the economic boost and jobs that expanded capacity could produce. The Environmental Protection Agency and Corps of Engineers have studied and studied and studied the question, he said. It's time to move forward.
\
*On whether Congress should repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on gays in the military, Urquhart said the military is not a ""social laboratory."" He would follow the recommendations of military chiefs and career military personnel. A Pentagon study of how to change the policy -- if Congress votes to repeal it -- will not be complete until after the Nov. 2 election.
\
Carney said he supports and has worked for ""equal opportunity for everyone in our country notwithstanding their sexual preference."" He said he would vote to repeal the policy, which has resulted in the expulsion of more than 13,000 troops.
\
On that question, Coons was clear, too. He sees the policy as ""outright discrimination"" and said he would work hard to repeal it.
\
*On abortion, Carney and Coons both said they support a woman's right to choose to end a pregnancy. Urquhart said he supports the right to life -- an ""unalienable"" right that does not come from government and cannot be repealed by government.
\
*On the separation of church and state, Urquhart said, ""That is not a matter of protecting the state from the church, but the church from the state."" Religious liberty is essential, he said.
\
""Jefferson and Madison made it clear we need faith-based principles in the public square.""
\
Carney said parents can choose religious schools for their children, as his father -- a public-school teacher -- did for him. Carney attended Catholic schools.
\
""It's appropriate to keep any kind of religious preference out of our public schools,"" he said.
\
*On the nation's immigration policy, Carney said he supports a ""guest-worker policy"" that would allow migrant workers to continue to work. If they did not, he said, the chicken-processing plants and many other agricultural endeavors in the state would collapse.
\
Urquhart said the nation cannot tolerate the continued defiance of immigration laws. He would pay more per pound to have Americans in those jobs, he said.
\
""We don't have to grow our economy on the backs of slave labor.""
\
Frank Barbehenn, a retired airline executive, said Carney made the most sense to him. He doesn't know how Urquhart can deny the climate-change research. Francis Battaglia of Newark thought Coons and Carney both were informative and knowledgeable.
\
Bart Hook, who served in the Navy, said he leans toward the Democrats on social issues, toward the Republicans on almost everything else. Urquhart sounded pretty good to him Saturday.
\
""He comes from both a government and a private-sector background,"" Hook said. ""If you've played football, you know football. Real-world experience is very important.""

The story of the student's rape in California so reminds us of Kitty Genovese's knifing murder in 1964 in Queens, N.Y., when 38 witnesses did nothing to phone police or intervene in repeated visits by her assailant beneath their apartment windows.
\
Here, over 20 students outside, more inside, including police and teacher chaperones, never used their cell phones to call for help or run back inside to summon assistance from their fellow students when sheer numbers might have stopped the assault. So they were drinking on school grounds, but nobody came to her aid. It was a ""bad city,"" but where was common sense? Will any of these students be considered accessories to a crime?

Don't fall for cap-and-trade when China and India won't
\
China and India say ""no"" to climate treaty. So must we.
\
A new international climate treaty drafted for a December meeting in Copenhagen calls for drastic reductions in global CO2 emissions.
\
This treaty would impose enormous costs not just on all Americans but on any country that agrees to it, unless they can get the U.S. to pay it all. The IPCC, or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, estimates the world cost at $1 trillion per year for years to come. Many other estimates are even higher.
\
On Oct. 21, China and India said ""no"" to the Copenhagen agreement. The U.S. must also do the same.
\
China (the largest emitter) and India (No. 4) will not agree to any emissions cap because it would limit their economic growth. China and India support the Kyoto Protocol, which does not require developing countries to reduce emissions. From 1997 to 2006 (the latest data), China's emissions rose 92.1 percent while U.S. emissions rose only 5.6 percent.
\
Restricting U.S. emissions because of this treaty and cap-and-trade would not lower global emissions at all but merely transfer industry and jobs to China and other countries, at great cost to the American economy and people.

Has Sussex Council already decided on shopping center?
\
The Sussex County Council hopes to keep the fact that they can't make a decision off the front page. Dan Shortridge's ""Vote delayed on shopping center"" made it to page B2 on Oct. 28.
\
Councilman Michael H. Vincent, R-Seaford, needs more time to review information presented over the past many months and Samuel R. Wilson, R-Georgetown, George B. Cole, R-Ocean View, and Vance C. Phillips, R-Laurel, all agree. The only council member prepared to do her duty was Joan R. Deaver, D-Rehoboth Beach.
\
The county Planning and Zoning Commission has already voted twice to recommend against both the original and then the modified version of the Lingo-Townsend Associates rezoning request to build the Village Center shopping and office complex across from Cape Henlopen High School.
\
Could it be that the 4-1 council vote to delay a final decision for 60 days is just an attempt to let the citizen heat die down? The vote would now come up during the Christmas holiday period when it might not raise so much dust in Lewes. It's beginning to sound a lot like the council has already made up its mind.

Corps' connections means it usually gets what it wants
\
I read with interest The News Journal articles on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredging the Delaware River without authorization from the states of Delaware or New Jersey. This is not surprising; the Corps was once an honorable and respected organization. But that has changed in recent years.
\
The Corps has huge financial resources and does not hesitate to flex its political and financial muscle to get what the corps and commercial interests want. The Corps is also pushing to dredge the Nanticoke River in Sussex County -- without any obvious concern for the environment, public safety or private property. In 2002, the Corps announced plans to dredge the Nanticoke River in Delaware. Dredging is very expensive and can be ecologically damaging, so regulations require that a specific need for dredging be documented. However, the Corps' only previous navigation channel survey of the Nanticoke River was conducted in 1899 (over 100 years ago). When this was pointed out to the Corps in 2005, they immediately had a survey conducted, but this was three years after the Corps announced plans to dredge.
\
As the owner of a home on the shores of the Nanticoke River, I have personally witnessed the Corps' complete lack of concern for private citizens. The Corps' efforts to dredge are driven entirely by commercial interests with a complete disregard for any harm that may be caused to the environment or the property and safety of homeowners.

Glacier's history should show us something about warming
\
As anyone who was educated in Ohio knows, about 15,000 years ago, a glacier once covered two-thirds of the state. Where Cincinnati and Dayton are, the ice was thousands of feet thick. The glacier eventually receded back into Canada, then advanced again to about 50 miles south of Cleveland. An Ohio Turnpike rest stop is dedicated to this event. The last glacier ice was gone from Ohio about 6,000 years ago.
\
The Gore-ites are worried about the effects of the rise in world temperature in the last century (100 years). The earth has been around 5 billion years. Shouldn't the past geologic events be factored into the present and future climate change? The glacier ice in Ohio wasn't melted by heat from the Indians building too many campfires.

Fox, Limbaugh and friends are bigots who blur the truth
\
It was Daniel Patrick Moynihan who stated, ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts."" How appropriate a sentiment in the wake of the White House's well-warranted condemnation of Fox News! Many of us already knew what the White House has asserted so recently. This particular corporate media giant is an arm of the Republican Party and blurs opinion programming with authentic news.
\
Unfortunately, there are many so-called ""low informed"" citizens who cannot nor will not make the distinction and mistake the slanted journalism of the likes of Sean Hannity and the Fox and Friends crew as real news reporting.
\
In addition, Fox News has also been instrumental in promoting and mobilizing this summer's so-called Tea Parties and the 9-12 Project protesting the present administration's policies. However, Fox News, dominated by the bombastic and irrational rantings and ravings of ultra-conservative personalities such as Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly, is not alone. Equally alarming are the bigotry, hypocrisy, and incendiary rhetoric of radio talk-show hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and CNN's Lou Dobbs.
\
Such inflammatory rhetoric and outlandish untruths as those espoused by the ""birthers,"" the ""deathers,"" and the ""conspiracy theorists"" also take on a life of their own on the Internet.
\
The need for more people to express their outrage over right-wing fear-mongering and ridiculous falsehoods has never been greater. The lessons of the past are reason enough to evaluate the consequences of our collective silence.

\
President Barack Obama urged Congress to enact ""market-based"" measures to reduce emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and used his State of the Union address Tuesday to declare he will press ahead on addressing climate change with or without congressional support.
\
""If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will,"" Obama said. ""I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.""
\
The president's remarks - touting opportunities of solar, wind and greater energy efficiency - came little more than three months after Superstorm Sandy threatened the entire state of Delaware before savaging the Jersey Shore and New York, leading to a $60 billion relief package likely to cover only a small share of total losses.
\
Although scientists cautioned against directly linking Sandy to global warming, many said the storm could have gathered extra strength from ocean waters heated by months of warmer-than-normal temperatures, and a slowly rising average global temperature.
\
Obama stressed Tuesday night he takes that storm and other events seriously as a call for action.
\
""We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen, were all just a freak coincidence,"" Obama said. ""Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science - and act before it's too late.""
\
The speech fell on the eve of the first of three public meetings on suggestions from Delaware's Sea Level Rise Advisory Committee, a panel formed by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to suggest ways to prepare for higher tides and flooding borne of rising global temperatures.
\
Those suggestions have ranged from better research and data and tougher coastal building restrictions to warning signs near future flood zones and seller disclosure requirements for land in vulnerable areas. Some already have drawn sharp criticism.
\
Rich Collins, who directs the business-oriented Positive Growth Alliance in Delaware, said he opposes the White House approach, and said that recent cuts in emissions have gone unrecognized.
\
""I have no problem with the cleanest environment we could possibly have."" Collins said. ""But I believe people are hurting, and these people just don't seem to have a problem with inflicting pain on those who are hurting the most.""
\
Eileen Claussen, president of the national Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, immediately endorsed Obama's call for controlling heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions by putting a price on pollution, capping emissions and allowing companies to trade emissions credits.
\
""A stable climate and reliable energy are both fundamental to our economic well-being,"" Claussen said. ""So as he and Congress seek long-term solutions to the nation's fiscal challenges, we strongly encourage them to consider either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax.
\
In often-flooded Bowers Beach, Lieba Kaplan said she hoped to see the president at least mention climate change, but was not surprised that he offered few details.
\
""I'm for really checking the environment, for not just going after energy no matter what the cost to the environment,"" Kaplan said. ""I'm concerned that we don't do things that just make the oil companies and gas companies richer. We need to shift to cleaner energy. We need to take advantage of the wind that's blowing through Bowers Beach all the time.""

\
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, long the advocacy arm of big business, is losing some big-name members for its position opposing a climate-change bill now working its way through Congress.
\
The departures underscore a division among businesses over the legislation's impact on their finances -- and the larger economy.
\
Some of those withdrawing from the national business group have local ties, notably Exelon Corp., the nation's largest owner of nuclear power plants. Exelon, with major offices in Kennett Square, Pa., also is the parent company of PECO, an electric utility serving the Philadelphia area.
\
Other companies ending their membership include Apple Inc. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., California's largest utility. Nike quit the chamber's board of directors in protest, but remained a member.
\
While stopping short of quitting the chamber in protest, several businesses with Delaware ties, like NRG Energy and Pepco Holdings Inc., are also bucking the chamber's lobbying efforts.
\
In an effort to reverse global climate change, Congress and President Barack Obama are working to enact legislation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
\
That's just one of several issues, including efforts to reform the health care system and financial markets, that put Obama at odds with the chamber. The chamber spent a record $34.7 million in the third quarter on lobbying against Obama's proposals.
\
For some of its members, the chamber's opposition to the climate bill was the tipping point. At a speech to energy industry leaders in late September, Exelon CEO John Rowe announced his group would not renew its membership.
\
""Inaction on climate is not an option,"" Rowe said during the speech. ""If Congress does not act, the EPA will, and the result will be more arbitrary, more expensive, and more uncertain for investors and the industry than a reasonable, market-based legislative solution.""
\
In June, the House passed a bill that would mandate cuts in greenhouse gases by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. Senators, meanwhile, are pushing legislation that would cut emissions by 20 percent by that year.
\
Lawmakers would accomplish this by limiting emissions from the nation's largest polluters, and creating a system where they could buy and trade a limited number of allowances to pollute above the cap.
\
One of the most contentious matters is issuing free allowances during the early years designed to ease the burden on businesses during the transition. The allowances would be divided up among power companies, refineries and other big industries.
\
In the House bill, electric utilities get 35 percent of the allowances in 2012 and 2013, while refineries receive just 2 percent during that time.
\
Not surprisingly, area electric utilities and power generators -- especially those who own carbon-free nuclear and lower-emission natural gas plants, like Exelon and NRG -- have spoken kindly of the bill.
\
NRG, which owns the coal-burning Indian River Power Plant, has never been a member of the chamber. But it supports the Senate passing a similar bill to the House as soon as possible, said Drew Murphy, president of NRG's northeast region.
\
""A bill like this would benefit the environment, the business community and the economy by stimulating massive private sector investment in clean technologies,"" Murphy said.
\
Officials at Pepco Holdings, parent company of Delmarva Power, say the company disagrees with the chamber on this issue, although it will remain a member.
\
The company ""supports congressional passage of climate change legislation in 2009,"" said spokesman Robert Dobkin, declining to go into more detail on the bill.
\
Dobkin said the chamber does good work to support the interests of Pepco's small business customers and shareholders on other issues, like taxes and tort reform, meriting Pepco's continued support.
\
NRG, Exelon and DuPont Co. are members of the United States Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big businesses and environmental groups pushing for a strong cap-and-trade climate bill.
\
Other members of the partnership are PepsiCo, Ford Motor Company, and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Also not surprisingly, two area refiners, Valero and Sunoco, say they're opposed to the House bill in its current form.
\
Valero spokesman Bill Day said the refiner is not a member of the chamber, but applauds its work, calling the bill ""dangerous legislation that will have serious detrimental impacts on the economy while providing no benefit whatsoever to alleviating climate change.""
\
At a time when refineries are facing difficult economic challenges, it would add major new costs, he said.
\
""There is no doubt that it will cause prices at the pump to rise,"" Day said.
\
The House bill makes it cheaper to import gasoline, diesel fuel and other products from overseas, said Thomas Golembeski, spokesman for Sunoco, with a refinery that straddles the Delaware border with Marcus Hook, Pa. Sunoco is not a member of the chamber.
\
Where companies stand depends upon where they sit, said Ed Ratledge, a University of Delaware economist. Those with natural gas, nuclear and other facilities with lower carbon emissions -- even those looking into ""clean coal"" -- stand to gain from the proposal, he said.
\
Companies will also examine how they would absorb additional costs, whether through increasing the price of their goods and services, lower shareholder returns, wages, and suppliers, he said.
\
""Eventually, it all gets passed along,"" Ratledge said.
\
The conflict has had its share of sideshows, most notably a phony news conference at the National Press Club on Monday by a group claiming to be the chamber, announcing it was reversing its opposition to the climate bill. An actual chamber member burst in and broke up the event; the chamber is asking authorities to look into the matter.
\
The chamber upset some of its members after one of its executives suggested putting the science behind climate change on trial, like the 1926 Scopes monkey trial. That's when a teacher was prosecuted for illegally teaching evolution.
\
The Delaware State Chamber of Commerce is lining up behind the national chamber, with which it is formally affiliated. James Wolfe, the state chamber's president, said a cap-and-trade system can work, as long as it doesn't ""unfairly punish some industries while benefiting others. We do not support provisions that will essentially tax the public and small business by establishing large hidden increases in the cost of energy.""
\
The state's most famous business, DuPont, which left the chamber in 2005, is generally supportive of the climate bill. Although it will probably increase electricity costs for its manufacturing sites, it will boost DuPont's alternative energy businesses, the company reported.
\
""When the House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy And Security Act earlier this year, we encouraged the Senate to take it up and continue to improve it, with the goal of environmentally effective and economically robust climate legislation,"" said Michael Parr, DuPont manager of government affairs.
\
DuPont reported that its departure from the chamber was due to general business reasons, as it tried to limit the number of associations of which it was a member.

\
A coalition of Northeast states has accelerated its schedule for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, adopting a lower ""cap"" that will be used as the starting point for a four-year reduction plan.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative moved its 2014 emission limit 45 percent lower, or 74 million tons, for its nine-state cap-and-trade region.
\
Delaware and Maryland are part of the program, which opened the nation's first carbon market auctions in 2007, after attempts to develop a national program fell through. New Jersey dropped out in 2011. Under the program, power plants buy credits, or allowances, for each ton of carbon dioxide released, with auction proceeds widely used for energy-related programs.
\
The adjustment partly reflects widespread power plant shifts from coal to lower-carbon natural gas and other changes that drove down emissions even as RGGI prepared to impose a 2.5 percent annual cut in allowable emissions between 2015 and 2018.
\
Collin P. O'Mara, Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control secretary, currently chairs the multistate group.
\
""Today we are taking another significant step forward in realizing our common goal of reducing carbon emissions, driving energy efficiency investments, accelerating clean energy deployment"" and benefiting residents and businesses, O'Mara said in a prepared statement.
\
Members of Delaware's chapter of the Sierra Club said Thursday that they support the move.
\
""RGGI has clearly been a success already by putting millions of dollars toward renewable energy and energy efficiency programs across the region and in Delaware,"" said Amy Roe, the group's conservation chair.
\
Scientists around the world have warned that global emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping pollutants need to drop sharply in the coming decades to avoid the worst effects of global warming and climate change. Current emissions, researchers have said, already have made an average 3.5-degree Farenheit increase nearly unavoidable, increasing the risks of extreme weather and drastic sea-level rise.

\
Business groups in Delaware are casting a wary eye on the arrival of President-elect Barack Obama and the expansion of the Democratic majority in Congress.
\
""We have seen that one-party control typically doesn't seem to work out the way it should,"" said Scott Kidner, Delaware state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby. ""It doesn't matter whether you're an 'R' or a 'D.' You do need checks and balances.""
\
Atop the list of concerns for a number of industries is Democratic-supported legislation that would make it easier for workers to form unions.
\
Some of Delaware's signature industries, including credit cards and pharmaceuticals, face potentially punitive legislation from a more consumer-oriented Congress.
\
And businesses are looking at a murky picture on tax policy complicated by the ongoing financial crisis and economic downturn.
\
Obama's tax plan calls for raising taxes on those earning more than $250,000, which would affect a number of so-called Subchapter S corporations, where profits flow through to the business owner's tax returns.
\
Some analysts and business leaders think the economic situation will push Obama and congressional Democrats to hold off on any tax increases, but the public officials have yet to say so publicly.
\
""The concern and the question here is whether ideology trumps reality,"" said Bob Prybutok, president of Newark manufacturing firm Polymer Technologies. ""Ideology appears to have trumped reality through most of the campaign.""
\
Prybutok, whose business employs 110 workers in Delaware, is among those closely tracking a piece of legislation known as the Employee Free Choice Act.
\
The bill would change the method by which a union can organize a workplace. Under current rules, companies can dictate that workers vote in a secret-ballot election on whether to unionize. The Employee Free Choice Act would allow workers to unionize by collecting signed authorization cards from a majority of workers.
\
Unions say the bill would remove unfair barriers to union representation and help stem coercive practices by employers leading up to union votes. But the bill faces fierce opposition from a range of business groups, who say the ""card check"" provision would stir widespread harassment of workers by unions.
\
""My personal view is that it's a tool for unions to increase their control and increase their membership by abusing workers' rights and abusing the system,"" said Prybutok, who chairs the leadership council of the National Federation of Independent Business in Delaware.
\
Prybutok said the U.S. manufacturing sector has benefited from the concept of ""lean"" manufacturing, a philosophy that calls for flexibility in how to utilize workers. Such a system is nearly impossible to implement in a union workplace, with its rigid work rules and protocols, he said.
\
Unions are optimistic about the bill's prospects in the next Congress. Obama has said he would sign the bill, which died in the Senate last year amid a Republican filibuster. Vice president-elect Joe Biden is also a supporter.
\
Congress also is expected to take up legislation that targets purported abuses by the credit card industry, including offering ""teaser"" interest rates that reset to higher levels and maximizing interest charges by requiring consumers to pay off balances with lower interest rates first.
\
The bill also would limit fees and control big rate hikes when a cardholder has a payment glitch on an account with a different provider.
\
William Keenan, chairman and CEO of Hockessin-based credit card consultancy De Novo Corp., said Delaware's financial services industry is seeing ""opposing forces"" from the next Congress and administration.
\
On the one hand, he said, government intervention is helping to shore up the parent banks of Delaware credit card issuers, and any economic stimulus package for consumers would benefit the credit card industry.
\
On the other hand, some of the proposed legislation puts credit card reward programs and offers to less creditworthy consumers at risk, Keenan said.
\
""While many of the legislators' hearts may be in the right place, a lot of it's not thought through because the ultimate impact will be felt by the consumer,"" he said.
\
The pharmaceutical industry also faces a potentially adversarial relationship with the new federal government. Obama targeted drug companies on the campaign trail, and some members of Congress are eager to give the government the right to negotiate prices for drugs covered by Medicare with drug makers.
\
AstraZeneca is likely to have a central role in the upcoming discussion on health-care reform; the company's chief executive, David Brennan, is in line to be the next chairman of the drug industry's trade group. That group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is launching a public-relations campaign in support of free-market health care.
\
Rich Buckley, AstraZeneca's vice president of government affairs, said the company has actively lobbied for a strong and well-funded Food and Drug Administration, the agency that regulates prescription drugs.
\
Buckley said AstraZeneca also supports reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program, a Democratic priority and one of the first major health-care issues the next Congress is likely to address.
\
But Buckley said private insurance plans are already effectively negotiating Medicare prescription prices with drug companies, and policymakers shouldn't tinker with the market.
\
""Once you go down the road of a monolithic federal plan with monolithic federal pricing, you're going to end up with a program that Americans don't like very much,"" Buckley said.
\
All businesses are watching to see what the Obama administration will do to stimulate the moribund U.S. economy. That's the No. 1 issue DuPont Co. will be watching next year, company spokeswoman Michelle Reardon said.
\
DuPont and other polluters could face more onerous environmental regulations in an Obama administration. But the Wilmington-based industrial giant, an early corporate advocate of addressing climate change, has worked to stay ahead of potential regulations.
\
DuPont already participates in a voluntary trading program to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions; a mandatory ""cap and trade"" program is expected under the new administration.
\
Obama even mentioned DuPont in an August speech as having a model energy-efficiency program. The president-elect has proposed spending $150 billion over 10 years on renewable energy, including solar power and second-generation biofuels -- areas where DuPont is investing research dollars and forecasting rapid growth.
\
In a speech earlier this month, DuPont Chairman and CEO Chad Holliday, in his role as chairman of the Council on Competitiveness, called for the new administration and Congress to enact a four-part plan including worker retraining, new investments in applied research and infrastructure, and a comprehensive energy plan.
\
""To compete, we need to ensure that every American has the skills to make it in the global economy, that America remains the innovation laboratory of the world, that our infrastructure continues to keep us moving and that we have an action agenda on energy,"" Holliday said.

ISSUES OF INTEREST
\
Some of the major issues local business leaders are watching, by sector:
\
Credit cards: Congress is mulling several pieces of legislation to correct what some consider the abuses of credit card issuers, such as high fees, abrupt rate changes and ""teaser"" raters. Executives worry the measures will wreak havoc on the industry's business model, with a crackdown shriveling offers to all but the most creditworthy consumers.
\
Construction: The industry is front and center among those worried about legislation that would make it easier to unionize workplaces. As private-sector construction slows, Delaware companies are closely watching the state budget situation in the hope that capital spending will hold steady.
\
Manufacturing: Delaware's auto sector has been decimated of late with more than 1,500 layoffs this year, but the state's dealers, suppliers and remaining workers at the General Motors plant near Newport could stand to benefit if the government bails out domestic automakers. Tougher environmental regulations are likely under Obama, including a ""cap and trade"" program to cut down on greenhouse-gas emissions.
\
Health care: Obama railed against prescription-drug costs on the campaign trail, and pharmaceutical companies are gearing up for a battle with members of Congress looking to control prices of drugs covered by Medicare. Businesses, already beset by rising health-care costs, are watching to see how new federal and state insurance reform policies will affect their bottom line.
\
Agriculture: Obama is in favor of continued subsidies for ethanol and other biofuels, a developing business for DuPont Co. that's dependent on government support. His criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement during a primary campaign worried some farm groups, who depend on a liberal trade environment to sell commodities overseas.

WASHINGTON -- Delaware Gov. Jack Markell stressed emissions control, energy efficiency and preparations for the harsher effects of climate change today during a keynote speech.
\
Markell spoke for the second-half opening of a two-day workshop at the Georgetown Climate Center on ways state and federal governments can cooperate to curb pollution linked to global warming and adapt to consequences of current and past emissions.
\
""From hurricanes and tornadoes, to wildfires and droughts, we're experiencing exactly what so many of the models predict and suggest that we ought to be experiencing. We ought to just say that the science is settled and the data is overwhelming, and that ought to be the starting point for all of these conversations,"" Markell told an early morning crowd.
\
The center, based at Georgetown Law School, operates as a clearinghouse and analysis center for states and federal issues involving energy, climate and transportation. Some of its work has focused on the evolution of climate change policies in the years since 2009, when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a formal declaration that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases have endangered public health and should be controlled.
\
In the past, Markell has stressed as settled scientific evidence of climate change and links to carbon dioxide releases and said communities need to prepare. But he also has emphasized that shifts to new and cleaner energy sources will create opportunities for economic growth and development.
\
""I think a lot of governors have seen that we can actually accelerate economic growth in our states by supporting the construction and manufacturing jobs in energy efficiency, clean energy and advanced transportation,"" Markell said.
\
""And I think the fact that the debate is evolving in that direction, where people see that these investments are good for the environment and good for the economy is a whole different way of looking at things. It's a much better way of looking at things.""
\
In Delaware, that view has led to state level support for a range of initiatives, including state support for power plant shifts from coal to natural gas, a fuel cell manufacturer venture and Fisker Automotive's troubled electric car venture.
\
A day earlier, during the same workshop, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin O'Mara said that the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has succeeded in moving power plant carbon dioxide emissions dramatically lower without harming ratepayers, utilities or local economies.
\
O'Mara currently chairs the initiative, which recently reduced emissions goals to account for findings from the first years of the program. The group relies on a ""cap and trade"" process that limited annual power plant carbon dioxide emissions and created a market for plants to buy needed pollution credits and sell excess amounts.
\
The group cut its multistate budget for carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent, to 91 million tons, earlier this month, with levels required to fall by 10 percent by 2019.
\
""We have confidence that the numbers are realistic,"" O'Mara said.
\
Markell said Superstorm Sandy and other recent weather calamities have shown that global warming has become an immediate threat that requires a ""frank conversation,"" choices and action.
\
""I know that there has been some hesitation on the part of some in the environmental advocacy movement,"" Markell said. ""They've been hesitant over the years to have a robust conversation about adapting, because some saw that as really a surrender. They didn't want to give a false sense that we can adapt our way out of it.""

State economies can benefit as climate change pressures encourage shifts to cleaner and more efficient energy sources, Gov. Jack Markell said in a speech on Friday to a climate conference at Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C.
\
But governments also need to act now to prepare communities for more extreme storms and other emerging consequences of global warming-driven climate change, Markell added.
\
""I think people are paying more and more attention to climate impacts than ever before because of many of the things that have happened to many of us,"" Markell said during a keynote speech that opened the second day of the Georgetown Climate Center workshop.
\
The event focused on ways states and federal government can cooperate in developing a future with drastically lower emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and communities better prepared for threats like sea-level rise, longer droughts and changes in agricultural patterns.
\
""From hurricanes and tornadoes to wildfires and droughts, we're experiencing exactly what so many of the models predict and suggest that we ought to be experiencing. We ought to just say that the science is settled and the data is overwhelming, and that ought to be the starting point for all of these conversations,"" Markell told an early morning crowd.

Some of its work has focused on the evolution of climate change policies since 2009, when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a formal declaration that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases have endangered public health and should be controlled.
\
Markell has said releases that could raise global average temperatures by 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit or more in the next century work as scientific evidence of climate change and links to carbon dioxide. But he also has emphasized that shifts to new and cleaner energy sources will create opportunities for economic growth and development.
\
""I think a lot of governors have seen that we can actually accelerate economic growth in our states by supporting the construction and manufacturing jobs in energy efficiency, clean energy and advanced transportation,"" Markell said.

Any discussion of job creation in Delaware must start with the recognition of the existence of the two distinct societies in Delaware: persons with limited education (a high school degree or less) and persons with ample education (a college degree or more).
\
The limited education folks are being hammered by the current economy while the ample education crowd barely knows there has been a recession. The ample education crowd dominates policy decision- making and that is to the distinct disadvantage of the limited education folks.
\
First, let's discuss the distribution of the burden of Delaware's current economic struggles.
\
While other factors may come into play, in today's labor market formal education is the primary determinant of employment and earnings. Delawareans with less education have an unemployment rate three to five times higher than workers with ample education.
\
More than one-fifth of Delaware's unemployed live in households that fall below the poverty line. Only 4 percent of Delawareans with ample education lack health insurance compared to 11 percent of high school graduates and 22 percent of dropouts.
\
Second, the ample education crowd's domination of the public policy process reflects the reality that they live in a more advantaged world. The two clearest examples are the focus of the ample education folks on the environment and quality of life issues at the expense of economic growth and their unwillingness to confront Delaware's mediocre public education system. Let's briefly discuss both.
\
An early major quality of life initiative was the passage of New Castle County's Uniform Development Act (UDC) in 1998. The UDC language was clear: ""growth management,"" ""control density,"" ""preserve agriculture,"" and ""protect from adverse consequences (of development).""
\
The UDC has worked almost exactly as intended. Since 1998 job growth in NCC has ground to a halt. Residential construction has collapsed and, with little growth in the tax base, property taxes and user fees have soared.
\
Recently the quality-of-life thrust has been centered on green energy. The state enacted an aggressive Renewable (Energy) Portfolio Standard, requiring power companies to shift to more expensive solar and wind power sources. Delaware joined RGGI, a regional carbon cap and trade program that has cost the power companies in the 10 member states $912 million from 2009 to date. Aggressive subsidies to power cell converter producer Bloom Energy will be paid for by Delmarva Power customers.
\
Energy costs are already a serious economic disadvantage for Delaware. These green energy policies, regardless of their merit, are driving up the cost of electricity and making it less likely that Delaware will be able to attract businesses that provide jobs for workers with limited education.
\
Public education in Delaware is tightly controlled by a large teachers' union. Despite mediocre performance that seriously disadvantages the children of parents with limited education, any serious efforts at public education reform have been thwarted.
\
Parents with ample education are able to opt out if they wish. Among the school-age children of parents who stay in Delaware, more than one out of six attend private school. This rises to one out four in New Castle County. Alternatively, parents with ample education can avoid private school costs by moving to such nearby high performing public school districts as Unionville-Chadds Ford, Wallingford-Swarthmore, or Avon Grove. Much of the $2.7 billion of wages currently exported from Delaware by commuters is accounted for by such parents.
\
Delaware parents with limited education are knocking down the doors of the available charter schools. While enrollment in Delaware's public schools has risen 9 percent in eight years, enrollment in Delaware's charter schools is up 228 percent. The fastest growth in charter school enrollment is among African-Americans, and today 58 percent of the state's charter school students are nonwhite.
\
The Delaware State Education Association, the teachers union, favors more regulations to slow the growth of charter schools. State government has ignored the Race to the Top recommendation to fund construction of charter schools.
\
The availability and ability to compete for jobs is a critical issue for Delaware residents with limited education. Delaware's ""ample education"" policy-makers need to begin to recognize the economic hardship their single-minded pursuit of the environment and quality of life are imposing on folks with limited education. These policy-makers should push for education reforms that emphasize choice for parents and give school administrators and teachers the latitude to try new approaches to education.

\
On Dec. 4 Environment America released a report that indicates storms with heavy rainfall are now 42 percent more frequent in the Mid-Atlantic than they were 60 years ago. The report concludes that increased frequency of extreme storms may be tied to atmospheric warming due to air pollution.
\
This isn't a surprising finding because as the Earth gets hotter, evaporation increases, resulting in increased moisture in the atmosphere. As moisture cools and condenses in clouds, it results in more water for precipitation, hence more frequent and intense floods.
\
On the drought side of the water cycle, more arid conditions induce more evaporation and thus can result in more frequent and intense dry periods.
\
In the Mid-Atlantic, there is debate about the causes of increased precipitation and its impact on flooding. I believe increased precipitation frequency is due to a combination of natural variation in the Earth's climatic cycle and human influences.
\
Gauges indicate there have been more floods and droughts lately in Delaware. The Brandywine and White Clay creeks and St. Jones River have had measurable increases in peak flood flows since 1990.
\
We looked at 20 stream gauges in the Delaware River basin; 10 of them recorded higher flood flows since 1990.
\
Extreme floods ranging between 50-year and 500-year intensity occurred during Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Tropical Storms Henri and Jeanne in 2003 and 2004. These extreme floods occurred between the droughts of 1995, 1999 and 2002, a striking weather swing.
\
There is enough evidence regarding global warming for the government to take action. I have witnessed the good that government can do in cleaning up the nation's rivers and streams through the Delaware River Basin Commission created in 1961 and the Clean Water Act and amendments passed during the 1970s.
\
In many watersheds draining to the Delaware River, dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, sediment, lead and copper levels have improved markedly. The American shad and bald eagle have returned as water gets cleaner. The bans on phosphorus detergent, leaded gas and DDT were successful actions prompted by the government.
\
These environmental improvements are due to progressive laws and efforts initiated during the John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon administrations. To deal with emissions and climate change, we need a law to reverse the damage done to the atmosphere by air pollution. It's time the federal government set criteria that cap and control emissions to the atmosphere.
\
A federal approach is appropriate because air emissions extend downwind thousands of miles and include dozens of states from the Midwest to the Atlantic.
\
The biggest companies in America are also calling for federal cap-and-trade guidance so they can install innovative air pollution equipment while maintaining their competitive edge on a balanced playing field.
\
Governments can make a difference in cleaning up the environment. Then maybe the polar bears will return just as the bald eagles have.

\
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday he will unilaterally pull New Jersey out of a 10-state climate change reduction agreement, giving heart to conservatives who tried -- and failed -- to force the same action in Delaware.
\
Christie's decision is the first successful blow against the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, designed to cap carbon emissions from power generators and establish a trading system where those below the cap sell allowances to those polluting above the limit. Some profits are sent back to participating states to fund energy conservation programs.
\
The agreement was designed to limit the harmful health impacts of pollution from older power plants contributing to global warming, said Bill Zak, a Lewes resident and a member of Citizens for Clean Power.
\
If the initiative is weakened, ""the effect is pretty profound,"" Zak said. ""It essentially gives no incentive to fossil-fuel generators to do anything to adjust or modify their past behaviors.""
\
Christie said the program was a failure and a burden on electricity consumers.
\
""RGGI is nothing more than a tax on electricity, a tax on our residents and on businesses with no discernible effect on our environment,"" he said. ""We remain completely committed to the idea that we have a responsibility to make the environment of our state and world better. We're not going to do it by participating in gimmicky programs that don't work.""
\
That has been a dominant theme in conservative Republican policy discussions for the last two years.
\
After defeating a plan for a national cap-and-trade system in Congress last year, conservatives set their sights this year on the similar, smaller-scale program that was enacted by Northeastern state legislatures. Delaware entered in 2008.
\
Collin O'Mara, Delaware's natural resources secretary, said the program ""has made a positive impact in Delaware by focusing attention on the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and driving clean energy investments that save residents and businesses money.""
\
As a low-lying coastal state, Delaware is especially vulnerable to climate change, he said.
\
The program has raised $860.9 million among the 10 states. Delaware received $7.4 million last year, and $21.3 million since 2008.
\
Sixty-five percent of the money in Delaware goes toward the Sustainable Energy Utility, a not-for-profit program designed to encourage energy efficiency and small-scale-renewables among businesses, governments and homes.
\
The rest was split between weatherization, fuel assistance and greenhouse gas reduction programs run by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.
\
Efforts to remove Delaware from the pact have so far been unsuccessful. The House Energy Committee voted 4-3 earlier this month to defeat a bill that would have pulled Delaware from the agreement, as conservatives claimed the system was intrusive and raised electricity prices at a time customers can't afford it.
\
Delmarva Power customers pay an average of 38 cents a month for the program, reports RGGI Inc., the nonprofit group implementing the initiative. That premium represents the higher price Delmarva Power pays for electricity from plants that are required to buy the allowances.
\
Rep. John Kowalko, the Democratic chairman of the House Energy Committee, on Thursday called Christie an ""environmental Neanderthal,"" and said he supports the program because it takes the first step in putting a price on carbon emissions.
\
New Jersey's decision has no impact on Delaware's commitment to its membership, said Brian Selander, spokesman for Gov. Jack Markell.
\
""The decision reduces the size of the 'R' in RGGI but doesn't reduce the sound science behind it,"" he said.
\
John Byrne, the co-chairman of the SEU, called Christie's move unfortunate, but said it wouldn't affect the amount of money Delaware received under the program, or the willingness of the remaining states to stay in.
\
Christie's move will embolden Delaware opponents of the initiative to push forward, said David Stevenson, director of the Center for Energy Competitiveness at the Caesar Rodney Institute. That group was a vocal supporter of this year's bill, sponsored by Rep. Harold Peterman, R-Milford.
\
""It took some guts for Christie to do it,"" Stevenson said, noting the New Jersey governor is giving up funding he was using to help balance his state's budget.
\
Supporters of the initiative say that by doing that, Christie was already acting contrary to the spirit of the program, which was to use the money for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.
\
Stevenson predicted more states will drop out, and by next year, opposition to the pact will grow in the Delaware General Assembly. ""Do we really want to be the last ones carrying the water?"" Stevenson said.
\
The initiative has been successful in putting a price on carbon emissions, and in funding state programs designed to reduce electricity demand, said Brian Yerger, president of the Wilmington alternative-energy consulting firm AERCA Advisors.
\
But environmentalists are losing the argument because of the failure of scientists to forcefully defend their findings that human activity is driving climate change, he said.
\
John Nichols, a citizen activist who opposes the initiative, called Christie's decision good news for New Jersey but bad news for Delaware, since he expects it will drive down electricity prices in New Jersey, diminishing Delaware's competitive advantage.
\
The pact includes New Jersey, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Delaware and Maryland.

\
The two men stalked back and forth, like zoo animals glaring at each other from separate cages.
\
The edge of a concrete curb served as their fence. As they paced, they traded insults across the divide.
\
""You are a piece of American trash,"" shouted Ryan Stevenson, holding a megaphone in one hand and a homemade ""Just say no to Christine O"" poster in the other. ""Did you brush your teeth this morning? They have plaque on them. I can smell your breath from here.""
\
Across from him, the man with a Christine O'Donnell yard sign, who would not give his name, responded: ""Too bad Obamacare won't help me. I'll be paying for your health care so you can get all the diseases you want. Tell your African president to go back to Kenya where he came from.""
\
For close to 10 minutes, the two shouted at each other from close range.
\
Raw is a strange political emotion for Delaware.
\
Once defined by a preference for moderates like Mike Castle, O'Donnell's primary opponent, Delaware's political landscape has grown as polarized this election cycle as it has in the rest of the country.
\
""The gentleman's way of political discourse in this state has taken a vacation,"" said Don Mell, a Republican strategist and Castle ally. ""If it continues that way, we've lost the civility that's marked this state's politics for decades.""
\
This Thursday, candidates are expected in Georgetown for a uniquely Delaware celebration. Held for decades a day or two after a major election, Return Day brings together foes who have fought for weeks. With the rancor of the campaign trail behind them, winners and losers climb into the same carriage and parade through the streets of Georgetown. The event's ""burying of the hatchet"" is a quaint reminder that Delaware is too small for entrenched enemies. After the votes are cast, candidates and their constituencies are supposed to work together.
\
But this year, Delaware's congressional races match candidates with little in
\
On the campaign trail and on the airwaves, all four have labeled their opponent as foolish or even dangerous. Whispers about Return Day no-shows are growing.
\
Rhett Ruggerio, a former Democratic National Committee member and a Delaware political campaign veteran, predicts the dawn of a new era in politics -- in his eyes, the death of the Delaware Way.
\
""If you're a candidate and you're running, you better be on the left or the right,"" Ruggerio said. ""Moderates don't have activists. You don't see people running around with picket signs saying, 'I'm a moderate.'""
\
While most voters remain in the middle, the extremes have commandeered the debate, said Ruggerio, a self-described progressive Democrat.
\
""The signs were there for everyone to see this coming,"" he said. ""And no one saw them.""
\
'Now it's here'
\
Democrats and President Barack Obama surged to power in 2008 promising unity and post-partisan politics. But a toxic brew of mortgage failures, foreclosures, unemployment, terrorism and wars overseas have hardened the extremes.
\
There was a fervent backlash against Obama's agenda, especially when stimulus relief didn't sustain promised job growth and health care reform landed with a nearly $1 trillion price tag over a decade. The Congressional Budget Office expects the reform plan to reduce deficits, but the act's thousands of pages contributed to a sense of overreaching bureaucracy.
\
Democrats contributed to the rancor, said G. Terry Madonna, a pollster at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.
\
""Liberals and conservatives are about as far apart as they've ever been,"" said Madonna, who holds a political history doctorate from the University of Delaware. ""Neither party has any commitment to bipartisanship. That's why guys like Mike Castle and [Democratic Pennsylvania Sen.] Arlen Specter are political history. The men in the middle are gone.""
\
Nationwide, Democrats have mobilized against the conservative swell, dispatching Obama to partisan crowds in big cities and college towns. On the campaign trail -- including during his stop in Wilmington earlier this month -- the president has repeated a metaphor that accuses Republicans of driving the country into a ditch, a far cry from post-partisan ideals.
\
""That even polarizes the environment more,"" Madonna said. ""There's not going to be any sainthood bestowed on candidates on either side this year.""
\
In Delaware, Republican congressional candidates portray Democratic counterparts as socialist or communist. Democrats responded by branding Republicans as right-wing zealots. A recent Delaware Democratic Party mailer features a photo of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and some form of the words extreme or right-wing six times.
\
""Fight to preserve the Delaware Way,"" the slogan-filled mailer exhorts.
\
""You see it in New Jersey, you see it in Maryland, you see it in Pennsylvania, but you never saw that in Delaware,"" Ruggerio said. ""Now it's here. ... And unfortunately, you have to fight fire with fire. You say they attacked, so we have to respond.""
\
Beginnings of rancor
\
Castle, a former governor, wore his moderate label proudly and successfully for 18 years in Congress, the embodiment of Delaware's centrist politics.
\
But when he lost the Republican primary to O'Donnell in September, he joined a list of moderates around the country who were ousted by more polarizing primary opponents, among them Specter, a former Republican who joined the Democrats, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
\
Castle struggles to pinpoint when it became a ""not good time to have that track record"" and the rhetoric shifted to its current extremes.
\
A few key moments come to mind. The election of President Obama. The bailouts. The health care town hall meetings and the ""lady in red.""
\
In the summer of 2009, Castle scheduled a health care meeting in each of the state's three counties. Castle said he wished to do what he does when discussing a bill with his staff: Hear all sides of the argument and then consider a decision, something he often wouldn't reach until right before voting.
\
For a panel to answer residents' questions at a senior center in Sussex County, Castle assembled experts such as Kenneth Bock, who read several position papers on the topic to prepare his presentation.
\
""We never got to that point. None of us got to speak,"" recalled Bock, deputy director at CHEER, a nonprofit serving seniors in Sussex County.
\
Instead, audience members expressed outrage over Castle siding -- or even considering cooperation -- with Democrats on issues like health care and cap-and-trade, a measure aimed at controlling carbon emissions not unlike a successful program Delaware has used to reduce harmful mercury emissions.
\
When the meeting veered into a spontaneous recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, one man yelled at Castle, ""You probably don't even know it.""
\
The episode might have slipped into obscurity.
\
Except someone in the audience captured the exchange on video and posted it to YouTube.
\
When Castle called on ""the lady in red,"" she stood and ranted about Obama's birth certificate.
\
The woman uttered what has become a tea party rallying cry: ""I want my country back.""
\
The birther conspiracy
\
So-called birthers suggest Obama was born in Kenya, the home of his father, or is a citizen of Indonesia and therefore not a naturalized citizen and not qualified, under Article Two of the U.S. Constitution, to be president of the United States.
\
For birthers, it doesn't matter that Obama's birthplace is Hawaii, where two state newspapers published the announcement of his birth in a local hospital. Hawaii's governor, a Republican, confirms Obama's birthplace.
\
Castle said he had never even heard the birther conspiracy before the woman in red confronted him in Sussex County.
\
""The only person's birth certificate I've ever seen is my own, for God's sake,"" Castle said. ""It just seemed unreasonable to me ... which made me start to realize there was some resentment building up about him.""
\
What stunned Castle, Bock and the panelists more was the reaction from the rest of the room. The cheering for the unknown woman. And the booing when Castle tried to restore order by defending the president's American citizenship.
\
""This was almost like a precursor to what ended up happening across the country with the town hall meetings,"" Bock said. ""I don't think anyone expected that at the time.""
\
Images of the forum and the woman in red's outburst spread, and as the summer continued, similar scenes became common.
\
On Aug. 11, 2009, a man stood nose-to-nose with Specter, a moderate from Pennsylvania, on live national television and called him ""crooked."" A woman at the same meeting warned he had ""awakened a sleeping giant.""
\
On Aug. 18, 2009, liberal Democrat Barney Frank of Massachusetts compared a discussion with one constituent to ""arguing with a dining room table"" after she asked why he supported a ""Nazi policy"" while holding a picture of Obama made to look like Adolf Hitler.
\
Signs of divide
\
The woman whose YouTube video appeared to embolden others remained unknown to the world, but people in Sussex County knew her well. She was 55-year-old Eileen McLaughlin of Millsboro.
\
Most knew her as the frequent local talk-radio caller and self-professed prophet who once predicted on air that 2009 would bring Hillary Clinton to the presidency and peace and harmony to all mankind.
\
WGMD host Jared Morris, a frequent target of hers, revealed the secret to the world by posting his own video of her unintelligible radio rants.
\
""With Castle, that was almost a moment of lucidity,"" Morris said. ""It was almost a feeling of, 'We hate Mike Castle. We hate where the country is going, and it didn't much matter who the messenger was.' ""
\
Some peg it as the first public sign of the divide, when the environment for moderates became openly hostile.
\
""The demise of Mike Castle started with ... Eileen,"" said Steve Grossman, a former Castle supporter and Kent County Republican activist. ""Because he didn't talk directly to the people after that. He started managing his appearances.""
\
Castle hesitates to assign the Sussex County confrontation too much importance but won't deny its impact.
\
""I don't know if it was the moment or the cause,"" he said. ""It definitely was a factor.""
\
After that, Castle admits, he withdrew from some conservative groups. Leaders of the 9-12 Delaware Patriots -- one of the largest grass-roots conservative groups in the state -- said they invited him to multiple meetings, promising to keep the crowd under control.
\
Castle declined.
\
""We talked and couldn't find any common ground,"" Castle said. ""We decided attending one of their meetings wouldn't be productive.""
\
As soon as YouTube made her famous, McLaughlin shunned the attention. Lately, neighbors seldom see her outside, tending to her robust, overgrown rose bushes, like she did when she moved to the small ranch home several years ago.
\
Last week, there was a car in her driveway with an ""impeach him"" bumper sticker underneath the president's name. But that's as much as McLaughlin would share about politics when she answered her door, wearing red.
\
""I don't want to give any interviews,"" she said. ""I don't want to tell any stories.""
\
No regrets for Castle
\
Castle has no regrets for calling on McLaughlin, any more than he apologizes for his moderate record.
\
""It was either call on her or call on somebody else,"" Castle said. ""I don't know that it would have mattered.""
\
Most of Castle's supporters, his opponents and the congressman himself refused to draw a straight line from that moment to the extinction of moderation. That oversimplifies the answer to a cloudy question, Castle said.
\
The tidal wave had started building already, months before. McLaughlin just managed to grab the attention of the country and the state long enough to put it on notice.
\
The conservative movement in Delaware rolled forward, culminating with O'Donnell's and Urquhart's primary wins, without a speck of influence from the woman in red. McLaughlin couldn't even cast a vote for or against Castle.
\
She's a registered Democrat.
\
""Who knows what triggers a movement or triggers a reaction in people?"" Castle said. ""To this day, I still don't even know who she was.""

The EPA's consistent and compulsive attempt to pass cap-and-trade legislation through Congress, or to bypass the legislative process altogether, is nothing more than another governmental grab for further control.
\
Our perilous American economy is still in the throes of a serious recession. President Obama has, on numerous public occasions, expressed his absolute disdain for electricity generated by fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, natural gas or nuclear power. Sustainable green energy is a great supplement. But it will never fuel our economy. Trains, planes and power plants can't run on windmills or solar panels.
\
The EPA should not forget about China when talking about pollution control. Evolving into the world's greatest industrial power is their goal. China is an industrial giant. Unfortunately, they are largely unregulated by such mundane requirements to not pollute the environment. The amount of pollution produced is on a scale that is impossible to imagine. Polluting industries are largely ignored without regard for the human population. Toxic fumes and particles belch from smokestacks with no attempt at filtration or scrubbers to diminish the venomous contents. China and Japan both border the western Pacific Ocean. The prevailing winds of the jet streams drifting from West to East carry the industrial pollution from China and now the nuclear debris from Japan. With a mere 5 percent of the Earth's population and land mass, why is the EPA charging us with the responsibility and impossibility of cleaning the other 95 percent?

Mercury trading bends environment law for industry
\
The Bush's administration's plan to let industry trade mercury emissions, rather than regulate them outright under the Clean Air Act, departs from very old knowledge of mercury's toxicity. Mercury gets absorbed through the food chain into blood and tissue, and damages brains, kidneys and fetuses. States have long advised people against eating mercury-contaminated fish. Of course, birds and animals remain vulnerable.
\
Yet the administration is siding with the energy industry on this, particularly with coal-fired power plants which remain the largest identifiable source of mercury releases. These plants account for 40 percent of them.
\
The Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton years also studied mercury pollution but finally hewed to the Clean Air Act's list of hazards to be curbed, mercury specifically among them. The Bush administration is instead reclassifying mercury as a lesser pollutant to justify a cap-and-trade system.
\
A 1997 mercury study group noted in a report to Congress that because types of mercury emissions differ from plant to plant, there is no uniform control technology and so costs would vary too. But the national estimate was billions of dollars a year.
\
In 2001, industry groups sued the EPA over mercury's classification as a hazardous air pollutant.
\
Now the Bush administration is trying to paint its concessions as a regulatory innovation, while at the same time internal legal advisers acknowledge they're a stretch under the clean air law and might not survive in court.
\
It seems that under President Bush, environmental law gets bent as a substitute for a truly forward-looking national energy policy. The history of environmental cleanup in this country has been pay now or pay later. This is apparently another cost the administration is shifting to a vague future long after its tenure is past.

""By shutting down or fuel-switching our dirtiest power plants, we achieved faster emissions reductions than any other state while reducing energy bills through efficiency.""
\
Gov. Jack MarkelL
\
Delaware and some of its Northeast neighbors already have taken several long steps toward new greenhouse-gas reduction goals outlined Monday by the Obama administration.
\
""I think that it validates the approach that Delaware has taken,"" Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin O'Mara said Monday from Washington, where he was invited to attend the announcement.
\
""In many ways, the proposal mirrors what has been done here,"" O'Mara said. ""The building blocks of this proposal are improvements in plant efficiency, fuel switching and moving to clean fuels and new generation, renewable energy and energy efficiency, which are the building blocks of Delaware's strategy.""
\
Behind the Obama administration's push are concerns about both the immediate public health effect of power-plant soot and smog-forming pollutants and longer-term evidence that CO2 emissions are pushing a dangerous warming of the atmosphere likely to trigger rapid changes in climate and weather.
\
""The science is clear. The risks are clear. And the high costs of climate inaction keep piling up,"" Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy said.
\
The proposed 30 percent cut in power-plant CO2 emissions by 2030 won immediate support from Gov. Jack Markell and a wide range of interests shortly after its announcement - and equally quick criticism from some national conservative groups and industries.
\
""This is Obamacare for the environment: guaranteed to raise costs, reduce choices, and destroy an existing industry,"" the Heartland Institute, a group that describes itself as a ""free market think tank,"" said in a written statement. ""By the time EPA is finished, millions of Americans will be freezing in the dark.""
\
Delaware was a charter member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a power-plant ""cap-and-trade"" program formed by Northeast states that have seen significant CO2 reductions since 2005.
\
Some of that decrease occurred as the Great Recession took hold of the national economy, but power-plant shifts from coal and oil to natural gas also played a huge role.
\
O'Mara noted that the EPA's proposal repeatedly referred to RGGI's approach and experience, and said that Delaware is already ""very close"" to the reduction target for 2030.
\
Markell termed the proposal ""bold"" and said that it gives states ""maximum flexibility"" to develop plans that reflect local needs and priorities.
\
""By shutting down or fuel-switching our dirtiest power plants, we achieved faster emissions reductions than any other state,"" Markell said, ""while reducing energy bills through efficiency and creating opportunities for research, manufacturing and construction jobs.""
\
Joseph O. Minott, executive director of the Philadelphia-based Clean Air Council, said the EPA's move is ""without a doubt"" going to become the administration's most effective rule targeting climate change.
\
""This is a start. This is a big one,"" Minott said. ""States like Delaware are actually going to be in great shape. They already participate in RGGI, the infrastructure is already set up, and they're on top of their building codes.""
\
The Energy Department estimated Delaware's CO2 emissions at just 0.2 percent of the national total in 2012.

\
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Tom Carper is leading a small but influential group of lawmakers who want to boost funds for public transportation as part of comprehensive climate change legislation.
\
His proposal depends on adoption of a ""cap-and-trade"" program that would aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions and create pollution allowances that power plants and other greenhouse gas emitters could trade.
\
Carper wants the Senate's climate change bill, expected to be introduced in September, to set aside 10 percent of the allowances for sale by federal officials. The revenue would finance transit and passenger rail projects, bike paths and other public transportation initiatives.
\
A House climate change bill that passed in June would set aside only 1 percent of the allowances.
\
Congress needs to send ""the right signal"" to those planning communities, working on transit systems or building vehicles that greenhouse gas emissions from transportation sources need to be addressed, Carper said Wednesday during a forum on climate change and transportation.
\
Despite the enactment of tougher fuel efficiency standards in 1975, energy consumption increased as Americans drove more, he said. Transportation now accounts for about a third of greenhouse gas emissions. More recent attempts to reduce emissions also could be eclipsed by increased driving if nothing changes, he said.
\
""If we continue to make those same mistakes, we'll end up 20 or 30 years down the road not meeting our aggressive targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions,"" he said.
\
The forum, hosted by Congressional Quarterly and sponsored by the American Public Transportation Association, brought together public transportation policy experts and advocates to discuss the impact of the climate bill on transportation.
\
Carper and Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who is one of four co-sponsors of Carper's bill, were keynote speakers. Like Carper, the co-sponsors are members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, a key committee working on climate change legislation.
\
Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat who sponsored Carper's bill in the House, had pushed to increase the allowances allotted for transportation, but competing interests prevailed, said Blumenauer's aide, Janine Benner.
\
The House bill is designed to reduce carbon emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and by more than 80 percent below those levels by 2050. The bill would cap emissions from sources such as utilities and oil refiners starting in 2012.
\
It also would invest in energy efficiency and promote renewable energy by requiring retail electricity suppliers to meet more of their energy needs with wind, biomass, geothermal and other renewable sources.

\
A federal appeals court has sided with more than a dozen states, including Delaware, in striking down a Bush administration effort to exclude power plants from the mercury pollution control requirements of the Clean Air Act.
\
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia declared that the Environmental Protection Agency wrongly ducked the Clean Air Act and Congressional mandates with mercury rules issued in 2005. Those rules would have capped mercury emissions while allowing power plants to trade credits for mercury releases, keeping pollution levels higher than the law would allow.
\
Delaware already has adopted rules tougher than the ones the EPA tried to sidestep. But Frank O'Donnell, with the environmental group Clean Air Watch, said the decision could bring new force to a proposal by Delaware Democratic Sen. Tom Carper to require the most-stringent mercury controls available for power plants nationwide.
\
Carper said in a written statement that he applauded the court's ruling, and said the EPA's own analysis found that plants could drastically reduce mercury emissions using current methods.
\
""There is no reason our nation's waterways should continue to be polluted with mercury emissions from power plants. There is no reason mothers should be concerned about the impacts their diet will have on their unborn children,"" Carper said. ""Put simply, making deep cuts in our nation's mercury emissions is financially feasible, technologically practical and absolutely necessary to protect American lives.""
\
Much of the mercury released to the environment in the United States comes from the smokestacks of coal-burning power plants, which release about 48 tons of mercury into the air annually. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin, and accumulates in the food chain. It poses a special risk to pregnant women and very young children. Mercury pollution is a factor in fish consumption warnings in dozens of states, including Delaware.
\
The EPA found that 6 percent of American women of child-bearing age have blood mercury levels high enough to threaten their unborn children. Other studies have found that mercury could increase the risk of heart and nervous system problems.
\
Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control approved mercury control rules tougher than the EPA's in late 2006. The state also joined a challenge to the EPA's cap and trade plan filed by New Jersey and eventually joined by 12 other states as well as Indian tribes and environmental groups.
\
""Coal company claims of 'clean coal' will now be put to the test,"" said Alice McKeown, coal analyst for the Sierra Club. ""These mercury pollution reductions will be an important trial run to see if coal is still viable in a cleaner energy future.""
\
Scott Segal, who directs the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, said in a written statement that the case actually causes uncertainty and delay in developing a national mercury rule. He said the industry group believes that the court ruling focused more on procedural issues, while not criticizing the EPA's pollution control approach.

\
State regulators are on the brink of ordering historic new controls on power plant emissions.
\
The new rules would sharply reduce allowable pollution in smokestacks, with maximum allowable sulfur dioxide releases falling by nearly 87 percent in 2012 and nitrogen oxides capped at 76 percent of current maximums.
\
The proposed regulations, poised to be adopted next month, have drawn unusually broad support from citizen and environmental groups, including critics of past efforts of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, fine dust and mercury.
\
""What DNREC has done is good, especially on mercury, and we thought that, under the circumstances, we wanted to support it fully as the first major cleanup in 50 years,"" said William T. Zak, a founder of Citizens for Clean Power. ""There's room to improve. Our feeling is, to water it down any further clearly would be a major concession to industry.""
\
Industry groups and some economic development advocates are less supportive. NRG Energy, owner of the Indian River power plant, cautioned in August that DNREC's timetables for compliance were unworkable. The company also said that its own pollution control plan would cost $330 million but still fail to meet the proposed state plan.
\
""The utilities have reported that the costs of making upgrades to comply with the new regulation will be very expensive and these costs will invariably flow to the consumer,"" Central Delaware Economic Development Council Director Daniel Wolfensberger wrote earlier this year. ""Additionally, we may lose generating capacity on the Delmarva Peninsula due to the possible shutdown of power plants.""
\
Power plants account for about two thirds of all sulfur dioxide releases and 16 percent of nitrogen oxides -- pollutants that cause acid rain, smog and water pollution.
\
About 77 percent of all mercury pollution originates in burners at the six coal-fired boilers. Mercury can accumulate in fish and the environment, potentially affecting development and the nervous system of people who eat fish contaminated with the metal.
\
City of Dover officials have warned that the new regulations could force a shutdown of the aging, oil-fired McKee Run Power Plant. Some industry organizations predicted similar risks for the Edge Moor power plant in east Wilmington and the NRG Energy Indian River power plant near Mills.
\
""This is perhaps the most historic regulation of any of our careers,"" said James D. Werner, director of air and waste management for DNREC. ""The commitment to clean up these old power plants was in essence made nearly a generation ago.""
\
Werner said DNREC also is pushing for new pollution limits on large industrial boilers at Valero's Delaware City Refinery, which account for more than 21 percent of total nitrogen oxide releases from industrial sites in New Castle County.
\
DNREC took three days of public testimony on the regulations last month, with the heaviest turnout reported in Sussex County, home to NRG's Millsboro plant. Indian River produces more toxic pollution than any other site in Delaware, and ranks among the nation's dirtiest generating plants.
\
State officials want to avoid federal rules that would give plants the right to buy or sell mercury pollution ""credits."" Under those regulations, if a company sends out less pollution than its permits allow, owners can sell the unused portion in the form of a credit to companies that are producing excessive amounts. Combined releases for all companies are capped, with the total slowly decreased.
\
In theory, the cap-and-trade system eventually will force all companies to install pollution control systems, replace equipment or shut down if they are unable to operate at cleaner levels. Scientists have credited the ""air markets"" trading system with helping to steadily reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain.
\
But DNREC Air Quality Management Administrator Ali Mirzakhalili bluntly noted that Delaware ""doesn't trade in neurotoxins.""
\
DNREC Secretary John A. Hughes must approve the state's alternative by Nov. 17 to head off the less stringent federal emissions rules.
\
""Of all the issues now before us, few have the potential to make Delaware healthier,"" Alan Muller, with the environmental group Green Delaware, said recently. ""And few are more powerfully opposed by special interests.""
\
Mirzakhalili said the DNREC proposals were ""highly cost-effective"" and comparable to those already in place in surrounding states.
\
""The main point of our rule is that it's designed to achieve actual reductions and see that controls are installed at every unit at a power plant, so that it can provide electricity while meeting Clean Air Act requirements and being environmentally less polluting,"" Mirzakhalili said.

\
Sen. Tom Carper on Friday criticized President Bush's plan to cut air pollution over the next 13 years, saying it does not go ""far enough, fast enough"" to make a difference.
\
Carper pushed his own pollution-cutting proposal as the best way to update the Clean Air Act of 1970.
\
""If we take reasonable steps now, we can avoid a crisis in the future,"" said Carper, speaking at Fox Point State Park with a pair of electricity-producing plants as a backdrop. ""The health benefits are 10-fold greater than the cost of the changes to the utilities.""
\
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is set to debate the Bush plan next week. Carper is the senior Democrat on the committee's clean-air subcommittee.
\
Bush has said his plan would reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by about 70 percent over 15 years by setting limits on the overall level of pollution allowed from power plants. The measure would encourage utilities to reduce pollution by allowing clean-energy companies to sell ""credits"" to dirtier plants.
\
Some environmentalists favor a tougher approach by forcing utilities to meet stricter emissions standards within six years.
\
Carper said his more moderate proposal, called the ""Clean Air Planning Act,"" would cut sulfur dioxide emissions 80 percent in 13 years, cut nitrogen oxide 66 percent in 10 years and mercury by 67 percent in 10 years.
\
Carper said his plan would use the same ""cap and trade"" incentive in the Bush plan but also reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Bush's plan does not address carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.
\
Carper joked Friday that a little global warming might be a good thing, as he stood with several environmental activists and the media on the cold and blustery banks of the Delaware River.
\
Dick Fleming, a board member of the Delaware Nature Society, called Bush's plan ""a distinct step backwards"" that will weaken the current federal laws on air pollution. Fleming, Carper and others said the Clean Air Act of 1970, along with an update in 1990, has been a great success in cutting air pollution nationwide.
\
Frank O'Donnell, president of the nonpartisan environmental group Clean Air Watch, praised Carper's work in reducing air pollution. He said Carper is the single most important senator on the issue of air pollution right now because of his efforts to negotiate a compromise between the opposing camps.
\
But O'Donnell had quite the opposite reaction when Carper introduced his proposal two years ago. As a member of a different environmental organization, he said then: ""His misguided legislation would undermine the Clean Air Act and do nothing but encourage the Bush administration to continue its efforts to gut the law.""
\
O'Donnell said Friday he was articulating the position of a group, Clean Air Trust, which he left a year ago because of differences with its leadership.
\
Conectiv, which operates the two power plants Carper used as a backdrop Friday, supports Bush's Clear Skies Initiative.
\
The company's Edgemoor plant produces 705 megawatts of electricity using low-sulfur coal. The Hay Road plant produces 1,100 megawatts of electricity by using cleaner-burning natural gas and oil. It also uses ""combined cycle technology,"" which generates electricity by reusing steam that would otherwise be wasted, spokesman Tim Brown said.
\
""We think [the Clear Skies Initiative] is the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions,"" Brown said. ""We're also sensitive to the costs of trying to go too far, too fast.""
\
The National Association of Manufacturers, an industrial trade organization, said Bush's plan gives businesses the flexibility they need to pursue the best anti-pollution measures possible.

Just like in the Wizard of Oz, the curtain was torn back and leading proponents of anthropogenic (people-caused) global warming have been caught lying
\
Called Climategate, the scandal exposes the global warming shysters who are conning the public into a massive restructuring of the global economy, while attempting to silence any dissent. But don't expect to see this in our mainstream media, because they are the spinsters who promote this manipulation of data and propaganda.
\
It all began when an anonymous person hacked into the computers at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit in England, releasing 61 megabytes of confidential files, including 1079 e-mails and 72 documents onto the Internet. These files are a wealth of information.
\
The most damning indictment of proponents of global warming hysteria is a long series of communications discussing how best to squeeze dissenting scientists out of the peer review process. The e-mails even included fantasies of violence against those who question anthropogenic global warming. These e-mails show disturbing patterns of ""conspiracy, collusion in exaggerating warming data, possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing information, organized resistance to disclosure, manipulation of data, private admissions of flaws in their public claims and much more,"" says Australian Sun's Andrew Bolt.
\
Man-made global warming hysteria has long been fueled by people using junk science, fear and hyperbole to support an agenda that they personally profit from. As they attempt to lead the world into a green revolution, these propagandists are hiding the truth that the average global temperature has fallen since 1998.
\
The leading profiteering propagandist is Al Gore. After losing the presidential election in 2000, Al Gore became the leader of the hysteria movement. However, this ""Eco-Prophet"" has hidden a few inconvenient truths of his own. He just happens to be involved with a venture capital firm that has invested approximately a billion dollars in green companies that stand to make a bundle if Cap-and-Trade becomes law.
\
Reports state that Gore's net worth now stands at $100 Million, when it was $2 million when he left politics. He's laughing all the way to the bank.
\
Al Gore has a history of playing loose with the facts.
\
Recently on TV, while discussing geothermal energy, Al Gore made the outrageous claim that ""the interior of the earth is extremely hot, several million degrees."" However, the actual temperature here on earth is between 5,000 and 9,000 degrees. This is a gaffe that if Sarah Palin had made, the media would ridicule as her stupid.
\
Speaking of hypocrisy, Al Gore is a living embodiment of it. As he lectures the world on energy use, and lobbies Congress to regulate productive American companies out of business, Gore consumes more than twenty times more energy than the average American, according to the Tennessee Center for Policy Research. This doesn't count the energy consumption of his jet.
\
Gore's ""Inconvenient Truth"" is full of instances where he plays loose with the facts. A 2007 British court ruled that Gore's film has nine significant refutable errors. These are examples of Gore's scare tactics to induce the public to take radical action (to his financial benefit).
\
Not only is Gore prone to hyperbole, hypocrisy and blatant distortions, he is also a bully. Professor Richard Lindzen of MIT wrote about scientists being ""in the crosshairs"" of Gore, who ""tried to bully"" them into changing ""their views and supporting his climate alarmism."" Lindzen also refers to a failed Gore effort to ""enlist Ted Koppel (then a TV host) in a witch hunt to discredit anti-alarmist scientists.""
\
When one side tries to shut another side out of the debate, it is typically because they feel their arguments won't stand up to scrutiny.
\
These propagandists use various tactics. A favorite is to make people feel guilty if they don't jump on the ""green"" bandwagon, and those who do are praised for helping the environment.
\
With the Copenhagen meetings just around the corner, expect to see ""green"" propaganda exponentially increasing. Open your eyes to these manipulators of data and people, who while acting like do-gooders, see great (green as in money) gain.

\
Beneath the campaign rhetoric are fundamental differences in how the presidential candidates would respond to the economic crisis and problems such as food safety, environmental degradation and global warming.
\
The Republican ticket of Sen. John McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Plain characterize the current crisis as greed and corruption on Wall Street. This is a law enforcement model that treats the problem as a few bad actors who might be charged under existing criminal and regulatory laws, as was executive Ken Lay of Enron.
\
The Democratic rhetoric sees the problem as systemic failure requiring increased disclosure to better inform investors, as well as tougher liquidity and capital standards for financial institutions.
\
Most important, Barack Obama and Joe Biden would extend regulation to unregulated entities such as hedge funds and derivative dealers that package credit default swaps.
\
The current crisis is but one example of unrestrained belief in the benefits of deregulation and self-regulation. Over the last eight years, the Bush administration has embarked on a deregulation frenzy that continues in the twilight of its reign. Officials at the Interior Department are racing to approve midnight rules to allow mining companies to dump mining waste into streams before the new administration begins. Important regulatory protections to reduce the risk of abuse have been repealed.
\
Bad advice
\
In 2000, based on the advice of then Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Congress pre-empted state laws prohibiting bets on defaults, such as credit default swaps, which now exceed $50 billion. They are exempt from disclosure laws and reserve requirements that remain unregulated even today.
\
In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission permitted investment banks to police their own compliance with capital requirements.
\
Similarly, the administration slashed the number of Food and Drug Administration inspectors and instituted a policy of self-regulation by chicken and beef producers.
\
McCain's full strategy is more nuanced than the rhetoric of corruption or greed. Recently he has also discussed tougher capital and disclosure requirements for financial institutions in a general way, and suggested shareholder limits on executive compensation.
\
In 2003, he proposed a cap on greenhouse gases with a system of trading allowances for those that exceeded their cap. Now he is retrenching on a mandatory cap and trade approach and suggests only a voluntary system of targets.
\
McCain was a Senate leader of the deregulation effort. His instincts, like President Bush's, have been to deregulate and let industry self-regulate.
\
However, the leader of deregulation at the SEC, Chairman Christopher Cox, two weeks ago finally confessed voluntary regulation did not work. And Greenspan announced this past week that he was shocked to learn that his model of self-regulation is flawed.
\
All but a few ideologues realize that successful capitalism requires a basic regulatory framework to minimize corruption and channel behavior, just as traffic laws reduce accidents and federally funded highways help create an efficient transportation system.
\
Excessive and wasteful regulation is always a danger against which we must be vigilant. But the current administration has posed a false choice of minimal regulation that is all too frequently not enforced and excessive regulation that encumbers entrepreneurship.
\
Capitalism actually requires a level of regulation to function smoothly, reward the efficient, and discourage deception and abusive behavior.
\
Transparency of corporate financial information based on uniform accounting standards is necessary for credit markets to operate smoothly and for investors to trust security markets. Trust has broken down because no one knows how to value unregulated credit default swaps that essentially insure packaged loans that are themselves of unknown value.
\
Actual inspection of the food supply is necessary to assure consumers that their food is safe to eat.
\
What we need out of the next administration, whoever it may be, is smart regulation, not self-regulation or dumb over-regulation. We need a regulatory system that supports and polices capital markets, promotes the safety of our food supply and protects the environment from degradation.

WASHINGTON -- Earlier this month, a draft memo surfaced from the Homeland Security Department suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency. Most disturbing was the stated rationale. This was being proposed ""in the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform."" In other words, because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, they will legislate it themselves.
\
Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate. Administrators administer the law, they don't change it. That's the legislators' job.
\
When questioned, the White House downplayed the toxic memo, leaving the impression that it was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland Security. But the administration is engaged in an even more significant power play elsewhere.
\
A 2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they threaten human health and the environment. The Obama EPA made precisely that finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The Washington Post, sending ""a message to Congress.""
\
It was not a terribly subtle message: Enact cap-and-trade legislation -- taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based energy -- or the EPA will do so unilaterally. As Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch noted, such a finding ""is likely to help light a fire under Congress to get moving.""
\
Well, Congress didn't. Despite the ""regulatory cudgel"" (to again quote the Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly refused to acquiesce.
\
Good for the Senate. But what to do when the executive is passively aggressive rather than actively so? Take border security. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., reports that President Obama told him about pressure from his political left and its concern that if the border is secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform (i.e., amnesty). Indeed, Homeland Security's abandonment of the ""virtual fence"" on the southern border, combined with its lack of interest in completing the real fence that today covers only one-third of the border, gives the distinct impression that serious border enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican quid pro quo on comprehensive reform.
\
But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for legislative favors. It is, as the administration vociferously argued in court in the Arizona case, the federal executive's constitutional responsibility. Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. Non-execution is a dereliction of duty.
\
This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal government or to Democrats. In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has just issued a ruling allowing police to ask about one's immigration status when stopped for some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment.
\
Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect. If police latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to be expanded, that's an issue for the legislature, not the executive.
\
How did we get here? I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.) The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned the heads of the country's nine largest banks and informed them that henceforth the federal government was their business partner. The banks were under no legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal government, when crossed, to cause you trouble, endless trouble. They complied.
\
So did BP when the president summoned its top executives to the White House to demand a $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages. Existing law capped damages at $75 million. BP, like the banks, understood the power of the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was.
\
Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was), and still be troubled by how we got there. Everyone wants energy in the executive (as Alexander Hamilton called it). But not lawlessness. In the modern welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That's bad enough. But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the separation of powers. Such constraints on your life must first be approved by both houses of Congress.
\
That's called the consent of the governed. The constitutional order is meant to subject you to the will of the people's representatives, not to the whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking bureaucrat.

It's hard to believe that more than five years have passed since Gov. Jack Markell had the crazy idea of appointing a 29-year-old kid to serve as the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary. Reflecting back upon my tenure since my first scrapple at Jimmy's and crabcakes at Sambo's, I am proud of the progress that we have made together, yet ever mindful of the work still to do.
\
While implementing the governor's vision, I have fallen in love with every inch of Delaware. From the ecological diversity of the bayshore and meandering waterways of the Inland Bays to the historical richness of the Brandywine Valley and the tranquil serenity of the Nanticoke, natural wonders permeate every corner of our state. This beauty is matched only by the overwhelming kindness and humbling generosity that Delawareans across the state have shown my family since we arrived.
\
My love for the First State has only deepened since the birth of my 2-year-old daughter. Experiencing Delaware's extraordinary places anew through Riley's eyes constantly reinforces how blessed we are to live here. Watching her flip over horseshoe crabs in distress, run along the new boardwalk of the Gordon's Pond trail, spot an osprey or heron overhead, or splash around in the Brandywine reminds me of our sacred obligation to bestow a healthier planet to the next generation.
\
It has been a privilege to lead the inspiring team at DNREC. Working with numerous partners, we have reduced air pollution more than any other state. We shut down, fuel-switched or replaced the dirtiest local power plants and led the regional push to require our neighboring upwind states to reduce emissions.
\
We've increased solar deployment 30-fold to 60 megawatts, passed some of the nation's most innovative energy efficiency legislation, adopted energy building codes that will save millions of dollars, and spurred more than $100 million in efficiency upgrades with the Sustainable Energy Utility.
\
We led the charge to modernize the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative's cap-and-trade program, creating a national model for complying with EPA's proposed rule for curbing carbon pollution from power plants.
\
We've moved Delaware from a regional laggard to a national leader in recycling by providing universal access to curbside recycling. We've cleaned up dozens of contaminated sites, strengthened laws governing polluter liability and helped revitalize blighted areas. We've modernized regulations about stormwater management and on-site wastewater systems and financed more than $150 million in water infrastructure upgrades.
\
We've invested in the natural resources that serve as the foundation of our multi-billion dollar tourism economy. We launched the Delaware Bayshore Initiative, which builds upon Delaware's conservation legacy and Gov. Russell Peterson's Coastal Zone Act, to conserve and restore thousands of acres of world-class wildlife habitat, expand access to low-impact recreation experiences, and strengthen communities from New Castle to Lewes.
\
We've expanded Delaware's trail network through the Governor's First State Trails and Pathways Initiative and now rank among the nation's most bikable and walkable states. We helped establish the First State National Historic Monument and are breathing new life into Auburn Heights/NVF and Fort DuPont.
\
Through our Children in Nature/No Child Left Inside campaign, we are exposing more children to the outdoors, creating more close-to-home recreational opportunities, and expanding environmental education.
\
And, possibly most significant for Delaware's future, we've led a statewide effort to analyze the science, develop policy recommendations and implement projects rebuilding dikes, dams, impoundments, beaches, wetlands and living shorelines that are improving the state's preparedness for extreme weather and resilience to sea level rise and other climate impacts.
\
Yet despite our progress, there is still much work to do. Too many Delaware children are spending more than 50 hours a week indoors in front of some type of screen, while only playing for mere minutes a day outside.
\
Far too many of our waterways do not support healthy aquatic life or are unsafe to swim. Our freshwater wetlands enjoy fewer protections than those in neighboring states. Critical tourism assets, including our beaches, navigable waterways and amenities in our state parks and wildlife areas need sustained investment. And many communities remain staggeringly vulnerable to future storms.
\
Nonetheless, I remain optimistic.
\
As I start my next adventure as president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation and begin pestering all Delawareans to become members and subscribe to Ranger Rick Magazine, I will carry with me Delaware's collaborative can-do spirit.
\
I am eternally indebted to Gov. Markell and members of the General Assembly for giving me this opportunity to serve, excited that my friend and colleague David Small will lead DNREC into the future, and grateful to all Delawareans for making us part of the family. In the months ahead, I look forward to seeing everyone outdoors and continuing our work to enhance Delaware's environment.

Conservatives champion the essential characteristics of America: liberty, enterprise and ingenuity. As world leaders consider how to transform the way we make and use energy in the face of a changing climate, it's time for an energy policy true to that spirit -- and it shouldn't be anathema to the American right.
\
Conservatives have a robust tradition of principled concern for the environment. It was, after all, Teddy Roosevelt who created five national parks and signed the Antiquities Act. It was Richard Nixon who established the Environmental Protection Agency, and George H.W. Bush who ushered in one of the greatest environmental success stories, the 1990 cap-and-trade plan to take on acid rain.
\
Today, Americans of all political persuasions want to see their country on a path toward an economy powered by energy that is clean, safe, secure and stable. With climate legislation pending and a binding global treaty being negotiated, conservative leadership is critical because the only way to get the job done is with broad bipartisan agreement.
\
How can they do it? By establishing a Red-Blue-Green agenda on whose principles conservatives, Democrats and independents can all agree. Which Americans would argue against energy that meets the following principles:
\
*Freedom from national insecurity. The Western world's dependence on oil means transferring billions of dollars to nations whose interests are at odds with democratic ideals. This makes for geopolitical instability and forces the United States to compromise its role as a beacon of freedom just to secure traditional fuels.
\
*A return to economic strength. Ultimately, the question is: Which countries will lead the world to a clean-energy future -- and reap the benefits? The United States is already falling behind. It has lost its dominance in solar manufacturing and ranks 22nd in energy efficiency. The Chinese market for clean tech is forecast to grow to as much as $1 trillion per year. America cannot afford to cede new markets and the jobs they create without even trying.
\
*New employment, with lower long-term costs. Much of the U.S. debate focuses on the short-term costs associated with the transition to a clean-energy economy without considering its long-term benefits or calculating the costs of continuing business as usual. The wave of innovations around clean energy will not only create new industries and jobs but also allow businesses to have increasingly efficient -- and therefore more profitable -- operations.
\
*Cleaner, healthier communities. Republicans once played a leading role in cleaning up our air and water, and conservatives of all stripes should champion that role again. The manufacturing booms that built cities such as Detroit and Cleveland left environmental degradation in their wake. Good climate legislation will bring jobs back to hard-hit areas, but this time factories will not pollute the groundwater or make the air unsafe to breathe.
\
*Competition trumps regulation. A sensible clean-energy policy should free, rather than constrain, markets. Smart policy corrects market failures and provides certainty, stimulating investment in the technology and infrastructure necessary to build an economy based on clean energy. Washington must ensure that such investment will be rewarded. The government shouldn't ""pick winners"" -- it should unleash competition, ensuring that the cleanest businesses thrive and the dirtiest are held accountable. A well-crafted federal law to limit pollution is better than unfettered regulation by the EPA or ever-changing regulation by the states.
\
The seeds of these opportunities have already been planted. And companies that have taken the lead are prospering. At News Corporation, we have saved millions by becoming more energy-efficient, overhauling a range of systems from the production of such shows as ""American Idol"" and ""24"" to energy usage in our buildings around the world. This has yielded savings that help us invest more in talent and has inspired us to look for further opportunities to improve.
\
You do not need to believe that all climate science is settled or every prediction or model is perfect to understand the benefits of limiting pollution and transforming our energy policies -- as a gradually declining cap on carbon pollution would do. This is the moment to champion policies that yield new industries, healthy competition, cleaner air and water, freedom from petroleum politics and reduced costs for businesses.
\
Through market-based incentives we can achieve clean energy at the lowest cost and with the strongest incentives for innovation -- ensuring that the energy solution will help, not harm, the economy. Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., get this and are working across party lines to build support for new legislation. Previously conservation-minded conservatives are missing in the heated partisanship of today's politics. It's time they found their voice again.

\
Mounting pressure for clear national greenhouse-gas controls could soon overshadow regional efforts -- including Delaware's -- as supporters step up calls for congressional action ahead of a global conference in December.
\
Behind the burst of activity are concerns that the United States could again sacrifice a leadership role in the climate-change negotiations despite growing certainty about the risks and links to pollution.
\
""It's generally understood that, until the major, developing countries see the United States stepping up to the plate, they themselves will not step up to the plate,"" said Manik Roy, with the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.
\
""This has been recognized for a while. What's different now is, we have a president who is strongly committed to enacting a law that would reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions and to engage constructively in international negotiations.""
\
Proposals now under discussion in Congress would go farther, faster, than the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that Delaware joined in 2005. That system requires power plants to buy credits for CO2 emissions, and will cap and reduce allowable totals in coming years, with a 10 percent cut by 2019.
\
Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who chairs a key subcommittee that will wrestle with climate-change legislation, said Thursday the Obama administration has laid out a rough blueprint calling for a 14 percent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020. By 2050, the reduction would rise to 80 percent.
\
Proceeds from sales of pollution rights to power plants and industries could be used to subsidize pollution control technologies and research, and help those disadvantaged by higher energy costs, said Carper, who supports economy-wide controls, covering transportation and other sources in addition to power plants.
\
""It's not real specific. It's sort of a blueprint, but a lot of it makes sense to me,"" Carper said, adding that the House already is considering a combined energy and climate change package. Senate leaders are discussing separate bills, envisioning an energy measure passing as early as Easter and the climate version by the August recess.
\
""It's conceivable that we'll have a bill in the House and Senate before the fall and have a chance to go to work to hammer out a compromise,"" said Carper, who already has worked for years on ""multi-pollutant"" legislation to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
\
States took initiative
\
The initiative to reduce greenhouse gases was widely seen as a response to Bush administration refusal to back comprehensive controls on carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping pollutants linked to rising global temperatures. Moving into the vacuum, New York and other states in 2007 attended the last big international conference on climate change, in Bali.
\
""We really do need a national system,"" said Tony Kreindler, with Environmental Defense Fund. ""It's incredible how closely people are paying attention now. They've been waiting a long time for U.S. leadership.""
\
Frank V. Maisano, an energy specialist with the international law firm of Bracewell & Giuliani who represents utilities, refiners and wind developers, said the timeline for federal action is not as dramatic as some argue. Potential costs to the economy, meanwhile, are uncertain but potentially high.
\
""The important thing is to get it done right, and in order to get it done right, Congress has to do its homework,"" Maisano said. ""To date, they haven't gotten into a lot of the substantive issues that they've got to get into.""
\
Maisano said the national and global recession has complicated forecasts about the impact of higher energy costs.
\
""It's important to have momentum, and they certainly will have that now with the Obama administration and increasing their majority in Congress,"" Maisano said. ""Ramming a bill through that's a bad bill probably is worse for your position going forward.""
\
Carper said former Enviornmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly recently called for an effort to pass a new version of the multi-pollutant bill if the cap-and-trade effort gets snarled. That, combined with tougher auto mileage standards and other new policies, could significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
\
""I think when your banking system is melting down and you have millions of families facing foreclosure, climate change is not on everybody's to-do list,"" Carper said.
\
He noted that he was asked on Thursday to take a Senate leadership role on the issue by by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee.

President Bush chose Delaware to underscore Wednesday his plan to curb the nation's thirst for foreign oil, calling DuPont Co.'s biofuels research ""on the leading edge of change.""
\
The visit came hours after a State of the Union address in which Bush called for a 20 percent reduction in U.S. gasoline consumption during the next 10 years. About 75 percent of that savings, he told the nation, should come from an increased use in alternate fuels, including the type of biofuels DuPont is aggressively pushing toward commercial use.
\
""We're on the verge of some unbelievable technological breakthroughs,"" Bush told a crowd of about 1,250 mostly DuPont employees during a 26-minute address at the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington.
\
""When I looked at those scientists ... and heard them say 'This is a reality, Mr. President, this is going to be something that we can live by' -- really, I got to tell you, I'm incredibly encouraged by what I saw,"" Bush said.
\
DuPont has carved out a leading role in development of ethanol and other alcohol-based fuels derived from plant cellulose -- found in grass, corn stalks, wood chips and other materials often discarded as waste. The demand for corn-based ethanol -- widely used as a gasoline additive -- has led to high prices for the grain and prompted fears of a shortage of animal feed.
\
But developing the fuel from plant cellulose, Bush said, could help dramatically increase production of ethanol, while easing competition with food supplies.
\
""At this company you've got 2,500 scientists, some of the smartest people in the country working here, all trying to develop new technology to help us solve this problem,"" Bush said.
\
The company also is developing hybrid corn that can produce more ethanol, and has partnered with energy giant BP to commercialize a next-generation alcohol-type fuel that gets more miles per gallon and is more easily transported. That fuel, biobutanol, is expected to be introduced in the United Kingdom this year.
\
Bush's visit came as debate over White House policies on energy, oil imports and climate change rises to a near-clamor.
\
""Instead of creating a real national plan to combat global warming and increase energy security, the president has ensured his legacy of failure while continuing to represent the interests of the energy industry,"" said John Passacantando, executive director of Greenpeace USA.
\
""Unfortunately, biofuels are not a panacea for America's supply problems, nor can they deliver on the much-touted promise of energy independence,"" said Charles T. Drevna, vice president of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association. In a statement issued Wednesday, the group cautioned that ""oil and natural gas will continue to serve as foundation fuels for the American economy"" for the foreseeable future.
\
However, the Union of Concerned Scientists said a big jump in alternative fuel use could drastically reduce both foreign oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions.
\
'Never looked more out of step'
\
Bush mentioned environmental concerns, including greenhouse gases -- pollutants linked to rising global temperatures and climate shifts -- several times during his speech in Wilmington.
\
But two days earlier, the White House gave a cool reception to a coalition of corporate and environmental group leaders, including DuPont's CEO Charles O. Holliday. The group, U.S. Climate Action Partnership, asked Bush to cap emissions of greenhouse gases. The group's plan recommended a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over 30 years from power plants and other industries, including auto.
\
""Speaking before a company that just endorsed mandatory carbon reductions, in a state that's part of a regional cap-and-trade program, President Bush has never looked more out of step on global warming,"" Kevin S. Curtis, senior vice president of National Environmental Trust, said in a statement.
\
""Companies like DuPont realize that limits on heat-trapping pollution are coming and they want to start planning today. By ignoring their call for leadership, the president is creating a climate of uncertainty that's as bad for business as it is for the environment,"" he said.
\
Members of Delaware's congressional delegation struck a more conciliatory note. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate's Clean Air, Climate Change & Nuclear Security subcommittee, said he urged Bush on Wednesday to consider his presidential legacy while choosing a course on climate change.
\
""I think he's gotten to the point where he realizes we have to do a bit more than study,"" Carper said, adding that Bush's comments during the State of the Union were ""about as clear as he's been"" on the risk from climate change.
\
Carper plans to introduce a new version next week of legislation to cap emissions of power plant pollutants, including carbon dioxide.
\
""I heard some things we can agree on -- like the need for energy independence and to address global warming. I hope we've gotten beyond the polemic. But the real question is -- is there the commitment behind that?"" said Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del.
\
Carper also said that he believes that the administration can go further with its goals for reducing gasoline consumption.
\
""My thought is: Twenty percent reduction in gasoline consumption by 2017 is nothing to sniff at. I don't know that I would call it ambitious enough,"" Carper said.
\
Beyond DuPont
\
Several new energy programs are already in use or in development across Delaware, Carper said, including DuPont's biofuels research, a soy biodiesel plant in Kent County, and a proposed wind farm and coal gasification power plant in Sussex County. Perdue Inc. is trying to develop diesel fuel that exploits both soybean oil and chicken fat.
\
State Sen. David Sokola, D-North Star, a DuPont employee, said that he hopes to see the administration give more attention to alternate energy supplies. Sokola, who works in the company's Center for Corporate Analytical Sciences at the DuPont Experimental Station, was one of the guests who filed into the Hotel du Pont auditorium more than an hour before the president's scheduled arrival.
\
""Any commitment by this administration toward something other than oil is a plus,"" Sokola said. He later cautioned that the administration needs to move carefully in offering incentives for new energy industries, to avoid putting promising technologies at a disadvantage. ""I think we need to keep all of the tools in the toolbox,"" Sokola said.

\
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's declaration Friday that greenhouse gases ""endanger public health and welfare"" could have a big impact in Delaware, though not where most people would think.
\
The EPA's action marks the first step toward requiring power plants, industries and automobiles to curtail their release of climate-changing pollution, especially carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.
\
""The law says if there's scientific evidence, [the EPA] must -- not can, must -- regulate that pollutant,"" said James D. Werner, director of the Delaware Division of Air and Waste Management. ""The foot-dragging ended today.""
\
Faced with the threat of regulation, many believe that Congress may be forced to develop a national policy to reduce pollution that contributes to global warming.
\
Delaware's smokestack legacy provides an obvious target for greenhouse-gas regulation, and indeed, industry and electric-power generation accounts for the largest share of carbon dioxide emissions. The U.S. Department of Energy reported this week that those sources emitted 10.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2005, or 60 percent of the state's total.
\
But such plants already fall under the four-year-old Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which Delaware and nine other states formed to control power and industrial emissions, said John Byrne, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Delaware.
\
Federal regulation would likely mirror that effort, he said.
\
Instead, the next-largest source of Delaware's carbon dioxide emissions is the cars and trucks zipping along the state's 13,000 miles of roads, including those passing through on I-95, Del. 1 and U.S. 13.
\
Transportation sources accounted for 5.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in Delaware in 2005, or almost 30 percent of the state's total.
\
""This could be very interesting,"" Byrne said. ""The cost of automobiles could be going up.""
\
Nick DiPasquale, conservation chairman of Delaware Audubon, said a ""carbon tax"" that raises the cost of high-emission sources could be an effective way of addressing the role of automobiles.
\
Such an impact could still be a few years away. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said that while the agency is prepared to move forward with regulations under the Clean Air Act, the Obama administration would prefer that Congress addressed the climate issue through ""cap-and-trade"" legislation limiting pollution that can contribute to global warming.
\
In announcing the proposed finding, Jackson said the EPA analysis ""confirms that greenhouse-gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations"" and warrants steps to curtail it.
\
The threat of dealing with climate change by regulation could spur some hesitant members of Congress to find another way to address the problem.
\
""The decision is a game changer. It now changes the playing field with respect to legislation,"" said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., whose Energy and Commerce subcommittee is crafting broad limits on greenhouse emissions. ""It's now no longer doing a bill or doing nothing. It is now a choice between regulation and legislation.""
\
Legislation could be considered by the House before the August congressional recess.
\
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee responsible for climate legislation, said the EPA's action is ""a wake-up call for Congress.""
\
Friday's action by the EPA triggered a 60-day comment period before the agency issues a final endangerment ruling. That would be followed by a proposal on how to regulate the emissions.
\
The EPA action was prompted by a Supreme Court ruling two years ago that said greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act and must be regulated if found to be a danger to human health or public welfare.
\
The Bush administration strongly opposed using the Clean Air Act to address climate change and stalled on producing the so-called ""endangerment finding"" demanded by the high court in its April 2007 ruling.
\
""The Bush administration was in pretty significant denial for a long time,"" said DiPasquale, who was secretary of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control from 1999 to 2002.
\
""There's finally a recognition that climate change is for real,"" he said.
\
Total greenhouse-gas emissions increased 1.6 percent between 2006 and 2007, according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Energy.
\
Of the six greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide is by far the most prevalent, the report shows. It made up 82.6 percent of the 7.3 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases emitted in 2007.
\
A contingent of Sussex County environmentalists has focused on the health impacts of carbon dioxide emissions, especially from the coal- and oil-powered Indian River generation plant, said William Zak, a spokesman for Citizens for Clean Power.
\
""We've lived with the health consequences of coal for 50 years,"" Zak said.
\
In 2007, state health officials found that lung cancer incidence was 30 percent above the Delaware average in the six ZIP codes around the Millsboro plant. That prompted a statewide study, which found seven other clusters.
\
Officials from NRG Energy, the New Jersey company that owns the 740-megawatt plant, could not be reached for comment about the EPA's action.
\
M.Q. Riding, spokeswoman for Conectiv Energy, said the agency's finding was expected because of the Supreme Court ruling in 2007. The company operates several electricity-generating stations in the region, including the 720-megawatt Edge Moor Power Plant near Wilmington.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative offers a good model for controlling emissions, Riding said. But it is unfair because it does not cover power companies in nearby states, she said.
\
""We've always felt that a national program for greenhouse-gas control is the best solution,"" Riding said. ""If everybody's working from the same page, then everything seems to be more consistent.""
\
Joe Rogalsky, spokesman for Gov. Jack Markell, said the EPA's action adds urgency to the governor's call to improve residents' health and the state's economy by pursuing alternative energy sources and ""green"" industries.
\
""The state's environmental health and welfare have to be at the center of our public policy debate,"" Rogalsky said.
\
In addition to carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels, the EPA finding covers five other emissions that scientists believe are warming the earth when they concentrate in the atmosphere: Methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
\
Material from the Associated Press was used in this story.

\
THE ISSUES
\
Delaware's vehicles emitted 5.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, in 2005, accounting for 30 percent of the total pollution in the state.
\
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said analysis ""confirms that greenhouse-gas pollution is a serious problem now.""
\
Friday's action likely will be followed by a plan to regulate emissions in 60 days if Congress doesn't act first.
\
In addition to CO2, the EPA finding covers methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluoro-carbons, perfluoro-carbons and sulfur hexafluoride.

Temporary work visas must be verified, and apply to many foreign countries
\
It is great The News Journal finally printed an article on the impact of temporary seasonal workers in our region. While it made some valid points, it was a little misleading.
\
For the past two years I have employed temporary workers from Central America. For 2008, my company is processing visas for returning employees that will, more than likely, not be approved due to the cap of 66,000 applicants. Our seasonal employees were scheduled to return April 1.
\
Congress - and more important the Hispanic Caucus - has blocked legislation that was in place in 2006 and 2007 that said returning workers, known as H2-R, did not count against the cap. The Hispanic Caucus is using the H2 visa program to promote immigration reform. However, H2 visas are not for immigrants. This is where Congress and the Hispanic Caucus are incorrect and misleading.
\
An immigrant is a person who comes to a country to take up permanent residence. H2 visas are for temporary workers. They are for only one specific employer for up to 10 months. Once the visas have expired, workers must return to their country of origin.
\
If a visa employee were to stop working for the allocated employer, that individual must return to the country of origin and the employer must notify the government of the resignation or termination.
\
In order for temporary workers to obtain visas, employers must provide concrete evidence to the state and federal Department of Labor and U.S. Customs and Immigration Service of their need to employ foreign temporary employees.
\
Temporary H2 visas are issued to almost all of the countries outside our borders. If you visit shore points, many employees are from eastern European countries. Some of these temporary workers are here on J-1 visas, but there are a lot of H2 visas out there too.
\
To categorize H2 visas as being for persons from Central and South America is incorrect. H2 visas are for temporary seasonal employees and mostly all countries.

Laws regarding childhood sexual abuse need change
\
Edward Smith along with James W. O'Neill, Paul Daleo and Francis DeLuca are archetypal figures, products of a clerical system that enabled and protected them. They speak to the tragic need to change all states' inadequate childhood sexual abuse statutes.
\
Known victims of these sexual predators are entitled to justice and charity, to bring such individuals and any enabling institutions into civil court.
\
People must be held responsible for their crimes as well as their sins.
\
It is just too bad that federal laws prohibit sending these depraved individuals to jail for their crimes - where rapists and child abusers belong.

Democratic Congress didn't deliver on energy
\
One of the ""Six (promises) for '06"" from Democratic congressional candidates was lower energy prices. This is a good time to review policies, proposals and results to see how Congress has fared.
\
Action: No drilling in rich coastal areas, no exploration or drilling in Alaska. Result: Commodity markets anticipate less supply; oil prices increase.
\
Action: Restrictions on coal- fired plants. Result: Less inexpensive energy, Big Coal is the new Big Oil.
\
Action: No nukes. Result: Same as above.
\
Action: Ethanol. Result: Higher ethanol, gas and food prices.
\
Action: Ethanol tariffs. Result: See above. Protectionism rules the day.
\
Action: Utilities forced to supplement energy supplies with non-fossil fuels. Result: Consumers forced to supplement incomes.
\
Action: $40 billion to subsidize boutique energy suppliers. Result: $40 billion wasted.
\
Proposed action: Suspend federal gas tax for the summer. Probable Result: Gas prices drop by 18.5 cents a gallon. Peacock-like preening.
\
Proposed action: Windfall profit tax to pay for tax suspension. Probable result: Gas prices rise by 37 cents a gallon. Finger- pointing at Big Oil.

DRBA service fee could eat up E-ZPass account
\
Regarding the service fee the Delaware River & Bay Authority imposed on E-ZPass accounts this year, $1.50 per month seems a little excessive for people who are infrequent users. If I have $25 in my account and don't use E-ZPass facilities for a year, that $1.50 removes $18 - or 75 percent of my balance. I call that excessive, especially in light of the reduced cost per vehicle to DRBA whenever an E-ZPass vehicle goes through a toll booth.

Socialist Europeans have excellent quality of life
\
The writer of a May 18 letter said that the high price Europeans pay for fuel supports ""an ever-growing socialist bureaucracy,"" which suggests a socialist bureaucracy is evil and should be avoided. I think it's fair to compare that bureaucracy with a capitalist one. Under socialist bureaucracy in Europe, citizens have health care from conception to death, while under our capitalist system about 10 percent of the population lacks health insurance protection. The infant mortality rate here is the highest of any industrialized nation.
\
In Europe, socialists have managed to raise life expectancy two to three years above that in the capitalist United States.
\
The euro is outperforming the dollar.
\
In this country, one in 10 citizens is in jail and the crime rate is 90 percent higher than in socialist Europe.
\
Capitalism has gotten us in an unwinnable war, created a national debt in the trillions and forced us into borrowing money from a Third World country, like China, which is communist.
\
We ought to be ashamed.
\
Back in the 1940s, Los Angeles had one of the best public transportation systems in the world. General Motors bought it and ran it down so that more cars could be sold.
\
U.S. auto makers came up with gas-guzzling SUVs and called them trucks so that fuel efficiency standards don't have to be met. This decision was detrimental to our economy and security. The auto industry fostered the use of trucks to move merchandise.
\
Oil companies are making obscene profits while the price of gas is going through the roof. Anyone who thinks this is OK was either born with a silver spoon in his mouth or is delusional.
\
Capitalism thrives on consumption. Therefore, it can neither encourage judicious use of natural resources nor stimulate protection of the environment, though both endeavors are essential to our survival.
\
Since this country's welfare is being adversely affected by capitalist policies and practices, maybe we should try to emulate our brothers and sisters of socialist Europe rather than ridicule them.

Horse racing fans are eager for a Triple Crown
\
There hasn't been a Triple Crown winner for more than 30 years. Every year horse racing fans are tantalized by the prospect.
\
Big Brown, the Kentucky Derby winner, just won the Preakness. On we go to the Belmont Stakes. Can the horse win the third leg of horse racing's biggest event?
\
With the catastrophes of Barbaro and Eight Belles in the minds of Americans, the industry needs a Triple Crown winner. The industry may be feeling heat from animal rights groups. The Internet generation has statistics that indicate hundreds of animals are destroyed on American tracks each year.
\
There is also controversy on whether horses are started racing too young.
\
For these reasons a Triple Crown winner will cause euphoria among an awful lot of people and may take the heat off the industry for a little while. I'm rooting for it.

\
Lawmakers plan to tackle a daunting task in the coming months: putting a price on the right to emit greenhouse gases.
\
Those gases -- primarily carbon dioxide -- are linked to warming temperatures and changing climate patterns across the globe. President Barack Obama and key members of Congress see emissions reductions as a necessary step after years of inaction.
\
Earlier this month, a coalition of corporations and environmental groups that includes the DuPont Co. offered its own input: a 24-page proposal outlining a model regulatory scheme. The document describes a ""cap-and-trade"" program, in which emissions from greenhouse gas-intensive sectors would be capped at a certain level and companies would receive allowances to release the gases.
\
Companies who cut emissions below the capped level could sell their allowances on an open market. The goal would be to slash emissions 80 percent by 2050, compared with 2005 levels.
\
""We're quite confident that it's something that the U.S. and global economies can do in a very manageable way, and if done carefully, create some new market opportunities,"" said Michael Parr, senior manager of government affairs for DuPont, a founding member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership.
\
The group's 31 members comprise utilities, manufacturers, oil and chemical companies, automakers and environmental and public interest groups.
\
Other members with local connections include American International Group, Exelon, NRG Energy and General Motors.
\
The group hopes its plan, hammered out after two years of negotiations, can inform the debate in Congress. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has made climate-change legislation a top priority. She chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, of which Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., is a member and chairman of a key subcommittee.
\
Carper said Boxer has asked him to play a lead role in developing climate-change legislation, which he hopes to introduce by the end of spring. The Delaware senator said he has worked with the climate partnership since the group formed, and the approach laid out in the blueprint largely mirrors his own favored approach.
\
""It's very difficult to build consensus around an issue as complicated and as contentious as climate change,"" Carper said. ""Having a very broad coalition, like USCAP, is a huge help.""
\
Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said several developments bode well for climate-change legislation: the arrival of a new president and new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the growing cooperation of businesses and the realization that such legislation will open up new market opportunities.
\
""I think all these things combined will give us the opportunity to see something happen in the course of this year,"" said Castle, who supports a cap-and-trade program.
\
The newest member of Delaware's delegation, Democratic Sen. Ted Kaufman, also supports a cap-and-trade scheme: ""Cap-and-trade, designed carefully, is the best way to make pollution expensive -- and it gives businesses the incentive to find new products and processes, to cut costs by cutting emissions,"" he said.
\
Already here
\
The concept is not new: Ten Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, including Delaware, participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program targeting electric utilities, the country's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union instituted a carbon-trading system in 2005.
\
DuPont and others already participate in trading on the Chicago Climate Exchange, a voluntary cap-and-trade system. On the federal level, a cap-and-trade program enacted in the 1990s helped reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide.
\
But the scale of a federal cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases would likely dwarf other efforts and affect the price of electricity, gasoline and consumer goods.
\
Some experts predict the market for carbon will become the largest commodity market in the world.
\
The climate partnership's plan would cover large greenhouse gas-emitting facilities and carbon emissions from other fossil-fuel users.
\
The program would set limits for emissions at 2005 levels, cutting greenhouse gases as much as 20 percent by 2020, 42 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050.
\
Under USCAP's plan, a ""significant"" amount of emission allowances would be given away free at the program's beginning, with the goal of phasing out free allowances as low-carbon technologies gain traction.
\
The partnership's plan recommends permitting up to 3 billion tons a year of carbon offsets, overseen by a Carbon Market Board. Carbon offsets represent emissions that are reduced or avoided through third-party projects.
\
The blueprint calls for federal investments in low-carbon technologies to help ensure that emissions are reduced. John Byrne, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Delaware, said such spending is vital to help reduce carbon emissions.
\
But he said it's an open question whether such efforts should come before a cap-and-trade program, or run simultaneously with such a program.
\
""The real way to tackle this problem in the near term may be to emphasize ... energy efficiency, conservation and renewables,"" said Byrne, a member of a working group of the 2007 Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""These will lower carbon emissions, and can be more effective than trying to cap the emissions of the auto industry and the power sector.""
\
Some environmental groups have taken aim at provisions of the climate partnership's blueprint, including its reduction targets, the use of carbon offsets and its proposal to give away, rather than auction off, many of the initial allowances.
\
""Were such a proposal to be enacted into law, it would fail to achieve the emission reductions we need in the U.S. and would undermine our ability to meaningfully and credibly engage in international climate negotiations,"" said Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth.
\
Tax alternative
\
Another debate centers on the best approach to greenhouse gas regulation: a cap-and-trade scheme or a straight tax on emissions. The CEO of oil giant Exxon Mobil has come out in favor of a carbon tax, as have several members of Congress and economists.
\
""Every approach to climate change necessarily will involve higher energy prices,"" says a recent report from a group called the U.S. Climate Task Force. ""By capturing those price increases in a tax, this program can rebate its revenues and sharply reduce both the direct costs of the tax for most businesses and people, as well as most of the indirect costs.""
\
DuPont's Parr said a carbon tax would offer no guarantee of any environmental benefits.
\
""The beauty of cap-and-trade it that it provides environmental certainty -- you know what reductions you're going to get,"" Parr said.
\
Another strike against a carbon tax: It's probably a non-starter in Congress.
\
""As a political matter, I think it's not likely that we could get 60 votes, or even 51 votes, for a carbon tax,"" Carper said.
\
Carper agreed that the economic downturn was likely to color the political debate on greenhouse gas regulations. But the senator and others think a carbon-constrained world will open up new market opportunities that could counter any economic injury.
\
""Over time,"" Byrne said, ""I think a carbon cap-and-trade will help our economy, not harm our economy -- if it's done properly.""

To understand how dangerously extreme the Republican Party has become on climate change, compare its stance to that of ExxonMobil.
\
No one would confuse the oil and gas giant with the Sierra Club. But if you visit Exxon's website, you will find that the company believes climate change is real, that governments should take action to combat it and that the most sensible action would be a revenue-neutral tax on carbon - in other words, a tax on oil, gas and coal, with the proceeds returned to taxpayers for them to spend as they choose.
\
With no government action, Exxon experts told us during a visit to The Post last week, average temperatures are likely to rise by a catastrophic (my word, not theirs) 5 degrees Celsius, with rises of 6, 7 or even more quite possible.
\
""A properly designed carbon tax can be predictable, transparent, and comparatively simple to understand and implement,"" Exxon says in a position paper titled ""Engaging on climate change.""
\
None of this is radical. Officials negotiating a climate agreement right now in Paris would take it as self-evident. Republican leaders in the 1980s and 1990s would have raised no objection.
\
But to today's Republicans, ExxonMobil's moderate, self-evident views are akin to heresy. Donald Trump, the leading GOP presidential candidate, says, ""I don't believe in climate change."" Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) says, ""Climate change is not science, it's religion."" Sen. Marco Rubio (Florida) at the moment seems to acknowledge that climate change might be real but opposes any action to deal with it.
\
.
\
A genuine conservative, as Ronald Reagan's secretary of state George Shultz has written, would acknowledge uncertainties in climate science but look for rational, market-based policies to lessen the risk without slowing economic growth.
\
A revenue-neutral carbon tax, as in a bill Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., has introduced, fits the description precisely.
\
What then explains the know-nothingism of today's Republicans? Some of them see scientists as part of a left-wing cabal; many of them doubt government's ability to do anything, let alone something as big as redirecting the economy's energy use. Almost all of them, along with quite a few Democrats, would rather not tell voters that energy prices need to rise for the sake of the environment.
\
Their donors in the oil and gas industry encourage their prejudices. Three years ago, Grover Norquist, the Republicans' anti-tax enforcer, said that a carbon tax wouldn't violate his no-tax-increase pledge if the proceeds were returned by lowering the income tax, though he made clear he didn't like the idea.
\
The next morning, the lobbying arm of the oil and gas industry swung into action. ""Grover, just butch it up and oppose this lousy idea directly,"" the American Energy Alliance said. ""This word-smithing is giving us all headaches.""

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Tom Carper, who serves on a Senate committee overseeing efforts to curb greenhouse gases, skipped his colleagues' all-night talk-a-thon on climate change.
\
The Delaware Democrat was the only Democratic member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to miss the Monday night to Tuesday morning speeches, organized to raise awareness and warn against the danger of inaction. Carper was in Delaware because his eldest son was visiting, according to Carper's spokeswoman.
\
""I stand #Up4Climate in spirit w/my colleagues who are pulling an all-nighter for #climatechange,"" Carper tweeted Monday night. ""Congress must address this pivotal issue.""
\
Carper has long defended the Environmental Protection Agency's authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases and other pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. Last month, he chaired a hearing focused on the cost of not being prepared for extreme weather events, and on ways the federal government can make communities more resilient.
\
Thirty-one Democratic senators, including Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., participated in the all-nighter, speaking in shifts on the Senate floor.
\
Addressing a nearly empty chamber and visitor gallery, more than two-dozen speakers agreed with each other about the need to act on climate change. Naysayers - Republicans - largely stayed away, arguing hours earlier that regulation would cost Americans jobs in a sluggish economy.
\
The talk-a-thon ended just before 9 a.m. Tuesday, lasting almost 15 hours. It was the 35th all-night session since 1915, according to the Senate.
\
Coons took the midnight shift. Beginning at 12:20 a.m., his remarks covered the impact of sea-level rise on Delaware, the lowest-lying state.
\
""The bottom line is that our climate is changing,"" he said. ""We know that. With this knowledge comes the responsibility to reduce our emissions, to mitigate the impacts, and prepare for and take action to deal with the coming changes.""
\
Republicans challenged Democrats to bring legislation to the floor to address the problem - secure in the knowledge they won't.
\
""Bring up the carbon tax bill. Put it on the agenda. Let's debate it,"" said GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He noted that Democrats failed to pass similar legislation in 2009-2010, when they controlled the 60 Senate seats necessary to overcome any Republican blocking tactics.

It amazes me that this newspaper, which generally informs people, continues to promote and obfuscate with respect to Bluewater Wind.
\
Bluewater announced a decrease in the price in the latest power purchase agreement, when the actual price increased from $116 to $125. The News Journal focused on the price change on one of the three parts of the price.
\
The newspaper focuses on the additional cost per month of some mythical and inaccurate measure at around $6. The more likely increase is $22. By the way, these are wholesale prices not retail.
\
The price of wind from the grid is $86 per megawatt. For offshore wind from Bluewater, it is $125.
\
Offshore wind is generally agreed to cost 50 percent more to build, and 500 percent more to maintain. Because it is so costly, the General Assembly is either going to tax those who don't use this expensive power or take away rights given during deregulation.
\
In addition, it intends to force Delmarva Power to sign a contract with Bluewater if they don't voluntarily agree. Not only are businesses going to pay for power they don't receive, involuntary contracts are now part of the business environment.
\
On top of this is a new carbon tax to provide money for those in government who are intent on making people poor while they pursue their social agenda.
\
A carbon tax, the wind farm tax and expensive power will have no impact on air quality or health in Delaware. A better approach would include energy- sensitive building codes, energy audits at occupancy, and better education about energy use.

Brandywine should have closed schools earlier
\
Last summer I recall that the Brandywine school board told residents that a tax increase was necessary to maintain the schools. Many residents were of the opinion that the board should first look for ways to reduce spending, such as closing some schools when enrollment was declining.
\
The second budget was eventually passed and resulted in a tax increase.
\
Last week the board revealed it is considering closing two to four schools due to declining enrollment. Why didn't the board members know this last summer? Shame on them.

Include vulnerable gay teens in family values
\
About 25 percent of gay teens are kicked out of their homes after their parents learn of their sexual orientation. Other gay and transgender youth choose to run away due to unbearable family and societal opposition. Altogether, gay and transgender youth compose 20 percent to 40 percent of all homeless and runaway youth.
\
That's up to 640,000 gay and transgender kids who are homeless.
\
Suicide is another way youth seek to escape their private hell. Up to 30 percent of all youth suicides are gay and transgender. Some 3,000 gay kids kill themselves every year.
\
Drug use, prostitution and other risky choices are also suicidal behaviors that vulnerable youth might select.
\
Is this the way we treat children in order to assert religious purity and commitment to family values? Those parents who are fortunate enough to know their kids are still alive and where they are can urge them to come home for Christmas. They might also apologize for their cruelty.
\
Who knows, the kids might be gracious enough to accept.

Fund Delaware Tech with small income tax increase
\
Delaware Technical & Community College needs to expand its facilities and requires funding to do so. The solution being advanced is to increase the real estate transfer tax.
\
It already was increased several years ago to 3 percent from 2 percent, a 50 percent increase. This idea is unsound for the following reasons:
\
It sets a precedent that will lead to more such increases in the future for all three Delaware institutions of higher education.
\
It burdens a small group of homeowners who already have other substantial mortgage and real estate fees.
\
The tax will live forever, providing the college with funds to play with well beyond the cost of building new facilities
\
A better solution would be a one-time income tax assessment. This would be extremely small, spread over thousands of taxpayers to pay just for the expansion of facilities.
\
Because the education of the masses is a worthwhile objective of all segments of society, the cost should not be borne by just a few homeowners.

Bluewater Wind project should not be rushed
\
Philosophically I support going green. But not enough due diligence has been done to merit moving so quickly with the Bluewater Wind project.
\
This rush that came from the General Assembly's deregulation of public utilities is history repeating itself. We can ill afford another debacle.
\
Have the developers done appropriate geological studies of the site, demonstrating its feasibility? I don't believe they have had time enough since they made their first proposal.
\
Before they rush into a contract, we must take the time to do this right. Delaware is considering a proposal that could have a dramatic impact on electric customers.
\
I strongly support the use of renewable resources, especially wind, to supply electricity. But this particular proposal is not in the best interests of electric users.

President Barack Obama urged Congress to enact ""market-based"" measures to reduce emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and used his State of the Union address Tuesday to declare he will press ahead on addressing climate change with or without congressional support.
\
""If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will,"" Obama said. ""I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.""
\
The president's remarks - touting opportunities of solar, wind and greater energy efficiency - came little more than three months after Superstorm Sandy threatened the entire state of Delaware before savaging the Jersey Shore and New York, leading to a $60 billion relief package likely to cover only a small share of total losses.
\
Although scientists cautioned against directly linking Sandy to global warming, many said the storm could have gathered extra strength from ocean waters heated by months of warmer-than-normal temperatures, and a slowly rising average global temperature.
\
Obama stressed Tuesday night he takes that storm and other events seriously as a call for action.
\
""We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen, were all just a freak coincidence,"" Obama said. ""Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science - and act before it's too late.""
\
The speech fell on the eve of the first of three public meetings on suggestions from Delaware's Sea Level Rise Advisory Committee, a panel formed by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to suggest ways to prepare for higher tides and flooding borne of rising global temperatures.
\
Those suggestions have ranged from better research and data and tougher coastal building restrictions to warning signs near future flood zones and seller disclosure requirements for land in vulnerable areas. Some already have drawn sharp criticism.
\
Rich Collins, who directs the business-oriented Positive Growth Alliance in Delaware, said he opposes the White House approach, and said that recent cuts in emissions have gone unrecognized.
\
""I have no problem with the cleanest environment we could possibly have."" Collins said. ""But I believe people are hurting, and these people just don't seem to have a problem with inflicting pain on those who are hurting the most.""
\
Eileen Claussen, president of the national Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, immediately endorsed Obama's call for controlling heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions by putting a price on pollution, capping emissions and allowing companies to trade emissions credits.
\
""A stable climate and reliable energy are both fundamental to our economic well-being,"" Claussen said. ""So as he and Congress seek long-term solutions to the nation's fiscal challenges, we strongly encourage them to consider either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax.
\
In often-flooded Bowers Beach, Lieba Kaplan said she hoped to see the president at least mention climate change, but was not surprised that he offered few details.
\
""I'm for really checking the environment, for not just going after energy no matter what the cost to the environment,"" Kaplan said. ""I'm concerned that we don't do things that just make the oil companies and gas companies richer. We need to shift to cleaner energy. We need to take advantage of the wind that's blowing through Bowers Beach all the time.""

57,"""It's a bad idea to abandon any tools that help us combat the real effects of climate change.""\John Carney\Delaware governor\Over the past decade, Delaware's power generators shifted energy production from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas, spent millions of dollars to upgrade existing facilities and shut down the biggest polluting smoke stacks - all to meet air-quality guidelines and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\But under a new Trump administration executive order, which the president says will make the country energy independent, states that didn't push for the same upgrades may not need to work toward a similar, pollution reduction goal.\It's a battle Delaware environmental regulators have been pushing over the last year - to get neighboring states that have large, coal-fired power plants to meet the same air-quality standards that Delaware must. Much of the state's problem with ozone pollution, for instance, comes from large power plants and crowded highways beyond the state borders.\Delaware, on the losing end of the battle for years, may have lost another round.\The president on Tuesday ordered a review of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.\The plan, adopted in 2015, but on hold because of a court challenge by 27 states, resulted from a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency finding that greenhouse gas pollution threatens public health and leads to changes in the climate.\Delaware, the lowest-lying state in the nation, is especially vulnerable to rising sea level, which is expected to hasten as the planet warms.\""It's a bad idea to abandon any tools that help us combat the real effects of climate change,"" said Gov. John Carney, in an email Tuesday afternoon. ""Delaware is already experiencing sea level rise twice as fast as the global average. More than 17,000 homes in Delaware are at risk of permanent inundation, and many more experience costly flooding. In addition to sea level rise, increased high heat days and changing precipitation patterns threaten Delaware's essential $8 billion agricultural industry, and pose critical health threats. The safety and health of Delawareans, our economy, and our natural resources are dependent not only on our actions as a state, but on a shared, urgent commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""\The plan required a 32-percent reduction by 2030 in carbon dioxide emissions below the levels recorded in 2005. Reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides also were required.\The president's order rescinds multiple Obama administration executive orders and related documents that focused on preparing for the impacts of climate change.\It also takes aim at several Obama administration energy policies and requires federal agencies to review actions that may burden the ""safe and efficient"" development of domestic energy. And it requires the secretary of the Interior to amend or withdraw the current moratorium on coal leases on federal lands.\The Caesar Rodney Institute, a conservative think tank in Delaware, has long argued that the Clean Power Plan was bad for Delaware.\In a policy paper last year, the institute wrote that ""residential electric bills will increase almost $270 a year, and some large industrial customers will see an increase of over $3 million a year if a proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency to limit carbon dioxide emissions is adopted. The EPA envisions a $25 per ton carbon tax will be adopted by every state. The EPA provided a preliminary analysis of the impact of its Clean Power Plan for existing power plants on Delaware power generation and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) by 2030 compared to 2012.""\But Delaware Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons, both Democrats, said the order raised concerns.\""I am deeply concerned by this latest action by the Trump administration to reverse our efforts to protect our national security, our environment, and our economy by working to address and reverse the impacts of climate change,"" Coons said. ""The United States has long been a global leader in the effort to fight climate change, and U.S. leadership made it possible to bring 195 countries, including China, together on an international climate agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2015. While the White House has not signaled whether it intends for the U.S. to remain in the Paris Agreement, the Trump administration's actions today are yet another step backwards undermining our commitments to address climate change and embrace a clean energy future.""\Carper said walking away from the Clean Power Plan and other climate initiatives ""is not just irresponsible - it's irrational. Today's executive order calls into question America's credibility and our commitment to tackling the greatest environmental challenge of our lifetime. ... This order clearly proves that this administration is not serious about protecting jobs and our environment. As a West Virginia native, I understand the plight of coal miners in today's day and age. But the Clean Power Plan isn't the coal industry's problem - market forces are. Let's be perfectly clear: this executive order will not bring back the coal industry. It is an insult to the men and women who voted for him for Donald Trump to say otherwise.""\Contact Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

\
When Delmarva Power customers saw their bills increase by 59 percent last May, many blamed the increasing cost of natural gas.
\
So state officials went looking for a solution that would protect Delaware residents against volatility in the energy market.
\
The leading plan? Build another natural gas plant.
\
Conectiv's proposal to build a 180-megawatt natural gas turbine plant at its Hay Road complex beat out plans for an offshore wind farm and a coal gasification plant. A state evaluation of the proposals favored the plan because it offered the best price for consumers in the next 10 years.
\
But a state consultant and a Delmarva consultant concluded that all three proposals would cost ratepayers more than they pay now.
\
Delmarva spokesman Tim Brown quoted his company's consultant as saying it would cost residential customers about $1 more per month to contract with Conectiv for 10 years.
\
If the state went with Bluewater Wind's proposed 200-turbine offshore wind farm, which the consultants ranked second, it would cost residential customers about $11 per month over 25 years, Brown said.
\
And if NRG built a coal gasification plant, it would cost about $26 more per month over 25 years, Brown said. The consultants ranked NRG last.
\
Price is the major consideration in the state's decision-making process, followed by price stability and environmental impact. The process for picking a winner will include three public hearings this week.
\
But critics point to the historically volatile prices of natural gas, arguing no one can tell exactly how much it will cost, leaving ratepayers with an uncertain future.
\
In its bid, Conectiv estimated the future price of electricity it can offer to Delmarva will be close to what Delmarva is paying now for electricity.
\
Ratepayers may be better off with Delmarva buying off the open market rather than locking into a long-term contract with Conectiv, said Jeremy Firestone, University of Delaware assistant professor of marine policy.
\
""If the state is correct in their analysis, it would seem that bid doesn't make sense,"" said Firestone, who also suggested taxes on carbon emissions could further increase the price of natural gas.
\
And even Delmarva, the company that could be forced to enter into a long-term contract with one of the companies, says none of the proposals makes sense. Brown said the three proposals do not provide enough savings and price stability to justify a contract.
\
Delmarva argues it can meet its customers' long-term needs through a combination of energy-efficiency programs, buying on the wholesale market, modernizing its transmission system and ""targeted purchases"" of renewable power.
\
The key issue for most Delaware residents is cost, said Edward O. Taylor, field organizer at the state chapter of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, an advocacy group for low-income residents. It doesn't make any sense to stabilize a high price, he said.
\
""It's like the joke, we're going to let this 59 percent increase stabilize our utility costs. That 59 percent didn't take into consideration anyone in the low- or middle-income range,"" Taylor said. ""We need to be stabilizing profits.""
\
Firestone said Delmarva's consultants' analysis also failed to adequately consider the cost of future taxes on carbon dioxide emissions, which he said could make the proposed wind farm more attractive.
\
The vast majority of scientists agree global warming is caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, largely from man's burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels. The Delmarva consultant acknowledged the federal government is likely to enact some kind of restrictions or financial penalty for carbon emissions, but the specifics are unknown.
\
This much is known: Conectiv and NRG have stated they would pass the cost of such taxes to ratepayers. Bluewater Wind's proposed wind farm would emit no pollution.
\
Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, including fewer carbon dioxide emissions, noted Richard Shaten, assistant faculty associate at the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
\
That has encouraged the upsurge in the construction of natural gas plants in recent years, Shaten said.
\
It's cheaper to build a natural gas plant than it is to build a coal plant or put up a wind farm, he said.
\
'A self-fulfilling prophecy'
\
But natural gas has been the most volatile of fuels in recent years, Shaten said. Over the past decade, demand for natural gas has grown, causing prices to rise. Last year, the average wellhead price was $6.47 per MMBTU, about three times higher than the 1990s price. (MMBTU is a thousand, thousand BTUs, which is the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a pint of water by one degree.)
\
Delmarva customers saw their bills increase by 59 percent last year after price caps came off. During the seven years that the state capped prices, the cost of natural gas was driving up the price of wholesale electricity.
\
The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts the price of natural gas generally going down in the next two decades.
\
Shaten disagreed. He argued the government's projections of natural gas prices have been low, and he expects the price of natural gas to instead double in the next 10 years.
\
""The easy thing to do is build the cheapest, quickest power plant that will serve your needs, which is natural gas,"" Shaten said. But ""if everyone keeps building natural gas plants, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that natural gas prices will skyrocket.""
\
Domestic sources of natural gas are being depleted, which will force U.S. companies to turn to the Middle East or Siberia for liquefied natural gas, said Dave Bayless, a professor of mechanical engineering at Ohio University. That's likely to mean higher prices, he said.
\
Delaware is now fighting a proposal, on territorial grounds, to build a liquefied natural gas terminal across the Delaware River from Claymont that could bring stabilizing quantities of natural gas to the region, but is mostly produced outside the United States.
\
""Whenever you talk about energy from foreign sources, it's problematic,"" Bayless said.
\
Conectiv spokesman Bill Yingling said his company can afford to offer low, stable pricing because it would take out a long-term contract with its suppliers to lock in prices for a ""substantial portion"" of its natural gas supply. The company refused to specify exactly how much of its supply would be covered under that contract.
\
Conectiv would then sell to Delmarva at price changes pegged not to the natural gas market, but to the less-volatile coal market. If natural gas prices exceed coal, Conectiv would absorb the difference, Yingling said.
\
""That's part of what we do in our business,"" Yingling said of the risk to Conectiv. No matter how bad it gets, Conectiv would honor the contract, he said. ""What we sign up for is what we live to.""
\
Pricing rationale questioned
\
But Conectiv's bid does not specify what the price would be to Delmarva on day one, instead specifying a formula to set the price.
\
""We don't understand the rationale for basing the natural gas price on the coal price,"" said Bluewater Wind spokesman Jim Lanard. ""How do you compare these bids if you don't have everybody's firm price?""
\
Prices for coal, a more-abundant resource, have traditionally been relatively stable, although prices have increased over the last few years.
\
Wind-power prices tend to be more stable than fossil fuels, which are subject to market forces.
\
On the issue of a carbon tax, Firestone noted that the state consultant criticized Delmarva's estimates as too low. Firestone said even the state is underestimating how high the carbon taxes will be. If the state used estimates from the Boston-based consultant Synapse Energy, the wind farm would look like a better option, Firestone said.
\
""We have to think of it like an insurance premium,"" Firestone said. ""You're insuring against the possibility of higher rates in the future by locking into long-term rates.""

COMPARING ENERGY SOURCES
\
Three companies are vying to build a power source in Delaware that would supply energy to Delmarva Power under a long-term contract. The state is evaluating the proposals based on cost, price stability and impact to the environment.
\
Bluewater: Wind turbine
\
Description: 200-turbine Atlantic Ocean wind farm 7 to 13 miles off Rehoboth Beach or Bethany Beach. Total maximum yield 600 megawatts; likely annual yield 111 to 127 megawatts.
\
Dollar cost: More than $1.5 billion. State consultant predicted long-term costs at 10.4 percent greater than buying electricity off regional market, or $2.2 billion by 2038.
\
Environmental impact: Zero emissions. Undetermined effect on migratory and aquatic birds and aquatic life. Unproven durability in mid-Atlantic offshore environment.
\
NRG: Natural gas
\
Description: 600-megawatt plant near Millsboro fueled mostly by natural gas-like fuel extracted from coal. Project also would retire two dirtier coal units at Indian River power plant.
\
Dollar cost: More than $1.5 billion. Long-term ratepayer cost up to 24.7 percent more than buying electricity off regional market, or $5.2 billion by 2038.
\
Environmental impact: Emissions far lower than conventional coal plant. Potential multimillion-ton-per-year increase in carbon dioxide /greenhouse-gas emissions without costs for capture and control. Unproven proposal to inject CO2 deep underground.
\
Conectiv: Coal gasification
\
Description: 177-megawatt turbine system in east Wilmington, fueled primarily by natural gas.
\
Dollar cost: Up to 1.1 percent more than buying electricity from regional grid. Reliance on potentially unstable natural gas supplies and prices.
\
Environmental impact: Increased CO2 emissions without controls.

CAFE STANDARDS
\
OUR VIEW
\
The U.S. Senate managed this week to push back tough opposition from Detroit's Big Three automakers and get an energy bill passed. It was the government's biggest step toward fuel efficiency in 20 years.
\
Delaware's Tom Carper and Alaska's Ted Stevens worked out a compromise that collected enough Democratic and Republican senators willing to impose fuel economy standards of 35 miles per gallon for cars and SUVs by 2020.
\
It was a hard fight. The American automakers, as usual, opposed any change in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy law. A number of powerful Democratic senators from Michigan and nearby states also opposed the changes. But the Carper-Stevens compromise overcame those threats.
\
This is an important step. It showed that the long powerful, and, to a considerable degree, obstructionist Detroit manufacturers do not have as much political clout as they once did.
\
Still, the battle isn't over. The House must take up the bill. It's fate there is even more questionable. The congressional delegation from Michigan was reportedly meeting in strategy sessions Friday in an effort to keep the CAFE standard changes from going into effect. Even though the Democrats control the House, some of the most powerful opponents of the CAFE reform back the auto industry.
\
The automakers see the standards as too expensive and burdensome. They would come at a time when the more fuel-efficient Japanese-made cars are winning more customers.
\
But public opinion is changing. More voters are concerned about slowing carbon emissions and relieving some of the nation's dependence on oil from unstable foreign countries.
\
Therefore, we have a popular push for the regulatory CAFE standards.
\
The CAFE numbers are far from perfect. So, in fact, is the entire regulatory process. Many economists argue that the most efficient and ultimately less costly way of increasing miles per gallon is a carbon tax on gasoline.
\
Despite the hardship it would impose on many Americans, it would be the most direct way of reducing the numbers of miles driven. That, in turn, would allow the marketplace to force Detroit auto makers into making more fuel efficient cars.
\
Unfortunately, the idea is too politically unpopular to be considered.
\
The proposed increases in mileage mandates will extend per-gallon rates, but they also will push up the price of cars. Eventually, new technologies will help drivers save money on fuel and relieve the burden on the environment.
\
In the meantime, the CAFE standards represent probably the best we can get.
"
60,"
A 30-year war over the environment is over.
\
The Obama administration announced the final rules for fuel efficiency and emissions for U.S. cars and light trucks.
\
The rules end a long, expensive battle between manufacturers and state and federal regulators. The standardized rules on greenhouse emissions will cover the 2012-2016 model years. The requirement of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 is expected to cut the nation's dependence on oil and cut greenhouse emissions by 30 percent.
\
The most important aspect of the rules is that they cover the entire nation. Manufacturers will not have to deal with the uncertainty of varying federal, state and regional standards. The national standard will make the changes more economical, although it is expected to add about $1,000 to the cost of new cars.
\
The battle over standards took too long. The manufacturers can be faulted for resisting, even denying, the need for fuel efficiency despite mounting evidence. The regulators can be faulted for imposing elaborate but shifting rules.
\
All told, the nation would have been better off if Congress had imposed a carbon tax on gasoline two decades ago. The higher cost would have forced the switch to more efficient cars and the tax money could have been used to subsidize research.
\
The next battle is likely to be over stationary emissions sources such as power plants and refineries. Let's hope the answer doesn't take another 30 years.

61,"During a CNN town hall on Wednesday, Joe Biden spoke of the effects climate change has had on his home state of Delaware, where sea level rise is occurring faster than the global average.\""My state is three feet above sea level,"" Biden said. ""And guess what? We know what is going to happen if we don't make significant change.""\""It's affected my family and it's affected my state in a way that's been real,"" the former vice president added minutes later.\Biden held the prime time spot during CNN's 7-hour town hall on climate change, which included presidential candidates former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.\Earlier this summer, Biden released his $5 trillion climate plan, which called for a 100 percent clean energy economy with net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. His plan would require $1.7 trillion of federal funding over the next 10 years and more than $4.3 trillion of private, state and local investments.\During the 40-minute town hall on Wednesday, Biden said he would support a carbon tax and would stop fracking on federal lands — but stopped short of saying he would ban it entirely as president. The former vice president also stressed the importance of bringing countries together in order to make an impact on the crisis.\""Plans are great,"" Biden said, ""but executing on those plans is a very different thing.""\This included the Green New Deal, which Biden criticized on Wednesday for not having ""a lot of specifics.""\From the beginning of the town hall, Biden faced questions about if his climate change plan was aggressive enough and if he would stand up to the corporations contributing to the climate crisis.\""Everything I've done has been done to take on the polluters,"" Biden responded.

Surely 535 other Americans could do better than this
\
We have a congressman who just voted for a likely unconstitutional bill. A hypocritical, disingenuous Congress is expending enormous energy to recoup $165 million from AIG employees weeks after passing bills with easily 100 times that much in waste and pork.
\
We have a senator who approved a blatant tax cheat as our Treasury Secretary and Speaker of the House exhorting illegal immigrants, praising their patriotism. We have a House and Senate that passes enormous money bills without reading them. We have a president who, four months after election, spends nearly all his time campaigning.
\
One might think that there would be a solid group of politicians pushing a serious effort to make our nation energy-independent. Instead, they will soon ram through a carbon tax that will put a new cost burden on businesses and Americans and improve absolutely nothing.
\
We could randomly select 535 people off the street to serve in Congress and have a much more purposeful, focused and honest set of lawmakers. We need to vote these bums out at our next opportunity and revisit term limits for Congress.

Separate students who want to learn from problem pupils
\
The ongoing violence in our schools points to a need for a realignment in the school system.
\
Choice allows concerned families to select a good or preferred school. That model requires that a disciplinary school also be established to control and teach those who choose not to care or behave appropriately.
\
Word would spread quickly among misbehaving kids and the majority who want to learn could do so without distraction.

For the state's budget, there are other options to pay cuts
\
Recently, California, Maryland and Georgia instituted furloughs for state workers to take the sting out of workers taking home less income. Ohio, Utah and New Jersey are considering the furlough in exchange for a pay cut for their state workers. New Castle County recently proposed forced furloughs for ""non-essential"" county employees.
\
Will Delaware's legislators debate the issue that cutting an employee's pay nearly 10 percent would be devastating to morale? Everyone understands that cutting payroll expenses is a huge savings, but at what cost? To take the pain out of earning less money, forced furloughs at least allows employees to seek part-time work or volunteer their time.
\
It does not appear that Gov. Markell's administration considered these issues before announcing the 10 percent pay cuts for all state workers. Will Delaware's legislators ask these questions prior to their vote on Markell's budget proposal?
\
Most state workers left the private sector with a pay cut. Many stretch dollars like rubber to make ends meet, but believe that the family-friendly environment is worth the trade-off for a bigger home and nicer car.
\
After overseeing the state budget during the last administration, one might assume that a former state treasurer would know which agencies cost the most, without producing results. Government waste is abundant, but it is not in every corner of every agency. In fact, some branches and divisions are federally funded. What benefit is it to the state general fund if 95 percent of the payroll dollars come from federal funds?
\
Layoffs are not pleasant for anyone, and certainly not for the state unemployment coffers, but usually in the private sector, simple math is the decider so that efficiency is rewarded and waste is cut.
\
Although everyone absorbing the pain seems like the better plan, it is not sustainable in the long term because it is not addressing irresponsible and wasteful spending.

Give state workers a break; raise the income tax instead
\
So Gov. Markell does not think the Delaware State slaves are making clay bricks cheaply enough. They now will become the newest scapegoats for all the problems Wall Street greed and folly have visited upon Delaware's economy.
\
All of us know heath care and pensions are a problem in this sorry economy. Perhaps our enablers of Wall Street deregulation and corruption - Congress - should start fixing Main Street problems.
\
Low-paid state employees are not the geniuses who lost tons of investments that wrecked the Delaware pension funds. They do not hire high-priced consultants in Dover.
\
They are the folks that change your grandmother's bedpan, fill pot holes, plow roads, try to teach our children on the cheap.
\
We need more money to run a civilized modern state, despite the popular notion that everything is free, or let someone else pay for it or deregulate or privatize it. Sin taxes and gambling will not do it; a sales tax is not the solution.
\
Raise the state income tax. At least that's deductible on federal income tax. Or re-regulate the Delmarva Ponzi scheme - a 40 percent reduction in my monthly utilities bill could be converted to state taxes.
\
I can pay more taxes then the food-stamp class. That's the shared burden of life that most greedy Americans seem to have forgotten about. I am not a state worker. And, I am not married to one and have none in my family.

Spacewalking is always an awesome, memorable event

I take exception to Marcia Dunn's description in her Associated Press article last Sunday. She used the word ""undramatic"" when describing Discovery's space walk.

Perhaps ""uneventful"" would be a better fit - meaning, thankfully, that there were no major problems. Anyone with a sense of wonder can see drama in a spacewalk. The astronauts are not walking down the sidewalk.

The best stem-cell research requires no human embryos
\
In commenting on the embryonic stem-cell debate, a recent letter mentioned something about outdated 18th century morality and about his love for science.
\
I wonder when the morality of not taking a human life for the purpose of benefiting another went out of style. Or not using human beings for experimentation purposes without their consent. A human embryo is not a cell; it is a unique collection of cells much like our bodies with all the DNA required to become a fully developed adult. It's not potential human life; it is actual life. This is what is destroyed to harvest embryonic stem cells.
\
As to the science, for the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on ESC research, there's not one, solitary positive result from the destruction of all that nascent human life. On the contrary, every time embryonic stem cells have been tried, the tests subjects (human and animal) have formed tumors or healthy tissue has been destroyed or some other adverse occurrence has resulted. Nothing in the foreseeable future will change that.
\
There is research that provides promising results for Type 1 diabetes, Alzheimer's and other diseases that involves nonembryonic stem cells and do not require the destruction of human embryos. On moral and scientific grounds this is research that should be funded, not that which is destructive, immoral and completely devoid of any success.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's declaration Friday that greenhouse gases ""endanger public health and welfare"" could have a big impact in Delaware, though not where most people would think.
\
The EPA's action marks the first step toward requiring power plants, industries and automobiles to curtail their release of climate-changing pollution, especially carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.
\
""The law says if there's scientific evidence, [the EPA] must -- not can, must -- regulate that pollutant,"" said James D. Werner, director of the Delaware Division of Air and Waste Management. ""The foot-dragging ended today.""
\
Faced with the threat of regulation, many believe that Congress may be forced to develop a national policy to reduce pollution that contributes to global warming.
\
Delaware's smokestack legacy provides an obvious target for greenhouse-gas regulation, and indeed, industry and electric-power generation accounts for the largest share of carbon dioxide emissions. The U.S. Department of Energy reported this week that those sources emitted 10.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2005, or 60 percent of the state's total.
\
But such plants already fall under the four-year-old Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which Delaware and nine other states formed to control power and industrial emissions, said John Byrne, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Delaware.
\
Federal regulation would likely mirror that effort, he said.
\
Instead, the next-largest source of Delaware's carbon dioxide emissions is the cars and trucks zipping along the state's 13,000 miles of roads, including those passing through on I-95, Del. 1 and U.S. 13.
\
Transportation sources accounted for 5.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in Delaware in 2005, or almost 30 percent of the state's total.
\
""This could be very interesting,"" Byrne said. ""The cost of automobiles could be going up.""
\
Nick DiPasquale, conservation chairman of Delaware Audubon, said a ""carbon tax"" that raises the cost of high-emission sources could be an effective way of addressing the role of automobiles.
\
Such an impact could still be a few years away. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said that while the agency is prepared to move forward with regulations under the Clean Air Act, the Obama administration would prefer that Congress addressed the climate issue through ""cap-and-trade"" legislation limiting pollution that can contribute to global warming.
\
In announcing the proposed finding, Jackson said the EPA analysis ""confirms that greenhouse-gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations"" and warrants steps to curtail it.
\
The threat of dealing with climate change by regulation could spur some hesitant members of Congress to find another way to address the problem.
\
""The decision is a game changer. It now changes the playing field with respect to legislation,"" said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., whose Energy and Commerce subcommittee is crafting broad limits on greenhouse emissions. ""It's now no longer doing a bill or doing nothing. It is now a choice between regulation and legislation.""
\
Legislation could be considered by the House before the August congressional recess.
\
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee responsible for climate legislation, said the EPA's action is ""a wake-up call for Congress.""
\
Friday's action by the EPA triggered a 60-day comment period before the agency issues a final endangerment ruling. That would be followed by a proposal on how to regulate the emissions.
\
The EPA action was prompted by a Supreme Court ruling two years ago that said greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act and must be regulated if found to be a danger to human health or public welfare.
\
The Bush administration strongly opposed using the Clean Air Act to address climate change and stalled on producing the so-called ""endangerment finding"" demanded by the high court in its April 2007 ruling.
\
""The Bush administration was in pretty significant denial for a long time,"" said DiPasquale, who was secretary of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control from 1999 to 2002.
\
""There's finally a recognition that climate change is for real,"" he said.
\
Total greenhouse-gas emissions increased 1.6 percent between 2006 and 2007, according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Energy.
\
Of the six greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide is by far the most prevalent, the report shows. It made up 82.6 percent of the 7.3 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases emitted in 2007.
\
A contingent of Sussex County environmentalists has focused on the health impacts of carbon dioxide emissions, especially from the coal- and oil-powered Indian River generation plant, said William Zak, a spokesman for Citizens for Clean Power.
\
""We've lived with the health consequences of coal for 50 years,"" Zak said.
\
In 2007, state health officials found that lung cancer incidence was 30 percent above the Delaware average in the six ZIP codes around the Millsboro plant. That prompted a statewide study, which found seven other clusters.
\
Officials from NRG Energy, the New Jersey company that owns the 740-megawatt plant, could not be reached for comment about the EPA's action.
\
M.Q. Riding, spokeswoman for Conectiv Energy, said the agency's finding was expected because of the Supreme Court ruling in 2007. The company operates several electricity-generating stations in the region, including the 720-megawatt Edge Moor Power Plant near Wilmington.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative offers a good model for controlling emissions, Riding said. But it is unfair because it does not cover power companies in nearby states, she said.
\
""We've always felt that a national program for greenhouse-gas control is the best solution,"" Riding said. ""If everybody's working from the same page, then everything seems to be more consistent.""
\
Joe Rogalsky, spokesman for Gov. Jack Markell, said the EPA's action adds urgency to the governor's call to improve residents' health and the state's economy by pursuing alternative energy sources and ""green"" industries.
\
""The state's environmental health and welfare have to be at the center of our public policy debate,"" Rogalsky said.
\
In addition to carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels, the EPA finding covers five other emissions that scientists believe are warming the earth when they concentrate in the atmosphere: Methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.

THE ISSUES
\
Delaware's vehicles emitted 5.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, in 2005, accounting for 30 percent of the total pollution in the state.
\
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said analysis ""confirms that greenhouse-gas pollution is a serious problem now.""
\
Friday's action likely will be followed by a plan to regulate emissions in 60 days if Congress doesn't act first.
\
In addition to CO2, the EPA finding covers methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluoro-carbons, perfluoro-carbons and sulfur hexafluoride.

Our country faces many challenges today.
\
Enormous trade and budget deficits. An economic recovery that is -- as yet -- producing not enough new jobs. Uncertainty in the marketplace that has kept investors and billions of dollars on the sidelines. Unhealthy air and a changing climate, as well as a growing reliance on foreign oil and fossil fuels.
\
We need to find commonsense solutions to these challenges. If we do, we can put America on a clean energy path that will create new jobs and restore prosperity, while improving our environment for generations to come.
\
I believe that our federal government has a role to play in encouraging the development of this clean energy economy, and Delaware stands to benefit greatly if we do.
\
I often say that a major role of government is to create a nurturing environment where businesses can grow and create new jobs while also playing by the rules and being good corporate citizens. Nowhere is this role clearer than in our efforts to find new and sustainable sources of energy in the United States.
\
Our country's dependence on fossil fuels means that we send over $250 billion a year oversees to pay for our oil imports, often to countries that don't like us very much and in some cases use our own money to try to harm us. This dependence also exacts an enormous public health cost as we spend billions of dollars annually to treat health problems triggered by pollution, as well as costing the lives of tens of thousands Americans every year.
\
The federal government can help level the playing field between fossil fuels and clean energy and be a catalyst for the creation and use of clean energy technologies including wind, solar, nuclear, and advanced vehicles.
\
In the Senate, I have pushed forward a number of initiatives to spur a clean energy economy, such as creating tax credits, loan guarantees and grants to stand up these new industries until they can stand on their own.
\
Among these initiatives are the clean energy manufacturing tax credits that I supported within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These tax credits are helping transform abandoned manufacturing sites -- like the GM plant in Wilmington -- into clean energy technology factories.
\
As a result, we will be generating thousands of jobs -- like those that will be created by Fisker in a year or two -- building clean energy equipment and cars to sell here and export around the world; equipment that's stamped ""Made in the U.S.A., Manufactured in Delaware.""
\
In addition, federal dollars invested wisely in research and development at the University of Delaware and Delaware State University will stimulate innovation and the commercialization of clean energy technologies.
\
The federal government can also send strong signals to the marketplace to encourage private investments in clean energy technologies.
\
This could be done through a national clean energy standard that would require some percentage of our electricity to come from low-or zero pollution technologies, such as the wind turbines being built off our shores in Rehoboth. Or we could require the largest energy consumer in our economy -- the U.S. government -- to buy more energy from clean sources.
\
In 1993, President Clinton issued an Executive Order requiring the U.S. government to purchase recycled paper. By creating more demand for recycled paper, this initiative helped lower the price of recycled paper throughout the larger economy.
\
Clean energy could be the next area where the U.S. government's purchasing power is leveraged to benefit all consumers.
\
One of my core beliefs is, ""If it isn't perfect, make it better.""
\
When it comes to pursuing a clean energy economy, we can do better. And we must.
\
On Dec. 13, public, private and academic leaders will gather at the University of Delaware to discuss how our federal and state government -- along with others -- can improve their leadership roles in what many foresee as the next industrial revolution. As concerned citizens who want a brighter future for our children, we must contribute to this meaningful dialogue.

NEWARK -- The demise of federal ""cap-and-trade"" legislation that would have made carbon-based fuels more expensive poses a major setback to ""clean-energy"" industries that major corporations, Delaware and other states were banking on for future jobs and economic growth, industry and government officials said Monday.
\
At a University of Delaware ""clean-tech"" forum, speakers said Congress is unlikely to resurrect a House-passed bill that would have capped industrial carbon dioxide emissions and allowed low-polluting companies to sell permits to pollute to others.
\
Such a system was intended to provide economic incentives for companies to clean up their act, and would have boosted the prospects of companies selling equipment producing clean energy -- such as DuPont -- or capturing carbon emissions. Supporters say that would have generated jobs.
\
Now that a conservative electoral wave has buried cap-and-trade, advocates for clean technology enterprises are looking for a new strategy.
\
Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., spoke for many when he said: ""What do we do, give up? I don't think so. You have to move forward.""
\
State officials had high hopes that solar development research, such as the work touted Monday by DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman, could help on that path.
\
Federal policymakers may need to reach out to industries that make environmentalists uneasy, officials said at the ""Creating the Clean Energy Economy.""
\
Putting a price on carbon emissions was highly desirable because of the long-term stability it would have provided, said Dirk Matthys, chairman and CEO of Gamesa Technology Corp., which makes wind turbines at a reclaimed steel works outside Philadelphia.
\
The company has been considering getting into the domestic offshore wind business, possibly building plants to make huge turbines if the U.S. offshore wind industry took off.
\
But without a price tag affixed to carbon emissions, alternative energy generators will continue to struggle to be competitive with electricity generated from coal, or oil or natural gas.
\
An alternate approach Matthys said might form a fallback strategy would be establishment of a national renewable-energy standard requiring utilities to buy a set percentage of their energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. Delaware has a version of this in place, with electric utilities required to buy 25 percent of their power from clean sources by 2025.
\
Carper said a nationwide standard also is unlikely in a Congress now divided and aware of voter opposition to anti-carbon plans that might raise electric prices for consumers already struggling to make ends meet.
\
He advocated a ""first cousin"" of the renewable energy approach, which he said stands some chance of passage in the coming year. Adding nuclear and ""really clean coal"" to sources qualifying for a renewable -- or clean power -- standard could help get it passed, Carper said.
\
Even natural gas, a fossil fuel with fewer carbon emissions than coal, could be added to the mix. The nonrenewable sources could be phased out over time, he said.
\
Carper's comments were a reference to a plan floated by U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last week, which would require utilities to buy 25 percent of their load from low-pollution sources, including nuclear, by 2025, and 50 percent by 2050.
\
""There is a great opportunity to create jobs if we can figure out a way to create energy in ways that are less offensive to our environment,"" Carper said.
\
The clean-energy standard Carper discussed is ""a good start,"" Matthys said. ""It's politically more digestible.""
\
But even that plan found opposition in Delaware among both environmentalists and tea party supporters, who campaign heavily against cap-and-trade as a ""hidden tax.""
\
Thurman Brendlinger, of the Clean Air Council, said affixing cost on carbon emissions was vital to transitioning to a clean-energy economy. His group was hesitant to call natural gas clean because it is a fossil fuel, and ""so-called clean coal we want to get away from as well.""
\
Chad Tolman, of Delaware's chapter of the Sierra Club, said coal gasification is unproven, new methods of extracting natural gas risk environmental contamination, and nuclear energy carries major risks.
\
At the other end of the spectrum was Russ Murphy, founder and executive director of the 9-12 Delaware Patriots, which opposed cap-and-trade. His group will be holding statewide meetings, starting with one in Bowers Beach on Wednesday, to discuss the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Northeast regional version of cap-and-trade, which he said will lead to higher utility bills.
\
Such approaches won't help because many pollutants blow in from other regions and other countries, he said.
\
""There's got to be a level playing field worldwide, not just here in America,"" Murphy said.
\
The global market also was on the minds of Gov. Jack Markell, who just returned from a recent trade mission to the Far East, and Ellen Kullman, CEO of the DuPont Co., which is investing heavily into photovoltaic materials for solar panels and sees rapid growth in that sector around the world.
\
Markell noted that Asian companies -- and nations -- are pressing for development of solar industries, noting the manufacturing prowess of China, as well as Taiwan, the home country of Motech, which has a small solar-panel factory in Newark.
\
""It is clear these countries are absolutely playing to win,"" Markell said. ""I am absolutely convinced that when we step it up a notch, as we absolutely must, we will prevail.""
\
Adding solar manufacturing jobs will be challenging, because Chinese factories are able to beat domestic factories on price, said Collin O'Mara, Delaware's natural resources secretary. Consumers may be willing to pay more for quality, but a solar panel can only be so good, he said.
\
""We need to figure out how we can make ourselves more cost-competitive, or risk becoming professional consumers,"" O'Mara said.
\
Energy efficiency can create jobs here, O'Mara said. ""You can't retrofit a home from China,"" he said.
\
Kullman said her company's work with solar panels -- building thin-film solar cells and components for solar modules -- has been booming, and sales are expected to double by 2014. She touted her company's commitment to biofuels like cellulosic ethanol and biobutanol.
\
Michael Chajes, engineering dean at UD, said that with the proper government price signals in place, the logical clean-energy jobs to come to Delaware would come from building wind-turbine blades. They're huge, and with their intricate design, it's better to make them nearby than transport them, he said.
\
Research and development would also be a natural jobs creator in Delaware, although ""it may not be as massive as manufacturing,"" Chajes said.
\
Without reliable government policy, though, companies are unable to make long-term decisions, said Robert Birkmire, director of the Institute for Energy Conversion, a longtime solar research lab at UD. Support for research and development is a critical way to keep the country competitive, he said.
\
""This is a booming area, and we are going to be left in the dust if we aren't able to change this,"" Birkmire said. ""What we need is a national energy strategy.""
\
Former Sen. Ted Kaufman said that strategy needs to be sold in a certain way to get through Congress.
\
""Making the argument for climate change is a great argument to make, I think it's going to kill us. But the argument has to be about jobs,"" Kaufman said.

""We need to replenish the fund and then we need to get serious about six-year funding.""
\
Sen. Tom Carper
\
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Tom Carper on Thursday proposed adding 12 cents to the federal gas tax over three years as a way to sustain the dwindling Highway Trust Fund.
\
The Delaware Democrat introduced his proposal as an amendment to legislation being debated in the Senate Finance Committee that takes a short-term approach to shoring up the trust fund.
\
Under Carper's proposal, the gas tax would increase by 4 cents a year for three years and would increase after that based on inflation.
\
""The idea of simply doing this stop-and-go, stop-and-go stuff, that we've been guilty of for a number of years - it's wasteful,"" Carper told fellow committee members during Thursday's work session. ""We've got to stop doing it.""
\
The Highway Trust Fund, financed mainly by gas taxes, is expected to experience a shortfall by this summer. Carper said he supports legislation that would sustain the fund through the calendar year so the federal government can meet commitments to states for transportation projects.
\
But a long-term bill is most cost-effective and would give states the certainty they need to fund larger projects, he said. A gas tax increase, he said, would help pay for a six-year transportation bill that passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in May.
\
""We need to replenish the fund and then we need to get serious about six-year funding,"" said Carper, who also chairs the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
\
Carper has long called for a gradual increase in the federal gas tax. In three years, his proposal would bring the federal gas tax - now 18.4 cents per gallon - to 30.3 cents per gallon and the diesel tax to 36.3 cents per gallon.
\
That's what both taxes would be worth in three years had they been indexed to inflation in 1993, the last time the gas tax was increased.
\
Absent the link to inflation, the gas tax has lost about one-third of its purchasing power in the last 21 years, according to Carper's office. Under his proposal, the tax rates would increase automatically every year after three years, based on inflation .
\
The Finance Committee is expected to vote on amendments during a later work session.
\
Delaware's state gas tax - now 23 cents per gallon - hasn't been increased since 1995.
\
Gov. Jack Markell proposed raising the Delaware tax by 10 cents, but the proposal was taken off the table for this session. Instead, state lawmakers agreed to raise weekend tolls on Del. 1 to finance $10 million in paving projects. The state also will borrow $20 million for additional paving.

Sen. Tom Carper
"
67,"
U.S. Sen. Tom Carper hasn't given up on a long-term solution to federal transportation funding, insisting the lame-duck Congress is the ideal opportunity for success.
\
With the lowest gas prices in years, Delaware's senior senator hopes that lame-duck lawmakers returning to their Washington offices this week will endorse a bipartisan deal to raise the federal gas tax and sustain the dwindling Highway Trust Fund.
\
Nationally, the average price of gas has declined for 50 days in a row - the longest consecutive decline since 2008, according to the auto club AAA Mid-Atlantic, and the trend could continue. The average price at Delaware pumps on Friday was $2.85 a gallon, compared with $3.21 a gallon a year ago.
\
""It's the perfect environment to fix the problem,"" Carper said Friday. ""Consumers, frankly, wouldn't notice.""
\
Joshua L. Schank, president of the nonpartisan Eno Center for Transportation, agrees it's good to strike while the cost of gas is low, but he doesn't see Republicans supporting the measure, even with lame ducks.
\
""Most people don't know what the federal gas tax is, and they wouldn't know if it was raised. It's such a potentially insignificant amount,"" Schank said. ""It's great that somebody's trumpeting how we need to pay for transportation, but one senator does not a law make.""
\
During the recent recess, Carper and allies spent time continuing to grow their coalition in favor of addressing the issue before January, even listening to Republicans' thoughts on different options to fund it, he said.
\
The lame-duck session - before Republicans take control of the Senate next year - is the best time to push for the hike, said Carper, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
\
A dozen or more lawmakers on their way out might be swayed to ""do the right thing,"" he said. The same goes for a similar number who won't run for reelection when their terms expire in 2016, Carper said.
\
Federal funding for highways, bridges and transit makes up roughly half of all spending on infrastructure. The Highway Trust Fund provides billions annually for state and local highway and transit projects.
\
It relies heavily on the 18.4 cents a gallon federal tax on gasoline - a rate set in 1993. The tax has since lost 35 percent of its purchasing power. The highway program is now operating under a short-term bill that expires in May.
\
Groups from AAA to the American Trucking Association to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have implored Congress to shore up the trust fund and pass a long-term bill to address a crumbling, congested highway and freight network.
\
Carper would fund it over four years with a 12 cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax, and a 20-cent increase a gallon for diesel. The tax would be indexed to increase with inflation going forward.
\
Carper knows from talks with Republican colleagues, including Utah's Sen. Orrin Hatch, they'd want to offset any hike with spending cuts elsewhere, and those cuts need not be dollar-for-dollar, he said. The Obama administration wants to fix the problem by closing corporate tax loopholes.
\
""I'm not going away. I think it's the right thing to do,"" Carper said. ""We can't keep kicking the can down the road.""
\
The easy thing, of course, is to keep kicking that can. But some GOP leaders have indicated a need to get away from borrowing to pay for highway construction. Others want to push the burden onto the states.
\
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in September told ABC's ""This Week"" that ""tax reform, a big highway bill, certainly are in the realm of doable"" in the next two years.
\
Carper's bill would originate in the Senate Finance Committee, where tax decisions are made and where Hatch is in line for chairmanship.
\
""You'd have to get [the Senate] to agree to something that Orrin Hatch almost certainly would oppose were he the chair,"" Schank said.
\
""That's the tricky part of a lame-duck session. On one hand, you might be able to get senators or congressmen to say, Let's do this now, so we can blame it on the Democrats before the Republicans are in charge. The fact is, the Republicans can stop it if they want to.""

""If we're not willing to pay for those things, we frankly shouldn't have them.""
\
Sen. Tom Carper
\
WASHINGTON -- As Delaware Gov. Jack Markell aggressively pushes for a state gas tax increase, Sen. Tom Carper will be making a similar pitch at the national level for an increase in the federal gas tax to help shore up a Highway Trust Fund that is fast approaching a shortfall.
\
Neither the federal nor the state gas tax has been increased in two decades. Carper, D-Del., whose committee assignments give him a powerful voice on such matters, said a variety of funding sources likely will have to be tapped to replenish the federal trust fund, which is projected to run out of money later this year.
\
One idea he supports is raising the 18.4 cent federal gas tax three or four cents a year for up to four years, then linking increases in the tax to increases in inflation. That would slowly restore the current tax's purchasing power to where it was when it was set in 1993, he said.
\
""If we think it's important to have roads that are in good shape, bridges that are not about to collapse, that our highways are efficient and in good condition, then it's worth paying for,"" Carper said. ""If we're not willing to pay for those things, we frankly shouldn't have them.""
\
Carper chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is writing the next bill to renew surface transportation projects. He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which is in charge of paying for it.
\
He plans to meet individually with his colleagues on the Finance Committee when Congress returns from recess and discuss revenue options for the Highway Trust Fund. A gas tax increase makes sense, he said, because the collection system is already in place and people who drive more pay a significant part of maintaining and improving the system.
\
""I think it's one of those things where people know we have to summon the political courage to do something,"" he said. ""Ultimately, I may come out of those meetings and say, 'There is no appetite for doing anything until after the election.' Maybe that will be the case. I hope not.""
\
Funding falling short
\
The Highway Trust Fund, financed mainly with gas taxes, has dwindled as people drive less and vehicles become more fuel efficient. Delaware has delayed a host of federal transportation projects because of uncertainty caused by the federal fund's impending insolvency, according to the Delaware Department of Transportation. Insufficient funding for the state transportation fund also has put work on state road projects at risk, the department says.
\
Markell's proposed 10-cent increase in the state's 23-cent gas tax and more borrowing would help cover $500 million in additional transportation spending over five years. Thirty-three states have a fixed tax on motor fuels and 26 have increased their gas taxes since 1992, according to State Policy Reports.
\
But Markell's proposal faces strong opposition in Delaware. The Delaware Chamber of Commerce has told him that raising the state gas tax to finance infrastructure projects should be a last resort.
\
Talk of a potential federal hike as well further imperils Markell's ""very unpopular"" proposal with state legislators, said Delaware Senate Minority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford.
\
""This is just a bad time for the economy to be adding another tax on people's backs,"" said Simpson, who favors spending cuts over tax increases.
\
Markell was not available for comment. His spokesman said the governor has supported the congressional delegation's efforts to invest more in infrastructure. But Markell's plan to shore up Delaware's ""chronically underfunded"" transportation fund isn't tied to ""any particular action or inaction in Washington,"" Jonathon Dworkin said in a statement.
\
""The governor has called for a balanced approach to address the shortfall and has been talking about the issue with legislators and citizens around the state, because as businesses, labor organizations, and others have recognized, we must act to make our roads safer, put thousands of Delawareans to work, and promote economic development,"" Dworkin said.
\
The price of stagnant taxes
\
Thirty percent of Delaware's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition, and 20 percent of its bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, according to an analysis of the latest information available by TRIP, a nonprofit transportation research group. Driving on roads in need of repair costs Delaware motorists $228 million a year - $318 per motorist - in extra vehicle repairs and operating costs, the report says.
\
Unless Congress provides more transportation revenue, federal funding for highway and transit improvements in Delaware could be cut by $175 million starting in October, according to TRIP.
\
Federal officials have told states that as the Highway Trust Fund shrinks to $4 billion, which is expected to happen in July, they will have to slow or stop payments on projects, which could include ongoing work along Interstate 95 and a widening of State Route 26. That could force Delaware to use a $50 million line of credit, opened last year, to keep construction going while federal officials figure out the next steps, said Shailen Bhatt, Markell's transportation secretary.
\
""Until I hear that is not occurring, we're just in a very guarded mode, a very defensive posture about any of our projects with federal funding,"" Bhatt said. ""For projects that are ready to go, which could be addressing a safety issue ... I'm not going to start that project because I don't want to create new projects that I'm not going to have funding on.""
\
Advocacy groups, along with state and local transportation agencies, argue that the federal gas tax is too low. Democrats in Congress have tried to raise it, but Republicans have been steadfast in opposition. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said there is no appetite for raising the tax this election year.
\
Taking up the challenge
\
Carper said every idea for shoring up the Highway Trust Fund raises its own concerns, and he doesn't agree that lawmakers who support increasing the gas tax do so at their own political peril. News leaked in about 24 hours, he said, when he and former Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, proposed a gas tax increase in a 2010 letter to a presidential commission studying ways to reduce the debt and deficit. Back then, a colleague told him the proposal would come back to haunt him during his re-election race in 2012.
\
""I just want to be able to tell my colleagues, look, George Voinovich and I proposed a penny a month [increase] for 25 months, and in my last re-election I got two-thirds of the vote,"" he said.
\
If lawmakers can't agree, they could transfer money from the Treasury's general fund to the Highway Trust Fund, as they've done in recent years. Since 2008, about $53 billion has been transferred to the highway fund, and the Congressional Budget Office projects the fund will require a $15 billion transfer in fiscal 2015, according to State Policy Reports. But that would add to the deficit.
\
Carper said he hopes it won't come to that.
\
""I prefer for us to take up the challenge and show some courage and take away the uncertainty for state and local governments,"" he said. ""This is terribly inefficient for state and local governments trying to plan their construction season.""

STATE, U.S. SYSTEMS FACE CRISIS
\
By SUMMER HARLOW
\
The News Journal
\
The biggest hurdle to improving Delaware's transportation system is nothing new: There's not enough money.
\
Last year, state lawmakers approved about $1 billion in new revenue to come from increased tolls and motor-vehicle fees.
\
But the General Assembly stopped $500 million short of providing the total the transportation department requested for projects it said were needed in the next six years. Legislators refused to consider raising the gas tax, as Transportation Secretary Carolann Wicks had proposed.
\
""We should have raised the gas tax last year; no one would have noticed because gas has gone up and down so much,"" said Beverley Baxter, Committee of 100 executive director. ""Five cents would have done so much, it would have made all the difference.""
\
This is the second straight year DelDOT has delayed projects because of a lack of funding.
\
""There are places all through the state feeling the strain of summer traffic or commuter traffic, feeling the strain of not enough capacity or inadequate paving,"" Wicks said.
\
By 2030, without new roads or lanes, travel delays in northern Delaware will double, with the average rush-hour trip taking 61 percent longer than during off-peak hours, according to a 2007 report from the nonprofit TRIP.
\
With little funding for long-delayed road projects, it is hard to make a case for underwriting transit, DelDOT officials said. But by increasing the number of transit users, the need for costly road construction is reduced, said Delaware Transit Corp. Executive Director Stephen Kingsberry.
\
Transit is expensive, though -- user fares amount to about 15 percent of DART's annual budget.
\
But, counters Dave Gula, Wilmington Area Planning Council senior planner, all highways are subsidized, and no one complains about that.
\
""So why should transit be any different?"" he said. ""It's cheaper to run a new bus line than to build a new road.""
\
It's time to come up with new, bold ways of funding transportation, Wicks said.
\
""Our environment and energy policies are going counter to each other,"" she said. ""We can certainly be leaders in that, to look ahead, not just two years, but where we'll be in 10 years, or 15 years, and what that means for the transportation trust fund.""
\
Raising the gas tax
\
Just as Delaware's transportation trust fund, which pays for road construction projects, has not kept pace with inflation or the needs of a growing state, the national transportation trust fund is projected to be empty by the end of this year.
\
Both funds are fed primarily by the gas tax. But as drivers become more conscious of rising fuel costs and more attracted to cars with better gas mileage, officials are worried transportation funding might suffer.
\
The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission has proposed ways to keep the national transportation trust fund solvent, and officials say some of the ideas could work here.
\
First, the commission recommended boosting the federal fuel tax 5 to 8 cents per gallon per year for the next five years, after which automatic increases would be tied to inflation. The commission also called for states to increase fuel taxes.
\
But after 2025, the commission says, new forms of steady revenue will be needed.
\
'Congestion pricing'
\
Highway user fees, in the form of tolls and congestion pricing, are one idea.
\
Congestion pricing is a burgeoning effort to tackle diminishing revenues and worsening traffic. For example, drivers might pay a premium to drive during rush hour.
\
The toll system on Del. 1, where tolls double on the weekends to correspond with a jump in beach traffic, is a form of congestion pricing.
\
High-occupancy toll lanes, in cities like Denver and Minneapolis, charge variable rates, depending on traffic conditions.
\
Congestion pricing has been called a ""silver bullet,"" said Robert Puentes, a fellow at the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program.
\
Researchers applaud congestion pricing because they say it encourages drivers to stay off busy roads during peak hours or to take alternate, less-crowded routes. But the transportation commission warns it can impose a hardship on those who must drive during rush hour.
\
The commission also is encouraging states to use public-private partnerships, such as the long-term leasing of toll roads. Delaware has passed -- although never used -- legislation authorizing public-private agreements.
\
Under such long-term leases, control -- and toll revenue -- is turned over to a company in exchange for potentially billions of dollars upfront. Delaware has considered public-private partnerships, such as leasing I-95, which estimates say could bring in as much as $4 billion.
\
Most Delawareans are opposed to leasing the state's highways, according to a poll released last year.
\
Paying per mile
\
Another idea is charging drivers for vehicle miles traveled -- a real road-user fee.
\
Several organizations say it is the best option for replacing the gas tax.
\
A pilot study in Oregon outfitted 285 vehicles with devices that measured the number of miles driven. At the gas station, rather than paying a gas tax, drivers instead paid a flat fee, about 1.2 cents a mile. The fee generated roughly the same revenue as the gas tax.
\
Volunteers were offered $300 for their participation in the 12-month Road User Fee Pilot Program.
\
The study's final report concluded that such a mileage fee is viable, and the challenge is to determine how to implement the system.
\
Wicks said she doesn't know enough about the pilot program to say that it would be successful in Delaware, but it's something to consider.
\
""We always want to be looking ahead for the best things to get new revenues,"" she said.
\
The problem, Puentes said, is that a vehicle-miles-traveled fee is long-term and doesn't solve the looming financial crisis.
\
The national transportation trust fund is projected to go belly up around Election Day in November, he said, and ""states are broke, so something has to give on the finance side. ... We need to figure out how to spend our dollars more effectively.""

Gov. Markell's proposed 10-cent-per-gallon gas tax for roads, bridges and infrastructure improvements - if this was so important, why did he and lawmakers move $40 million from the road and bridge 2014 fund to cover higher costs, not to repair roads and bridges?
\
It appears our infrastructure is not in need of repairs after all. We definitely do not need a 10-cent gas tax increase.
\
This is just another case of poor money management by our government.
\
All they ever want to do is raise taxes for one item and spend it on other pet projects or to cover higher costs (whatever that means).
\
It is time our governing body tell the truth about how our tax money is spent.

More reasons to support sports complex
\
I am writing in support of the proposed Kent County Regional Sports Complex, as I am the executive director for the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Milford and serve as the Board of Directors secretary for Kent County Tourism, and feel very passionate about this project.
\
At the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Milford, we focus on economic development, and the sports complex is projected to bring many jobs (at all levels of education and experience) to our area. During these stressful times when businesses are closing and people are losing their jobs, the sports complex will bring a positive growth opportunity and positive economic impact for people who are employed and/or have family members that are employed at the complex.
\
In addition to employing people in our community, the sports complex will also support the businesses in the greater Milford area. When teams come to Delaware to participate at the sports complex, the athletes and their families will be staying in our hotels, eating at our restaurants, visiting our museums and tourist attractions, and shopping in our stores.
\
With projected annual revenue of $10 million to $18 million and having a need for an outdoor athletic facility that is centrally located in this region, it only makes sense to build and support the sports complex in Frederica.

State's energy plans need revision
\
Last Sunday's paper announced PPL Corp. plans to spend billions to build a 725-mile system of electric transmission lines to bring energy from the Marcellus Shale natural gas fields to customers on the East Coast.
\
Meanwhile in Washington last week, Gov. Markell made a speech praising our progress in ""clean energy"" focusing primarily on natural gas, barely mentioning renewable sources.
\
Also last week, the Joint Green Energy Program by DNREC and the SEU proposed $1.5 million annually for two years to finance energy credits. That's nice, but a paltry sum when compared to the billions spent to promote natural gas by private and government sources.
\
While Maryland still works on developing a wind turbine project, Delaware's project was ended by NRG Energy, which purchased Bluewater Wind when the global market shook their finances. So, a fossil fuel company was able to purchase a possible competitor and shut it down?
\
The story that renewable energy is not profitable or developed enough to be viable is nonsense.
\
Capital is flowing to development of the industry already in control while renewables are shortchanged.
\
We are being sold the idea that natural gas is a clean fuel. It is not.
\
Substituting gas for coal is not a solution. It continues down the wrong path. We need a change of direction.
\
A national and state energy policy that promotes renewables over fossil fuels would provide thousands of additional jobs and bring prosperity to the state.
\
Unlike our current policy, it would also benefit human health and the environment.

U.S. could make synthetic gasoline from native coal
\
I remember reading how allied bombers during World War II targeted German synthetic gasoline plants to cripple the Nazi war machine. The United States developed a method to extract gasoline from coal in 1935. There is a plant in West Virginia that the government shut down. It uses a hydrogenation process that turns coal directly into gasoline.
\
The United States has ample coal resources. We could eliminate our slavery to the Arab countries. South Africa uses this method now and no longer imports Arab oil.
\
Why don't we hear about this? Could oil companies control our politicians that much? I think I know the answer.

Coastal Zone protects all the land we'll ever have

Go to Delaware City, look at the refinery there and imagine our coastline looking like that all the way down toward the beaches. Had it not been for Gov. Russell Peterson and others who fashioned the Coastal Zone Act almost 40 years ago, that is probably what our coastline would look today.

Metachem's long history of violations is expensive

\
In September 1981, five thousand gallons of monochlorobenzene were released while filling a railroad car. On Jan. 5, 1986, a release of 400,000 gallons of para-dichlorobenzene and approximately 169,000 gallons of trichlorobenzene were released due to an above-ground tank failure. In 1986, a spill of 569,000 gallons of volatile organic compounds happened when a holding tank ruptured.
\
The corporation was assessed a civil penalty of $150,000 on March 3, 1993, by DNREC for violations of a Clean Water Act permit held for a wastewater treatment plant.
\
The company was sued by DNREC in 1995, and ordered to remove 300,000 gallons of stockpiled tetrachlorobenzene over a three-year period from 1995 to 1997. The corporation failed to comply with this court order. On March 15, 1996, DNREC launched an investigation to confirm the corporation was in violation of the court's order.
\
On July 11, 1997, the U.S. Department of Labor issued two citations.
\
On May 18, 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency filed a lawsuit against the corporation for repeatedly violating federal rules designed to reduce chlorobenzene leaks. EPA assessed a $349,500 penalty.

In March 2000, DNREC issued a cease and decease order to shut down a production line.

We now have a stockpile of the byproduct tetrachlorobenzene, an astronomical cleanup expense for taxpayers of the state, fat and happy company owners living out of state, and the same political culture governing these companies.

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Tom Carper is growing weary of short-term fixes for long-term problems.
\
Last year, the Delaware Democrat voted against a compromise of tax increases and spending cuts aimed at avoiding the ""fiscal cliff"" - a compromise supported by most senators - because it postponed consideration of a ""grand bargain"" on fiscal issues.
\
Now, Carper is fighting a funding plan for highway projects for a similar reason - it would allow lawmakers to punt on their responsibility to fund a long-term transportation bill until next year.
\
When the full Senate takes up the bill, likely next week, he'll propose an amendment he says would force Congress to come up with a long-term transportation strategy before Christmas.
\
""The idea there is to create a dynamic that will compel the Congress to do something that we are oftentimes loathe to do, and that is to do something that's hard, something that's difficult, but something that we know in our hearts is the right thing to do,"" Carper said.
\
The Highway Trust Fund, which relies mostly on the federal gas tax to finance federal transportation projects, is expected to become insolvent this summer without congressional action. Many lawmakers agree that a short-term funding ""patch"" is needed so the federal government can meet commitments to reimburse states for transportation projects.
\
The question is how long the patch should last.
\
The White House, concerned about transportation funding running out and putting jobs at risk this summer, has endorsed a Republican House-passed plan that would transfer about $11 billion - mostly from general revenue - to fund the program short-term. An administration statement says Congress should work to pass a long-term transportation bill ""well before"" the patch expires on May 31.
\
But Carper says ""we're fooling ourselves"" to believe Congress will make difficult choices this year without an earlier deadline. Congress has approved 11 short-term extensions in the Highway Trust Fund in the last five years, and the House measure would perpetuate that cycle, he said. That approach is inefficient, expensive and creates uncertainty that hurts states' ability to plan for long-term projects, he said.
\
Carper's goal is to fund the projects included in a six-year transportation authorization bill that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed in May. He chairs the committee's Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee and is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which is responsible for funding the measure.
\
His amendment would keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent through December, putting pressure on lawmakers to come up with long-term solution - such as an increase in the federal gas tax, which Carper supports - in this Congress rather than the next. He has said he would oppose the House-passed extension on the Senate floor.
\
Carper has taken similarly hard positions in the past on legislation that he viewed as postponing long-term solutions. A veteran, he was one of three senators in February who opposed repealing cuts to some military pensions, saying the legislation undermined progress on deficit reduction.
\
In January 2013, he was among eight senators who voted against the fiscal cliff compromise negotiated by Delaware's former senior senator, Vice President Joe Biden. That deal increased taxes on households earning more than $450,000 a year, extended unemployment benefits and delayed massive, automatic spending cuts for two months.
\
Carper said the deal walked away from the chance to enact meaningful entitlement and tax reform.
\
""That was not a fun vote to cast, but it was the right vote to cast,"" he said. ""I have no regrets.""
\
On July 10, Carper was the lone no vote during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the Highway Trust Fund compromise. At that hearing, he offered his amendment to adjust the timeline, telling colleagues, ""We can put pressure on us to do the job that we need to do."" But the amendment failed, 10-14.
\
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee's top-ranking Republican, said the Senate needs ""breathing room"" to come up with the best deal, and imposing an ""artificial deadline"" isn't a good idea.
\
""We all share the same goal,"" he said. ""We want to get to a long-term solution.""
\
If lawmakers postpone long-term action until next year, the path forward for transportation legislation gets complicated. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee would have to pass a new bill authorizing long-term transportation projects. And it's possible that task - as well as a funding measure - would fall to new leaders if Republicans take control of the Senate after the November elections.
\
A transportation bill also would compete with other urgent issues early next year, including the extension of the nation's debt ceiling.
\
""If work is not completed on a long-term bill by the time Congress adjourns the whole process - (in) both the House and Senate - we'll have to start all over,"" said Jack Basso, a former Transportation Department official and now an adviser on transportation finance issues. ""And that can take an extended period of time to actually accomplish.""
\
The American Trucking Associations released a statement Wednesday backing the Carper plan.
\
Carper said Senate Finance Committee leaders gave him only 30 minutes warning that he'd be allowed to offer his amendment, and he didn't have time to win over other committee members. Still, the measure won support from three Republicans and seven Democrats.
\
Carper said he's now working to win votes from most Democrats and a handful of Republicans on the Senate floor. He will introduce his amendment measure with Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. It will be one of only four amendments considered.
\
""I think I have a responsibility to show some leadership,"" he said. ""I'm trying to do that.""

""We demonstrated this week that there is a coalition of the willing that is just as eager as I am to enact a long-term transportation bill before the end of this Congress.""
\
Sen. Tom Carper
\
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Tom Carper equated Senate passage of his transportation measure this week with ""magic.""
\
But in the end, the spell wore off.
\
House members voted 272-150 to reject the Senate version of the highway spending bill this week that Carper, D-Delaware, successfully had amended. Facing a Friday deadline for keeping federal money for transportation projects flowing, the Senate approved the House version 81-13.
\
That means funding will be assured through May. Carper wanted to shorten the bill's time frame to the end of December, figuring that would pressure lawmakers to develop a long-term transportation strategy during the lame-duck session, the most likely time for action.
\
The Senate passed the measure, with Carper's amendment attached, 79-18 on Tuesday.
\
""This week, we saw magic happen in the Senate,"" Carper said in a statement. ""The institution functioned as our Founding Fathers intended -- we debated, we offered amendments, we worked across party lines.""
\
But House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had said the House wouldn't accept financing changes from the Senate, and his office seized on a technical drafting error in the measure that resulted in a significant funding gap in the Senate bill.
\
Carper was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the House's version of the legislation on Friday.
\
""This marks the 12th time in five years that Congress has resorted to short-term patches for transportation funding,"" Carper said. ""Our states, cities and businesses deserve more certainty to plan and execute the projects that will restore our aging transportation system and grow our economy. The millions of Americans we depend on to do this work deserve certainty about whether or not they have a job, and families in this country deserve more convenient, affordable and safer commutes.""
\
Federal money for transportation projects comes from the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed mostly by the federal gas tax. The trust fund has been teetering close to insolvency, and federal transportation officials had said they would begin limiting transportation-related reimbursements to states on Aug. 1.
\
Carper has worked to find a long-term way to fund transportation projects included in a six-year authorization bill the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed in May. He chairs the committee's Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee and is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which is responsible for funding the authorization measure.
\
""We demonstrated this week that there is a coalition of the willing that is just as eager as I am to enact a long-term transportation bill before the end of this Congress,"" he said. ""That coalition includes Democrats and Republicans, business and labor leaders, truckers, motorists, transit riders and even cyclists. During the August recess and after we return to Washington in September, I will continue to work with this broad coalition to ensure Congress does what it is elected to do -- govern and lead by example.""
\
Carper's amendment also differed from the House bill in how the extension would be financed. The House bill lets companies defer pension payments, thereby increasing their corporate taxes when they report higher profits. Carper's proposal omitted such ""pension smoothing,"" which opponents rejected as a ""gimmick,"" and made other financing changes.
\
Rep. John Carney, D-Del., was among 45 Democratic House members who voted in favor of the Senate version, which he said omitted budgetary gimmicks and would force Congress to act on transportationissues.
\
""We've got to use the time between now and May to find a permanent solution -- we cannot let this extension distract our attention away from the issue of funding our nation's roads and bridges,"" Carney said in a statement.

WASHINGTON -- The nation's transportation system is threatened by short-term federal funding measures and will be ""in trouble"" unless it gets more money, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told USA TODAY reporters Wednesday.
\
Uncertainty resulting from the lack of a long-term transportation bill has cost jobs and has left state and local transportation officials unsure how to finance projects that will take years to complete, he said.
\
Infrastructure in Delaware and other states is aging and the federal government isn't spending enough to maintain it, Foxx said. Delawareans pay more to maintain their vehicles -- more than $380 annually -- than they would if the system were in better shape, he said.
\
""This issue affects every community, every user of our system, whether they're driving, whether they're using transit in some way,"" Foxx said. ""And I don't see how we can get through this in a good way as a country without Congress coming to the table and actually passing a long-term transportation bill.""
\
Congress passed its latest short-term fix in August, but that measure assures funding only through May. Democrats and Republicans don't agree on how to pay for projects that would be part of a long-term bill.
\
The issue has been a priority for Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who has pushed for a spending bill to finance a six-year authorization measure that passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in May.
\
The committee's bill would reauthorize federal highway transportation programs at current levels plus inflation. Carper has met with House and Senate leaders and has helped build a coalition working to pass a funding bill during the lame-duck session. ""We're not about to give up,"" he said during an interview.
\
Following the latest short-term federal fix, Delaware moved forward with transportation projects scheduled for fiscal 2015. But state Transportation Secretary Shailen Bhatt said the outgoing Congress needs to act before the end of the year to restore the Highway Trust Fund. The fund finances transportation projects, mostly using revenue from the federal gas tax.
\
""Improving safety and repairing aging infrastructure during the spring and summer construction season depends on states knowing this winter that federal money will be available,"" Bhatt said in a statement. ""In Delaware, we have a contingency borrowing strategy in place that will allow us to move projects forward for a short while, but states should not have to engage in creative financing to solve a federal budget problem.""
\
Foxx said that even if transportation programs are funded at current levels for the next six years, ""we're going to be in trouble because we actually are under-invested in the system to begin with.""
\
Foxx said he's ""hopeful"" Congress can move forward with a long-term bill during the lame-duck session, but he's prepared for the possibility that such a bill won't come until next year. In that event, committee work on such a bill would have to start over in the 114th Congress, when Republicans will control the Senate and have a larger majority in the House.
\
Aging infrastructure is a bipartisan problem, Foxx said.
\
""Democrats and Republicans are stuck in traffic. Democrats and Republicans are stuck on potholes,"" Foxx said. ""Democrats and Republicans are actually paying the cost of a system that's failing us because they're having to repair their cars more frequently, they're having to realize expenses they wouldn't have to realize if the system were better maintained and if we were putting new capacity out there.""
\
Foxx said communities already are seeing the impact of cumulative short-term funding measures. Transportation officials in Tennessee say they will delay projects worth $400 million, he said, and ""that's not the last shoe to drop on this issue.""
\
The country's growing population will put increasing pressure on the transportation system, especially as construction projects are pulled back.
\
""That's setting us up as a country to see the gridlock in Washington translate into gridlock for the whole country,"" he said. ""Not where we want to be.""

As the leader of the Republican Party in Wilmington, I agree with a recent letter writer to The News Journal who urged city Republicans to change their party registration so they can vote in the Sept. 13 Democratic primary.
\
I support the letter writer's reasoning that the GOP is unlikely to find a substantive mayoral candidate who can win, so it makes sense to put our GOP votes to good use and support a credible Democrat. I urge my fellow Republicans to support an experienced leader, a former federal prosecutor who will be tough on crime and a caring person who is committed to moving our city forward.
\
Please switch your party registration and vote on Sept. 13 for Theo Gregory, who is, by far, the best choice for both parties and for our city's future.

I am perplexed by DNREC's recent decision to close the Polly Drummond Hill drop-off site for yard waste and to reopen it in May, but only on Saturdays.
\
In 2007 it banned yard waste from the Cherry Island Landfill and asked us citizens to dispose of our yard waste on our own. Based on the usage of the drop-off site since then, it is obvious that as good stewards of the environment, we responded to the plea with great enthusiasm. Until recently you could see all types of vehicles lined up on Saturday and Sunday to drop off their yard waste.
\
The alternative Holland Mulch site they suggested has limited hours, and on the weekend, when most homeowners clean up their yards, it is only open until noon on Saturday. It appears DNREC is making it harder for us to do our part to protect the environment.
\
I urge DNREC to provide the funding to reopen the Polly Drummond drop-off site with hours that more closely align with the needs of the taxpayers.

Incorrectly spending our money
\
Everybody who thinks that the Democratically controlled government of Delaware will ever lower or eliminate a 10-cent gas tax, please raise your hand, and then please promise me you won't vote ever again. Can anyone tell me if the state has ever lowered a user tax?
\
I do have a counter-offer, a 5-cent increase with an absolute 12-month life, with no amendments being added to this bill. It must be voted in or out on its own merits, and it must be written in plain English. It can't be continued ""at all""; a new bill must be passed ""after"" this one has expired, and you can't submit the new bill until this bill expires. This will allow for a full accounting of the money collected, and we must know exactly how and where it was spent. We the people do not need any new roads; we need repairs to roads and bridges. You must stop spending our money your way and start doing it our way. After all, it's our money.

Deal with honesty about President Obama
\
Recently, a published letter to the editor accused President Obama of using executive action more than any other president to ""spit in the face of the constitution.""
\
This is false.
\
President Obama has issued 168 executive orders in seven years. In their eight years in office, Reagan - 381; Clinton - 364; and George W. Bush - 291, issued far more executive orders. And every president since Eisenhower has issued executive orders concerning immigration. It's OK to disagree with President Obama, but at least be truthful about the disagreement. He won two elections by the American people. That is not karma; it is factual.

A school district just for Wilmington
\
Over the past year, there has been a lot of media attention given to the struggles faced by the students who reside in the city of Wilmington. In my conversations with other parents of school-aged children we always seem to be without an answer as to why the needs of these struggling students are not addressed directly. Sen. Henry and Rep. Keeley claim that neighborhood schools did not work. Is that really true?
\
As far as I can tell, the students of Wilmington do not have a middle school to call home nor do they have a high school. Perhaps the city needs to have a district of its own so that the city can address the needs of its students directly rather than continue to allow the current school districts to shift the students from one school to the next that is nowhere near their neighborhood. The idea of a neighborhood school is that it can provide the education and programs to the students who live in the surrounding neighborhoods.
\
Is that really being done?
\
Let us give the students of Wilmington the best chance by allowing their city to provide the best opportunity for its children.

U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., has been selected to chair the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works by the full committee's chair, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
\
Carper will leave his chairmanship of the Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee to focus on transportation issues, which could be at the center of economic debate in Congress with President Barack Obama proposing $302 billion in transportation upgrades paid for by an overhaul of corporate taxes.
\
Carper, Delaware's senior senator, also serves as chair of the full Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
\
The Congressional Budget Office says the federal Highway Trust Fund is running dry, and won't have enough revenue to fund obligations by 2015.
\
Like in Delaware, the federal gas tax, pegged at 18.4-cents-per-gallon, has not been raised in 20 years.
\
""As our country continues to grow and our infrastructure ages, falling gas tax revenues are no longer able to support the many demands on our transportation system including our need to reduce congestion while moving freight and helping people get where they need to go affordably and efficiently,"" Carper said in a written statement.
\
Delaware Gov. Jack Markell is proposing a 10-cent increase to Delaware's 23-cent-per-gallon gas tax to fund new transportation projects, mainly road and bridge improvements. Markell is, however, facing opposition to his plan inside Legislative Hall. Lawmakers in Maryland and Pennsylvania recently increased gas taxes in those states to fund new transportation infrastructure.
\
Carper said Congress must solve the federal government's transportation problem.
\
""States and cities across the country - red and blue, urban and rural - are doing their part by raising revenues to invest in innovative transportation projects,"" he said. ""In Congress we need to do our part to support this partnership by finding solutions to return the Highway Trust Fund to solvency, while at the same time evaluating promising new policies to address transportation challenges more efficiently and cost-effectively.""

Delaware keeps its AAA bond rating
\
The three major credit rating agencies have again shown their confidence in Delaware's debt, placing top-rated AAA ratings on $225 million in general obligation bonds the state is selling to finance construction projects.
\
The state took bids Wednesday on the bonds, which will finance construction in Laurel, Smyrna, Red Clay and Woodbridge school districts, and library projects in Wilmington, Claymont, Lewes and Greenwood, among other projects. Wells Fargo was the lowest bidder at 2.62 percent.
\
Delaware is one of 13 states with a AAA bond rating from Standard & Poor's. Moody's and Fitch also gave Delaware a AAA rating, which gives the state access to lower-cost financing. The state has maintained the rating, the highest awarded by the agencies, since 2000.
\
""These ratings affirm the success we have had in addressing our budget challenges while adhering to high standards of fiscal responsibility,"" Gov. Jack Markell said in a statement. ""This announcement means taxpayers will continue to benefit from lower costs for important projects that create jobs and improve quality of life in our state, including construction at schools, libraries and other facilities.""
\
Moody's said the state has continued to manage its finances well and fund pension obligations, but could be challenged by a high per-capita debt burden, potential cuts in the financial services industry in Wilmington and lingering effects from the recession, which caused state revenues to sag while increasing the demand on social programs and other government services. The agency said the state's rating outlook is stable, an outlook echoed by Fitch.
\
""The combination of the state's strong structural governance features (including frequent revenue forecast revisions), speedy actions to deal with downward revenue revisions, the use of recurring solutions to solve gaps, a low-risk debt profile and high pension funding ratio will result in the state coming out of this recession in a strong position relative to its peers,"" Moody's said.

Since Gov. Markell took office in 2009, state spending has increased nearly 24 percent, costing taxpayers $738 million ...
\
Gov. Jack Markell recently lectured a Sussex County audience that he needs to raise the gas tax to 33 cents per gallon because, ""As nice as it would be for there to be a free lunch, where we just make the investment but we don't have to pay for it or we expect the next generation to pay for it, that's not how it works.""
\
Were the governor and other Democrats in Dover willing to be honest, they would tell us even the need to have this conversation about higher gas taxes is an admission they already have mortgaged the future of our state and unfairly hurt the average Delawarean. The proposed new gas tax, while bad public policy, is not the real issue. It is only a symptom of uncaring policies that have created huge challenges for our state.
\
Since Gov. Markell took office in 2009, state spending has increased nearly 24 percent, costing taxpayers $738 million, and has been funded through tax increases and historic levels of per capita debt. It is clear that Delaware's Democrats have earned the ""tax-and-spend"" label, while leading to a ""Detroit-ing of Delaware.""
\
Last year, Gov. Markell and General Assembly Democrats made permanent four ""temporary"" tax increases enacted in 2009 to help the state get through the financial crisis. Those hikes are anticipated to cost taxpayers approximately $156 million in the upcoming fiscal year. In addition, the governor's Bloom Energy fiasco could cost Delmarva Power ratepayers more than $700 million in above-market electricity costs over the next 20 years. This money will leave Delaware and go to line the pockets of billionaire California venture capitalists.
\
As if unfair tax hikes and fees were not enough, the governor now suggests more tax hikes, hurting average Delawareans by raising the state tax on gasoline to 33 cents per gallon, and increasing state borrowing by another $250 million, plus raising taxes on businesses incorporated in Delaware.
\
Of course, hitting corporations with new taxes used to be ""safe;"" however, The Economist magazine reported in November 2013 that Delaware's share of corporate law decisions had decreased from 80 percent in 1995, when Democratic Gov. Tom Carper was in office, to under 40 percent by 2009. Since 2009, according to Forbes magazine, the Markell administration has achieved national notoriety for paying an independent consultant well over $30 million a year in commissions to aggressively squeeze escheat money from Delaware corporations to balance his unsustainable budgets.
\
With unfair, anti-growth policies like these, it is not surprising that the most recent report from the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council (DEFAC) reduces the Delaware Fiscal Year 2015 revenue estimates by approximately $40 million.
\
While there has been minor improvement in the state's unemployment figures, jobs available to Delaware workers are not those found in a robust economy. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that in February, U.S. average hourly earnings were $24.31 versus Delaware's paltry $22.20, and the U.S. average weekly hours worked were 34.2 versus Delaware's anemic 31.9. The average American worker made almost $500 more per month than the average Delaware worker.
\
The Democratic solution to the deteriorating economic conditions in Delaware remains unclear. Democrats seem flummoxed and are distracted by crises and scandals of their own making. From the Veasey report detailing the corrupt ""pay-to-play"" nature of Delaware's political environment, about which this paper's Editorial Board recently laid the lack of solutions at the feet of Delaware's Democrats, to Wilmington being the eighth most violent city in the country to the absence of Attorney General Beau Biden on the medical examiner's scandal, one can only conclude that, much like the city of Detroit, the wheels are falling off Delaware's state government.
\
The current situation should come as no surprise. Republicans have been sounding the economic alarm for some time regarding the reckless tax, borrow and spend policies of the Democrats. Going back to before the financial crisis in 2008, Republicans have been warning that Delaware's path is unsustainable. At the same time, our party has been continually offering solutions to help curb spiraling state spending while growing the economy for all Delawareans.
\
The new gas tax opens the door for Republicans to call for a more wide-ranging public debate about a better, fairer way to make government work again and bring growth back to our economy. It allows our party to demonstrate real leadership and create an economic climate that allows the creation of good jobs. After all, we don't want to be on the road to Detroit.

A provision in the state's proposed capital budget would allow Delaware officials to move forward with the much-anticipated extension of U.S. 301 around Middletown, with some opponents claiming the state will stick taxpayers with expenses for the toll road that can't pay for itself.
\
The budget language would allow Transportation Trust Fund money to be used for the project, which already has seen toll revenue projections reduced in a recent survey that suggested significantly less traffic on the road.
\
""There's a fear among the people that I help out that this is going to end up being a very expensive boondoggle and it's going to need bailing out with higher taxes or higher gas fees,"" said Charles Mulholland, an Odessa resident and past president of the Civic League for New Castle County.
\
New debate over the toll road comes as Gov. Jack Markell is proposing additional revenue for road projects in the Transportation Trust Fund. Markell wants lawmakers to raise Delaware's gas tax by 10 cents and to authorize new borrowing to generate $500 million in new spending for road projects over the next five years.
\
Delaware Transportation Secretary Shailen Bhatt said nothing has changed since September, when the agency received dramatically reduced traffic estimates on the proposed four-lane toll road, proving that toll receipts alone would not cover the estimated $400 million cost of the bypass. The state would have to come up with roughly $75 million more to cover the project's shortfall, a proposition that already has drawn fire from one key lawmaker in Legislative Hall.
\
The agency borrowed $125 million in 2009 to pay for roughly $79 million in right-of-way purchases, preliminary engineering and utility work. Federal dollars are being diverted out of the state's Transportation Trust Fund to repay the loan.
\
The proposed bypass would also traverse a large, relatively undeveloped tract of southern New Castle County that has been the subject of intense interest from developers who could benefit from the highway's new access. In 2011, Whitehall Ventures filed a $1 billion plan to build mixed-use villages on more than 1,200 acres of farmland in the area. DelDOT has filed condemnation lawsuits on Whitehall-related land in the path of the proposed toll road, but ambitious development plans remain for the Town of Whitehall.
\
In October 2009, a consultant for the state estimated that 14,800 cars would use the bypass daily. The new estimate from September showed only 5,200 cars a day, tanking projected toll receipts. State officials hope a low-interest federal loan from the U.S. Department of Transportation will cover about half the cost of the project.
\
But Bhatt says lower toll receipts mean that the state will have to kick in $75 million in additional Transportation Trust Fund revenue to fully fund the bypass, which he says is necessary to reduce truck traffic and congestion in the Middletown area, a fast growing pocket of southern New Castle County.
\
The gap will not be covered by Markell's 10-cent gas tax increase meant to pump money into roadway projects and balance higher operational costs, Bhatt said.
\
""There is a real need for this road,"" Bhatt said. ""The question is, with the low interest rate environment and the fact that contractors are pretty hungry, has that created an environment where we can move the road forward now?""
\
Bhatt said concerns that budget language allows the Markell administration to hastily move toward construction are unfounded.
\
The provision allows the state to authorize new debt, backed by toll receipts and additional trust fund revenue, to fund bypass construction only if several administration officials and the state Controller General, an employee of the General Assembly, sign off, he said. Moreover, the same budget language is included in the current's year's capital budget, meaning authorization exists currently.
\
""We're not going to abuse the authorization,"" Bhatt said. ""I have been very clear I'm not going to go out under cover of darkness and sell these bonds.""
\
Nevertheless, the Markell administration could face some tension in the Legislature. Sen. Robert Venables, a Laurel Democrat and chair of the General Assembly's Bond Bill committee, said he will propose legislation to remove the budget language to address fears of the project's critics.
\
""The only way that we will do 301 is we've got to have some agency, some firm do another analysis that shows us we've got enough money on tolls to pay the bonds back,"" Venables said. ""That's the only way, with the economy, ... it will ever go.""
\
That's good news for Andye Daley, a Middletown-area resident and longtime opponent of the bypass, who says taxpayers are likely to see a high bill if construction moves forward.
\
""It is just a fiscal liability to the state,"" Daley said. ""It's all about the taxpayers footing the bill for something that we can't pay for, nor do we need.""

The state would have to come up with roughly $75 million more to cover the project's shortfall, a proposition that already has drawn fire from one key lawmaker in Legislative Hall.
\
The agency borrowed $125 million in 2009 to pay for roughly $79 million in right-of-way purchases, preliminary engineering and utility work. Federal dollars are being diverted out of the state's Transportation Trust Fund to repay the loan.
\
The proposed bypass would also traverse a large, relatively undeveloped tract of southern New Castle County that has been the subject of intense interest from developers who could benefit from the highway's new access. In 2011, Whitehall Ventures filed a $1 billion plan to build mixed-use villages on more than 1,200 acres of farmland in the area. DelDOT has filed condemnation lawsuits on Whitehall-related land in the path of the proposed toll road, but ambitious development plans remain for the Town of Whitehall.
\
In October 2009, a consultant for the state estimated that 14,800 cars would use the bypass daily. The new estimate from September showed only 5,200 cars a day, tanking projected toll receipts. State officials hope a low-interest federal loan from the U.S. Department of Transportation will cover about half the cost of the project.
\
But Bhatt says lower toll receipts mean that the state will have to kick in $75 million in additional Transportation Trust Fund revenue to fully fund the bypass, which he says is necessary to reduce truck traffic and congestion in the Middletown area, a fast growing pocket of southern New Castle County.
\
The gap will not be covered by Markell's 10-cent gas tax increase meant to pump money into roadway projects and balance higher operational costs, Bhatt said.
\
""There is a real need for this road,"" Bhatt said. ""The question is, with the low interest rate environment and the fact that contractors are pretty hungry, has that created an environment where we can move the road forward now?""
\
Bhatt said concerns that budget language allows the Markell administration to hastily move toward construction are unfounded.
\
The provision allows the state to authorize new debt, backed by toll receipts and additional trust fund revenue, to fund bypass construction only if several administration officials and the state Controller General, an employee of the General Assembly, sign off, he said. Moreover, the same budget language is included in the current's year's capital budget, meaning authorization exists currently.
\
""We're not going to abuse the authorization,"" Bhatt said. ""I have been very clear I'm not going to go out under cover of darkness and sell these bonds.""
\
Nevertheless, the Markell administration could face some tension in the Legislature. Sen. Robert Venables, a Laurel Democrat and chair of the General Assembly's Bond Bill committee, said he will propose legislation to remove the budget language to address fears of the project's critics.
\
""The only way that we will do 301 is we've got to have some agency, some firm do another analysis that shows us we've got enough money on tolls to pay the bonds back,"" Venables said. ""That's the only way, with the economy, ... it will ever go.""
\
That's good news for Andye Daley, a Middletown-area resident and longtime opponent of the bypass, who says taxpayers are likely to see a high bill if construction moves forward.
\
""It is just a fiscal liability to the state,"" Daley said. ""It's all about the taxpayers footing the bill for something that we can't pay for, nor do we need.""

81,"As of this writing, federal officials have said that 12 people in the USA have died and more than 800 have become ill due to vaping. These numbers are sure to rise in the coming weeks.\The exact cause of these illnesses and deaths is not yet known, but the current focus of the investigation by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is chemical exposure due to additives such as vitamin E acetate, which is added to dilute THC oil and increase profits for the criminals who manufacture and sell these black-market products.\Protecting consumers from dangerous products is an essential responsibility of government.This current nationwide crisis is yet another concern that makes it imperative for Delaware to pass House Bill 110 in 2020 and legalize cannabis for adult use.\HB110 will impose a strict ""seed to sale"" system of tracking and compliance requirements that will enable state regulators to monitor legalized cannabis products through every step in the supply chain. Only by creating a regulated and taxed market can we begin to erode the economic incentives and profit opportunities for criminals and provide our citizens with the safe products they want.\HB110 will replace an existing illegal industry with a taxed and regulated market that will generate substantial tax revenue, create hundreds of jobs, reduce government spending, restrict access and enable law enforcement to focus on serious public safety matters. And as the vaping crisis has shown us, it will also save lives.\Call your locally elected officials and urge them to vote yes on HB110.\—Dan Winschel, Bethany Beach\If DelDOT is serious about reducing the dangerous congestion that occurs every evening on I-95 at the Rt. 896 exits, I propose they lower the tolls at the Delaware-Maryland state line to $1 from 3-6 p.m.\I think at least a third of the traffic would continue on and exit at Rt. 279 instead. We could at least consider it as an interim solution until the new exit construction is finished in a few years.\—Michaelle McGinnes, Elsmere\In regards to the recent front-page story reflecting DelDOT's need for more highway project money because of hybrid cars' better gas mileage: A conflict emerges — the hybrid cars using half the gas end up not paying their fair share of the gas tax, based on the miles driven.\The hybrid's 50 mpg is exactly what our common fight against global warming can use right now. These cars can start significantly reducing a large amount of CO2 from getting into our protective atmosphere.\The article points out that our surrounding states are getting gas taxes much more than Delaware's 23 cents per gallon — Maryland's is 13.7 cents higher, New Jersey is 18.4 cents higher, and Pennsylvania is 34.6 cents higher.\Our legislature surely knows that we are long overdue for a gas tax increase (25 years without even an inflation adjustment) and thus we could now get 10 cents to 15 cents per gallon more in taxes and still be competitive against neighboring states and make a large dent in the DelDOT needs.\Extra taxing for fuel-efficient cars and lower taxes for inefficient cars does not make good incentives for encouraging us to go for the hybrids — which I think is saving the hybrid drivers money and is a moral imperative.\—Jim Miller, Hockessin\The person who wrote that Wawa should use glass bottles for their milk was partly right.\However, the best way to help to help the planet is to stop eating dairy products as well as animal products.\Cows are a huge part of the problem.

""... when they fail to invest in infrastructure we're putting America behind almost every leading country in the world""
\
Joe Biden
\
Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday urged Congress to fix the federal Highway Trust Fund, telling a crowd of government and business officials that transportation spending ""used to be bipartisan.""
\
""I've been hanging around the United States Senate for a long time,"" Biden said at an event hosted by the White House Business Council, according to a pool report. ""And I ask all of you who have been doing this more than 15 years ... when's the last time prior to the recent past that there's been a big debate over infrastructure? Since when did it become a bad investment? Since when did it become something we view as big government? When did that happen?""
\
Without action to sustain the Highway Trust Fund by September, Biden said, states including Delaware, which has had its own issues funding road projects, could be forced to delay thousands of transportation improvements.
\
Congress is now mulling a short-term patch, a move criticized by U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who chairs the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Carper has proposed raising the federal gas tax by 12 cents over three years to support the trust fund and prevent project delays.
\
Delaware lawmakers rejected a plan proposed by Gov. Jack Markell to raise Delaware's gas tax by 10 cents, and authorize new debt, to fund $100 million in new projects annually over each of the next five years.
\
Democrats and Republicans resisted taking votes on higher taxes in an election year. Lawmakers and administration officials instead agreed on a limited deal to raise weekend tolls along Del. 1 and authorize $20 million in borrowing to fund new paving projects.
\
In his remarks on Wednesday, Biden urged business leaders to lobby members of Congress to spend more on transportation infrastructure across the country.
\
""We need your help,"" Biden said. ""This is not being polite, it's being earnest. We need your help. We need you to remind your representatives in both parties that when they fail to invest in infrastructure we're putting America behind almost every leading country in the world.""

U.S. Senate candidate 'called by Holy Spirit'
\
Carl Smink, the Milton retiree who is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, says he had a calling to launch the campaign.
\
""I got a call, just like our pastors get called, an urging from the Holy Spirit to say 'we want you,'"" Smink, 81, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ""He talks to me all day, every day.""
\
Smink is one of two Republicans attempting to unseat Coons. Kevin Wade, the Republican who unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Sen. Tom Carper in 2012, also has secured a ballot spot. Smink and Wade will meet in a Sept. 9 primary.
\
Coons was first elected in a 2010 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Joe Biden. He's up for a full six-year term in November, and also faces a challenge from Green Party candidate Andrew Groff.
\
Christine O'Donnell, Coons' tea party-endorsed opponent from 2010, tweeted about Smink on Tuesday, calling his candidacy ""promising.""
\
Smink is an Air Force veteran and a retired environmental engineer who moved to Delaware seven years ago.
\
Smink's website calls him a ""full spectrum conservative"" who wants to ""strengthen and preserve traditional families"" and ""protect the dignity of life and marriage."" He also calls for lower taxes and wants the U.S. Senate to ""stop ratification of entangling treaties.""
\
""We're giving away sovereignty,"" Smink said.

Believe it or not, in state legislatures around the country there is fierce debate going on right now over how to spend excess revenues. Governors and lawmakers are grappling over whether to use these budget surpluses for things like paying down debt and cutting taxes or increasing spending on schools and infrastructure.
\
No such luck in Delaware.
\
The improving economic conditions elsewhere were the focus of recent articles in two of the nation's biggest and most influential newspapers - the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
\
Oh, to have Connecticut's ""problem"" of how to spend an additional $365 million. Or in Wisconsin and Michigan, where revenue forecasters have raised estimates for the next 18 months by $893 million and $971 million, respectively. Nationally, according to Moody's Analytics, state revenues were up 6.7 percent for the fiscal year ending in June 2013.
\
After years of declining or stagnant revenues, many states are finally moving on from the recession.
\
This is not the case in Delaware.
\
Here, revenue is still on the decline as evidenced by the $13 million shortfall projected by the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council for the next fiscal year.
\
Yet, Gov. Markell is acting like he's working with a surplus, proposing in his operating and capital budgets tens of millions of dollars in new spending for education and transportation.
\
The governor wants to pay for these things not with revenue gained from a growing economy, but by raising taxes, including a 10-cent per gallon gas tax. Once again he's asking Delaware's working class and business owners to foot the bill, the same folks who for years have been forced to tighten their belts.
\
If, like the governor, you think we need more taxes, consider that since 2008, we've seen increases to the personal income tax, estate tax, corporate franchise tax, vehicle registration fee, vehicle titling fee, RGGI tax on energy, Bloom surcharge tax on energy, higher minimum wage requirement tax on business, state tax on casino revenue, gross receipts tax, property tax for Wilmington businesses and residents, and water and sewer taxes in Wilmington and New Castle County.
\
It's no wonder Delawareans aren't purchasing more goods and services and businesses aren't growing - we're nickel and diming them to death. Squeezing even more taxes out of citizens and businesses already struggling to survive in this prolonged recession is just silly. If the governor continues to rob Peter to pay Paul, pretty soon Peter's going to run out of money, if he hasn't already.
\
For our economy to grow, we need to do everything we can to help folks like Gale Voshell - owner of Voshell Brothers Welding in Dover - expand his business. Gale says he's trying to add to the roughly 80 employees he now has. But thanks to ever-increasing taxes, regulations and insurance costs, he says that's just not possible. The gas tax alone will cost him about $60,000; money he said could have gone into hiring more personnel. What he said after that should keep the governor - or anyone else in favor of increased taxes - up at night:
\
""I don't know why anybody would ever bring a business to Delaware.""
\
Let's bring that business-friendly climate back to Delaware. Some of the ideas already advocated by Senate and House Republican leaders include creating right-to-work zones in targeted areas of the state. This would help create a more competitive environment, attract new businesses to Delaware, and help revitalize a manufacturing base that has lost 14 percent of its jobs since 2009.
\
And once and for all, Delaware needs a serious conversation about prevailing wage, which drives up the cost of public construction projects and wastes taxpayer money by guaranteeing union-scale wages.
\
I'm not denigrating unions, they have their place. But they have become so powerful in New Castle County that they are driving up the cost in southern Delaware. We need to look at whether recalculating prevailing wage or perhaps suspending it for a period of time will create more public projects and put more Delawareans back to work.
\
I welcome the opportunity to talk to the governor and my fellow lawmakers about these and other creative ways to kick-start our long-suffering economy.
\
Let's continue the conversation, because what we're doing isn't working. With any luck, we'll soon be arguing over what to do with our increased revenues.

""That bay is so polluted. There's no sea grass.""
\
Chris Bason
\
Director, Center for the Inland Bays
\
They rank among the cleanest in the nation: Miles of Atlantic Ocean surf at the edge of Delaware beaches that double as resort playgrounds and crowded mainstays for the state's economy.
\
Yet, this weekend holiday arrives at a pivotal moment as state and local officials look for a new place to daily send up to 3.4 million gallons of treated sewage now pumped from Rehoboth Beach into a canal just off the polluted inland bays.
\
After years of studies, court battles and debates, the leading option simply calls for pumping the waste about a mile into the ocean off of the north end of Rehoboth Beach, via a $30 million outfall pipe.
\
It's an idea that has environmental groups and some residents worried the government is simply trading one dirty water problem for another, hoping simple dilution will protect Delaware's ocean beaches from the inland bays' fate.
\
Greg Rosner, a Delaware Surfrider Foundation member, said the proposed Rehoboth outfall is archaic - ""the wrong message to send"" about the state's biggest tourism attraction.
\
Last week, Delaware's beaches were listed among the best of 30 coastal states for clean water by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Based on water samples nationwide over a five-years span, Dewey Beach is a ""superstar"" of America's shores.
\
If the outfall is built, Rosner predicts, ""The PR [public relations] nightmare will never end.""
\
The disputes pit concern for Delaware's tourism industry, beach ratings and offshore environment against a need to comply with a court-backed order to end treated sewage releases to a canal outfall just north of Rehoboth Bay without crushing ratepayers.
\
An environmental impact study, completed in late 2012, said an ocean outfall is the best solution to the city's practice of pumping wastewater into the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal, which feeds Rehoboth Bay and Indian River Bay. Wastewater high in nitrogen and phosphorus pollutes the water and promotes algae growth, which undermines habitat for fish.
\
Although the environmental impact study supported construction of the outfall pipe, outgoing Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin P. O'Mara quietly urged the city to consider an innovative, if seldom-used, option: Discharge wastewater to a series of upland, artificial wetlands. The wetlands would ""polish"" treated wastewater and release fresh water back to the inshore environment, without adding to ocean beach pollution risks.
\
""I'm encouraging some additional review,"" said O'Mara, who left his position to become president and chief executive officer of the National Wildlife Federation. O'Mara said that he also ""has some concerns about the habitat"" for fish and ocean animals surrounding any potential outfall.
\
But DNREC's own staff and local experts have largely dismissed the wetland option as unworkable, and one experienced county wastewater management and public works official termed the marsh option a potential ""nightmare.""
\
Newly appointed DNREC Secretary David S. Small said he has yet to review the full record. ""I'm not sure what, if anything, it [the record] says about wetlands,"" Small said. ""I don't know that it addresses wetlands. I want to discuss the record internally with our team to see what that may reveal as far as whether there are other options.""
\
""Either way, we're going to have to look at the deadline"" of Dec. 31 for removing the discharges from the bay environment, Small said. ""That's a tight timeline and probably not realistic at this point.""
\
The News Journal learned about DNREC's alternative studies from records obtained under a state Freedom of Information Act request. State officials turned over dozens of emails, inspection reports and other documents relating to the existing Rehoboth Treatment Plant and the review for the upgrade.
\
Frustrated Rehoboth officials have complained for months that state officials have been dragging their feet on permitting and financial assistance for the outfall. The delay is significant because Rehoboth is under a court-backed order to stop discharging its treated wastewater into the Lewes & Rehoboth Canal by Dec. 31.
\
Rehoboth Beach Mayor Samuel Cooper said he was aware of O'Mara's interest in a created wetland from conversations with the city's engineers and some DNREC staffers.
\
Still, Cooper wonders: ""Why didn't he [O'Mara] call us so we could sit down and meet? How does doing nothing resolve anything? To just leave it hanging is no answer.""
\
DNREC's Financial Assistance Branch has made a recommendation to O'Mara, but that proposal has not been acted on. The recommendation has not been released and was not included in the FOIA documents.
\
O'Mara said there is considerable interest both locally and from the federal Environmental Protection Agency in seeing Rehoboth Beach get its discharge out of the canal. However, the permit review process for the proposed ocean outfall at the federal level could be more challenging than city officials anticipate, he said.
\
EPA officials in Philadelphia, where the city's choice would be reviewed, declined to comment. An EPA spokesman said the agency would prefer to wait until they have a permit application in hand.
\
Risks considered
\
The city's two proposed ocean outfall pipe options stop just west of Hen & Chicken Shoals, off the city's northeast corner. The shallow sand flats are part of a broader, federally designated essential fish habitat - a critical area for all stages of winter and windowpane flounders, several mackerel species as well as cobia. Multiple life stages of summer flounder, sea bass and several shark species also use the habitat at the shoals.
\
Sending discharges to acres of new, created wetlands, O'Mara said, could avoid new risks for offshore habitats while creating new recreational and onshore habitat resources for the area. Costs might be comparable to the outfall, with lower, long-term maintenance expenses.
\
And although the city-commissioned environmental impact statement considered worst-case scenarios and suggest little chance of failure - a finding shared by much of the staff within DNREC - O'Mara said he believes it may be overly optimistic, given the increased risk from storms projected with climate change and sea level rise.
\
During Hurricane Sandy, in late October 2012, flooding around the Lewes Wastewater Treatment Plant forced its emergency evacuation, followed by a sewage release to the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal.
\
The current Rehoboth Beach treatment plant exceeded some of its discharge limits as well. And high flow discharges during Sandy, which hit during the offseason, forced the use of an out-of-service holding basin.
\
Rehoboth's plan
\
Under Rehoboth's proposed ocean outfall scenario, the city would continue to use its treatment plant along banks of the canal. A pipeline would carry the treated waste under municipal streets and out to Deauville Beach. From there it would move about a mile off the swimming beach before being discharged into the ocean.
\
Henlopen Acres, the community of North Shores and Cape Henlopen State Park, are just to the north of the outfall. Residential neighbors send their wastewater to Rehoboth for treatment and disposal.
\
Rehoboth has been discharging its wastewater into the canal for decades, with diluted discharges ultimately flowing into Rehoboth Bay. Early operations barely treated the wastes, although upgrades and improvements reduced the amount of pollution reaching open water.
\
In the 1980s, just as the city was poised to build a new treatment plant, a citizen group sued to halt discharges to the canal, pressing instead for land application of wastewater to protect both the canal and bay. Rehoboth prevailed and built a new treatment plant in 1987, and received state permits to continue canal discharge.
\
Other municipal and industrial dischargers got their waste and process water out of the canal, however. Sussex County invested millions of dollars to build new wastewater treatment plants, eliminating thousands of aging and failing septic systems around the inland bays.
\
Officials at the Center for the Inland Bays say they have been waiting long enough to remove the harmful discharges from the bays.
\
Chris Bason, executive director of the center, said that DNREC approved a ""total maximum daily load"" or TMDL, for fertilizer-like nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in the bays in 1998, with a goal of eliminating all treatment plant discharges to surface waters.
\
""The TMDL was completed in 1998. We are 16 years down the road"" and Rehoboth is still discharging into the canal, Bason said.
\
Although Rehoboth Beach challenged the 1998 plan, a consent decree dating to 2002 required eventual compliance with a requirement to either remove the pollutants or remove the discharge - with the deadline for a plan currently at Dec. 31.
\
""We're not going to make that and that's embarrassing,"" Bason said.
\
Behind the dispute is a U.S. District Court settlement to a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club and American Littoral Society after the EPA regional office failed to enforce a requirement to set Clean Water Act pollution limits.
\
As a part of the settlement, the federal court ordered a TMDL be developed for the Inland Bays by Dec. 1998 and that document, developed by the state, called for the systematic elimination of wastewater discharges to the Inland Bays. The result: municipalities like Georgetown, Millsboro and Rehoboth Beach had to find other places to dispose treated wastewater.
\
Meanwhile, said Bason, the Rehoboth treatment plant is still a major source of nitrogen and phosphorous in Rehoboth Bay: 17,120 pounds of nitrogen and 1,180 pounds of phosphorous on average, every single year.
\
""That bay is so polluted,"" Bason said. ""There's no sea grass.""
\
He said the nitrogen and phosphorous fuel growth on the dominant remaining plant - algae.
\
""And that's why the bay is so cloudy,"" Bason added.
\
The center hasn't taken a position on the outfall. But it did prepare a fact sheet which notes that of the 13 main sources of pollution, only two remain in the Inland Bays - Rehoboth and Millsboro, and Millsboro is scheduled to come out of the bays this year.
\
The alternatives
\
Rehoboth and its consulting engineers looked in depth at a range of alternatives as part of a draft environmental impact study.
\
Two main options emerged: ocean outfall and land application, where treated waste is spread on fields, typically when they are planted with crops to uptake the nitrogen and phosphorous.
\
Rehoboth commissioners opted for the ocean outfall, seeing it as the most efficient and least costly option at $30.4 million.
\
Sky-high costs hobbled the land application option. City officials needed something close but land near the resort community for spraying the waste was expensive. And among dozens of landowners contacted, only three considered talking about selling their property as land application sites.
\
While city residential property owners typically pay $326 annually in sewer fees, the estimated cost of land application ranged from $1,010 to $1,400 per property owner annually, according to the environmental impact statement.
\
The estimate was made in 2009 dollars, as was the per property owner estimate for the ocean outfall, which came in at $635.
\
City officials went with the lower-cost option, bolstered by reassurance from the consultants that a properly diffused ocean discharge could operate without an environmental impact even in worst-case scenarios.
\
Cooper said the recommended plan would continue to process and treat the wastewater at the city's 3.4-million-gallon-a-day plan along the Lewes & Rehoboth Canal, disinfect it the discharge, remove trace chlorine and then pipe it to the ocean. The outfall pipe will have a capacity of 7 million gallons, Cooper said, explaining that should help plant operators better manage peak flows at times of extreme use.
\
City leaders found significant support for the plan at public hearings. They also found it potentially easier to shepherd through the permit process.
\
James May, a professor of law and graduate engineering at Widener University, said that ocean outfalls might prove a difficult sell politically. They only need to meet minimum, primary treatment standards and rely on technology that dates to the 1920s. The ocean's vastness, he said, assures that pollutants are rapidly diluted.
\
Two wastewater facilities already operate ocean outfalls off Delaware, the county-run South Coastal ocean outfall, which discharges about a mile off Bethany Beach, and a larger outfall off Ocean City, Md. Both have been in operation for more than three decades with few issues.
\
However, in 1992, the EPA released the results of a five-year study on the two outfalls that found an impact on aquatic life and habitat on the ocean bottom, even though ""the discharges are not a public health threat.""
\
Sediments around the discharge pipes, EPA scientists said, had become ""a sink for many contaminants in the marine environment."" Varying populations of pathogenic, cyst-forming microbes were found, along with a drug resistant bacteria known to cause food poisoning.
\
The scientists drew no conclusions on the broader impact of their findings except to observe the changes in the bottom sediments.
\
John Schneider, DNREC's watershed assessment manager, said that the state's environmental staff was ""happy"" with the findings in the city's study of alternatives. Bacteria are not an issue with treatment plants these days, he said, and DNREC officials don't see failures.
\
""We asked the City of Rehoboth to look at catastrophes, power outages, a storm, a hurricane,"" he said. The conclusion: ""It just can't happen there ... it's perfectly safe.""
\
Anthony E. Hummel, an environmental engineer in the state Surface Water Discharge Section, wrote in an email dated Sept. 24, 2012, that the environmental impact study found the outfall ""the most practical solution considering the availability of land and the protection of groundwater and water quality of the Inland Bays.""
\
""The Ocean Outfall alternative also had the lowest impact on estimated user charges and greatest acceptance by citizens of Rehoboth Beach. The treatment plant would continue to discharge the same high quality effluent to the Atlantic Ocean that is currently discharged to the L-R Canal,"" Hummel wrote. ""Mixing is more than adequate to meet surface water quality standards under even the most extreme circumstances.""
\
But conservation groups such as the Surfrider Foundation and the Marine Education, Research & Rehabilitation Institute have concerns.
\
""The Delaware Surfrider Chapter announced in March along with other environmental groups, that we don't want this outfall pipe,"" said John Weber, Mid-Atlantic Regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation. ""Three months later and we still don't have a decision.""
\
Suzanne Thurman, who directs the MERR, Inc., described ocean outfalls as an ""archaic solution."" The methods release pharmaceuticals and other residual chemicals like caffeine, antibiotics and endocrine disruptors that aren't removed in the treatment process, creating a risk for marine mammals and other marine life.
\
Thurman, one of those favoring the wetland option, said that the outfall's likely position near sensitive Hen & Chicken Shoals was a special concern.
\
""In my opinion, it should be a preserve,"" she said. ""It's so vital.""
\
As late as 2012, the DNREC staff looked for possible land sites - five-acre parcels within five miles of the city - for creating wetlands. They came up with dozens of possibilities.
\
""Collin personally asked that we look at the wetland option,"" Schneider said.
\
But in the end, a report prepared by DNREC staff found it would be less than ideal.
\
The report found that constructed wetlands ""have been used in the U.S. as an alternative to complex mechanical WWTFs designed to provide tertiary treatment for nutrient removal."" But they are not commonly used to reduce nitrogen and phosphorous in treated wastewater, key issues in Rehoboth Beach.
\
While farmland is available nearby, DNREC staffers found, treated wastewater would still need to be disposed of, something that would require a state-issued discharge permit because ultimately, the treated waste would end up in Rehoboth Bay.
\
""DNREC staff do not believe that a Constructed Wetlands system can consistently meet water quality standards for Delaware's Inland Bays. Consequently, DNREC does not recommend this option for the City of Rehoboth Beach.""
\
Kent County Public Works Director Hans Medlarz said he would have concerns about the potential cost and reliability of wetland treatment for large wastewater volumes.""I have not seen it done on a large scale,"" Medlarz said. ""As soon as the vegetation reaches a mature point it eventually will have to be harvested so it doesn't die and decay and release nutrients back into the water.""
\
""That works just fine in a small created wetland, but if you have acres and acres, how would you remove all that biomass,"" Medlarz said. ""You could have a few good years and then you could have a nightmare on your hands.""
\
Some communities have made attempts. Disney World in Florida has used wetlands and floating hyacinths as part of its wastewater treatment plan for years, but the resort also has faced criticism for taking a toll on wetland ecosystems that were there before its construction.
\
Under O'Mara's vision, the wetland would be created from an upland area.
\
In Washington, Ind., the American Council of Engineering Companies recently honored city consultants for designing a $26 million wetland treatment system to deal with mixed stormwater and wastewater when tanks used to control combined sewer overflows are overwhelmed. Expanding the community's conventional plant to handle the overflow would have cost $53 million.
\
""I like these kind of challenges and I certainly have had some ideas which appeared innovative to me at the time, and I've lived to regret,"" Medlarz said. ""The general public works director would not want to be on the bleeding edge of new technology.""
\
Tidewater Utilities Inc. President Gerard Esposito said constructed wetlands are fragile, undermining the potential reliability of sewage treatment systems that rely on them.
\
""If you're the guy with the permit on the line, you don't want to have the last point of compliance be coming off a wetland,"" Esposito said. ""People with good intentions usually shy away from those, not because it's unproven, it's just that it's inconsistently in compliance at a certain scale.""
\
Tidewater has urged the city to consider use of current and future capacity in the company's new Wandendale commercial wastewater plant west of the city as an ocean disposal alternative. Wandendale uses both spray irrigation of treated wastewater on farm fields and more-confined rapid-infiltration beds for wastewater treatment.
\
""It's known and it's cheaper,"" Esposito said. He noted that constructed wetlands could require a relatively large amount of land, a potential financial negative in the resort area where land prices are high.
\
In Rehoboth, Cooper didn't raise those issues. Instead, he worried more about the availability of land for a created wetland and whether it would remove nitrogen and phosphorous and still allow city officials to meet the TMDL requirements.
\
Ironically, he said, in the spring when Gov. Jack Markell was pitching both his water and gas tax proposals, he stopped by the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of commerce.
\
Cooper said the Governor told the crowd of business leaders that the water tax money would help with the Rehoboth Beach Outfall.
\
""Either deny it,"" Cooper said of the outfall request ""and give a rationale for it,"" or sit down and discuss the other alternatives.

\
As citizens across Delaware and the nation have noticed, skyrocketing gasoline prices are negatively impacting commuters, families, tourists, truckers, businesses, and industries that rely on trucking deliveries. While gas prices are likely to approach $4.00 a gallon this summer, truck drivers are already paying more than that in many parts of the country for diesel fuel. Transportation costs are then passed to each of us as consumers.
\
Experts believe there are a variety of reasons for rising gas prices, many of which are beyond our immediate control. Specifically, the supply and demand structure that regulates much of the cost increase is difficult, if not impossible, to address in the short-term. However, Congress can enact measures that will make a difference in the way we consume energy and in how we develop the energy sources on which we rely.
\
This week, I sent a letter to Congressional leaders urging immediate coordination and cooperation to bring together proposals from Republicans and Democrats to address our energy crisis. The rising costs of gas prices are only one element of the broader fact: energy dependence affects our economy, security, and environment.
\
The letter, signed by eight other House Republicans, highlighted several proposals to reduce consumption, encourage innovative technology development, and promote energy self-sufficiency in this country.
\
First and most importantly, we must work to lessen the demand for oil. As for supply considerations, with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve filled to 96 percent capacity, I believe we should consider suspending shipments during the summer months, and we may also want to consider increasing refinery capacity in the United States. The United States should also work with other oil importing countries to require more transparency from oil producing countries to verify available oil reserves and production capacity.
\
There is also discussion of a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax in an effort to immediately lower the price of gasoline. While this tax moratorium may have merit and immediate appeal, we should be mindful that the federal gas tax is a major funding stream for the Highway Trust Fund, which funds many transportation construction projects. Any cuts to this federal revenue stream should be accounted for to ensure infrastructure upgrades are not jeopardized.
\
There are also a number of ways that each and every one of us can reduce costs now. While it may seem overly simplistic, basic conservation and efficiency measures such as maintaining driving speeds of not more than 55 miles per hour and proper tire inflation can make an immediate difference by slowing gasoline consumption and saving money.
\
Looking forward, Congress must adopt long-term extensions of existing and new tax incentives for renewable energy production and alternative energy research and development. Tax incentives for auto manufacturers and consumers to make and purchase clean vehicle technologies and funding for alternative and renewable research as well as development remain critical. In fact, the production tax credit for renewable energy assists in developing renewable energy projects like offshore wind energy in Delaware. With initiatives like cellulosic ethanol at DuPont, GE Solar, the fuel cell transportation project at the University of Delaware, and hydrogen storage research at Delaware State University among many others, Delaware has the potential to be a leader in these innovative new technologies and applications that will contribute greatly to cleaner and more efficient global energy solutions. Another important area is a federal requirement that a much greater percentage of our electricity come from renewable energy sources.
\
The finite supply of oil in the world ensures that our dependence on it will always directly correlate to the world's supply and demand structure. The bipartisan agreement to increase fuel efficiency standards, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, is proof that Congress and the Administration can find common ground. Congress should move to immediately promote policies to lessen the cost-crunch today while also acting to ensure we have a comprehensive, clean, and secure energy policy for tomorrow.

\
DOVER -- The political battle began Thursday almost as soon as Gov. Ruth Ann Minner finished proposing a $3.24 billion budget for next year that raises spending by nearly 5 percent while asking for more money from smokers and motorists.
\
House Republicans expressed dismay at Minner's proposal for the year that begins July 1, targeting her call for a 5 cents-a-gallon increase in fuel taxes to help pay for backlogged road construction and a 45 cents-a-pack hike in cigarette taxes to pay for new health care programs.
\
Immediate reaction to the fuel tax outside of Legislative Hall also was negative.
\
""I don't think gas needs to go no higher. We're struggling with this all the time,"" Dover resident Chester Lewis said Thursday as he filled his tank at the Dover Safeway gas station. ""The roads are going to be fixed anyway, and they'll find some way to come up with the money.""
\
Other parts of the budget were praised, particularly Minner's inclusion of a 2 percent raise for state workers.
\
""There have been years when the governor recommended zero,"" said Michael Begatto, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. ""We understand this is a tight budget, but we will be working with the administration and Legislature as more money comes on the table.""
\
More needed for Medicaid
\
The governor also released a $554.8 million capital budget, which includes $330.2 million for highway and transit work and $98 million for school construction.
\
Minner's budget includes several new initiatives, including:
\
*$1 million to start to buy and preserve forestland as the state has done for years with farmland.
\
*$1 million to implement forthcoming recommendations of the Health Disparities Task Force.
\
*$1 million for a dam emergency planning fund.
\
Overall, the budget reflects few new programs, slower revenue growth than in past years and continuing growth in spending for public school enrollments, health insurance costs and growing costs for Medicaid, the state-federal health care program for low-income residents.
\
Those factors required Minner to build into the budget:
\
*$9.6 million more to handle school enrollment growth.
\
*$9.9 million for the growth of Medicaid rolls to 151,000 people.
\
*$9.9 million to cover the state's share of operating the new veterans home in Milford.
\
*$40 million to continue building a fund to cover health care costs for state retirees -- a new federal mandate.
\
Transportation fees, taxes
\
It was Minner's proposal for fixing the state's overwhelmed road construction program that was the focus of most comments Thursday.
\
Her plan starts to address what was estimated in late 2005 to be a $2.7 billion gap between work the state Department of Transportation said was needed through 2012 and the money projected to be available. Last week, the administration said it had trimmed that gap to $1.5 billion with cost efficiencies, changes in use of federal aid and adjustments to project timetables.
\
In her budget, Minner still draws most of DelDOT's $350 million in operational costs from the Transportation Trust Fund, which receives money from tolls, vehicle fees and fuel taxes, rather than the general fund, where most taxes collected by the state go and which pays for most programs and operations.
\
Instead of shifting DelDOT's costs and freeing up that much money for construction, Minner proposes higher fuel taxes, vehicle fees and tolls to bring into the trust fund an estimated $78.6 million more. One change would eliminate E-ZPass discounts.
\
""I think people will have problems with the loss of E-ZPass discounts, but the gas tax increase is simply cruel,"" said state Rep. Deborah Hudson, R-Fairthorne, chairwoman of the House Revenue and Finance Committee. ""The fluctuations in price are hard enough on people, but raising a fixed cost is hard.""
\
Michelle Koppenhofer, of Dover, said the tax increase would be a hit to her family budget. ""Five cents is a pretty good hike, especially if you have a family,"" said Koppenhofer, who drives from Dover to Georgetown several times a week for work. She suggested a more modest increase -- maybe 2 cents a gallon.
\
AAA Mid-Atlantic spokeswoman Catherine Rossi said the club would support increases in tolls and gas taxes if it were guaranteed the money would be used solely for expenses that benefit motorists. However, a new poll of Delaware motorists by AAA Mid-Atlantic shows that 58 percent are opposed to any increase in gas taxes.
\
""We venture to say this gas tax increase will not be well-received by motorists,"" Rossi said.
\
The poll shows that more than 60 percent of motorists do not object to increases in registration and documentation fees.
\
""The public is much more receptive to those because they are one-time fees,"" Rossi said.
\
Minner said she knows no one will like higher taxes and fees, but said Delawareans will support them if they know the cash will go just to road work.
\
""People want good roads, and they can see where those dollars are going and that makes a difference,"" she said.
\
State House Majority Leader Wayne A. Smith, R-Clair Manor, and Joint Bond Bill Committee co-chairman William A. Oberle Jr., R-Beechers Lot, said they were disappointed Minner did not move more of DelDOT's operating costs into the general fund.
\
""I thought last year we had agreed on a bipartisan way forward, and I am disappointed that we are not following it,"" Smith said.
\
The Joint Finance Committee will start taking public testimony on the budget package next week, and the House Revenue and Finance Committee will begin its review of the tax and fee package when lawmakers come back in March.
\
Minner said she's ready to compromise with lawmakers.
\
""There are always assumptions built into any budget,"" she said. ""We are ready to work with the General Assembly on the ideas they have to make this a better package.""

A Jan. 30 editorial raised the issue of university endowments. A few universities, especially the Big Three, have enormous endowments that are growing faster than can be spent. At the same time, unlike all other non-profits, they do not have to spend at least 5 percent of value annually. Harvard is flagrantly taking advantage of this. Last year it made about 26 percent on its endowment and spent less than 4 percent of the endowment. When the endowment is over $36 billion, this is significant.
\
At the same time both Princeton and Yale have more endowment per student. All three have over $1.5 million per student. Neighboring, small Swarthmore College has almost $1 million per student in endowments. Regulations can get complicated at this point. One suggestion is that the Big Three voluntarily fund their own huge research activities and cease seeking government and corporate research funds. This would sever their obligations to those entities and more importantly would help all other institutions of higher education applying for those funds.

Overcrowded buses are a serious safety concern
\
I recently found out that the school bus that picks up my kids to take them to their elementary school has a total of 70 kids that ride it. I have checked with the Department of Transportation and the maximum number of kids allowed on a single school bus, by law, is 72.
\
The schools and DelDOT are too cheap to send out more buses, and I don't think our children should suffer. Not only because of accidents, but because our kids are sitting three to a seat and have no room, especially in the winter. I also think that if you have a certain number of kids on a bus, then you should have a certain number of adults watching the kids, not just the bus driver who is trying to drive and watch the kids at the same time.
\
I will be taking this up with the PTA, school board, and the state representative. I suggest you open your mouths and protest this, too, if you have kids, and even if you don't.

Self-reflection is coded genetically before birth
\
A recent letter suggested that the fetus is not a human being because it does not possess the faculty of self-reflection. It seems to me that self-reflection is a faculty of a human being, not the determinant of being human. Self-reflection is a faculty among other faculties, such as abstract thinking, that are potentialities that are actuated as a human being develops.
\
Would anyone suggest that a newborn has the capacity for self-reflection? All the potential for development of a human being is encoded in the human DNA. DNA is the litmus test of a human being.

Excluding workers from programs is unfair
\
The News Journal has given University of Delaware President Patrick Harker much favorable press, including articles about his desiring partnerships with industry and the state. So far, it seems to be all smoke and mirrors.
\
Having failed to reach him through e-mail and two letters (one certified) since November of last year, I can only conclude that his desire for an ""elite"" University of Delaware includes elitist leadership not answerable to taxpayers.
\
My concern is about the Department of Biological Sciences not admitting working citizens into their graduate program; I did not challenge the quality of that program, just the unfair admissions policy.
\
If the university graduate programs are not for students who must work to pay a mortgage and perhaps help support a family, then it is for rich kids and the department practices discrimination based on age and wealth. Employees of small businesses such as mine should not have to go out of state (as the Department recommended) to attend graduate programs. As he is unresponsive, it is my opinion that President Harker is not a good fit at the University of Delaware and that the UD trustees have erred in hiring him.

Barbaro is gone, the media should get over it
\
Your article ""One year later Barbaro's legacy still strong"" (Feb. 2) borders on the ridiculous. Come on, guys! We are talking about a stupid nag who broke a stupid leg while running a stupid horse race, and died as a result. Ever since, not a month goes by that we don't read some inane article about that ""heroic"" horse.
\
Why don't we just name the entrance road to Delaware Park, or maybe the entire Kirkwood Highway, ""Barbaro Drive?"" Why don't we just remove that silly Caesar Rodney from atop his horse, replace him with a bronze jockey and rename the entire square Barbaro Square? Better yet, why don't we petition the Vatican to name Barbaro ""Santo subito?"" And if the equine gods are not satisfied, why not offer them some human sacrifices? I suggest we immolate the next newspaperman who writes about Barbaro.

Yard waste ban is ideal chance to go natural
\
On Jan. 24, New Castle County instituted a yard waste ban to slow down the growth of their landfills. While this may seem like another nuisance law to most, I see a silver lining.
\
This is the perfect opportunity to create a backyard habitat. By providing food, shelter, water and places for animals to raise their young, you can foster a wildlife habitat. Food can be the bird food you put out or the native plants installed. Berries, nuts, nectar and insects found on or produced by plants benefit all wildlife.
\
A suburban lawn provides very little in food or shelter for the birds. Mowing a lawn lessens your personal time and money plus it pollutes the environment. Grass under trees is not natural. Birds and wildlife can find shelter in those same native plants you install. Dense plants can be a refuge from a hungry hawk or wind protection on cold winter nights. Water does not need to be anything as elaborate as a Longwood Gardens fountain display, it can be a simple pan filled with fresh water. Birdhouses provide places for birds to nest and raise their young. Houses are also used for winter roosting by some birds.
\
The Delaware Nature Society can assist in plant decisions and the National Wildlife Federation will also certify your yard as a backyard habitat. If approved you will receive a habitat yard sign.

Broadcaster made a wasteful use of air time
\
Recently on an ABC nightly news broadcast (Feb. 1) at 6:30 in the evening the newscaster made a very big deal about the recent snow storms and frigid temperatures in China, as well as about the hardships of the people being stranded in the transportation terminals.
\
While this storm was unusual, does anyone care or for that matter think China televises on their television any of the recent massive storm problems that we are having in the West and Midwest, or for that matter the country as a whole? The broadcast made no mention of deaths or people left homeless, just the inconvenience of the stranded travelers. Let's put our airwaves to a better use.

Democrat's war reticence is practical, not fearful
\
A recent letter stated that Democratic presidents have been historically weak on defense. I resent the perpetuation of this lie by the Republicans. Wasn't it Franklin Roosevelt who decided our nation had to respond to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and enter WWII?
\
As commander-in-chief, he not only was a source of strength for our people, but his leadership allowed German and Japanese occupied nations to regain their freedom.
\
When the communists invaded South Korea, wasn't it Harry Truman who sent in American troops so that communism could be contained? And wasn't it John Kennedy whose determination and courage forced the Soviets to withdraw their missiles in Cuba? These are just a few examples that demonstrate the strength of Democrat's presidents. Has the letter-writer forgotten 1983 and Reagan's failure to avenge the terrorist attack in Beirut that caused the death of 241 American servicemen?
\
Just increasing the defense budget, which often is full of waste, or taking the nation into an unprovoked war is not showing strength. It is foolhardiness.

Fund transport deficit with a gas tax increase
\
With the highway fund short of cash, the gas tax should be raised. If your morning drive- thru coffee went up 20 cents you would pay it. A 5-cent tax increase per gallon would have the same impact. The cost would be about $3 per month to the normal driver. Do the math.

\
After four decades as a statewide officeholder, U.S. Sen. Tom Carper says he's facing the most personal attacks of his career - about his health and, more recently, his military service.
\
Beyond those attacks, Republican Kevin Wade targeted Carper's voting record in Washington, including his 2010 proposal to raise the gas tax during an economic downturn in which Wade accused the two-term senator of doing too little to curb the national deficit.
\
During a recent debate in Dover, Wade also attacked President Barack Obama's signature health care law and Carper's role as a member of the powerful Senate Finance Committee in helping craft the law. Wade called the new health care law ""just one of those Washington programs that went through without any thought.""
\
""It was too much too soon,"" Wade said, calling out Carper for not actually reading the bill before voting to pass it. ""It is not embraced by about half of the public.""
\
The hits on his record are new for Carper, who has been facing a different type of assault from Independent candidate Alex Pires.
\
Pires, a successful class action lawyer and Dewey Beach businessman who is primarily self-funding his campaign, has lashed out at Carper for months, accusing the senator of concealing a hidden illness from voters and exaggerating his military service.
\
Carper has responded aggressively to both issues, posting a letter from the attending physician of Congress showing that the senator's ""overall health is very good.""
\
Carper's campaign also posted military service records online, showing that he received Vietnam campaign and service medals for honorable service as a Naval flight officer on intelligence gathering missions in the region.
\
Staying focused
\
The attacks have been on a wide range of issues, from the deficit to gay marriage. Opponents, led by Pires, have even renewed attacks that Carper relies too much on campaign money from banks in return for votes in Washington. Carper rejects each attack but has struggled to highlight his own agenda.
\
In an interview last week outside his campaign office on the Wilmington Riverfront, Carper said, if re-elected, he expects to be appointed chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where he hopes to identify cost savings in government and target cybersecurity issues. He also pledged to support full implementation of Obama's controversial health care law.
\
Carper doubled down on his support for a $4 trillion deficit reduction plan crafted by former Bill Clinton aide Erskine Bowles and former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, who chaired a commission appointed by Obama. The Simpson-Bowles plan, which failed to gain support in 2010, would have made steep cuts in defense and domestic spending and lowered tax rates while increasing government revenue by closing tax loopholes. It would also slowly increase the Social Security retirement age to 69.
\
At a Rehoboth Beach debate last month, Carper said Congress should put ""everything on the table"" to cut spending, including reforms to Social Security and Medicare.
\
In last week's interview, Carper said the Senate needs more leadership from Obama to get the deal done. He said Congress must act ahead of the so-called ""fiscal cliff"" at the beginning of 2013 when, in the absence of a large deficit reduction deal, automatic tax increases and spending cuts are scheduled to take effect, undermining a shaky economic recovery.
\
Carper said Obama ""has not been fully supportive of doing something really hard,"" adding Democrats need political ""air cover"" from the White House to agree on cuts to social programs.
\
""Without the president's strong support, with the opposition of four leaders of the four caucuses in the [Congress], it's been like pushing a string. It's not easy,"" he said. ""But we'll have the gun to our head as we get to the end of this year. Never waste a good crisis. This is a good crisis.""
\
Fiscal fire
\
Wade, a former DuPont engineer who runs a Christiana engineering business, suggested that Carper's calls to reduce the deficit are disingenuous, saying he has stood by as the debt has piled up to $16 trillion.
\
""Simpson-Bowles has been on the table for two years,"" Wade said at an October debate hosted by the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce. ""Here we are in an election season, and suddenly, Tom Carper is a fiscal conservative.""
\
Wade, who ran a brief congressional campaign in 2010 but dropped out of the race before the summer filing deadline, said he wants to boost the economy by opening up public and private lands to more oil and gas drilling and by pushing an overhaul of the tax code, lowering rates while eliminating special interest loopholes. He has offered few details on how lowering taxes would chip away at the deficit or which loopholes he'd support eliminating. In an interview, Wade said, ""we grow the economy and money floods into the Treasury.""
\
""I support a dramatic increase in tax revenues. People who are unemployed don't pay much in the way of income taxes,"" Wade said.
\
In recent weeks, tax policy has become central to Wade's campaign, with the Republican lambasting a 2010 proposal by Carper to raise the per-gallon gas tax by 25 cents.
\
Carper and former Republican Sen. George Voinovich proposed the policy in a November 2010 letter to Bowles and Simpson, arguing that the higher tax, phased in over three years, would raise $200 billion over five years for deficit reduction and new funding for roads and bridges.
\
Carper and Voinovich said the proposal would ""fix the transportation program's major fiscal challenges,"" referring to the Transportation Trust Fund. Carper stands behind the proposal and at a debate last week suggested that highway spending should be funded with ""user fees.""
\
""I know how to use that 25 cents better than he does,"" Wade counters. ""There are people on the margins. They're already two months behind on their apartment rent. You're going to raise the price of gasoline they need to go back and forth to work? The question is who better can use the money. I think it's we the people,"" Wade said.
\
Still safe?
\
Jennifer Duffy, an analyst at the Cook Political Report who follows gubernatorial and Senate races across the country, predicts that Carper is safe, basing her analysis partly on private polling that Republicans and Democrats shared with her earlier in the cycle.
\
Jason Mycoff, a political science professor at the University of Delaware, says incumbents typically have strong advantages, especially over newcomers like Pires and Wade with little in the way of a political coalition or infrastructure.
\
""They've got six years in office to build their organization to reach out to the community, to create those bonds, the bonds of trust with voters,"" Mycoff said. ""Any challenger is really behind the eight-ball trying to match that kind of organization.""
\
Then 29, Carper was first elected in 1976 as Delaware's treasurer. In 1982, he won the first of five two-year terms in Congress. Carper returned to Delaware to successfully run for governor in 1992, served two terms and was elected to the Senate in 2000 by toppling longtime Republican Sen. Bill Roth.
\
Pires argues that many years in office have tainted Carper.
\
""I didn't need this. I didn't want this. I tried to get somebody to run against Tom Carper because I think Tom Carper was probably a good legislator 15, 20 years ago. He's become what they all become when they're there too long. They become horribly corrupt,"" Pires said.
\
Pires has stopped campaigning in the wake of regional damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. ""I am using my resources and my time to purchase large quantities of food and have it tractor-trailered to the American Red Cross distribution centers in New Jersey, working hand-in-hand with officials of the Delmarva Red Cross,"" Pires said in a statement.
\
Pires has criticized Carper for supporting higher credit card swipe fees, which benefit banks to the detriment of merchants, and pushed last year to delay implementation of lower swipe fees in the Dodd-Frank regulatory bill, which the senator supported.
\
Carper defends his votes, saying he works toward compromise but ultimately favored sweeping new financial regulations opposed by big banks. Carper added that it's natural for banks to give to his campaign , considering their overwhelming presence as an employer in Wilmington.
\
""If you look at our economy here in our state, there they are,"" Carper said. ""The reason why they're doing this is because they find that this is a place with a pretty good economic climate and a nurturing environment for job creation. Does it mean we agree with them all of the time? We don't. I supported the Credit Card Act. Did they like that? No. I supported Dodd-Frank. Did they like that? No. But in the end it was fair.""

My belief, given the revenue forecast for the Delaware Department of Transportation, is that the plan for transportation is unsustainable. Without a new revenue source for transportation, expenses will continue to outweigh revenues. The governor's recent Delaware Voice about the environment shows his concern. However, he fails to see that one of the best ways to help the environment is to increase public transit options. His talks about increased job opportunities for the disabled forgets one of most important things associated with a job. Transportation. As our population ages and seniors are less likely to drive, we will be taking transportation opportunities away.
\
The state's move toward community-based living is a good thing, until you learn that many of these homes are built outside the American with Disabilities Act service area. Using nonprofits to supplement transportation in not sustainable. Many have funding issues with their transportation programs. Privatizing service to those areas is not sustainable. Replacing the best trained drivers in the country with people in the game for profit, the money will not be spent for meaningful training, background checks, drug testing to protect passengers in the care of the highest quality people possible.
\
The current funding model is unsustainable, as DelDOT's secretary in his presentation has proven. I propose a transportation tax on all citizens and businesses of $100, which brings more than $100 million to the trust fund. Raising the gas tax is not fair because it hits one segment of the population. The same with raising bus fares. The bicycle folks will also pay for the benefits they receive.

Thousands of miles of water run through Delaware, in creeks and streams and rivers and bays, and very little of it is considered healthy. Nearly all of the state's rivers and streams - 94 percent, the highest amount in the region - are so bad that fish can't thrive. In 85 percent of them, Delawareans can't swim. Exempt from these dubious distinctions: the 24-mile Delaware Ocean coast and the Delaware Bay shore. Many days, Delawareans look out over the state's waters and see only calm and beauty. But the problem of dirty water is real, a product of dangerous toxins, unsanitary runoff and destructive deposits creeping in unseen. If left untouched, Delaware runs the risk of endangering its drinking water supplies, leaving fish caught in state waters too contaminated to eat and losing a multimillion dollar tourism industry built on a promise of clean, clear water.
\
In Wilmington, Ronald Bowers has had more than a decade to watch Delaware's dirty water problem from his third-floor balcony overlooking the Brandywine at Superfine Lane, built atop the foundations of a 19th century flour mill across from the city's water filter plant.
\
""Let me tell you, on some days I get up and the water just looks bad. You can see stuff floating in it,"" Bowers said. ""Years ago I used to fish there, but not any more. I ask old guys who used to go there and fish and they say, 'Man I'm not eating anything out of that river. It's too dirty.' But you still see people doing it.""
\
Near Dover, Jeremy Drago has followed the catch-and-release custom that has become common among bass clubs fishing in the Murderkill watershed, which drains farm fields as far west as Harrington and dumps into Delaware Bay by Bowers Beach.
\
For Drago, who fishes ponds and streams across Delaware, there really isn't any other option.
\
""I have a friend who will tell you not to eat anything out of Silver Lake in Dover at all,"" Drago said. ""But I also have a friend who's been eating Silver Lake fish all his life, and he's still kicking.""
\
Along the Christina River in full view of the Riverfront development, ""the boats really do need to be washed every day at this point, especially after a storm,"" said Meg Carr, manager for the Newport Rowing Center in Newport. ""The kids pretty much know that if they can avoid touching the water, they avoid it. We know the water's not clean.""
\
Five weeks ago during his State of the State address, Gov. Jack Markell branded the state's water ""embarrassing"" and ""unacceptable,"" and vowed to offer a plan to ""clean up our waterways within a generation.""
\
Markell, now in his fifth year as governor, is expected to outline the plan this week to finance a program estimated to cost more than $700 million to tackle Delaware's legacy of troubled waters.
\
His promise to act quickly drew comparisons with neighboring Maryland's decision in recent years to create a new ""flush tax"" and resident fees to pay for water-quality programs.
\
Markell's plan will focus on wastewater treatment, water quality needs and protection. On Tuesday, he is expected to propose reducing pollution, erosion and flooding caused by poorly managed stormwater runoff. He also will argue that the plan will create jobs for a state still struggling to recover from the Great Recession.
\
""The time has come to have dedicated resources over a multiyear plan to actually put the projects on the ground that we know are necessary,"" said Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin P. O'Mara, ""and then to try to accelerate those projects on a time frame that allows us to see the benefit in our lifetime and also puts a bunch of folks to work right now.""
\
Time to heal
\
Unless action is taken, generations will pass before some of the state's most-abused creeks heal and toxic pollution levels fall enough to make fish safe to eat freely, state officials have cautioned. Dozens of Delaware's waterways remain under fish consumption advisories, warnings that regularly eating fish caught there increases cancer risk by at least an extra 1-in-100,000, and in some spots 1-in-1,000.
\
Even without the cancer risks, there is the problem of mercury tainted fish - including big bluefish from the ocean, some ponds and Prime Hook Creek east of Milford. In many of these waterways, state officials recommend that pregnant women eat no fish at all.
\
The easy fixes to the state's water problems are in place, including removing pipes that once spewed minimally treated sewage and manufacturing process water into rivers and streams.
\
""There's been enormous progress in what you could characterize as the low-hanging fruit,"" said Kenneth T. Kristl, director of the Widener Environmental Law Clinic.
\
""What we're dealing with now are problems that are more subtle, more insidious, more intractable. . . The solutions are much more difficult.""
\
What remains are pollutants that touch waterways across the state. They flow from thousands of acres of phosphorus-enriched farmland in Sussex and Kent counties to nitrogen tainted groundwater south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Bacteria slips into waterways from faulty septic systems, from dog waste left on the curb, from migrating waterfowl, from cattle depositing waste in streams where they roam freely.
\
The problems also include aging and outdated water systems, storm drains, ponds holding runoff from neighborhoods and ditches, a legacy of toxic pollutants, runoff from urban and suburban development and farm fields, and increasing strain on headwater habitats as stream banks erode, trees topple or vegetation is removed.
\
Currently, creeks supplying 70 percent of northernmost Delaware's drinking water carry levels of bacteria, chemicals and fertilizers too high to meet federal Clean Water Act standards, creating a need for industrial-scale treatment before the water is suitable for public consumption.
\
And south of the canal, the groundwater is often tainted with nitrogen at levels at or approaching the federal Safe Drinking Water Act maximum of 10 milligrams per liter of water. High levels of nitrogen can interfere with oxygen in the blood stream among infants and the elderly.
\
In some spots above and below the region's largest drinking water intakes, contaminated industrial land bleeds polychlorinated biphyenyls (PCBs) that were banned in the 1970s and other toxic chemicals into damaged tidal creeks and the Delaware River itself.
\
Shared struggle
\
Part of the problem, Kristl said, lies in the Clean Water Act of 1972 - the law that allowed a comprehensive cleanup of municipal and industrial sources of water pollution. The act gave federal officials and states the authority to regulate water pollution at the discharge pipe. But it stopped there, with states and counties having few means and little authority to address broader pollution problems such as leaking septic systems and unchecked runoff from farm fields and developments.
\
That point was driven home when DNREC attempted to curb pollution that could not be linked to a single source, such as runoff from fields and yards.
\
Around the inland bays, state officials tried to get control by barring development in narrow buffer strips around the bays and streams that feed them. Sussex County and local developers had the state rules struck down in court, pointing out that land use is a county power.
\
Four decades after passage of the Clean Water Act, much of the nation - especially the long-settled industrial northeast - is still struggling to restore its waterways to ""fishable and swimmable"" status.
\
Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania all report better water compliance, but big gaps, with tens of thousands of stream miles not yet evaluated. Delaware has checked virtually all of its more than 2,500 miles of rivers, streams, creeks and ponds.
\
Shawn Garvin, the federal Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator, said Delaware has done such a good job assessing the condition of its streams, creeks, ponds and estuaries that at one time observers could look at a stream that started in Pennsylvania and it was listed as not polluted but once it entered Delaware it was.
\
Knowing where the problems are is a first step, Garvin said. But ""a lot of these things are going to require investments on the ground.""
\
In some parts of Delaware, water problems have become grotesque.
\
During the mid-1990s, people who lived and boated along Rehoboth Bay put up with an overgrowth of Ulva lactuca - sea lettuce - an algae that looks like neon-green leaves of kale. It clogged the bay shore for several hundred feet, suffocated creeks and lagoons, and as it decomposed, it kept people indoors because of the stench.
\
The decomposition also produced hydrogen sulfide at levels high enough to corrode bolts on the keels of sailboats and discolor metal in nearby homes. These days it has virtually disappeared but no one is certain whether it left the bays because of the massive harvesting effort or because of a change in water quality.
\
Big polluters
\
So far, Delaware officials have seen no cases of human illness at ponds, but several have been posted with warning signs - often at the boat ramps where people launch to fish for bass, sunfish and crappie.
\
Visitors to Delaware's inland bays are warned against swimming in the same waters where they are encouraged to rent sail boards, boat and fish, and where maps of shellfishing beds are stained bright red in large areas because of dangerous bacteria levels. High levels of nitrogen and phosphorus fuel a chain reaction of supercharged aquatic plant growth and decomposition that sucks the oxygen from the water in the bays, producing massive fish kills that serve as a calling card of the degraded environmental conditions.
\
Around Wilmington, research has shown that some of the region's top industries also rank as some of the worst water polluters in the 13,000 square mile Delaware River watershed, and significant contributors to toxic contamination that led to fish consumption warnings.
\
During the past decade, studies tagged Amtrak's heavy locomotive shops in Wilmington as the far-and-away largest source of PCB contamination from stormwater runoff. The same research tagged the now-bankrupt and abandoned Standard Chlorine Metachem chlorinated benzene plant near Delaware City - once the world's largest producer of some pesticide and insecticide ingredients - as the top discharger of PCB-laced wastewater.
\
Other plants, including DuPont's Edge Moor pigment factory, also were found to be PCB culprits.
\
""If we do nothing other than what we're doing now, our models predict it will take another 40 to 50 years for PCB concentrations in the sediments to drop to the level that it doesn't result in fish contamination, where we need fish consumption advisories,"" said Richard W. Greene, watershed assessment scientist for the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.
\
A quicker fix
\
Greene was one of the leaders of pioneering state and Delaware River Basin Commission research on ""fingerprinting"" PCBs and tracking down sources, which eventually led to adoption of a new multistate PCB pollution standard for the Delaware River and Bay last year. He also led development of a new cleanup strategy, called the Watershed Approach to Toxics Assessment and Restoration or WATAR, that has become part of Markell's water strategy.
\
DNREC and Markell's administration are hoping that WATAR offers a quicker fix for the state's most-toxic waterways.
\
The process relies in part on locking up contamination in sediment and water. Small black granules of activated carbon, not unlike those found in drinking water filters, are sprayed across contamination zones. The carbon, scientists say, binds strongly with pollutants like PCBs and chlorinated pesticides, locking up the contamination and becoming buried over time.
\
Interest in the WATAR approach grew rapidly last year after it was used to control runoff from an oil- and PCB contaminated site near Elsmere. Plans for a flood-control project along the same Mill Creek waterway threatened to send the pollutants into the Russell Peterson Wildlife Area marsh in Wilmington.
\
""Here we were making big investments in trying to enhance that marsh for purposes of ecological function, and we had an active release of petroleum and PCBs coming in a short distance above it,"" Greene said. ""We were able to identify that, using advanced chemical fingerprinting techniques, and then fast-tracked a remediation project"" that removed the worst pollution concentrations and stopped the movement of what remained.
\
Hidden sources
\
Tracking down sources can be complicated and frustrating.
\
Just off Georgetown's Circle, somewhere around the Delaware Court of Chancery parking lot, there is a dividing line for three lower Delaware watersheds. Look slightly north and east and the runoff from this parking lot and the land beyond it, drains to the Delaware Bay and tributaries.
\
Look slightly south east, and the water flows to the Inland Bays. Face west and the water flows to the Nanticoke River and on into Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay.
\
Drainage is so complicated in Delaware that some residents may not have any idea what watershed they live in or the impact they may have on it. John Schneider, the state's watershed assessment manager, said by the time land is subdivided into lots, it forces regulators to talk with hundreds of individual land owners rather than just one large property owner.
\
And when those hundreds of properties change hands every few years, a new round of education must start from scratch.
\
In about one-third of Delaware, everything ends up in some form in the Chesapeake that's put on the land, roads, parking lots, lawns and farm fields - from leaking crankcase oil or antifreeze, to cigarette butts, or stale coffee.
\
""You can't point fingers at somebody else and say that is where the pollution is coming from,"" said Beth Wasden, with the Nanticoke Watershed Alliance. ""The pollution in the Nanticoke does start in Delaware""
\
Big costs
\
Delaware's known wastewater needs now total about $500 million, O'Mara said. Another $200 million is needed for flooding and stormwater control problems, with another $75 million required just to deal with the worst toxic pollution affecting state waterways and fisheries.
\
Annual wastewater treatment needs are running at about $10 million to $12 million annually, according to Jeffrey M. Bross, chairman of Delaware-based Duffield Associates, a regional engineering and consulting firm.
\
""I think we've made some strides in the last 10 or 15 years in improving waterways, but improving them is one thing and getting them to the point of being fishable and swimmable is another, and we're not there yet,"" Bross said.
\
Bross noted that New Castle County, DelDOT and several municipalities are under EPA mandate to improve their stormwater management, but state reserves for the effort have dried up. Few gains have been made in removing or easing health advisories on fish consumption.
\
""I can remember taking my children fishing and they'd ask ""Can we eat this fish?"" Bross said. ""I'd tell them that it was fun fishing but 'You have to throw it back.'""
\
Lorraine Fleming, a longtime Delaware Nature Society board member and statewide advocate for conservation and environmental programs, said that one of Markell's challenges will be creating political will and public backing for new public fees for water quality amid turmoil over his proposed 10-cent gas tax increase.
\
The size and complexity of the problem will make it even tougher.
\
""It can be discouraging when you consider the billions that have been spent across the country to improve water quality,"" said Fleming, who once took part in a study that found only a kind of ""sewage fungus"" living in a portion of a now cleaner Red Clay Creek. ""It's hard to feel that it's not two-steps forward and one step back.

My oldest daughter attends Pencader Charter High School of Business and Finance. Despite some opening-year struggles, the school sets high academic and behavioral standards.
\
My other daughter attends MOT Charter School, which was new in 2002 and overcame many obstacles as well.

The schools have done an excellent job providing small class sizes so the students get the attention they need. And the curriculum provides them with skills they will need in any educational or career path they choose.

Greedy oil companies profit at expense of consumers
\
I've often wondered how much everybody in the chain from oil well to gas pump profits from the sale of gasoline. When a company like Exxon shows a quarterly profit of billions of dollars, something is grossly wrong.
\
Every time the price spikes we hear another creative excuse. The current excuses -- refinery problems and lack of capacity -- is particularly disturbing because there is no shortage of oil at this time.
\
The last time gasoline reached this price level, oil was $77 per barrel. Why now is the price of gas so high when oil is in the $65 range? The only possible answer is greed.
\
It is time for state and federal governments to get involved to protect consumers. Do we need to use less oil to protect the environment and bring down the cost of gasoline? Of course. However, oil companies have said it would take 10 years to get a new refinery up and running. It will take at least that long to indoctrinate citizens in ways of lowering usage.
\
Do we want to pay what countries in Europe are paying for gas? Do low-income families have to sacrifice food in order to buy gas to get to work?

State employees' pay raise barely makes a difference

With schools asking for a 26 percent tax increase, county government is increasing property tax 17.5 percent, gas is more than $3 a gallon and utilities are up 62 percent, a $750 annual raise may just cover the cost of the paper it was printed on.

Enact a military draft and gas tax to finally end war
\
A recent writer admonished Congress for dragging its feet when it comes to dealing with the Iraq situation. This has gone on far too long. The ""surge"" is not going to cut it.
\
Another 300,000 American targets should be sent into the the Iraq civil war. Since the military is already stretched to the breaking point, a draft will be needed. Every U.S. citizen between the ages of 18 and 38 should be shipped over for a tour, starting with those who voted for President Bush. And tours should be extended indefinitely or until the job is done.
\
A war tax of $5 per gallon gasoline should be implemented immediately so all those SUV patriots can help pay for the biggest foreign policy disaster in U.S. history.

Federal money is available for seniors' long-term care
\
Parents become senior citizens. In time, they start to fade physically and mentally. If impairment progresses, the choices for living become restrictive. The prospect of assisted living or skilled nursing homes creates apprehension, even fear. Seniors don't want to lose their independence after years at home.
\
Delaware has an opportunity to get matching federal funds as part of a Money Follows the Person program. The federal government will provide a $5 million grant if the General Assembly will fund Delaware's share. This will give seniors the choice to extend their lives at home with long-term care.
\
Please urge state Senate and House members to fund this program to match the generous federal grant.

Rev. Falwell was loving and approachable on campus
\
In reading a letter published May 23, I am reminded of the poor grasp that some people have of the English language. For example, the word ""homophobia"" means fear or contempt for lesbians and gay men. I never saw this behavior in Jerry Falwell.
\
I was a student at Liberty University in the late 1990s. I knew a student who revealed he was gay. Falwell put his arms around him, told him that he loved him, and offered to be available any time the student wanted to talk to someone. Does that sound like fear or aversion?
\
Another word that seems to be misused is ""anti-Semitic."" This means a person who discriminates against or is prejudiced or hostile toward Jews. For years, Falwell has been preaching that we should pray for peace in Israel. The only quote from him that can be misconstrued is that he believed the anti-Christ will be a Jew.
\
If you have studied the Bible, the anti-Christ would have to be of Jewish descent in order to fulfill the prophecies of centuries ago and to convince people that he is the Christ. How is this showing hostility to Jews? Just because you do not agree with someone's religious beliefs does not give you the right to impugn his character.

Iraq war funding bill was larded with extra spending
\
How disheartening that Congress saw fit to lard the Iraq funding bill with $17 billion in extra spending. Paying for vehicles that will be less vulnerable to mines and roadside bombs was understandable. Most of the additions were not, such as $6 billion for hurricane relief and $3 billion in farm disaster aid. Procedurally, such expenditures should have been considered on their merits, not grafted to this bill just because it was considered veto proof.
\
Something must be done about the continual growth in government spending that the members of Congress are facilitating. Given soaring entitlement outlays for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid as the baby boomers retire, total federal, state and local government spending will exceed 50 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2040, compared to 30 percent today.
\
Such an increase could hardly be covered by raising taxes, so what is to be done? My suggestions: eliminate wasteful government programs like agricultural subsidies, corporate welfare and federal grants for education; and restructure the entitlement programs so they will be sustainable over the long term. The sooner we face up to these problems, the less painful the solutions will be.

Treatment of immigrants makes racial distinctions
\
The senators in Washington who promised reform should live up to their promises. The 2008 election is approaching. Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy should resign, to be replaced with new people dedicated to real change.
\
Regarding immigration, Haitians are sent back or held in camps until they are deported, depriving them of a better life for themselves and their families. Why can't they be given citizenship through applications legally? I see blatant racism in the treatment of Haitians and Cubans. Skin color does make a difference.
\
Illegal Mexican immigrant families have children born in the United States who are granted citizenship. Their parents face deportation. Before that happens, U.S. citizens must bear the medical and education expenses of those living here illegally.
\
Congress is rewarding illegal immigrants for breaking the law. Enforce the laws already on the books. Secure our borders with more guards and new electronic safeguards.

Korean war veterans and casualties are overlooked
\
I happened to read an article in your newspaper headlined ""Dedication to duty."" The reporter wrote: ""But World War II was different from later wars. Troops returned from Vietnam and the Gulf war without parades or welcoming ceremonies."" As usual, the Korean war was omitted.
\
Americans, as part of a United Nations force, lost more than 34,000 service personnel. When I returned to the West Coast on a troop ship, a very small group of people was at the dock. There were no signs, no flags and no cheering. We were passed over then, and are still.
\
Though all war deaths are horrible, mentioning the Gulf war, which lasted about six weeks with casualties in the hundreds, is insulting to those of us who served in Korea from 1950 to 1953, with casualties in the thousands.
\
I suppose I should be used to this insult to those of us who were drafted or enlisted to serve our country. What amazes me is that The News Journal allowed this article to be published knowing it was incomplete.

washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.
\
A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.
\
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.
\
The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.
\
The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.
\
The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.
\
Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.
\
Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs.
"
94,"""We're with the Guv!""\That's the Delaware Republican rallying cry while the Democratic leadership holds the budget process hostage.\For those unaware, the state's $400 million budget deficit must be resolved by June 30.\There is a process to do that and those involved, people from both parties, were busy at work following the blueprint set forth by the governor. That blueprint, developed after a series of town hall meetings the governor held throughout the state last fall, had a mix of tax increases and budget cuts.\But in an unprecedented move, General Assembly leaders, both Democrats, suspended the process last week.\So what's really going on here? Political grandstanding. A budget cannot be passed without Republican assistance. So budget cuts are coming. They will not be popular.\And even though they're part of the governor's blueprint, the Dems are looking to pin them on the Republicans.\You could see this coming. In December, I posted a letter in another publication that outlined the tax increases I felt would be proposed. Rep. Pete Schwartzkopf called me and said I upset people unnecessarily.\Today, I believe I didn't upset people enough.\Lee McCreary\Rehoboth Beach\Uncover the truth\A special assistant to help reform the DOC? Hopefully, he/she is not employed by the DOC. I am sure there is employee intimidation within the department, not to mention the ability to falsify data, shred grievances and give only a slap on the wrist to those who have already done this or worse.\Dig deep, Carney. You will find the answers you are looking for.\Kim Mauk\Wilmington\Sales tax targets the poor\While a sales tax is always tempting, if you enact one, it will hurt the lower-income families most. For example: If a family of four has an income of $40,000, they will most likely spend 100 percent of their income, much of which would now be taxed.\If a family of four has an income of $150,000, they will have money to spend elsewhere, i.e. savings, investments, college tuition, vacations, etc. Much of that money won't be taxed.\So don't hurt the ones you claim you want to help.\Howard Smith\Newark\Who's laughing now?\I appreciate former FBI Director Comey informing us about how dangerous Russia is during his testimony today.\Let's again go back to 2012 when then-candidate Mitt Romney warned that Russia was our biggest geopolitical threat.\Remember President Obama, Democrats and the mainstream media mocked and laughed at Romney's comments. Looks like he was dead on.\It seems to me that we should be looking closely as to why our national security was not ahead of Russia's attempt to manipulate our election. I suggest that the Obama administration and our security agencies were asleep at the wheel during his final year. I for one want to know why we are on the defense with Russia, as opposed to the offense. Russia is laughing at how divided and screwed up we have become over the last few decades.\I long for the days of President Reagan when simple, confident words and strong, confident action ended the Cold War and put Russia back in line.\I also found it funny how the Democrats were praising Comey, when only months ago they said he cost Hillary Clinton to lose the election. This is typical of both our major political parties, and I for one am tired of it.\Ralph DegliObizzi Jr.\Newark\Delaware's litter problem\Now that Delaware is part of the United States Climate Alliance to protect the climate, it's about time that the local environment is protected.\As a cyclist, I see roadside trash everywhere that never seems to be removed. It's a disgrace that not only do people toss trash from cars, but the authorities do nothing to clean it up.\At one time, Delaware was clean, but now the state seems to be the garbage dump of the region. Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey certainly seem cleaner. There is also a noticeable improvement in road conditions when crossing the borders.\There is a relatively simple solution. A few cents extra on gas tax would pay for roadside cleaning, as vehicles and their occupants are the main culprits.\Oh, and also a tax hike on cigarettes and alcohol, judging by the number of butts and beer cans next to traffic signals.\Geoffrey C.

95,"
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Tom Carper has ended his improbable effort to pass a long-term transportation funding bill during this Congress's lame-duck session.
\
The Delaware Democrat said Friday he will focus on passage of a bill during the next Congress. A conversation with House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio just before Thanksgiving dashed his hopes for quick action.
\
Carper said Boehner told him, ""We've just got too little time and too much to do.""
\
""It's not fair for me to ask Senate members to walk the plank and make tough votes when we know that the House isn't even going to bring up that legislation,"" Carper said. ""We'll have the first five months of next year to focus, to find consensus on transportation policy.""
\
Boehner told ABC's ""This Week"" in September that passing a long-term transportation bill during President Barack Obama's last two years in office is ""in the realm of doable."" A spokesman for Boehner declined to comment on Carper's statement.
\
Congress passed its latest short-term fix in August, assuring funding for transportation projects through May. Lawmakers haven't been able to agree on how to finance a six-year authorization measure that passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in May.
\
The Senate passed legislation by Carper that was designed to force faster action on a long-term funding bill. But the House rejected that measure.
\
Postponement of long-term funding legislation means committee work on the authorization will also have to start over in the 114th Congress, when Republicans will control the Senate and have a larger majority in the House.
\
""I have worked night and day for months to create a dynamic that would compel us to make tough decisions, not sometime next year but during this lame-duck session,"" Carper said.
\
After the latest short-term federal fix, Delaware moved forward with transportation projects scheduled for fiscal 2015. But state Transportation Secretary Shailen Bhatt said last month the outgoing Congress needed to act before the end of the year to restore the Highway Trust Fund. The fund finances transportation projects, mostly using revenue from the federal gas tax.
\
""Improving safety and repairing aging infrastructure during the spring and summer construction season depends on states knowing this winter that federal money will be available,"" Bhatt said in a Nov. 18 statement. ""In Delaware, we have a contingency borrowing strategy in place that will allow us to move projects forward for a short while, but states should not have to engage in creative financing to solve a federal budget problem.""
\
The nation's transportation system is threatened by short-term federal funding measures and will be ""in trouble"" unless it gets more money, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told USA Today reporters last month.
\
Infrastructure in Delaware and other states is aging and the federal government isn't spending enough to maintain it, Foxx said.
\
Delawareans pay more to maintain their vehicles - more than $380 annually - than they would if the system were in better shape, he said.
\
""This issue affects every community, every user of our system, whether they're driving, whether they're using transit in some way,"" Foxx said. ""And I don't see how we can get through this in a good way as a country without Congress coming to the table and actually passing a long-term transportation bill.""

Temporary work visas must be verified, and apply to many foreign countries
\
It is great The News Journal finally printed an article on the impact of temporary seasonal workers in our region. While it made some valid points, it was a little misleading.
\
For the past two years I have employed temporary workers from Central America. For 2008, my company is processing visas for returning employees that will, more than likely, not be approved due to the cap of 66,000 applicants. Our seasonal employees were scheduled to return April 1.
\
Congress - and more important the Hispanic Caucus - has blocked legislation that was in place in 2006 and 2007 that said returning workers, known as H2-R, did not count against the cap. The Hispanic Caucus is using the H2 visa program to promote immigration reform. However, H2 visas are not for immigrants. This is where Congress and the Hispanic Caucus are incorrect and misleading.
\
An immigrant is a person who comes to a country to take up permanent residence. H2 visas are for temporary workers. They are for only one specific employer for up to 10 months. Once the visas have expired, workers must return to their country of origin.
\
If a visa employee were to stop working for the allocated employer, that individual must return to the country of origin and the employer must notify the government of the resignation or termination.
\
In order for temporary workers to obtain visas, employers must provide concrete evidence to the state and federal Department of Labor and U.S. Customs and Immigration Service of their need to employ foreign temporary employees.
\
Temporary H2 visas are issued to almost all of the countries outside our borders. If you visit shore points, many employees are from eastern European countries. Some of these temporary workers are here on J-1 visas, but there are a lot of H2 visas out there too.
\
To categorize H2 visas as being for persons from Central and South America is incorrect. H2 visas are for temporary seasonal employees and mostly all countries.

Laws regarding childhood sexual abuse need change
\
Edward Smith along with James W. O'Neill, Paul Daleo and Francis DeLuca are archetypal figures, products of a clerical system that enabled and protected them. They speak to the tragic need to change all states' inadequate childhood sexual abuse statutes.
\
Known victims of these sexual predators are entitled to justice and charity, to bring such individuals and any enabling institutions into civil court.
\
People must be held responsible for their crimes as well as their sins.
\
It is just too bad that federal laws prohibit sending these depraved individuals to jail for their crimes - where rapists and child abusers belong.

Democratic Congress didn't deliver on energy
\
One of the ""Six (promises) for '06"" from Democratic congressional candidates was lower energy prices. This is a good time to review policies, proposals and results to see how Congress has fared.
\
Action: No drilling in rich coastal areas, no exploration or drilling in Alaska. Result: Commodity markets anticipate less supply; oil prices increase.
\
Action: Restrictions on coal- fired plants. Result: Less inexpensive energy, Big Coal is the new Big Oil.
\
Action: No nukes. Result: Same as above.
\
Action: Ethanol. Result: Higher ethanol, gas and food prices.
\
Action: Ethanol tariffs. Result: See above. Protectionism rules the day.
\
Action: Utilities forced to supplement energy supplies with non-fossil fuels. Result: Consumers forced to supplement incomes.
\
Action: $40 billion to subsidize boutique energy suppliers. Result: $40 billion wasted.
\
Proposed action: Suspend federal gas tax for the summer. Probable Result: Gas prices drop by 18.5 cents a gallon. Peacock-like preening.
\
Proposed action: Windfall profit tax to pay for tax suspension. Probable result: Gas prices rise by 37 cents a gallon. Finger- pointing at Big Oil.
\
Proposed action: Cap and trade. Probable result: The disastrous tax-sucking vampire survives the journey from Europe.

DRBA service fee could eat up E-ZPass account
\
Regarding the service fee the Delaware River & Bay Authority imposed on E-ZPass accounts this year, $1.50 per month seems a little excessive for people who are infrequent users. If I have $25 in my account and don't use E-ZPass facilities for a year, that $1.50 removes $18 - or 75 percent of my balance. I call that excessive, especially in light of the reduced cost per vehicle to DRBA whenever an E-ZPass vehicle goes through a toll booth.

Socialist Europeans have excellent quality of life
\
The writer of a May 18 letter said that the high price Europeans pay for fuel supports ""an ever-growing socialist bureaucracy,"" which suggests a socialist bureaucracy is evil and should be avoided. I think it's fair to compare that bureaucracy with a capitalist one. Under socialist bureaucracy in Europe, citizens have health care from conception to death, while under our capitalist system about 10 percent of the population lacks health insurance protection. The infant mortality rate here is the highest of any industrialized nation.
\
In Europe, socialists have managed to raise life expectancy two to three years above that in the capitalist United States.
\
The euro is outperforming the dollar.
\
In this country, one in 10 citizens is in jail and the crime rate is 90 percent higher than in socialist Europe.
\
Capitalism has gotten us in an unwinnable war, created a national debt in the trillions and forced us into borrowing money from a Third World country, like China, which is communist.
\
We ought to be ashamed.
\
Back in the 1940s, Los Angeles had one of the best public transportation systems in the world. General Motors bought it and ran it down so that more cars could be sold.
\
U.S. auto makers came up with gas-guzzling SUVs and called them trucks so that fuel efficiency standards don't have to be met. This decision was detrimental to our economy and security. The auto industry fostered the use of trucks to move merchandise.
\
Oil companies are making obscene profits while the price of gas is going through the roof. Anyone who thinks this is OK was either born with a silver spoon in his mouth or is delusional.
\
Capitalism thrives on consumption. Therefore, it can neither encourage judicious use of natural resources nor stimulate protection of the environment, though both endeavors are essential to our survival.
\
Since this country's welfare is being adversely affected by capitalist policies and practices, maybe we should try to emulate our brothers and sisters of socialist Europe rather than ridicule them.

Horse racing fans are eager for a Triple Crown
\
There hasn't been a Triple Crown winner for more than 30 years. Every year horse racing fans are tantalized by the prospect.
\
Big Brown, the Kentucky Derby winner, just won the Preakness. On we go to the Belmont Stakes. Can the horse win the third leg of horse racing's biggest event?
\
With the catastrophes of Barbaro and Eight Belles in the minds of Americans, the industry needs a Triple Crown winner. The industry may be feeling heat from animal rights groups. The Internet generation has statistics that indicate hundreds of animals are destroyed on American tracks each year.
\
There is also controversy on whether horses are started racing too young.
\
For these reasons a Triple Crown winner will cause euphoria among an awful lot of people and may take the heat off the industry for a little while. I'm rooting for it.

A fight over the right to build a new in-state power plant has turned Delaware into a tiny battleground in the global fight over clean energy technologies and heat-trapping ""greenhouse"" gas emissions.
\
But with a series of public hearings set to begin on Tuesday, most members of the public are shooting in the dark when it comes to balancing the environmental impact and costs of the projects. Crucial facts about the three competing proposals remain out of public reach or in dispute.
\
On paper, a review by the Public Service Commission offers residents and policymakers a chance at the cleanest electricity available -- whether it be through wind-, coal-, or natural gas-powered plants -- in amounts that officials say will stabilize prices and improve service reliability.
\
Yet questions about price and environmental impact dog every proposal, issues complicated by the fact that the three companies have refused to make public financial information that could affect ratepayer interest in new technologies and lower pollution rates.
\
""Ultimately the consumer cares about how it's going to affect their bill. They haven't provided that, and I think that's the more important number,"" said Jeremy Firestone, an attorney and University of Delaware professor.
\
Among the choices the state is considering:
\
*A new, more than $1.5 billion plant at NRG Energy's Millsboro site that would create a clean-burning, natural gas-like fuel from processed coal while shutting down two of the state's dirtiest smokestacks.
\
*A Bluewater Wind LLC offer of an ""emissions-free"" wind farm several miles off Delaware's coast, also at a cost of more than $1.5 billion.
\
*Conectiv Power's plan for another conventional turbine fueled by natural gas or oil at its riverside complex in east Wilmington.
\
Delmarva Power, which could have to accept a long-term contract with the winner, recently recommended none of the bidders. The Public Service Commission and three state agencies involved in the choice endorsed Conectiv's plan as the best choice.
\
Officials could refine their assessments in coming weeks.
\
Among the factors officials are considering are the impacts of carbon dioxide emissions and the greenhouse impacts of each project. Carbon dioxide emissions have been linked to rising global temperatures and climate change.
\
Cutting-edge, but unproven
\
None of the projects is more cutting-edge than NRG's proposed 600-megawatt coal gasification plant, a system supporters say can capture and control most conventional power-plant emissions, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and soot.
\
But the technology is largely unproven.
\
Although NRG has proposed building a large gasifier in New York and others are in the works around the nation and world, none yet operates at the scale proposed for NRG's Millsboro site.
\
Sequestration concerns
\
Four different oil companies struggled for several years to get reliable electricity output from a different model gasifier system at the Delaware City Refinery that is fueled with coal-like solid leftovers from crude oil. Only recently did Valero Energy's top executive say the unit is getting the type of performance first expected in 1995.
\
None of the gasifiers now in operation around the globe has the kind of carbon dioxide capture and ""sequestration"" features that NRG included in its proposal. The plant has tentatively said it could pump carbon dioxide gas deep underground.
\
But that type of sequestration would increase overall long-term costs for NRG's project, making it 35 percent more expensive than Conectiv's plan, according to documents.
\
Also, the company uses the term ""promising"" to describe its proposal to inject carbon dioxide into a mile-deep well under Millsboro. The proposal is based on methods never tested on a commercial scale at a well depth never before attempted in Delaware.
\
""If you look at coal gasification, it's one of those things that, at this point, is almost entirely theoretical on a commercial scale,"" said Josh Dorner, an energy director for the Sierra Club national office.
\
But Ian Duncan, environment and earth systems director for the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, considers NRG's plan viable. Duncan said his agency recently highlighted the CO2 storage prospects for salty aquifers under the Delmarva Peninsula, and tested injection of CO2 at similar depths in Texas.
\
""There's no doubt that, technically, we can put compressed CO2 down into briny aquifers,"" Duncan said. ""The technology is available. We're still involved in looking at the issues of monitoring and verification -- how do you detect leaks?""
\
Taxpayers have heavily supported two smaller gasifier power-plant operations in Florida and Indiana, but Ohio-based American Electric Power recently put on hold plans for two commercial gasifiers, citing costs. A bitter fight is under way for a gasification project in Minnesota.
\
In contrast to NRG's proposal, Bluewater Wind's project would operate virtually without pollution emissions, other than those created by maintenance boats.
\
The company has offered to build what could become the nation's largest offshore wind farm, relying in part on credits that could increase if state, national and international policy-makers adopt punitive taxes on carbon dioxide emissions.
\
Bluewater's plan calls for construction of 200 wind turbines in a 30-square-mile block of Atlantic Ocean off Rehoboth Beach or Bethany Beach. Under the best conditions, the farm could send 400 megawatts to Delaware and generate another 200 megawatts for private sale.
\
Other nations already have large-scale wind farms, with Denmark leading the way in offshore projects. Denmark's energy agency recently concluded that the turbines can operate without harming waterfowl or fish and other aquatic organisms.
\
""The long-term cost of wind is the true bargain,"" Lewes-area resident Kit Zak wrote, because wind turbines operate without harmful emissions.
\
But consultants for Delmarva and state agencies involved in the selection of the energy plant questioned the viability of Bluewater's financing plan, describing portions as ""speculative"" and ""uncertain at best.""
\
Critics of Bluewater's plan have questioned the company's ability to deliver wind power in summer, when air is more likely to be still.
\
Again, pros and cons
\
Conectiv's proposal received high marks for offering cleaner electricity than coal power. But it also would make the region more reliant on natural gas. It also could prove vulnerable to the same greenhouse-gas tax concerns dogging NRG.
\
The selection process has ignited a letter-writing war, mostly between supporters of NRG and Bluewater Wind, with some of the state's most-active environmental groups, business organizations and labor unions taking part.
\
And there have been casualties. Disagreements reportedly contributed to a recent leadership change and friction among officers of the Sierra Club Delaware Chapter, which publicly supports Bluewater over NRG. The Delaware Audubon Society has taken a similar stand
\
""Why there has to be such a head of steam on this, I don't understand,"" said David Keifer, a former state planner who was recently replaced as Sierra Club chairman.
\
Keifer declined to discuss organization politics, but acknowledged strong differences in the group over the viability of wind power.
\
Some state officials have branded the PSC's May deadline premature.
\
Sen. Harris B. McDowell III, who chairs the Senate's Energy and Transit Committee, said a May deadline for the choice ""may adversely affect Delaware ratepayers for years to come."" Quick approval of a high-cost contract, he said, could ""create perverse conditions in which Delawareans would be penalized for choosing cost-saving sustainable energy options.""

\
Delaware's builders are standing at the end of a long line of falling dominoes.
\
When banks get scared, credit gets tight. When credit gets tight, commercial construction projects are put on hold.
\
And when those projects founder, tomorrow's paycheck becomes a far less certain thing for the builders, trade workers and architects who hammer together Delaware's schools, stores and offices.
\
Bidding has become intense for current commercial jobs, insiders said, and contractors are beginning to operate well out of their comfort zone when choosing which projects to chase.
\
Some contractors are traveling to the Eastern and Western shores of Maryland, to Annapolis, and to New Jersey and Pennsylvania to find work. Projects are being scaled back, put off, or canceled altogether.
\
""It has slowed to a snail's pace,"" Harry Gravell, president of the Delaware Building Trades Council, said of the overall construction market. ""Commercial really kind of put on the brakes somewhere around August.""
\
For now, the backlog of projects begun in months past is helping keep the revenue flowing in commercial construction, but it's also agreed that an already tight market is likely to get even tighter in the months ahead as government budgets falter and expansion plans are reassessed.
\
For the thousands of local trade workers who have already seen the once-lucrative home-building market shrink in this region, that means even more competition for jobs, giving developers more leverage to find the cheapest deal.
\
""We're seeing that we have to be very lean to be competitive in this market, as everyone does,"" said Mike Loessner, vice president of the construction firm ICS, or Integrated Construction Services. ""I think everyone is having to reduce their profit margin.""
\
This past week, ICS was in the bidding for a new project. They ended up getting the deal, but what a fight it proved to be.
\
""It was all the top guys in this industry right now,"" Loessner said. ""Just about everybody that was capable of bidding on this job bid on it.""
\
""A year ago, I had to beg people to bid on my site work,"" said Dover-area developer Michael A. Zimmerman of BBC Properties Inc. ""The last job, in Georgetown, I had 15 site contractors bidding.""
\
Nationally, construction hiring dipped in September -- partly a seasonal phenomenon -- but other types of jobs that are considered an indicator of future activity, such as engineers and architects, also fell, according to the Associated General Contractors of America.
\
""It is definitely the time to buy construction [services] right now,"" said Brian DiSabatino, president of EDiS Building Systems. ""The bidding market is wild. Especially this time of year -- the schools are done, so there are a lot of subcontractors in the marketplace that are eager for work.""
\
Fortunately, they say, riding out the ups and downs of the building market is nothing new -- and even something that eventually could help make firms stronger.
\
""We call it the nature of the beast when you're in the construction industry,"" said Kevin Irwin, president of Iron Workers Local 451.
\
Those who have toughed-out previous slumps say they learned to be ready -- by diversifying their services and widening their geographic scope. Less diversified firms are learning new strategies -- seeking work farther afield and bidding on jobs they once would have viewed as misaligned with their capabilities.
\
Some are even forging into the upheaval of the economy with zeal -- as home builders step back, developers like Zimmerman can drive forward, bidding on land with the benefit of reduced competition, and contracting labor from a pool that's more eager to negotiate its compensation.
\
On the other hand, those developers are also operating in a financing environment that demands more assurances than ever that a project will succeed.
\
""Projects that depend on bank funding -- such as hotels, retail and office development -- the projects that were expected to go ahead have been put on hold"" in many cases as developers seek alternative financing, said Ken Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America.
\
""This tighter credit market ... has kind of weeded out some of the less-than-stronger players,"" said Brian Bailey, a vice president in commercial lending at Wilmington Trust. ""So you're left with a smaller pool of players, all fighting for the same tenants.""
\
Economic shifts felt
\
The commercial construction business routinely feels the impact of broader economic shifts, experts say. When the housing market is down and governments are having trouble issuing bonds, school construction is usually impacted. When home prices slide, so does the property tax revenue needed to help foot the bill for government projects. When gas prices are up, fewer people drive and gas-tax revenue dips, potentially affecting highway construction.
\
Meanwhile, as the general economy slows and people and companies spend less, there's less potential profit in building a shopping center or an office building.
\
Of course, market strength also depends on the area involved and the type of business being planned. The Middletown-Odessa-Townsend area is still in need of commercial development, and Sussex County's housing growth is showing some signs of rejuvenation, insiders say. Medical offices and other health care facilities remain in growth mode, a phenomenon partly aided by the influx of older workers fleeing New Jersey's property taxes, according to Bailey.
\
""We're traveling wherever we have to, to keep work going,"" Loessner said.
\
In the longer term, the continuing realignment of military bases -- under Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC -- is expected to bring many workers into nearby Cecil County, Md., and help strengthen Dover Air Force Base.
\
Once-plentiful spending from the state isn't something builders can count on now, despite the fact that the demand exists.
\
""We know there's a billion dollars in need between schools, state office buildings, renovations and new construction,"" and even more when it comes to transportation projects, said John J. McMahon Jr., executive vice president of the Delaware Contractors Association. ""We know from an infrastructure perspective there's over $2 billion in needs.""
\
In the private sector, the demand for office space has just about dried up, Loessner said.
\
""The office sector is probably the most difficult right now,"" agreed Bailey of Wilmington Trust.
\
Opportunities can be found
\
Overall, however, ""commercial is still better off"" than the residential construction market, Simonson said.
\
""It certainly was far better off over the past two years,"" he said. ""There are a lot of projects in the ground that are still going ahead.""
\
And if you're a developer looking for deals, it's definitely a time of opportunities, McMahon and others agreed. ""Now's the time to go after it and get something done,"" he said. As residential developers back away from the market, the upward pressure on land prices eases, giving other developers a chance to find relative bargains.
\
""It's as hot as it's ever been,"" Zimmerman said. ""We're building centers in Ocean City, Bethany, Georgetown, Long Neck. I've got a large one in North Dover.""
\
Still, outside the pockets of strength, caution and a prudent wait-and-see attitude seems to be the norm. Credit woes and sagging consumer confidence are aggravated in the construction trade by soaring costs and a formidable regulatory process.
\
Construction costs have been rising at a faster clip than the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index, according to Turner Construction Co.'s Building Cost Index. Thanks to rising materials costs, the index for the third quarter of this year was up by 1.77 percent over the second quarter 2008, and up 6.49 percent from 2007.
\
In the short term, the many negative dynamics are prompting some to put projects on hold until the climate clears. At the multimillion-dollar expansion of Christiana Mall, there had been the promise that a branch of the popular Cheesecake Factory would be built.
\
""That's on hold,"" said Gravell, the Building Trades Council president. ""It's not canceled, but it's on hold.""
\
On the Internet, there used to be 35 or 40 projects posted for bids at a time, Gravell said. It's now down to twelve. ""It can be bad times for everyone regardless of whether you have a union affiliation or not,"" he said.
\
As contractors and builders fight harder for fewer jobs, they're also looking to keep costs as low as possible.
\
""It's obvious everybody's sharpening their pencils ... and being as competitive as they can be,"" McMahon said. Sometimes, that means stepping up into bigger kinds of projects.
\
""I think what happened is some of the lower-tier jobs dried up,"" as fewer homeowners went ahead with additions and other bigger projects, McMahon said. ""When that market starts to decline, they start looking at a higher level.""
\
That kind of cost-cutting can always mean job reductions, a prospect that runs against the values of builders like Loessner at ICS.
\
""We've been through slow times before,"" he said. ""We don't want to let people go, because we've been on the employee side before. ... We'll forgo profits to keep people working.""

Homeowners who sign contracts for new, residential solar energy systems they will own on or after Thursday will get 10 percent less in state grant money than folks who previously used Green Energy Fund incentives.
\
And people who lease power purchase systems will no longer be eligible for the installation grants at all.
\
Projects aren't affected if the Green Energy application was received by the Division of Energy & Climate or if the system contract was signed before Dec. 1. The change applies only to Delmarva Power customers.
\
The popular grant program is a victim of its own success. As more people opt in and install solar systems, the available pool of money has gone down.
\
So many homeowners applied through the fund in 2016 that administrators discovered they needed to reduce grants to keep the fund sustainable. Initially, it was set up to jump-start solar installations, which in 2008 were among the lowest in the nation.
\
In 2016, the fund supported more than 1,000 solar energy projects.
\
""We review the grant levels for the Delmarva Power Green Energy Fund program periodically in response to changing market conditions to ensure that the program continues to be cost effective,"" said Energy Program Administrator Robert Underwood, Division of Energy & Climate. ""Because the economics of solar energy continue to get stronger, we have seen the market for solar energy in Delaware grow even as we have reduced incentives in recent years.""
\
Delaware has set a target of producing 25 percent of power from renewable energy by 2026 with 3.5 percent coming from solar energy. Under the state's net metering law, homeowners get credit when they produce more power than they are using. That law allows lease power purchase agreements with solar installers.
\
In 2015, installed solar capacity in Delaware grew by 137 percent over the previous year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group.
\
In a 2015 report issued by Environment America, Delaware ranked 12th in the nation with 74.4 watts per person generated by solar. That number grew more than 26 percent since 2012.
\
The drop in incentives, from a maximum of $3,300 down to $3,000 for future applications for homeowner owned systems, comes after a review by the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility Oversight Board and a presentation before the Renewable Energy Taskforce.
\
Underwood said he expects the changes to have a minimum impact on the solar market in Delaware.

Effort Helps Create Jobs, Sustainable Energy, Sustainable Industries in State
\
Newark, Del. (March 10, 2010) Standing before solar panels that were made in Delaware and could help power the state, Governor Jack Markell today announced his intention to seek legislation that will put more people to work, help homes and businesses secure locally-generated power and expand emerging industries such as wind and solar power in Delaware to create new long-term careers for the state's citizens.
\
""The purpose of the initiative the Delaware Clean Energy Jobs Act is simple: to create quality jobs, expand local manufacturing and establish Delaware as a national leader in the adoption of renewable energy,"" Markell said.
\
The Clean Energy Jobs Act would facilitate the potential installation of approximately 300 MW of new solar photovoltaic systems by 2029, resulting in the creation of hundreds of secure, quality jobs. The Act would also facilitate the potential installation of over 1000 MW of utility-scale generation, likely in offshore wind power, resulting in as many as 1000 new construction jobs and 150 new long-term operation and maintenance jobs by 2029. Additional jobs would be created by prioritizing Delaware renewable-energy projects and incentivizing the use of locally manufactured systems.
\
It achieves these goals in part by increasing the amount of renewable energy available in Delaware. By adding a longer-range target to the existing Renewable Portfolio Standard, Delaware will be on a course to receive 30% of its energy supplies from renewable sources by 2029. It would also seek uniformity in the RPS and include a ""local generation component"" to maximize the economic development potential from solar and wind.
\
""To restore our economic promise and prosperity, the State can and will lead by example when it comes to creating efficiencies, supporting jobs and being good stewards of our environment,"" said Markell.
\
Markell made the announcement at Motech Americas, a solar company in Newark. Motech Americas currently employs more than 70 people and is in the process of expanding manufacturing capacity. They are expected to add 75 more jobs before the end of the year.
\
The Governor was joined by leaders from local business and higher education, as well as legislators from across the state, including Senator Harris McDowell, Chair of the Senate Energy and Transit Committee and one of Delaware's most active proponents for renewable energy, and Rep. Earl Jacques, who represents the district in which Motech Americas is located. The Cabinet Secretaries present reflected the broad scope of people who will be served by more clean energy jobs the Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Labor, Director of Economic Development and Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.
\
Some of the quality jobs that a clean energy industry would support include skilled trades' people, electricians, steel fabricators, IT specialists, electrical engineers, solar system installers, wind turbine service technicians, training specialists, factory workers and support service personnel like accountants, educators and customer service specialists.
\
""We are working closely with our neighboring states to create a vibrant mid-Atlantic clean energy market, but we also want to maximize capital investment and quality jobs in Delaware. We can move more rapidly, respond to opportunities more quickly and get people back to work,"" Markell said.
\
At the event, the Governor highlighted some of the great work being done by Delaware businesses to move technology and the state's economy forward. For example: DuPont is emerging as a leader in solar technology components; WL Gore is developing next-generation fuel cells; White Optics has an innovative high-efficiency lighting solution; PTM Manufacturing is producing innovative, green-building materials; Sanosil manufactures green cleaning products; Innospec is working on alternative fuels; Autoport is doing electric vehicle conversions and potentially ground-breaking vehicle-to-grid power; IonPower is designing fuel cells; Ashland is developing green chemistry and water technology; Fisker said it expects to employ thousands of Delawareans, and NRG recently acquired Bluewater Wind, recognizing the value of clean energy to their bottom line.

REHOBOTH BEACH -- With the frigid late-January wind whipping off the ocean, it wasn't much of a day to stroll the boardwalk or sit on the beach. But it would have been a great day to generate electricity from the first offshore wind farm in the country.
\
If 200 wind turbines had been sitting offshore, the wind would have spun them at maximum speed, generating in 24 hours about 500 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 500,000 homes for one day.
\
Bluewater Wind, a New Jersey company, wants to build such a wind park 10.5 miles off the coast of this seaside city or seven miles off Bethany Beach to provide Delaware residents a new source of electricity. Supporters point out that production would be free of the pollutants or heat-trapping ""greenhouse gas"" emissions associated with conventional power plants, and fueled by abundant, and free, Atlantic Ocean winds.
\
""You have the Saudi Arabia of wind off your shores,"" said Peter Mandelstam, the company's president. ""It's very windy and the waters are shallow.""
\
The project, now competing with two other power plant ventures, has developed a following across Delaware and would be one of the largest in the world, if approved. Supporters include some of the top politicians and many environmental groups, backed by a University of Delaware-sponsored survey that found broad support for wind energy.
\
But others warn that offshore wind ventures, generally, and Bluewater in particular are sailing into uncharted regions. Bluewater has drawn criticism for submitting a bid based on undisclosed or unproven answers to questions about costs, reliability and effect on birds, fish and other aquatic life and environments.
\
""It's not so much the prediction that something drastic is going to happen, but not enough information has been gathered to even do a logical risk assessment,"" for offshore wind farms, said Susan Nickerson, executive director of the Massachusetts-based environmental group Nantucket Soundkeeper.
\
Offshore wind power involves ""a range of issues -- fishing, tourism, economics, visibility, environmental impacts on bird life, fish, marine mammals,"" Nickerson said.
\
Bluewater and wind power advocates generally say wind power already has proven itself a good neighbor.
\
American wind power production ranks third globally, trailing only Germany and Spain, and accounts for about 20 percent of the world total, according to the Global Wind Energy Council, based in Belgium.
\
Denmark, the world's fifth-largest wind energy producer, has meanwhile sunk billions of dollars into offshore wind and late last year published a study that found wind farms can be developed without significant harm or risk to birds or aquatic life, provided sites are chosen carefully and with adequate precautions.
\
Wind advocates say the findings add to wind power's allure as a way to make energy without the pollutants and carbon-dioxide emissions of conventional power plants. Those features have gained increased attention as world governments wrestle with calls for cuts in heat-trapping carbon-dioxide emissions linked to global warming and climate shifts.
\
""It's made people sit up and put wind into a whole, fresh, new point of view,"" said Guy Dauncey of British Columbia, president of the Sustainable Energy Association and author of the book ""Stormy Weather: 101 Solutions to Climate Change.""
\
Delaware found itself looking for a new approach last year after alarming increases in costs following deregulation of the wholesale electricity market in 1999. The deregulation lifted price caps in May, leading to a 59 percent increase in the cost of residential electricity.
\
The bid is one of three for the Delmarva project. The others are a coal gasification plant proposed by NRG Energy, and a natural gas plant proposed by Conectiv. Four state agencies, advised by Delmarva, are expected to make their final decision by late spring or early summer.
\
""We have a huge stake in this decision. We can set an example for the rest of the country by selecting the one energy option that provides the greatest long-term financial and environmental benefits,"" Delaware Audubon Society, one of the state's oldest environmental groups, said in a position paper supporting Bluewater Wind, released last month.
\
""Wind energy is not a futuristic, niche technology,"" Audubon leaders wrote.
\
Details of plans not made public
\
If it opened today, Bluewater Wind's project off Delaware would rank as the largest offshore wind farm in the world. If completed as company officials hope in 2012, it would likely be the second largest, behind a planned project off the coast of the United Kingdom. There are 17 offshore wind farms worldwide, all off the coasts of Europe.
\
Bluewater Wind made the bid in response to a request for proposals to provide 400 megawatts of electricity to Delmarva Power. The state required Delmarva to seek the bids as part of an effort to provide a long-term, Delaware-produced source of energy.
\
""We've looked carefully at it,"" said Tim Brown, spokesman for Delmarva Power.
\
One concern: Wind turbines rely on weather, operating at full capacity only part of the time. Company officials say the average electricity output throughout the year, including the less windy summer months, would be less than half of what it was on that day last month.
\
Critics say the link to weather forces overinvestment. Wind farms have to be large enough to collect sufficient electricity even when winds are light, pushing developers to plant hundreds of turbines to assure minimum output.
\
""What's happening is people don't understand how you can 'firm up' wind energy,"" Dauncey said. ""If you have hydropower, you can store water behind a dam.""
\
Yet details about Bluewater's capacity plans remain out of reach to the public, as do the details of the two power plants competing for the lucrative deal. Although confidentiality claims are now under review by all three bidders, Bluewater excluded information about the generating capacity and costs of its project from public versions of its application.
\
Other storms lie ahead. Around Nantucket Sound, some opponents say a project to put 130 turbines in federal waters would mar the offshore horizon and disrupt fishing, ferry traffic and navigation.
\
Similar complaints have come ashore in Delaware.
\
""A lot of people are against it because it will ruin the view of the horizon,"" said Robert Littleton, co-owner of Clarksville-based Bobs Marine Service Inc. ""Myself, I would think the wind mills would be a better way to go because you get rid of all the coal ash. I suspect that a lot of people who are opposed have houses on the beach.""
\
Littleton referred to huge old and new stockpiles of ash at NRG's Indian River power plant near Millsboro, where DNREC recently announced plans for a major, utility-financed cleanup to stop pollution from trickling into the river.
\
When the wind isn't blowing
\
Over lunch at Arena's Deli last month, some Rehoboth Beach residents said they're not bothered by the possibility of having 200 wind turbines 11 miles offshore. Renderings, created by RPS of England and supplied by the company, showed the turbines barely visible in the distance.
\
""It goes so far out, I don't think it's going to make a difference,"" said Emily Gilmore, a server at the restaurant, examining a rendering brought into the restaurant by a News Journal reporter. ""People like seeing things out there. 'Ooh, I see a ship.' Now they'll say, 'Ooh, I see a windmill.' ""
\
Another server there, Dawn Kasow, said: ""I couldn't see it without my glasses.""
\
But the renderings released to the public were produced by Bluewater Wind and based on a consultant's ""visualization.""
\
NRG, another company competing for the contract to provide power to Delmarva, said in its filing with the Public Service Commission, and in a full-page ad in The News Journal, that the turbines wouldn't produce enough power on hot, high-demand days. The company also argued that in this age of more hurricanes, a wind farm isn't a good idea.
\
""There are several ironies when NRG raises the question of the ability of wind parks to withstand hurricane-force winds,"" said Jim Lenard, spokesman for Bluewater Wind. He said hurricanes are great for harnessing the wind; when they get too intense, the company turns the turbines off and angles them so the wind slides right by.
\
""Hurricane-force winds that NRG is talking hypothetically about in the North Atlantic would almost only occur with global warming precursor events, to which NRG is a contributor with its many fossil fuel plants throughout the United States,"" Lenard said.
\
Lenard said his company's turbines would operate 85 percent of the time, and that there would be plenty of other sources of electricity to make up for the time that the wind isn't blowing.
\
Dave Bayless, a professor of mechanical engineering at Ohio University, said wind power is inexpensive, but fossil fuel electricity is easier to control. When there's a need for more electricity, companies simply burn more coal or natural gas, he said. Wind turbines, on the other hand, generate electricity only when the wind is blowing, he said.
\
Wind power, he said, can be part of the solution, as long as utilities plan ahead to have fossil fuels available when the wind isn't blowing very hard.
\
""There's plenty of room for wind right now. You do have to be careful with managing your loads, and have something as a backup when you need it,"" Bayless said. ""Utilities do that really well.""
\
To save birds, 'Keep your cats inside'
\
The Bluewater Wind project is one of just a few planned offshore wind projects in this country. Besides the Massachusetts project, there's a 40-turbine project being considered off of Jones Beach, located on Long Island.
\
New projects cannot proceed, however, before the U.S. Minerals Management Service issues Environmental Impact Statement requirements for alternative energy projects along the nation's Outer Continental Shelf.
\
That document, due as early as next month, will establish the rules for evaluating and approving wind power sites. Final regulations are unlikely to be adopted before September and could face challenges.
\
""What we're finding is, we have very little baseline data on Nantucket Sound on which to even base a judgment about the degree of risk,"" Nantucket Soundkeeper's Nickerson said.
\
Concerns about wind power stretch from the tip of the big turbine blades, some 440 feet above the water, to foundation sediments 60 feet below the surface.
\
Awareness of the hazards came the hard way. Earlier-generation, faster-spinning wind turbines built in California's Altamont Pass whack thousands of birds from the sky each year.
\
But studies in Denmark, based on slower-moving and more-modern turbines, found that ""Under the right conditions, even big wind farms pose low risks"" to birds, mammals and fish.
\
""Wind turbines do not kill birds,"" Dauncey said. ""If you want to stop killing birds, keep your cats inside and turn off some of the lights in the city"" on towers and other structures.
\
Although underwater construction work, such as pile-driving, annoyed or frightened away marine mammals, those populations returned later, the Danes found. Fish populations changed and generally increased, congregating around and exploiting new, hard structures amid the shifting sediments.
\
""The Danes were very careful to specify that the findings they were reporting were specific to just two wind farms they studied,"" Nickerson cautioned. ""You have dramatically different conditions in other locations. The dynamics of each site are very unique, and there are significant gaps with regard to what the impacts might be.""
\
Mark Jacobson, associate professor of environmental engineering at Stanford University, said as many as 40,000 birds are killed each year from wind turbines in the United States, but far more are killed by communications towers, he said.
\
A renewable source of energy
\
Bluewater's Mandelstam formerly worked for the City of New York building affordable housing. But he credits reading in 1989 ""The End of Nature,"" Bill McKibben's early book on global warming, with changing his life's purpose.
\
Mandelstam opened a solar nonprofit, but realized quickly what a small part solar would play in the solution. He believed wind power could have a more immediate impact.
\
He started Arcadia Windpower, which built the Judith Gap wind park, a 181-megawatt facility, in Montana.
\
Bluewater Wind is a subsidiary of Arcadia. The Delaware project would be the company's first venture into offshore wind farms, but the company is not the first to propose a site off Delaware.
\
Winergy Power of Hauppauge, N.Y., submitted an application in 2002 to build a 306-turbine, 1,101-megawatt wind farm 3 1/2 miles off the coast of Bethany Beach. The proposal attracted interest from environmentalists, but was criticized by coastal landowners worried the turbines would blot their view.
\
Winergy officials said their application with the federal government has lapsed. ""We're ready to submit"" again when the government says it's OK, said company spokesman Mark Treiser.
\
Mandelstam's project boasts a team of companies experienced in building offshore wind farms abroad, including Fluor, the world's second-largest engineering company, and Ramboll, a large European engineering firm.
\
One fan of offshore wind power is Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. He said he'd like to see both a wind farm and a coal gasification facility, although he added, ""I don't know if that's achievable.""
\
""If wind power off Delmarva (Peninsula) is an economically viable project, when the wind blows, how hard the wind blows, how often throughout the year the wind blows, my hope is wind power will be part of the mix of electricity generation for Delmarva in the early part of this century,"" Carper said.
\
The state will require utilities to get 10 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2019. That would work in Bluewater Wind's favor, being potentially the only major source of clean energy in the state. Company executives say opening the proposed wind farm would provide the utilities with all of the renewable power they need to comply with the law.
\
Utilities, however, also have the option of buying renewable power from out of state.
\
Bluewater Wind faces a potential hurdle in the form of a point system set out by the Public Service Commission as a way of evaluating the bids.
\
Critics, like Treasurer Jack Markell, say the point system puts too much emphasis on price and not enough on price stability and environmental concerns. Wind farms have high startup costs, but advocates say they pay for themselves in the long run.
\
As for the point system, ""I go where opportunities are good, and I live with the situation,"" Mandelstam said.
\
Company officials aren't afraid to talk up the dire consequences of global warming to help make their case. If the current projections are right, one-third of Delaware could someday be under water.
\
Mike McCabe, a former deputy administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a consultant to Delmarva Power, said if Delawareans want to stop global warming, they have to start making changes.
\
""Delaware has a tremendous amount to lose, if the projections are right,"" McCabe said.

That would work in Bluewater Wind's favor, being potentially the only major source of clean energy in the state. Company executives say opening the proposed wind farm would provide the utilities with all of the renewable power they need to comply with the law.
\
Utilities, however, also have the option of buying renewable power from out of state.
\
Bluewater Wind faces a potential hurdle in the form of a point system set out by the Public Service Commission as a way of evaluating the bids.
\
Critics, like Treasurer Jack Markell, say the point system puts too much emphasis on price and not enough on price stability and environmental concerns. Wind farms have high startup costs, but advocates say they pay for themselves in the long run.
\
As for the point system, ""I go where opportunities are good, and I live with the situation,"" Mandelstam said.
\
Company officials aren't afraid to talk up the dire consequences of global warming to help make their case. If the current projections are right, one-third of Delaware could someday be under water.
\
Mike McCabe, a former deputy administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a consultant to Delmarva Power, said if Delawareans want to stop global warming, they have to start making changes.
\
""Delaware has a tremendous amount to lose, if the projections are right,"" McCabe said.

104,"""Even though the president has decided to pull out of the Paris agreement, that's not going to stop our efforts here in the state of Delaware to meet our obligations and to meet our goals and targets [for renewable energy].""\Gov. John Carney\The unveiling of another large solar array is helping Delaware close in on an ambitious energy goal.\The state wants to generate 25 percent of power from renewable sources by 2025, with 3.5 percent from solar.\On Tuesday, completion of one of the biggest solar arrays was announced as the state continues to increase its solar capacity at a rapid pace.\Delaware Technical Community College celebrated the end of its $7 million energy project; a carport solar array at the school's Terry Campus is the last of nine solar installation on its campuses statewide.\The completion of this project brings the college's energy production to 2.1 megawatts and is expected to offset approximately 12 percent of its annual energy needs.\It is among a number of large solar installations that have gone up around the state, including Milford Solar Farm, completed in 2013 with the capacity to generate 15 megawatts of electricity, enough to power nearly 1,600 Delaware homes.\That photovoltaic project run by Delaware Municipal Electric Corp. is the biggest solar installation in the state, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.\Delaware Tech's statewide project was part of a goal to reduce energy use and its carbon footprint by 20 percent by 2020, which is spelled out in the school's 2010 Sustainable Energy Management Plan.\""That plan included a goal, and at the time, we thought that goal might be too ambitious,"" Delaware Tech President Mark Brainard said. ""But it wasn't. We have reduced our carbon footprint by 25 percent three years early. We took this very seriously and have gotten results.""\Gov. John Carney said Delaware Tech's effort is a strong statement in the face of national trends.\""Even though the president has decided to pull out of the Paris agreement, that's not going to stop our efforts here in the state of Delaware to meet our obligations and to meet our goals and targets [for renewable energy],"" Carney said.\As school officials recognized the value of managing energy, they decided solar would be the best option to save on energy costs and take a leadership position in carbon reduction and sustainable energy production.\While talking about climate change and uses of energy, Carney told Brainard and the other companies that partnered with the college on the project that solar energy was clearly the approach that needed to be taken.\""It's just unbelievable to me that you set that 20 percent goal and you met 25 percent three years early,"" he said. ""I think the reason you did that was you really put your shoulder to the wheel. It was a conscious effort.""\According to Standard Solar Inc., in partnership with Urban Grid - the companies that financed the projects under a 20-year power purchase agreement with Delaware Tech - the first phase of the system included 806 kilowatts on four campuses and began producing energy in 2013. That included a solar carport and rooftop array at the Wilmington campus, rooftop arrays at the Stanton and Dover campuses and ground-mounted panels at the Georgetown campus.\The combined project can generate more than 2.9 million kilowatt-hours per year, according to Standard Solar; that's equivalent to offsetting the carbon dioxide emissions from more than 2.2 million pounds of coal, or 220 homes' energy use a year.\Energy education\Back in 2010, Delaware Tech officials recognized that the solar industry was adding jobs 20 times faster than the overall economy.\That prompted the college to start two-year degree programs related to the field. According to the Solar Jobs Census, the timing couldn't have been better as employers are constantly looking for workers with skills in the solar industry.\The Solar Jobs Census 2016 found that solar employment increased by over 51,000 workers, or 25 percent, since 2015. The number of jobs in the sector nearly tripled since the first National Solar Jobs Census was released in 2010.\Rapidly falling prices of solar panels and advances in technology have helped create this job boom, prompting Delaware's photovoltaic companies, homebuilders, government agencies and electric utility companies to seek more workers.\Jennifer Clemons is the department chair and an instructor and program adviser for Delaware Tech's energy programs. She was hired in 2011 to help launch the degree programs and said companies are ""screaming"" for more graduates to work in the solar energy field.\""Right now, we have a 100 percent job placement rate in our two-year degree program,"" Clemons said. ""Employers are constantly coming to us for people to work in these jobs.""\Just recently, Clemons said Honeywell contacted her for people, but she couldn't provide the company with employees because all of Delaware Tech's graduates were already employed.\""As long as the market supports this, I would like to see all of the seats [in our program] filled,"" Clemons said. ""And as long as we can continue the 100 percent placement rate, I would like to see this program grow.""\Joe Latteri finished the two-year program in May and immediately went to work for one of the companies building the solar panel arrays at Delaware Tech.\""It was really cool seeing the [solar array panel] project come together and being able to work on it,"" said the 20-year-old Delaware Tech graduate from Magnolia. ""This is a good program, especially if you want to do something for the environment and want a good job right out of school.""\Keeping up\Robert Underwood, program administrator for the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control's Division of Energy & Climate, said Delaware Tech's renewable energy plan is a big reason Delaware is meeting the goals specified in the Renewable Portfolio Standard.\""Delaware Tech had a vision and is following its plan and doing great things,"" Underwood said. ""They have been pushing the envelope in renewable energy projects and by developing two-year degree programs in renewable energy.""\The Division of Energy & Climate seeks to accelerate Delaware's transition to a clean energy economy and ensure that Delawareans have access to cost-effective and reliable energy by increasing energy efficiency and conservation, increasing the use of cleaner fossil fuels and renewable sources of energy, and modernizing Delaware's transmission and distribution infrastructure.\Underwood said that the state's Green Energy Program is proof the state is moving toward cleaner, renewable energy. Underwood said that more than $55 million in grants have been given to Delaware residents and businesses to help install solar power.\""Delaware has done some great things driven by RPS and the drop in solar costs,"" Underwood said. ""Delaware Tech is a shining example and the latest project that will help the state continue to meet its Renewable Portfolio Standard goals.""\Reach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com. Follow him on Twitter at @JerrySmithTNJ.\""Even though the president has decided to pull out of the Paris agreement, that's not going to stop our efforts here in the state of Delaware to meet our obligations and to meet our goals and targets [for renewable energy].""\Gov. John Carney\SOLAR FACTS\Currently, Delaware ranks 29th in the U.S. in the use of solar energy, which is one better than it was in 2016, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.\Here are other facts on the Delaware solar industry:\Total solar installed: 99.4 megawatts (16.9 MW installed in 2016)\State homes powered by solar: 11,000\Percentage of state's electricity from solar: 1.61 percent\Solar jobs and ranking: 363 (46th in 2016)\Solar companies in state: 53 companies total; 8 manufacturers, 31 installers/developers, 11 others\Total solar investment in state: $323.38 million ($48.78 million in 2016)\Price declines: 64 percent over past five years"

Bills introduced
\
S.B. 125 (Adams): Addresses the incongruity of maintaining two separate agencies responsible for managing offenders once released from incarceration. When an individual is released from incarceration, the period of time reflecting his or her good time credit is called ""conditional release."" Presently while on conditional release, the defendant is supervised by probation officers, and if a violation occurs the defendant is brought before the Parole Board for that violation. Thereafter, while on probation if the defendant violates it, he or she is brought before the sentencing court to be resentenced. The ""dual"" supervision by different bodies has caused confusion, inefficiencies and modifications inconsistent with the court's original order and appears to be a leftover of the system eliminated in 1989. To executive.
\
S.B. 126 (Adams): Keeps the present maximum fines for drug offenses, but would eliminate the mandatory imposition of those amounts and would allow for judicial discretion with respect to the imposition of drug fines, taking into consideration the particular facts involved in sentencing individual defendants. Many times, the large financial burden imposed by these fines affects the rehabilitation effort of the defendant and may actually cause an individual to commit additional crimes to satisfy the obligation. This will allow the judge to impose the appropriate fine based upon the facts of each case. To executive.
\
S.B. 127 (Adams): Addresses the difficulty offenders face when trying to satisfy the conditions of probation, employment and treatment without a driver's license. It creates a conditional driver's license limited to the purpose of satisfying probational requirements and rehabilitation. To executive.
\
S.B. 35 (McDowell): Increases the system benefit charge for the Green Energy Fund by adding 18 cents per month to the average residential customer's electricity bill. The Green Energy Fund helps stimulate the local renewable energy sector. Increased funding will allow more Delaware households and businesses to benefit from renewable energy. To Senate Energy & Transit Committee.
\
Bills passed
\
H.B. 83 w/ H.A. 1 (Viola): Requires that retailers that provide full- and self-service gasoline sales must provide refueling assistance to drivers with disabilities at the self-service rate. The bill also requires gasoline retailers that offer only self-service to have at least one calling device accessible to a driver with a disability to call for refueling assistance. The calling-device provision requires 50 percent compliance one year after enactment and 100 percent compliance after three years. Violators face a monetary civil penalty of not less than $300 and no more than $600. 18 yes, 3 absent (not available). To governor.

H.B. 177 (Gilligan): Most states abolished ""fusion"" candidacies over a century ago. Only six states other than Delaware still permit such a practice. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has upheld state laws prohibiting fusion candidacies. This bill would allow only members of a political party to seek that party's nomination for an elected office in a primary or otherwise be nominated for office by that party. However, persons unaffiliated with any party still have the right to appear on the ballot as permitted by law. 17 yes, 19 no (Blakey, Booth, Carey, Cathcart, Ewing, Hastings, Hocker, Hudson, Lee, Maier, Manolakos, Miro, Outten, D. Short, Stone, Thornburg, Valihura, Wagner, Lavelle), 5 not voting (Lofink, Oberle, Spence, Williams, Kowalko).
\
S.B. 5 w/S.A. 4 + H.A. 1, H.A. 2, H.A. 3 (Venables): This is the Delaware Regenerative Medicine Act. The purpose of this act is to encourage and foster responsible, ethical and moral public policy governing research in the emerging science of regenerative medicine, which includes stem cell research of all types. Further, this act seeks to ensure that any human embryonic stem cell research conducted in Delaware will adhere to broadly accepted standards. This act prohibits and establishes penalties for the practice of, or the attempt to practice, human reproductive cloning. The act also prohibits the sale of, or attempts to sell, human embryos in the state of Delaware. 7 yes, (Hudson, Johnson, Plant, Schwartzkopf, B. Short, Manolakos, Ennis), 30 no, 3 not voting (Ewing, Maier, McWilliams), 1 absent (Stone).

\
H.B. 72 w/S.A. 1, S.A. 2 (Schwartzkopf): Authorizes the Division of Public Health to assess fees for plumbing permits issued by the Division of Public Health and for plumbing inspections required because plumbing does not comply with the State Plumbing Code or is not ready for inspections at the scheduled time. Revenue generated by these fees shall be retained by the Division of Public Health to defray costs associated with the plumbing program. This bill also empowers the Division of Public Health to impose civil fines for noncompliance with plumbing regulations and increases the criminal fines that may be imposed from $25 nor more than $100 to $100 nor more than $1,000. 41 yes. To governor.

This act is a housekeeping measure since benefits exceeding those allowable by current statute are available from the benefit association. 41 yes. To Senate.
\
H.B. 207 (Ewing): Would insure that those who engage in the drug trade using counterfeit controlled substances or tainted controlled substances are treated as if they had been dealing the actual drug they represent their wares to be. As the Delaware Supreme Court noted when discussing a predecessor of this act, ""[a]nything which gives sustenance, solace, comfort, or encouragement in the selling of narcotics or in the agreeing to sell narcotics, can be condemned, and properly so, by the legislature ... [t]he aim of [such] statues is not to proscribe fraudulent narcotics traffic but rather to prohibit anyone from appearing to engage in narcotics traffic."" 41 yes. To Senate.
\
H.B. 212 w/H.A. 2 (Manolakos): Expands the coverage of the Child Safe School Zone Act to include other areas where children may be gathered, such as parks, recreation facilities, athletic fields, playgrounds, skating rinks, neighborhood centers, gymnasiums, school bus stops, swimming pools, dance studios or karate centers. The act ensures enhanced protection for children while not unduly limiting access to public areas for sex offenders by prohibiting those offenders from those areas only: (1) when children are there congregated; (2) when the offender is present with no specific or legitimate reason. 41 yes.

This bill also provides that contractual limitations under a property insurance contract may not require a claimant to file an action less than one year from the date of the denial of the claim. 41 yes. To Senate.
\
H.B. 263 (Outten): Clarifies that only new tires and not used and remanufactured tires are subject to the $2 fee imposed on the sale of tires and used to fund the Scrap Tire Management Fund. The act also clarifies that the definition of farm tractor for purposes of the statute is found in [section]101 of Title 21 of the Delaware Code. 41 yes. To Senate.
\
H.J.R. 12 (Carey): Requests the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to issue a final ruling for conservation management of the greater snow goose. Voice vote yes. To Senate.
\
H.J.R. 13 (Miro): Directs the secretary of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services to perform a fiscal impact analysis to determine how much revenue Delaware pharmacies are expected to lose because of Medicaid's new formula that determines maximum reimbursement for multiple-source drugs, and directs the director of the Division of Social Services to adopt emergency and final regulations that increase the amount of reimbursement. Voice vote yes. To Senate.
\
H.R. 38 (Stone): This legislation creates a Health Insurance Pools Task Force to perform certain analyses and make legislative recommendations by March 15, 2008.

To governor.
\
S.B. 82 (Henry): Will permit the DMV to cooperate with federal agencies in the enforcement of commercial vehicle regulations, including the new PRISM program. The Performance and Registration Information Systems Management program (PRISM) is a cooperative agreement between the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the states.

\
S.B. 84 w/S.A. 1, S.A. 4 (Sokola): Replaces and updates the current pharmacy chapter of Title 24, including provisions relating to objectives, licensure, examination, reciprocity, complaints, grounds for discipline, hearings and sanctions. The provision for a counseling option for pharmacists impaired by drug or alcohol use or abuse is maintained, but the section has been amended to provide that if the pharmacist does not agree with the alleged facts, the matter proceeds with a complaint and an opportunity for a hearing. 41 yes. To governor.
\
S.B. 89 (Cook): Geospatial data and information refers to information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the earth. This information may be derived from, among other things, remote sensing, mapping, and surveying technologies. This act creates a Delaware Geographic Data Committee to coordinate the use and sharing of geospatial data and information among all levels of government, and with the academic and private sectors. The act also clarifies requirements for the publication of geospatial data and information. 40 yes, 1 absent (Spence). To governor.
\
S.B. 105 (Adams): Would delete the requirement that Social Security numbers appear on all decrees of divorce or annulment. 40 yes, 1 absent (Spence). To governor.
\
S.B. 111 w/S.A. 1 (Sorenson): Adds a felony-level violation to the existing provisions for criminal contempt of a domestic violence protection order. Criminal contempt of such an order will constitute a class F felony in cases where the violation involved physical injury or the use or threatened use of a weapon. 39 yes, 2 absent (Cathcart, Mulrooney). To governor.
\
S.B. 112 (Henry): Would exempt licensed health care professionals as well as trained, non-icensed persons, acting at the direction of the Public Health Authority, from the licensing statutes and regulations for health care professionals. This exemption is necessary to allow trained, nonlicensed persons to hand out prepackaged medications to essential workers -- Delaware's first line of defense -- without there necessarily being a licensed health care professional physically present to oversee the dispensing process. 41 yes. To governor.
\
S.B. 113 w/S.A. 1 (McDowell): Reduces caseload standards of Division of Family Services' caseworkers. It reduces investigation caseloads from 14 to 11 with no current fiscal impact. It reduces treatment caseloads from 18 to 12 with a fiscal impact. As a result of the fiscal impact, the bill provides for a three-year fiscal plan for phasing in the reduction which is consistent with federal and state mandates for safety, permanency and well-being for Delaware's children. 41 yes. To governor.
\
S.B. 128 (Still): The House of Pride Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization created to help fight substance abuse in the Dover area. The city of Dover already exempts its properties from city property tax. This act would add the House of Pride Inc. to the list of organizations specifically exempted from property taxation by any county or other political subdivision of this state. 40 yes, 1 absent (Outten). To governor.
\
S.B. 139 w/S.A. 1 (DeLuca): Section 4701 provides a short title for Chapter 47 of Title 12, providing that the chapter will be referred to as the ""Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act."" The chapter is based on the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws, which approved and recommended the act for enactment in all states in 2006. Section 4702 provides definitions used in the chapter. 41 yes. To governor
\
S.B. 140 (Bonini): The proposed reincorporation of the charter of Frederica is a compilation of its old charter along with the charters of several other towns of similar size. The University of Delaware and the previous town solicitor put together a packet of information for the town to select from. There were several town workshop meetings that were attended by the residents of the town. Questionnaires were filled out by the residents. 41 yes. To governor
\
S.B. 144 (DeLuca): This act adds clarity and precision to the section of Delaware's Criminal Code that establishes the defense of ""guilty, but mentally ill."" Section 1 of the Act replaces the phrase ""psychiatric disorder"" as it currently appears in the definition of ""guilty, but mentally ill"" with the phrase ""mental illness or mental defect."" The phrase ""psychiatric disorder"" is not defined anywhere in the Delaware Code, nor is it defined in any major dictionary, medical dictionary or psychiatric reference. 41 yes. To governor
\
S.B. 145 w/S.A. 1 (Sokola): This bill creates a new license for Land Surveyor Intern under the regulatory authority of the Board of Professional Land Surveyors, permitting the new licensees to perform activities under the supervision of a licensed professional land surveyor, as determined by regulations adopted by the board. The bill specifies the required qualifications, licensing and disciplining both for professional land surveyors and land surveyor interns. It permits work performed under the direct supervision of a Maryland property line surveyor, or a similar limited license in other states, to count the same as work under a professional land surveyor. These Maryland licensees perform boundary line surveys, a critical experience element for Delaware professional land surveyors. The bill provides for fees to be set by the Division of Professional Regulation, creates grounds for discipline for licensees who practice after their licenses have lapsed, and allows the board to issue letters of concern. 41 yes. To governor.
\
S.B. 146 (Still): Would decrease maximum bonded indebtedness for the city of Dover from 25 percent to 5 percent and amend the $1 million bond limit without a referendum to 1/4 of one percent (0.25 percent) of total assessed value of real property or $3 million, whichever is less. 40 yes, 1 absent (Spence). To governor.
\
S.B. 149 w/S.A. 1 (Marshall): Establishes a framework for Delaware to attract high-paying, competitive jobs into the next decade. To qualify, a new employer must add at least 50 net new jobs which each have an annual salary of at least $100,000. Up to 40 percent of the withholding taxes collected and paid on behalf of these new, qualified employees during the taxable year will be rebated. Higher refund amounts will be granted for qualifying employees employed within targeted growth zones, incorporated municipalities and former brownfields. Qualifying firms would be eligible for credits over a ten-year period and would need to apply annually for the rebate. 40 yes, 1 absent (Spence). To governor.
\
S.B. 150 w/S.A. 1 (Blevins): This legislation will enhance and strengthen Delaware's medical corps by ensuring that medical personnel who volunteer their services during emergency and/or disaster relief operations are protected from liability in the same way that state emergency responders are protected. 40 yes, 1 absent (Spence). To governor.
\
S.B. 153 (Adams): This act amends the charter of the town of Ellendale to update its annexation procedures and to eliminate the need for an annexation election where the lands proposed for annexation involve two contiguous acres or less and the owners of record thereof have requested or consented to the annexation. 40 yes, 1 absent (Spence).
