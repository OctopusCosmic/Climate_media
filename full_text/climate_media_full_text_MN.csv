0," In the last presidential campaign, George W. Bush staked out a moderate approach to environmental protection. Mostly he called for adjusting the balance between competing values - relaxing some regulations in favor of economic growth, moving from command-and- control oversight to free-market incentives, shifting some decision- making out of Washington and into local communities.\ One can agree in principle with the president on all of these points and still see his record as dismal - a radical and secretive dismantling of sensible, productive programs that were decades in the making and, in nearly all cases, bipartisan at birth.\ Was this a conservative, free-enterprise agenda? The Political Economy Research Center, perhaps the nation's leading advocate for letting market mechanisms take care of the environment, has graded Bush's policies and come up with a ""D."" In PERC's view, the president has simply rolled back rules without creating alternatives. Taxpayer groups lament his fondness for subsidizing favored industries, like timber.\ Was it a Republican agenda? The Bush record has so appalled a wide range of GOP traditionalists that it sparked creation of REP America (Republicans for Environmental Protection). REP has urged the president, so far in vain, to honor the legacies of Republican predecessors from Theodore Roosevelt through Richard Nixon (and even, on selected issues, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush).\ Putting it bluntly, the Bush agenda on environment has been driven chiefly by cronyism - the distribution of favors to the oil, gas, logging, mining and electric-power industries that contribute heavily to his campaigns and, in case after case, have gotten their regulatory preferences pasted verbatim into administration policy.\ It is not even a probusiness agenda in any broad or long-term sense. For every company that benefits from the president's rollbacks, others are disadvantaged - for example, by foregone investments in energy-efficient technologies and products, renewable fuels, brownfield rehabilitation. These sectors represent some of the nation's best opportunities for new leadership in the world economy.\ Indeed, it can be difficult these days to find informed and independent supporters of Bush's environmental record outside a tight circle of administration officials, congressional allies and industry associations. Even some prime beneficiaries of his rollbacks, such as major oil companies, are muttering as they plan for the days of tightened control that they know must follow this respite.\ .\ In recent months, the president's campaign has been handed an unexpected problem in what had been considered safe territory, demographically and geographically. Hunting and fishing groups, notably in the Rocky Mountain West, have been urging members to consider the rollbacks' damaging impacts on their sports - habitat loss to drilling and logging, a virtual halt in new wilderness designations, worsening mercury contamination in fish downwind from coal-burning power plants.\ These are clear and logical links between administration actions and real-world results. But many Americans may find it difficult to make such connections, because the administration has made headlines with only a small portion of its campaign against the environment.\ Nearly everyone knows, of course, that George W. Bush thinks it would be a splendid idea to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Most probably know that he canceled the ""roadless rule,"" which protected the remaining large, wild fragments of federal land from subsidized logging and other development. Perhaps they recall his pulling the United States out of the Kyoto treaty on greenhouse gas emissions, saying global warming was a problem that needed more study.\ But these items can be seen as the tip of an iceberg extending far down into the nation's environmental governance, where the Bush administration has been quietly rewriting the rules, replacing the rulemakers, even changing the rules by which new rules are written.\ Take that fish-tainting mercury, for example. Under the Clean Air Act, power-plant emissions fall into two classes: especially nasty toxins, which are supposed to be controlled as tightly as the ""maximum achievable control technology"" permits, and lesser pollutants, for which the standards can reflect a cost-benefit analysis.\ Mercury is the neurotoxin that made the hatters mad in Victorian England, that deformed the children of Japanese tuna fishermen in 1950s, and that now forces health departments in Minnesota and most other states to warn anglers against eating their catch. In the United States, about 40 percent of airborne mercury comes from coal- fired power plants.\ The Environmental Protection Agency, during the Clinton administration, saw mercury as a clear candidate for maximum control, along with such other substances as asbestos, chromium and lead. In the Bush administration, however, smokestack mercury was classed with the sulfur and nitrogen compounds that cause smog and acid rain. The permissible national load of mercury emissions was increased. Moreover, a cap-and-trade system would allow utilities to buy and sell mercury-pollution credits among themselves, ensuring that ""hot spots"" of contamination around the biggest polluters would only get worse.\ The mercury initiative was a key component of the president's program of handouts to polluting utilities, unabashedly titled the ""Clear Skies"" initiative. As with the ""Healthy Forests"" plan, which expands logging in national forests under the guise of preventing catastrophic fires, the president's team showed a gift for happy, if shameless, sloganeering.\ But scores of other rollbacks have been undertaken with little, if any, public announcement. Still others have been accomplished by soliciting or failing to oppose lawsuits that advance a particularly unpopular administration preference - suspending the roadless rule, for example - so the courts are blamed.\ You don't need to be a woman of childbearing age, or her husband or father or brother, to be appalled by the administration's about- face on mercury. You don't need to be an antilogging zealot to wish for honest forest management, or a reduction in taxpayer subsidies - or to wonder why Western governors should be given management authority over national forests in their states.\ You don't even need to be an ""environmentalist"" to be offended by George W. Bush's performance in this sphere. You need only be an American who thinks environmental issues are important, that the balance between competing values should be struck fairly, honestly and in the open, and that a president of the United States ought to keep his word, more or less.\ .\ In a more typical election contest, an editorial would analyze the candidates' positions on selected policy questions in some depth. This race is different. In the environmental arena, at least, John Kerry and George W. Bush have compiled records so completely opposite that there is no need to look for nuance-and Bush's may well prove to be the most destructive of any American president's.\ As for Kerry, his voting record in the Senate has earned him nearly perfect marks from the League of Conservation Voters. But he has hardly been an extremist, or even notably activist. As an analysis on the front of this section concludes, he has been a steady supporter and occasional leader on environmental protection. He has also opposed, on almost a point-by-point basis, the Bush rollbacks on clean air, clean water, alternative energy and wilderness protection. He seems to appreciate that sound environmental stewardship also holds the potential for strong economic growth.\ Neither the Kerry nor the Bush campaign has laid much emphasis on environmental issues so far. If that changes, Americans may hear whether Kerry has new ideas for the nation. If not, they can fairly expect him to reverse the damage done by President Bush."
1,"BLOOMINGTON -- Carbon cap and trade legislation is effectively ""dead"" in Congress, House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson told feed industry executives Monday, with the chief struggle over carbon regulation now solely being played out in and around the Environmental Protection Agency.\The Senate isn't just short of the votes for a cap-and-trade measure like what passed the House last June, it's short of the votes for any significant climate measure at all. And today Peterson confirmed the whispers on Capitol Hill -- that environmental lobbyists are scaling back their efforts on a large-scale climate bill because they too have come to privately accept that it won't happen this year.\""The environmental community has basically stood down and they're pulling all of their money out of the effort and all their lobbying,"" Peterson said. ""So it's dead.""\""So the issue now is is the EPA going to try to regulate this under the Clean Air Act?"" Peterson said. That was almost certainly a rhetorical question, because the answer is obviously yes. In fact, they've already started.\In 2009, the EPA ruled that greenhouse gasses were an ""endangerment"" to humans, a move that paves the way for regulating emissions under the Clean Air Act. It's an argument linked to climate change, specifically that ""climate change caused by emissions of greenhouse gases threatens the public's health and the environment."" Last month the EPA upheld its own decision when it rejected petitions that suggested the science behind climate change theory was faulty.\Now the agency is moving full steam ahead on regulations aimed at cutting emissions from cars and trucks. Power plants and heavy manufacturers are up next. And if the agency can deflect anticipated court challenges, experts say it may pursue even more aggressive carbon policies, like a national cap on carbon -- which the toughest half of the phrase cap and trade.\Ironically, while the carbon bill is dead, so too is a measure that would forbid the EPA from regulating it under the Clean Air Act.\Peterson and Missouri Rep. Ike Skelton were among those who proposed a bill to that effect. The measure wound up co-signed by a couple dozen Democrats and Republicans. Peterson reckons it could have passed the House had it made it to the floor.\But Republicans held off endorsing his measure en masse -- preferring instead to introduce their own carbon bill. That one was a replca of the Peterson/Skelton bill, but with no Democrats on board. It, like the carbon cap-and-trade bill before it, has stalled in Congress.\And with Congress refusing to pass anything on carbon either way, the EPA continues to have free rein to deal with the problem as it sees fit.\Credit: Derek Wallbank"
2,"lschumacher@stcloudtimes.com\U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann brought her opposition to President Obama's plan to reduce carbon emissions to St. Cloud State University on Thursday, repeating a discredited claim about how much the plan would cost Minnesotans in the process.\In front of a crowd of more than 400 people gathered at Atwood Memorial Center to hear her talk about climate change, Bachmann said she would oppose a carbon cap-and-trade proposal.\Among other reasons, she said it was because she believed it would cost each Minnesota family $2,500.\""This energy tax, I am very concerned, will hike up taxes by as much as $2,500 for a family of four in Minnesota, by at least one study,"" she told the crowd during prepared comments introducing Chris Horner.\Horner is a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C., free-market think tank that opposes cap-and-trade.\Cap-and-trade is a plan in which total emissions are capped by the government. Industries that release less than allowed get credits they can sell to industries that release more. Over time, the total allowable emissions are reduced.\Bachmann's estimate of the cost to Minnesotans, made in a Twin Cities newspaper opinion piece this week and in her newsletter to constituents, is derived from a House Republican take on a recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study.\One of the scientists involved has called the Republican estimate ""nearly 10 times the correct estimate of $340"" per year on average.\John M. Reilly, associate director for research at the Joint Program on Global Change, sent a letter April 1 to House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, to ""clear up any misunderstanding and avoid further confusion"" about the cost estimate.\Bachmann has advocated for drilling for more oil and natural gas in parts of the country that are protected.\She has argued that global climate change is not due to human activity.\Bachmann took no questions from the audience Thursday and left the room without addressing requests to substantiate her claim.\Bachmann spokesman Dave Dziok later said she had to leave for a similar forum in Woodbury, and that her claim was based on the House Republican estimate.\She left most of the day's talking to Horner, a lawyer and author of two books skeptical of global climate change.\Horner repeated the claim about the estimated costs of the cap-and-trade proposal, citing the conservative Washington, D.C.-based Heritage Foundation as a source.\Taxing issue\Horner delivered a lecture and slide show to the crowd that appeared evenly divided between climate change skeptics and those who believe climate change is caused by human activity.\He argued that global climate change is not man-made, and that efforts to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases will do nothing besides cost Americans money and jobs.\""Cap-and-trade is an energy tax. It's the best kind of tax, a hidden tax,"" he said. ""I can't tell you who it will hit, except, ultimately, it will be you.""\Associate St. Cloud State geology professor Al Pekarek, a climate change skeptic, emceed the event and read questions from the audience.\Pekarek called Obama's proposed cap-and-trade plan ""a potentially economy-crippling tax"" and said that there had been no significant national debate on the issue of climate change ""because believers in global warming do not accept the challenge.""\Distortions\All Thursday's forum served to do was illustrate how politics distort science on both sides of the climate change issue, said Bob Weisman, professor of meteorology at St. Cloud State and a member of the audience.\""For the most part, it was a political statement. There wasn't a lot of science there,"" Weisman said. ""We'd say the same thing about (former Vice President Al Gore's climate change documentary) 'An Inconvenient Truth,' by the way.""\Derek Larson, environmental studies program director at the College of St. Benedict/St. John's University, said he and his department saw Horner's presentation once before at St. John's and felt no need to attend Thursday's event.\""He's not a scientist and he's misrepresenting everything. He's coming from the CEI, which is funded by Exxon,"" Larson said of Horner. ""And Rep. Bachmann is not interested in any dialogue, or she would have invited both perspectives on the issue.""\Ciru Mugo, a first-year graduate student at St. Cloud State University and a native of Kenya, said she was disappointed that Bachmann didn't give students a chance to present their points of view on the issue.\""I thought she was going to listen to us,"" Mugo said. She said she supports the idea of a cap-and-trade policy because ""it lets people know the true cost of production,"" including impact on the environment.\Ronald Skelton, a Christian evangelist from St. Cloud, said he agrees with Bachmann that cap-and-trade is bad policy because it would drive up energy costs and is based on dubious science.\""Global warming has not been proven. It's a theory,"" Skelton said.\Some agreement\Despite disagreeing with him ""100 percent, politically,"" Weisman said he agreed with Horner that the Obama administration's cap-and-trade program likely won't do anything to effect climate change.\""Like the Kyoto treaty, it won't bring down global warming,"" Weisman said. ""You'd need something more like a 40 percent cut in emissions (to do that).""\Horner said the cap-and-trade plan would result in ""Soviet-style manufacturing quotas.""\Anthony Akubue, a professor of environmental and technological studies at St. Cloud State, said he believes man-made climate change must be addressed, but he also dislikes cap-and-trade proposals.\""As far as I'm concerned, industry has always found a way to circumvent whatever limits are placed on it when Congress puts in credits and other breaks,"" he said.\Times staff writer Kirsti Marohn contributed to this report."
3,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The cap-and-trade policy debate may just be getting started in Congress, but the fight over who gets to regulate the emerging carbon market has already turned into a feisty insider battle.\Bloomberg reports that a tug of war has begun between Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., over who gets to control what would become one of the world's largest derivatives markets.\On one side stands Peterson, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). On other side is Markey, who heads the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee, which supervises the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\Both congressmen claim that their committees have more experience regulating the relevant markets.\While the difference between the CFTC and FERC may seem fairly trivial from outside the beltway -- a matter of two letters in a four-letter acronym -- to the committee members it is anything but.\Campaign money from industries, you see, has a funny way of flowing to members of committees with the corresponding regulation power.\Bloomberg reports thusly: ""Employees of oil and gas companies gave $2 million to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees their industry, in the 2008 elections, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics. That compares with $1.1 million to the House Agriculture Committee, which has jurisdiction over oil and gas futures markets through the CFTC.""\Credit: Cynthia Dizikes"
4,"Minnesotans may soon be asked to drive less (or slower) plow less earth and plug in fluorescent light bulbs as part of the effort to combat climate change. \But the most extensive strategy may be one that doesn't yet exist in Minnesota, and few may ever notice: a ""carbon market."" \A group of business leaders, environmentalists and others has begun examining a free-form system in which large emitters of carbon dioxide, such as coal-burning energy-producers, could buy or sell credits permitting the release of carbon dioxide into the environment. \If it works as intended, such a program could reduce Minnesota's greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 by anywhere from one-eighth to one-third of current levels. \The so-called ""cap and trade"" system, similar to one that was critical in reducing acid-rain-causing emissions in the 1990s, was one of several dozen global-warming-mitigation strategies hashed over Thursday by the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Council. \The group, authorized by Gov. Tim Pawlenty and the Legislature last year, has been meeting since April, when it listed several hundred proposals, and recently winnowed those down to about 60. \In recent weeks, the panel's research group began presenting financial and environmental assessments of each proposal. The overall aim is to reduce Minnesota's carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050. \Scientists believe that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming that could dramatically alter Minnesota's climate. \Energy production accounts for about one-third of Minnesota's greenhouse gas emissions and for that reason is most likely to be the first sector of the economy to have its emissions capped. Transportation kicks out another 25 percent and buildings another 25 percent, but they are more diffuse and difficult to regulate, noted Jim Turnure, environmental policy manger for Xcel Energy, the state's largest energy provider. \Turnure said emissions caps and the trading system that would emerge would mean higher costs for energy customers, at least until the utilities are able to reduce their emissions below required limits. But Turnure couldn't say how much higher. ""Everything depends on how stringent the cap is,"" he noted. \Minnesota would likely enter into a trading system with other states, similar to markets that already exist in the western United States and New England. North Dakota, Minnesota's neighbor and a leading producer of the coal Minnesota burns, has resisted the idea because it would put coal at a competitive disadvantage. \. \Staff writer H.J.

5,"ST. CLOUD - Rep. Michele Bachmann has said she wants Minnesotans ""armed and dangerous"" against the climate-protection strategy known as ""cap and trade."" But what she and a fellow presenter encountered at a forum Thursday was a small army that engaged in a standing ovation, then some enemy fire. \About 500 people, perhaps fewer than half of them students, turned out at St. Cloud State University to hear Bachmann and author and global-warming skeptic Chris Horner elaborate on what has become a hot topic for her in recent months -- a plan to establish a market for the right to emit carbon dioxide. \But after Bachmann was greeted warmly by many in the ballroom of the Atwood Memorial Center who cheered and rose to their feet, Horner was repeatedly pestered during a PowerPoint presentation by students insisting that he ""answer the question"" and holding up signs reading ""Lies"" and ""Fact Check!"" \Bachmann spoke for less than 10 minutes, during which she largely read her op-ed piece that appeared in Wednesday's Star Tribune in which she criticized the cap-and-trade plan going before Congress as an ""energy tax."" Horner spoke and took questions for about 40 minutes. \The two critics argued that cap-and-trade, which would set carbon dioxide emission limits and let emitters buy and sell emissions allowances, would drive up the price of energy, hurting families and the U.S. economy. Horner argued further that it wouldn't reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, seen as a chief cause of global warming. He also dismissed the economic potential of wind energy, an area of alternative-energy leadership in Minnesota, prompting loud retorts from the student faction. \Afterward, Alfred Pekarek, an assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at St. Cloud State and global warming skeptic who moderated the event, said he thought the event helped energize people over ""what government is trying to do to us."" \But Jordan Angelle, a junior from Lindstrom, said global warming and cap-and-trade are issues ""not just about money."" \""It's about the environment, too,"" he said. ""We're young. We're the future. We know (energy use) is going to take more money, but we can choose to use less."" \Cap-and-trade was used in the 1990s to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. Emissions were cut in half in 10 years. \Several multistate cap-and-trade initiatives have been established to deal with carbon dioxide in recent years. Gov. Tim Pawlenty authorized Minnesota's participation in a Midwestern regional program. David Sparby, chief executive officer of Northern States Power Co. Minnesota, an Xcel Energy company, said the company would support such a market-based strategy, as opposed to a government mandate, particularly if it were phased in gradually to avoid spikes in energy costs. \Bill McAuliffe - 612-673-7646"
6,"It's encouraging that President Obama has declared his commitment to a ""national conversation"" on climate change just as 2012 is confirmed as the hottest year on record in U.S. history, and among the hottest 10 years in the modern global temperature record.\Solving what England's Stern Commission called ""the greatest market failure of all time"" -- allowing the fossil fuels industry to use the atmosphere as a free sewer for carbon waste that alters the climate -- must inform the energy and tax policy debates of the next three years, with the president committed to resolving it in favor of the health of the planet.\Before that conversation begins, let's review energy issues the last election settled. For although climate change was shamefully not raised by debate moderators, the election became a clear referendum on energy policy -- and green energy won.\In the debates, Mitt Romney made clear his priority was to quickly approve the Keystone XL Pipeline to move dirty Canadian tar sands oil to Gulf ports. Obama was wisely mute. Now it is Obama's time to speak up, cancel the pipeline by presidential order and use his State of the Union address to tell Americans why. This export pipeline will provide few long-term jobs, and may well raise oil prices. Far more important, canceling it would be the beginning of the end of the oil industry's political and economic hegemony.\Subsidies to the oil industry must end. This issue was fully vetted in the campaign, and Obama won, in spite of at least $136 million of direct oil industry attack ads.\Subsidies for noncarbon energy, especially wind, have already been renewed, another victory. Romney lost Iowa, where wind power is well-established, in part by opposing such subsidies, which Obama supported.\Finally, Obama and Romney agreed that the federal government should expand research into next-generation energy, the kind that is already bearing fruit in new storage battery technology soon to be commercialized from MIT laboratories, research partially funded by Obama's Department of Energy. The president has a mandate to increase funding for such research.\The major climate policy not addressed in the campaign was a carbon tax or cap-and-trade regime. Here is where the ""national conversation"" is essential. Obama certainly supported the cap-and-trade bill that died in the Senate early in his first term, and has expressed doubts about the carbon tax. Romney endorsed neither.\Some environmentalists are critical of the president for his apparent passivity on carbon solutions. But gridlock politics requires just this conversation. The costs of carbon taxes or cap-and-trade will be broad, with impacts greater on some sectors than others, and tens of thousands of workers in the coal and oil industries need to prepare for the mostly coal- and oil-free world a stable climate demands. That transition will be wrenching, and the impacts need to be mitigated as much as possible.\In the climate wars, President Obama must be our Roosevelt, rallying the nation and the world to the cause of saving the future. For all of us now know that a rising sea level is no cheap laugh, and that the record heat and drought of the last year is no statistical blip but a crippling trend. Crops withered in the fields; 75 million acres of western forests have died; acidification of the oceans has begun to damage shellfish production. The symptoms of a planet reeling from carbon sickness, a form of cancer, are all around us.\President Obama -- it is time for you to lead this war for all of us. You did not ask for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, one ended, the other ending, nor for the recession, which you defeated. Nor did you ask for the carbon war. But you understand it. History demands that you be not only America's first black president, but America's first green president.\James P. Lenfestey is a former Star Tribune editorial writer.\Credit: JAMES P. LENFESTEY"
7,"AMERICA'S ENERGY FUTURE \We're no Iceland \Andy Barnett's June 16 Counterpoint, ""Bachmann's thinking on cap-and-trade is polluted,"" was built squarely on the abuse of statistics. The key evidence Barnett offered that cap-and-trade effectively promotes the use of renewable energy was a comparison between Iceland, which has cap-and-trade and uses renewables for 73 percent of its energy needs, and the United States, which does not have cap-and-trade and uses renewables for only 7 percent of its energy consumption. \Iceland, and in particular greater Reykjavik, where nearly two-thirds of Icelanders live, has abundant geothermal energy readily available from the continuous volcanic activity there. In fact, 89 percent of Iceland's homes are heated with cheap geothermal energy. The closest analogue in the United States would be Yellowstone National Park, but woe to the poor soul who suggests tapping the geothermal energy in Yellowstone! \Personally, I believe the way forward will involve a combination of fossil fuels, renewable energy, nuclear energy and new technologies. Cap-and-trade is a big-government regulatory nightmare that is disruptive to normal market forces, and in no way will transform the United States into an energy Iceland. \GLEN MENZIES, Minnetonka \. \To drill is to wait \Before people jump on the ""more domestic oil drilling"" bandwagon, they should know it takes a minimum of 10 years for the oil to be found, drilled for and extracted, pipelines to be built to carry it to a refinery, refined and, finally, put into a gas tank. \Meanwhile, the last refinery built in the United States was in the 1970s, and it takes another 10 to 15 years to build one. And, if people think it's going to lower gas prices, they're sorely mistaken. Remember, it's the oil companies that do the work and build the new infrastructure. Just how do you think they're going to cover the costs? \No, the big effort should be in finding alternative forms of energy and developing the vehicles that can run on them, not placating oil-hungry people and the politicians who pander to them. \KEVIN DRISCOLL, ST.

If it could be used 60-some years ago in the blitzkrieg, surely it can be used now. \We have committed billions to biofuels, but we seem to insist on using food (corn) to produce it. Why not use tobacco, simultaneously disposing of a product poisonous to the human body yet yielding vast potential for energy? \If Congress is so determined that the caribou of the frozen north are more important to national survival than human beings, why not at least allow drilling for oil in the offshore areas the experts assert is so potentially abundant?

McCain's lifetime voting record as scored by the League of Conservation Voters is 26 out of 100. In contrast, Barack Obama's lifetime score is 96. \To be fair, Obama has a shorter tenure in the Senate than McCain, but when their records are compared for 2007, when both began their presidential campaigns, Obama's score was 67; McCain's was zero. \KURT RUSTERHOLZ, ST.

8,"""As a governor, Tim Pawlenty pushed through tough laws to reduce greenhouse gases and slow climate change. Then he ran for president.""\That's what a story in the National Journal says about Minnesota's former governor.\Notes the story:\Pawlenty's public squirming over climate change -- an issue on which he was once viewed as an emerging national leader -- highlights the deeply uncomfortable dance that top GOP contenders will have to execute as they seek to reconcile their past records, their current positions, and their party's increasingly rigid dogma.\Supporters of action against climate change have always been a small minority among Republicans. But they weren't always considered heretics. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, was an unabashed believer in the reality of climate change and a coauthor in 2003, with Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, of the first Senate cap-and-trade bill.\And:\No other candidate, however, has made a more jaw-dropping about-face than Pawlenty. Despite his current claims, Pawlenty did far more than flirt with climate change: He made the issue a signature of his administration and of his 2007-08 tenure as head of the National Governors Association. He aggressively led state, regional, and national efforts to promote cap-and-trade legislation and pushed through one of the country's toughest renewable-energy mandates in Minnesota. Along the way, he won other Republicans over to the cause. And he did it in the national spotlight, as his star rose high enough to put him on McCain's short list of possible running mates.\Pawlenty's clean-energy and climate push began in earnest at the end of 2006, after he narrowly won a bruising reelection race against Democrat Mike Hatch.\Although Pawlenty's first term had been defined by fiscal and social conservatism, he campaigned as a moderate, and he wanted to create a more centrist profile in his second term. As a practical matter, he also had to move his ideas through the Democratic-controlled Legislature in St. Paul. A clean-energy push fit the bill perfectly: Minnesota's windswept prairies had the potential to generate vast supplies of low-carbon electricity, along with jobs in manufacturing and installing wind turbines. Plus, the governor had bipartisan support for some form of renewable-energy legislation.\Pawlenty also had a personal motivation. As an evangelical Christian, he had been brought to believe in the urgency of climate change by his pastor, Leith Anderson, who earlier in 2006 had banded with a group of other evangelical leaders to challenge the Bush administration on global warming. In a letter to the president, they argued that there was no longer a legitimate scientific debate on the merits of climate science and that evangelicals had a moral obligation to solve a problem that threatened the world's most vulnerable inhabitants. (Anderson is now president of the National Association of Evangelicals.)\The very long story concludes:\Some GOP strategists say that Pawlenty risks losing more by abandoning causes he appeared to believe in deeply than he would by sticking to his positions and alienating ultra-conservatives.\""He's been involved enough in the issue to truly understand the realities of it,"" said David Jenkins, vice president for government and political affairs for Republicans for Environmental Protection. ""Being that deeply involved, you can't come away without a deep understanding of the science. ... He disowned his accomplishments to pander to one segment of the Republican Party.""\Republican strategist Mike McKenna, who advises GOP leaders on energy policy and strategy, put it more bluntly. ""Guys like Pawlenty now look like what they are -- opportunists without authentic beliefs,"" he wrote in an e-mail to National Journal. ""That is why the issue is so damaging. It is totemic.""\Credit: Joe Kimball"

In Pope Francis' sprawling new encyclical, ""Laudato Si',"" there are many mansions: A meditation on biblical ecology, a discussion of environmental policy, a critique of consumerism, even a reflection on the perils of social media.
\
What everyone wants to know, of course, is whether the pope takes sides in our most polarizing debate. And he clearly does. After this document, there's no doubting where Francis stands in the great argument of our time.
\
But I don't mean the argument between liberalism and conservatism. I mean the argument between dynamists and catastrophists.
\
Dynamists are people who see 21st-century modernity as a basically successful civilization advancing toward a future that's better than the past. They do not deny that problems exist, but they believe we can innovate our way through them while staying on an ever-richer, ever-more-liberated course.
\
Dynamists of the left tend to put their faith in technocratic government; dynamists of the right, in the genius of free markets. But both assume that modernity is a success story whose best days are ahead.
\
Catastrophists, on the other hand, see a global civilization that for all its achievements is becoming more atomized and balkanized, more morally bankrupt, more environmentally despoiled. What's more, they believe that things cannot go on as they are: That the trajectory we're on will end in crisis, disaster, degringolade.
\
Like dynamists, catastrophists can be on the left or right, stressing different agents of our imminent demise. But they're united in believing that current arrangements are foredoomed, and that only a true revolution can save us.
\
This is Pope Francis' position, and the controlling theme of his encyclical. It includes, as many liberals hoped and certain conservatives feared, a call to action against climate change, which will no doubt cause Republicans to squirm during political campaigns to come.
\
But reading ""Laudato Si' "" simply as a case for taking climate change seriously misses the depth of its critique -- which extends to the whole ""technological paradigm"" of our civilization, all the ways (economic and cultural) that we live now.
\
This is a document aligned with the scientific consensus on climate that excoriates the modern scientific mindset as, in effect, a 500-year mistake. It's a document calling for global action, even a ""new world political authority,"" that's drenched in frank contempt for the existing global leadership class. It's a document that urges a rapid move away from fossil fuels while explicitly criticizing the leading avenue for doing so -- a cap-and-trade regime -- as too ""quick and easy,"" too compromised by greed and self-interest, to ""allow for the radical change which present circumstances require.""
\
And while it includes hopeful passages, the encyclical's most pungent lines are apocalyptic: ""Doomsday predictions can no longer be met with irony or disdain. We may well be leaving to coming generations debris, desolation and filth.""
\
This pungency is what really distinguishes ""Laudato Si'"" from prior papal documents.
\
Francis' predecessors attempted versions of his double pitch -- urging Roman Catholics to recognize environmental devastation as a manifestation of the individualism the church has long condemned, while inviting secular readers to consider religious alternatives to our present way of life. But its urgency, sweep, and apocalyptic flavor may make ""Laudato Si'"" more immediately influential, more likely to make both audiences think anew.
\
However, its catastrophism also leaves this pope more open to empirical criticism. For instance, he doesn't grapple sufficiently with evidence that the global poor have become steadily less poor under precisely the world system he decries -- a reality that has complicated implications for environmentalism.
\
Nor are questions related to population growth successfully resolved. If resource constraints are really as severe as the pope implies, and technological solutions as limited in power, it isn't entirely clear how the planet can sustain the steadily growing population the Catholic vision of marriage and fecundity implies. To credibly make the case that a billions-strong human race can keep having large families, you might need a more, well, dynamist view of the human future than this encyclical contains.
\
Finally, it's possible to believe that climate change is happening while doubting that it makes ""the present world system ... certainly unsustainable,"" as the pope suggests. Perhaps we'll face a series of chronic but manageable problems instead; perhaps ""radical change"" can, in fact, be persistently postponed.
\
Indeed, perhaps our immediate future fits neither the dynamist nor the catastrophist framework.
\
We might have entered a kind of stagnationist position, a sustainable decadence, in which the issues Pope Francis identifies percolate without reaching a world-altering boil.
\
In that case, the deep critique our civilization deserves will have to be advanced without the threat of imminent destruction. The arguments in ""Laudato Si'"" will still resonate, but they will have to be structured around a different peril: Not a fear that the particular evils of our age can't last, but the fear that actually, they can.

"
10,"The author Edward Arlington Robinson would like the name Michael Noble. Robinson enjoyed giving his protagonists names that reflected their true character. You can't spend 10 minutes with Michael Noble without recognizing that he is, in fact, a noble man.\For 30 years, Michael Noble has dedicated himself to a vision of an energy-efficient economy. For 16 of those years, he has been the executive director of Fresh Energy and its predecessor organization. When politicians at the state Legislature start spouting off about energy and the environment, they look around to see if Michael Noble is in the hall. If he is present, they resort to the facts. When he is not around, legislators sometimes simply make things up.\Michael Noble, more than even journalists, keeps politicians honest when they start creating facts out of thin air. That's because Noble knows more about energy, global warming, state law and the environment than any of our elected officials.\You don't think politicians just make things up? When the Legislature was considering what amount of sulfates ought to be allowed in wild rice rivers near a proposed mining site, Rep. Tom Rukavina stood up and said the limit should be 250 milligrams per liter. The current standard is 10 milligrams. Rukavina wants the mine built, so he just made up a number. He said that's the allowable measure of sulfates in the human body, so why wouldn't it be good for wild rice? No science. Just politics. The body looked around for signs of Michael Noble, and decided it might be best to wait for some actual research before acting on Rukavina's suggestion.\Noble tried his hardest last Thursday, but the state Senate voted 42-18 to lift state restrictions on coal plants. The law has been in place since 2007. Out of 201 legislators, 184 voted for the coal restrictions. Times have changed. The Legislature has changed. And, now it appears, Minnesota's national leadership on energy and the environment is changing. One of those who voted to lift the restrictions was Sen. Julie Rosen, Republican from Fairmont. But Sen. Rosen voted for the restrictions four years ago. Things change.\Noble is noble. ""Julie Rosen is a very fine senator,"" he told me. ""I admire her and how she is managing a good committee. She continues to voice support for renewable energy and energy efficiency legislation.""\Yet Rosen voted to lift restrictions that require any new coal plant to reduce emissions elsewhere in the utility's system. Noble told me: ""She is fond of saying that man can't live by renewables alone.""\Pawlenty's leadership\The laws, passed by a super-majority in 2007, came about as a result of then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty's leadership on global warming, energy and the environment. That leadership is something of an embarrassment for him now. One poll showed his impressive energy credentials turn out to be his biggest negative among Tea Party regulars. He has a defense. Pawlenty actually started backsliding a long time before this presidential campaign.\Pawlenty put together a group called the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group (MCCAG). There were 56 members and Noble remembers, ""the largest fraction of the group was from business and industry, and the smallest fraction came from the environmental side.""\It was the task of the MCCAG to come up with recommendations to implement the 2007 Next Generation Energy Act. Among other things, like restricting new coal plants without emissions reductions, it required an overall reduction in greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050. It was a tall order, but the MCCAG went to work and reported out 46 recommendations to help the state reach its goals. Once the recommendations were in Gov. Pawlenty's hands, he sat on them. He could have given them to the Legislature to debate, but he didn't. After all of the work of the MCCAG, Pawlenty did nothing. Actually, he did do two things. He reversed himself on the coal restrictions, and called for a lifting of the moratorium on new nuclear plants.\Noble thinks Pawlenty was scared off the coal restrictions by the governor of North Dakota. You see, this whole coal restriction controversy has little to do with the future of Minnesota coal plants. The argument is really over whether Great River Energy can import coal-fired electricity from the new Spiritwood plant in North Dakota. North Dakota threatened to sue Minnesota. It was going to claim the Minnesota restrictions violated our neighbor's rights and was a hidden carbon tax on North Dakotans. If that sounds like a weak argument to you, you are not alone. One senior legislator thought it was a bluff play. But Pawlenty folded his hand.\I asked Noble why everyone was so united back in 2007 and so divided today. He said: ""In 2007, the industry was sure there was going to be a carbon cap-and-trade bill at the federal level."" That didn't happen, and now a slow dismantling has begun. ""The upshot of the Legislature's attempt to lift the restrictions sends the wrong signal to investors in clean-tech global capital, which is, by the way, the fastest-growing segment of the nation's investment economy. We are giving the signal that Minnesota, once a leader, is backing away from a clean energy economy.""\Xcel as rock star\Another part of Minnesota's energy picture has to do with efficiencies. It is axiomatic that conserving energy is like finding energy, without building a new plant. Noble has high praise for Xcel. ""It is the rock star,"" he said. ""It is trying to get everyone to conserve energy. If people conserve energy, Xcel doesn't have to go out and borrow money to build an expensive new electricity plant.""\He has less praise for small co-op utility operations. ""They don't produce the electricity, they buy it, and turn around and sell it. They don't want to conserve. The more electricity they sell, the more money they make."" And, Noble adds, they don't have to worry about paying for a new plant. ""We know energy savings is the easiest and cheapest way to meet our energy needs, by far.""\The 2007 law was wisely written. It has an anti-backsliding provision, but the backsliders are in ascendance. The dismantlers are concerned that Minnesota will be unable to meet industrial demands, won't be able to attract business and build jobs. Noble says that's hogwash. ""The renewable energy standard creates a $10 billion new electricity investment at or below market rates.""\At the Legislature, one hears the refrain that renewables cause electricity rates to skyrocket. ""That's not true,"" says Noble. ""Xcel shows no upward effect on rates as it adds renewables.""\Noble adds: ""You always know how much renewables will cost. You have no idea what the upward price pressure will be of coal, whether through regulation or the cost of the product."" No new coal, without emission offsets, is the law of the land, unless Gov. Mark Dayton signs the repeal. Noble says, ""It's going to be a brawl.""\Few people, and certainly not Michael Noble, question Sen. Julie Rosen's ethics. When it comes to Minnesota's advanced energy policy, Noble remembers Rosen saying that Minnesota can on longer be out there by itself, an island.\It takes pure courage to lead, to walk the point of a platoon. It is the definition of feeling alone. And, as it concerns her view that man can't live by renewables alone, I'm reminded that before the Wright brothers lifted off from Kitty Hawk, clergymen of every stripe preached from their pulpits that God never intended man to fly.\Credit: Don Shelby"
11,"Congresswoman Michele Bachmann emerged from her blackout on public appearances Friday with more warnings on the problems of Obamacare and an acknowledgement that the unrelenting pressure of congressional campaigning was part of her decision to not seek another term.\At a speech and question-and-answer session at the I-94 West Chamber of Commerce meeting in Elk River, Bachmann showed no signs of stress over the legal problems of her failed presidential campaign and appeared to want to put controversy behind her.\She spoke of working in bipartisan fashion on the group's goal to expand I-94 west of Highway 101.\""I had a wonderful working relationship with our governor, Mark Dayton, to get the bridge built in Stillwater. I think we can work with Governor Dayton. I encourage all of you to work with him, work with our senators,"" she told the group of 50. ""This is not a partisan issue in any way. This is as bipartisan as you can get.""\She also sympathized with another Chamber complaint, the Affordable Care Act.\""The No. 1 reason we are failing to see more jobs being created is because of the president's health care plan,"" she said.\She attacked Obama's decision this week to modify some requirements as ""the arbitrary nature of what the federal government is doing in decision-making.""\Bachmann said later in a brief interview that one of the highlights of her term of service is alerting the nation to the potential problems of the president's health care plan.\""I made Obamacare an issue [in her presidential campaign],"" she said. ""That's why even the president is admitting it's not working and the chief author is calling it a train wreck.""\Minnesota should be the model for substitute legislation, she said. ""Minnesota has been a leader in innovation -- the Minute Clinics -- very effective. We want to be nimble, innovative and always cost-effective.""\Bachmann was not without the sweeping generalizations that have caused her problems in the past.\""We have a problem right now with granting amnesty to illegal aliens,"" she said on one hot-button issue. She cited studies that showed that jobs are lost and wages depressed because of the president's policy of ""ongoing rolling amnesty with no possibility of deportation.""\On the environment, she accused Obama of a ""magic wand trick"" for enforcing his policy on cap-and-trade emissions. ""The cap-and-trade agenda just this last week shut down a coal-fired plant in Ohio,"" she said. ""You're going to see that repeated over and over and over again.""\But after concluding her speech and posing for pictures, Bachmann offered a more pensive tone. The pace of a member of Congress had taken a toll, she said.\""We'll have a break in August, and I'm hoping I will have some time to think about it a little more, about what my next move is going to be,"" she said. ""I just want to have a space of time so I can think. That's one of the problems and hazards with Congress -- that you go at such a fast pace, it's tough to even think sometimes. That's not good.\""Not being in Congress or running for Congress, that frees me from doing parades, from doing fundraising. I was very involved in both of those activities. I'm relieved of the necessity of doing those, so I'll have that time.""\And she insisted that her family has been the source of her strength. ""My husband has had some health challenges, so I've tried to be very careful with him,"" she said. ""What's worked well for us is that we're tag-teamers. We've really swapped roles throughout our marriage. That's worked really well.""\Her voice, she promised at the start of her speech, will continue to be heard.\And she will make good on that promise as soon as Sunday, when Bachmann is scheduled to re-join the morning talk shows with a 9 a.m. appearance on ABC News' ""This Week.""\Credit: Cyndy Brucato"

How big is the much-talked-about green economy in Minnesota? And what are the jobs like?
\
With a $1.6 million grant, state labor officials have been working for the past two years to find emerging green job titles and measure the size of the green economy in Minnesota.
\
Though a final report is due in the fall, the preliminary data indicate that the sector accounts for a small number of jobs - between 50,000 and 60,000 ""green"" jobs in the state's economy of 2.6 million jobs.
\
Labor market officials are evaluating the number of new ""green"" job titles in the surveys of job openings it conducts twice a year. These are fast-growing occupations, many of which didn't exist a decade ago.
\
Green jobs are a small piece of the state's job postings, accounting for just 2.5 percent of the 33,800 job openings in the second quarter.
\
""Green jobs have been touted as one of the areas that's going to be a good job creator,"" said Oriane Casale, assistant director of the state's labor market information office. ""Whether or not that's the case, what we wanted to do really was look at whether the skills and knowledge requirements for these jobs were new and whether there were gaps - whether employers were able to find people to hire for these jobs.
\
""What we are finding is they do require new skills and knowledge but in this economy with so many people unemployed and looking for work, or looking for better jobs, there doesn't appear to be any gap in terms of being able to fill these jobs with qualified people. They tend to be jobs with high-skill, high-education requirements, that translate into fairly high wages.""
\
Here's a sampling of three new and emerging green jobs:
\
ENERGY ENGINEER
\
Honeywell's ""energy engineers"" are wrapping up an upgrade to hundreds of Minneapolis public housing single-family homes and apartment buildings to make sure they are as energy efficient as can be.
\
They've been through more than 700 homes and apartment buildings in an effort to reduce utility costs and their impact on the environment by replacing outdated boilers, installing energy-efficient windows and appliances and upgrading thermostats.
\
The project is expected to reduce the city's costs by more than $1.5 million a year.
\
Completing the energy audits and overseeing the system upgrades are engineers like Hazen, 48, of White Bear Lake. Many of the engineers in the energy services group at Honeywell Building Solutions in Golden Valley have a mechanical, civil or electrical engineering background and are trained on the job in energy - or how to use less of it.
\
While Honeywell, with $33.4 billion in worldwide sales, has employed energy engineers for decades, it's a growing occupation as public officials with cash-strapped budgets, escalating energy costs and aging buildings seek ways to save money.
\
After obtaining a degree in mechanical engineering in the 1980s, Hazen landed a job at a power company in Florida, where he helped big industrial clients reduce their energy use. ""Even back then, people were seeing that we needed to reduce energy and our dependence on oil,"" he said.
\
In his role at Honeywell, Hazen is doing much of the same, mainly for public entities such as K-12 schools, universities and local governments.
\
Through energy performance contracting, public entities get a bank loan or issue bonds for energy upgrades. Honeywell basically guarantees the savings - essentially the loan payments - in terms of reduced energy use. In other words, the savings finance the cost of the project.
\
Demand for the services is growing. Honeywell's energy services business as a whole tripled in revenue over the past five years. ""Even in a down economy we have grown, because in a down economy a lot of clients are strapped for capital,"" said Hazen, whose clients span a five-state area of the Midwest.
\
One particularly good client has been Anoka County. Since Honeywell's first project with the county in 2000, the company has completed $12.5 million worth of work on many of the county's aging buildings, including libraries, the government center, park and recreation and highway and transportation buildings. The upgrades have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 3,200 tons annually, equal to taking 600 passenger cars a year off the road, said Andrew Dykstra, director of facilities for Anoka County. ""We're seeing about $1.3 million in energy and operational savings per year.""
\
Hazen and his team of engineers and technical analysts roam buildings dissecting heating and cooling systems, boilers, thermostats, lighting, insulation, weather stripping around doors and the caulking around windows - every detail of daily operations. They monitor energy outflows and test lighting illumination and boiler systems seeking energy-sucking culprits. Then they devise a plan for energy reduction. ""We'll spend a month or two going through the building,"" Hazen said. ""It's not a one-day process.""
\
Today, Hazen mentors new engineers and guides their work. He teaches them how to conduct energy audits, reviews other engineers' calculations and analyses and coordinates workloads.
\
With demand growing, Honeywell couldn't find the pool of experienced energy engineers it needed, so last fall, the company began its own two-year training program for new engineers. Whether their degrees are in civil, mechanical or electrical engineering, the new engineers are in for two years of intense mentoring and classroom work on their way to an energy specialty.
\
""You'll probably see more curriculum being developed for energy engineers as this discipline grows.""
\
It's a new job, so a salary range is difficult to nail down. The state reports that engineering managers make a median income of $116,000 a year.
\
ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY COORDINATOR
\
In her dream ""green job,"" Pinc's mission is to find waste at the St. Paul Public Schools and creative ways to get rid of it - whether that's in a school's trash bill, its lighting or water use.
\
Pinc is the district's energy and sustainability coordinator, responsible for spotting waste in the school system's operations at its 75 buildings sprawling 7.3 million square feet. She's charged with finding more ways to recycle or repurpose anything the district uses and figuring out how to reduce energy use overall.
\
That includes combing utility bills in search of abnormal costs for an individual building, changing lighting to improve efficiency, analyzing the weight of each trash bin emptied by trash haulers and comparing those to fees charged. No rock is left unturned in search of energy savings.
\
She's an investigator, an analyst and a problem-solver. She'll spot water use at one school building that seems particularly high and get on the phone with the custodian or make a visit. Could there be a water leak?
\
Though Pinc, 40, of Coon Rapids, has a resume heavy in science and in environmental management, when she was laid off from a manufacturing company in late 2008, her trouble landing another job right away prompted her to take a step back.
\
In two previous jobs, she helped manufacturing companies comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
\
It was time for a course change. ""It was an opportunity to refine where I was going,"" she said. Instead of working on the regulatory side, she wanted to be more proactive in environmentalism.
\
Already armed with a bachelor's degree in biology and jobs as a college biology instructor, she enrolled in a master's degree program in environmental management and corporate sustainability at the University of Minnesota. She also completed training and received certification through a federal grant that trains the state's laid-off manufacturing employees in ""green skills.""
\
St. Paul Schools offered her a job - which she started in January - after she responded to an online job posting.
\
Data crunching is a job requirement. ""I pay for myself essentially, by now,"" she said. ""We're putting money back into the kitty.""
\
The district is well on its way with recycling programs. In 2010, it recycled 80 tons of electronic waste equal to taking 158 cars off the road for a year, she said. Through a recycling program with a hog farm, 1,463 tons of cafeteria food waste was recycled (fed to pigs), in the past school year, removing it from the trash cycle and saving the district $64,000 a year and trips to the landfill.
\
Printers, copiers, computers, furniture, books, metal, plastic film, paper and cardboard: all recycled. But there's more to do.
\
In the end, Pinc's job is about getting more out of the available resources - or, in her words, running the district more like an efficient business. ""To me, it's not just about being green,"" she said. ""It's about doing the most we can with the least amount of money.""
\
Pinc said her salary is about $58,000 a year.
\
CARBON TRADER
\
Arjun Patney works on a trading floor in Hopkins but he's laser-focused on California and its looming cap-and-trade program for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
As a carbon-market strategist, Patney, a civil engineer, was hired by the agricultural giant Cargill a few years ago to set up its U.S. carbon trading business at a time when Congress was contemplating a national cap-and-trade program, as Europe has, to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. ""Part of the interview process was to sketch out a plan of how I would develop a sustainable carbon business for the U.S. market,"" he said.
\
While ""prospects faded"" for a national plan, Patney now is setting his sights on California, a state that is putting in place its own cap-and-trade program, a strategy to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.
\
A cap-and-trade system places a cap on carbon emissions for certain groups of regulated businesses. A price is then put on credits for reducing emissions. Companies that produce more emissions can buy credits from companies producing less. In that way, the right to emit the gas is essentially bought and sold. Over time, the cap is reduced, with the goal of affecting overall emissions.
\
""There is already trading going on of credits expected in the California market,"" said Patney, 40, of St. Louis Park. ""Much of what I am doing is positioning ourselves for that market. We are trading carbon credits already.""
\
California passed cap-and-trade legislation in 2006. The state is now developing regulations. For a range of industries from oil refineries to power companies to some manufacturers, the regulations begin in 2013.
\
Mostly now, the traders are banks or companies such as Cargill with trading operations. It's a nascent market. ""Right now the voluntary market plays a role,"" he said. ""But the prospective California market is the real driver of the market.""
\
Point Carbon, a Thomson Reuters information source on the carbon market, expects the California market to be worth close to $10 billion by 2016.
\
Cargill, with $120 billion in revenue, has developed sites in Idaho that take the methane from cow manure generated on three dairy farms and turn it into enough electricity for more than 3,000 homes. The reduction in methane, a potent greenhouse gas, can be packaged and traded on an active carbon trading market. If a company in California, for example, needs to emit more carbon dioxide, it could buy the offsets, or credits. The offsets are the items currently being traded.
\
Part of Patney's job is to stay on top of who the players are and to get Cargill access to an offset pipeline that will create robust trading opportunities. He's also learning about the carbon offset buyers and the bids and offers, or the prices for the offsets.
\
The final users of the credits - power companies and refineries that will be regulated - are becoming more engaged, but it's still not a robust trading market. ""A lot of the liquidity right now is still coming from the trading desks.""
\
For Patney, working in this new market brings together his two interests: the environment and finance.
\
After receiving his civil engineering degree, Patney worked internationally and in the U.S. with companies on how to better manage their environmental practices.
\
When he came back to the U.S. after five years in Singapore, it was 1999 and the midst of the dot-com boom. He went to New York to get his master's degree in environmental management and policy. When he finished, the dot-com bust had arrived. Jobs in environmental management were shrinking fast. Even so, he landed an environmental consulting job in Omaha, where he worked on oil spill control plans for utilities, waste management plans and air pollution permitting for manufacturing companies.
\
In 2004, he joined his fiance in New York and worked for an engineering firm managing the cleanup of contaminated sites. While there, he earned his MBA.
\
""I enjoy working at the intersection of business and the environment. I get to work on something entrepreneurial, in a developing market, and which also benefits the environment.""
\
The income of a commodities trader in Minnesota can range to more than $166,000.

13,"By 2025, if all goes as planned by automakers and the federal government, the average American car will get 54.5 miles per gallon of gasoline, matching the efficiency of today's top hybrids.\Yes, the technology to achieve this will cost consumers more at the dealer's showroom, as conservatives were quick to point out after the regulations were finalized last month. What they didn't mention is the projected $8,000 in fuel savings over the life of a car meeting the new standards.\""These fuel savings represent the single most important step we've ever taken to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,"" President Obama said. ""This historic agreement builds on the progress we've already make to save families money at the pump and cut our oil consumption. ... It'll strengthen our nation's energy security, it's good for middle class families, and it will help create an economy built to last.""\I sure hope so. But it's very hard to predict the price of oil a dozen years down the road. If it skyrockets, the value of every bit of fuel economy wrought by the standards will rise in tandem. On the other hand, if oil prices tank with vast new supplies or cratered demand -- remember the sub-$2 gas in the depth of the Bush recession? -- investments in efficiency may prove less worthwhile.\Behavioral effects?\Another question mark is the effect of super-high-mileage vehicles on our driving behavior. Will 54.5-mpg cars spawn another rush to the exurbs? Will we all drive more than before, negating the environmental benefits of fuel efficiency?\Plus, as I noted three years ago, Macalester College professor Sarah West and other economists have persuasively demonstrated that it's the miles, not the gallons, that ring up the most economic and environmental externalities of driving -- costs imposed on society by drivers but not borne by them. She has estimated this freeloading as equivalent to at least $1 a gallon of gasoline. Skipping out on the bill fosters costly economic distortions that range from gridlocked highways, collision mayhem and falling bridges to pollution-borne disease and global climate change.\Lisa Jackson, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator, hailed the standards as ""another example of how we protect the environment and strengthen the economy at the same time."" And U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood noted that ""today automakers are seeing their more fuel-efficient vehicles climb in sales,"" a market signal that's in harmony with the new rules.\Standards opposed by Romney\Leading conservatives, including presidential contender Mitt Romney, oppose the standards, although as governor of Massachusetts he said the answer to high gas prices was increased fuel efficiency. He added then: ""I don't think that now is the time, and I'm not sure there will be a right time, for us to encourage the use of more gasoline.""\Incentives for early introduction of advanced technology and flexibility to average fuel economy and emissions over the entire industry (using cap-and-trade-style credits) are included in the new standards, to which most domestic and foreign automakers and the United Auto Workers agreed. And it won't be just engine and alternative fuel technology that gets us to 54.5. More efficient auto accessories and air conditioning, lighter vehicles, lower tire rolling resistance and better aerodynamics will be part of the solution, as well.\But discouraging the use of gasoline, as Romney might once have said, will require more than tinkering with private motor vehicles. Alternatives to driving such as transit, bicycling, walking and telecommuting already are on the rise. Government should do its part, too, to meet the growing demand for transportation modes that burn no gasoline at all.\Conrad deFiebre is a Transportation Fellow at Minnesota 2020, a nonpartisan, progressive think tank based in St. Paul.

14,"A long-simmering dispute between North Dakota and Minnesota appears to be coming to a head. North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem is saying he very likely will sue Minnesota over its so-called ""carbon tax"" on emissions, calling it an illegal attempt to regulate another state's industry.\""We simply feel that we've been forced into this posture,"" Stenehjem said in an interview this week. ""We have attempted everything we can think of to work with officials in Minnesota.""\Stenehjem declined to put a timeframe on the lawsuit or say in which court it was likely to be filed, but he said his group is calculating the economic damage to North Dakota.\The interstate showdown comes as Congress works on national legislation to curb emissions of carbon dioxide -- a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming -- via various schemes, including a cap-and-trade system that sets a limit on emissions and creates a market for ""permits to pollute.""\But with health care dominating the agenda, it's not clear when carbon legislation will get passed. International climate talks in Copenhagen before Christmas resulted in a nonbinding agreement for countries to cut emissions, but it didn't get specific.\Minnesota gets much of its electricity from North Dakota. North Dakota generates most of it by burning coal, which spews carbon dioxide. Coal is a $2.8 billion industry in North Dakota and lawmakers approved a litigation war chest of $500,000 for the dispute with Minnesota. There's $400,000 left, Stenehjem said.\The Bismarck Tribune on Dec. 29 reported Stenehjem's intentions to sue. That was about 10 days after the Industrial Commission of North Dakota held a closed-door meeting to discuss potential litigation. The commission consists of North Dakota's governor, agriculture commissioner and attorney general.\The outcome of such a lawsuit could potentially affect the ability of states to implement environmental regulation of one of the most important greenhouse gases, said Frederick Weston, a former utilities regulator at the Vermont-based Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit working on environmental issues.\""I would imagine federal and state policymakers will follow this case with interest,"" Weston said.\The carbon fracas goes back to the Next Generation Energy Act that Minnesota passed in 2007. The law instructed Minnesota's utility regulators to include the cost of the carbon dioxide emissions into the cost of electricity from coal-fired power plants to price the power more accurately. Minnesota is one of a number of states that use some method to account for the cost of carbon emissions from the power sector in their planning.\The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) now estimates that carbon emissions cost $9 to $34 per ton. That's not a tax or surcharge but is an analytical tool for evaluating purchases of electricity or the construction of new power plants. It goes into effect in 2012.\North Dakota argues the adjustment amounts to a tax on its power. The new planning mechanism will make North Dakota's coal-fired electricity prohibitively expensive, Stenehjem argues, and have a chilling effect on its industry.\Stenehjem said Minnesota exempted at least one Minnesota facility from the carbon policy.\Stenehjem said North Dakota has ""done more than any other state in carbon capture and regulation"" and invested millions of dollars in research addressing carbon. He said he invited Minnesota lawmakers last May to tour carbon-capture projects in North Dakota and got no response.\""We haven't even had a courtesy of a response to our letter,"" he said. ""Minnesota is doing nothing except passing these laws,"" Stenehjem said. ""We're actually doing something."" Stenehjem said Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Glenn Wilson called him after Christmas about the potential litigation. The Commerce Department declined to comment.\State Sen. Ellen Anderson, DFL-St. Paul, said North Dakota doesn't have a legal argument. Minnesota's new carbon policy applies to Minnesota, too, she said, so it isn't penalizing any state.\""It's not about North Dakota. It's about coal,"" said Anderson, who chairs the Environment, Energy and Natural Resources Budget Division. Anderson said she didn't recall getting an invitation from North Dakota.\Anderson said she anticipates a federal cap on carbon in 2010 and feels it's ""ridiculous"" for neighboring states to be discussing suing each other over the issue. They should sit down and talk, she said.\Jennifer Bjorhus - 612-673-4683\Credit: JENNIFER BJORHUS; STAFF WRITER"
15,"There is growing concern once again at the Capitol about the depth of Gov. Tim Pawlenty's commitment to his climate-change pronouncements through much of last year as chair of the National Governors Association and as co-chair of the Sen. John McCain's presidential quest.\The uncertainty over Pawlenty's intentions -- mostly as a result of his administration's indifference and sometimes opposition to energy bills being considered earlier this year -- comes at a time when legislative leaders are gearing up with initiatives to accomplish strict carbon-reduction mandates put in place a year ago.\During the 2008 legislative session, the normally mild-mannered Sen. Yvonne Prettner Solon, DFL-Duluth, said that Pawlenty's point person on energy, former Deputy Commerce Commissioner Edward Garvey, was ""obstructionist"" in dealing with her and her Energy and Utilities Committee.\""The governor has done this dance before, where he's put a toe out but his follow-through wasn't there,"" said Sen. Ellen Anderson, DFL-St. Paul, chair of the Senate Energy and Environment Finance Committee. ""Basically, there's been no leadership from the governor on the energy issues for a long time.""\""We need the governor to help move the energy agenda,"" said Rep. Bill Hilty, DFL-Finlayson, who chairs the powerful House Energy Finance Division.\Next Gen statement in '07\When Pawlenty eagerly signed the Next Generation Energy Act in May last year, he said: ""...We are kick-starting the future by increasing our nation-leading per capita renewable fuel use, boosting cost-saving measures and tackling greenhouse gas emissions.""\As chair of the National Governors Association, Pawlenty called for ""bold initiatives"" by states to address climate change.\But in February, when a governor's report was due on how the state would move ahead to meet carbon-reduction mandates of the Next Gen Act, Garvey sent up a ""preliminary"" report that largely ignored draft recommendations of the governor's own Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Committee (MCCAG).\Under fire for the report's weakness, Garvey personally promised Prettner Solon that he would submit a revised report within a few days when he was to testify before her committee.\He didn't and, according to the senator, in deliberations on energy bills after that Garvey was generally unhelpful and ""obstructionist.""\Others had similar reactions to Garvey\Other legislative leaders who worked with Garvey in 2008 sounded similar concerns:\Hilty characterized Garvey's testimony before his committee as largely exercises in ""obfuscation.""\Anderson said that Garvey ""is an expert at saying nothing, which is what I think the governor wants.""\When Pawlenty formed the Office of Energy Security (OES) by executive order in January, he named Garvey its director and effectively made him the administration's point person on energy.\Garvey had said that the governor's carbon-reduction report would be revised when the MCCAG report was made final, which was in April.\But Garvey never sent up a revised report, which is legally required to outline how the state will meet the mandate for a 15 percent reduction of carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2015, 30 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. Neither Garvey nor the governor's office would say when the report, now months overdue, would be submitted.\Two top positions will be open\Then on July 15, Garvey abruptly announced he was leaving state government ""for other opportunities."" Earlier, the OES' No. 2 person, state government veteran Michael Bull, resigned to take a position with a wind-energy group. Bull has not been replaced, and so on Aug. 8 both top positions in the OES will be vacant.\The governor's office also declined comment on reports that another Pawlenty energy initiative is likely to miss a November deadline. Last November, amid high-visibility fanfare, Pawlenty and Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, worked through the Midwest Governors Association to set up an ambitious energy initiative.\Among other things, it would establish a cap on total carbon emissions and a free-market auction mechanism (trade) that would establish monetary carbon value, which would push up the cost of emitting carbon and effectively create incentives to reduce the pollutant.\""It appears to me that the regional governor's report on cap and trade will not be completed on time without the governor's personal involvement,"" said Rep. Kate Knuth, DFL-New Brighton. She is one of several legislators who are tracking progress of the regional cap-and-trade effort so that it may be legislatively ratified in Minnesota as early as next year.\Lawmakers only funded a study\Knuth and Anderson failed to win support for a cap-and-trade bill in the 2008 Legislature, mainly because lawmakers wanted to first see what comes of the Pawlenty-Doyle regional effort. In the form that passed, the Legislature ordered a $500,000 study of the economic effects of a cap-and-trade system; the report is due in January.\For its part, the governor's office says nothing's changed in energy policy and that Pawlenty continues to push the several carbon-reduction initiatives he announced in January.\But while Pawlenty continues to tout what he claims was his initiative for the Next Generation Act and its aggressive carbon-reduction mandates, Anderson doesn't remember it that way.\""Through deliberations in 2007 and before that, the governor's office worked with opposition legislators on killer amendments and generally tried to derail the bill,"" Anderson said. She added that in an earlier session, when critical votes were needed, the governor's office sat by as utility lobbyists worked with then House Speaker Steve Sviggim to keep the bill from a House vote.\According to Anderson, the governor's office and utility lobbyists finally gave way last year when the new DFL majority pushed the bill to a vote and prevailed.\""The Pawlenty administration was not helpful in passing that bill,"" Anderson said.\Legislature organizing for energy push\Given the difficulty that legislative leaders say they had with the governor's office in the 2008 session, plans are being laid to strengthen the Legislature's hand on energy policy.\Last month, the Electric Energy Task Force (which in January becomes the Legislative Energy Commission) voted to hire its own staff to organize a push at the Capitol for a series of bills to fulfill the Next Gen carbon-reduction mandates and other energy policies.\Hilty said the staff likely would consist of a director to develop an energy policy-agenda and track progress, and experts who can help research energy policy and organize legislative hearings.\The commission will also track progress on the regional cap-and-trade effort and on the economic-effects study by the Commerce Department.\""The next session will be critical to the long-term success of our carbon-reduction efforts and in developing sound energy policy,"" Hilty said.\One observer who is deeply involved in energy politics, Bill Grant of the Midwest Office of the Izaak Walton League, said the problem goes beyond Pawlenty.\Grant said the Legislature lost a year in 2008 when it failed to move key energy bills -- like the cap-and-trade legislation and one that would significantly reduce automotive emissions, as is being done in California and several other states.\""It takes more than a push from the exec branch,"" Grant said. ""The Legislature needs to move ahead as well, and in the last session there wasn't a big appetite to move ahead.""\Indeed, when a critical vote was taken in the Senate Business and Jobs Committee on marquee energy legislation, the so-called California Clean Cars bill, three DFLers joined Republicans in a move that effectively killed the bill. They are Committee Chair James Metzen of St. Paul, Tom Bakk of Cook (who chairs the Senate Tax Committee), and Rod Skoe of Clearbrook (who chairs the Property Tax Division of the Finance Committee).\Ron Way, a former reporter for several Midwest newspapers, covers the environment and energy issues.

16,"The politically charged task of reducing carbon emissions linked to climate change will have a spotlight in center ring at the Capitol when the 2009 Legislature convenes, but it remains unclear whether or where Gov. Tim Pawlenty's administration will be in the tent. As well, the current economic downturn may dampen political interest in pushing ahead with legislation that could add to short-term business and consumer costs.\Even before lawmakers convene in St. Paul in January, two major events are certain to shape the energy agenda: one is a decision by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) on whether to approve power lines to enable construction of the Big Stone II coal-burning -- and carbon spewing -- power plant, and the other is that work on the much-anticipated Midwest regional ""cap and trade"" carbon-reduction program may not be finished before the Legislature adjourns next spring.\To add emotional spice to the energy mix, it's expected that hearings will be held on whether to lift Minnesota's 16-year ban (PDF) on new nuclear power plants. As well, Xcel Energy will seek legislative approval on a related hot-button issue: expansion of output at its three nuclear reactors at Monticello and at Prairie Island near Red Wing, something that would increase the on-site radioactive waste storage.\""I expect we'll be busy,"" said Rep. Bill Hilty, DFL-Finlayson, chair of the House Energy Committee.\Added gusts to the usual political headwinds\But it's also expected that there will be added gusts to the usual political headwinds on energy matters as consumers face economic uncertainty with each day's news and are anxious about anything that increases energy costs, as would be one result of some aspects of carbon-reduction measures like carbon taxes and ""cap and trade.""\The concern over rising costs seems to be at the root of the governor's sliding interest in climate change; last year it was a Pawlenty priority as he headed up the National Governor's Association and skipped across the country calling on states to undertake ""bold initiatives"" to reduce carbon emissions. As part of that effort, Pawlenty joined Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, to form the Midwest Energy Initiative to craft what was billed as an aggressive market-driven ""cap and trade"" plan to create incentives for utilities and other industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\After years of sometimes-intense debate, in 2007 a bipartisan legislative majority passed the Next Generation Energy Act that included an aggressive mandate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent (below 2005 levels) by 2050, with interim reductions of 15 percent by 2015 and 30 percent by 2025.\Pawlenty appointed a 55-member Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group (MCCAG) to work with a consulting group he hired to develop specific ways to meet the mandated carbon goals with the objective of completing an ""action plan"" that was to be sent up to the Legislature last February.\Cautions about the costs\But also last winter, Pawlenty's talk of ""bold"" steps gave way to cautions about economic costs of dealing with climate change. It happened at about the time he was pilloried by columnist Robert Novak and local radio talk show host Jason Lewis for challenging prevailing Republican orthodoxy over the human influences on climate change and the need for government to actively undertake corrective actions.\After the dust-up with the conservative commentators, the governor not only tempered his ""bold"" talk but his minions at the Capitol steered clear of debates on the issue and in one prominent case stonewalled on providing legislators with an ""action plan"" on ways to meet mandates of landmark energy bill that the governor eagerly signed last year.\That means that the Legislature will focus on the MCCAG report that was completed last April. It calls for sweeping actions in transportation, agriculture and industry to reduce carbon emissions on a scale that will be felt throughout the economy, and there is spirited debate on the full costs of the recommended actions.\To Sen. Ellen Anderson, DFL-St. Paul, and Rep. Jean Wagenius, DFL-Minneapolis, who chair Senate and House environmental finance committees, the carbon-reducing changes will promote a ""green economy"" with thousands of jobs created as commercial sectors undertake to retool buildings to operate more efficiently and use less energy, to redesign systems -- including home appliances -- that consume less, to build solar systems and wind turbines and geothermal systems to produce carbonless energy.\The costs of doing nothing\They also argue that doing nothing has its own costs, a view underscored last month week when the National Conference of State Legislatures issued a report (PDF) warning of significant added future costs by delaying climate-change solutions.\The chair of the Senate Energy Committee, Sen. Yvonne Prettner Solon, DFL-Duluth, said the Legislature must act on the Next Gen mandates in the next session to give affected industries some direction in actions they must take to comply with the new state law.\To help drive the process, the new Legislative Energy Commission becomes operational in January. Its full-time staff will coordinate energy legislation and provided added research staff for Hilty, Prettner Solon and others making up an expanding core of legislators with an interest in energy affairs.\But it's more than that.\In important part, say Capitol insiders, the commission represents a lack of confidence in the Pawlenty administration on energy affairs.\They point to the carbon-reduction ""action plan"" that was to be sent up last February by the Commerce Department's Office of Energy Security (OES) and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA).\Preliminary letter sent instead\OES Director Edward Garvey and MPCA Assistant Commissioner David Thornton instead sent up a letter they said was ""preliminary."" It listed some issues sent up by MCCAG and some -- like lifting the ban on nuclear power plants -- that were different from what the group recommended.\Legislators and energy advocates said at the time that the letter was unacceptable, and Garvey and Thornton promised a completed plan when the MCCAG formally completed its work in April. Garvey left state government in August, and his replacement at OES, Bill Glahn, has avoided discussions about the plan, which legislators see as crucial to building political support for the mandated carbon-reduction goals.\Glahn recently met with Senate staffers and promised that he'd begin work on the plan and other legislative energy reports for delivery by January 15, nearly a year past the due date for the Next Gen report.\The delay ""shows that the Pawlenty administration either lost interest in the process and simply walked away, or never intended to fulfill its obligation,"" said Jim Erkel, a transportation advocate with the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy and member of MCCAG.\It's not only the governor who shows reticence in pushing ahead with the kind of carbon-reduction plans called for in the Next Gen law and the MCCAG report.\DFLers helped scuttle fuel-efficiency bill\Earlier this year, as lawmakers were considering legislation to advance fuel efficiency in passenger cars, several powerful DFL senators were among those who helped scuttle the bill, which appeared to enjoy majority support in the House and full Senate.\Late in the 2008 session, the ""clean cars"" bill, by Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, was killed in the Senate Business and Jobs Committee, chaired by James Metzen, South St. Paul.\Metzen opposed the bill because, he said, he had many auto dealerships in his district that didn't want it. Metzen was joined by two other DFLers who also said they responded to local economic concerns: Sen. Tom Bakk of Cook and Rod Skoe of Clearbrook.\The ""clean cars"" bill is expected to be back again in 2009.\But before legislators get to that, they'll have a decision -- expected in January -- by the PUC on whether to certify power lines into Minnesota from the power plant on the South Dakota shore of Big Stone lake. Even though administrative law judges have twice recommended against the certification -- which would effectively kill the project -- there is a strong likelihood that the five-member PUC will approve the plant.\Meanwhile, the WWF (formerly the World Wildlife Fund) issued a new report, ""Climate Change: Faster, Stronger, Sooner"" (PDF) which warns that global warming is accelerating far beyond forecasts made by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Among other effects, the WWF said that rising emperatures have already led to a loss of 40 million tons of grain annually and sea temperatures have risen to the highest levels since record keeping began.\Ron Way, a former reporter for several Midwest newspapers, covers the environment and energy issues.

Imagine if the government made you spend 20 percent of your family's food budget on asparagus. It might be costlier than other vegetables, but Congress and the president say it's good for you. Asparagus producers are ecstatic -- no more competing with other vegetables for your business. And because there's a mandate, they don't even have to worry about lowering costs.
\
Other farmers respond by replacing their less-expensive crops with the costlier, mandated vegetable. In the end, consumers are stuck with less choice and higher prices.
\
Sounds absurd, right? Well, it's what would happen to our electricity bills if Congress passes a Renewable Electricity Standard.
\
An RES would force Americans to purchase a pre-determined percentage of their electricity from certain energy sources that Washington bureaucrats deem acceptable, like wind or solar, which featured prominently in last year's failed ""cap and trade"" legislation. Tuesday's election likely killed any hopes of Congress passing a cap-and-trade bill anytime soon, but an RES, which has garnered bipartisan support, is still in the cards.
\
Politicians are quick to say that an RES would enable us to have renewable energy without having a cap and trade. But like cap and trade, it's the equivalent of an energy tax -- and an economy killer.
\
Because these electricity sources are expensive, Washington has to force us to buy them. Mandated higher electricity prices ripple throughout the economy. Higher electric bills force families to consume less and dip into their savings. They force businesses to cut production and reduce labor.
\
A Heritage Foundation analysis found that a 15 percent RES by 2020 would destroy more than 1 million jobs as soon as 2017 and reduce gross domestic product by more than $1 trillion from 2012-2020.
\
But, say politicians, higher prices are justified. An RES is necessary for America's clean energy economy and securing energy independence.
\
Saying RES will enhance America's energy security is nothing more than an empty talking point. Since electricity comes almost entirely from secure domestic sources, and petroleum provides about 1 percent of our electricity needs, an RES would do almost nothing to decrease our use of foreign energy. It would simply displace cheap electricity with expensive electricity.
\
RES supporters argue that because wind and solar energy are emissions-free, increasing those sources will save the Earth. The reality is requiring Americans to buy expensive, uncompetitive energy has little, if anything, to do with the environment. A recent study by the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States finds that temporarily reducing coal generation in place of wind generates more greenhouse gases because it causes coal plants to operate inefficiently.
\
RES is more a political instrument for Washington to subsidize powerful special-interest groups, than a policy to reduce emissions. Otherwise, it would include nuclear power, which provides almost 70 percent of the nation's emissions-free energy.
\
Not that including nuclear energy and CCS in an RES bill would make it a good idea -- Washington has no business in dictating what energy sources American's use. But excluding them demonstrates the hypocrisy at work here.
\
Too often these mandates are not recognized for what they are: a mechanism to transfer wealth from everyday Americans to industries that politicians believe are worthy. Congress concentrates benefits to the politically connected and disperses the costs to the rest of us.
\
Here is the truly perverse outcome of these policies. Mandating and subsidizing non-competitive technologies crowds out investment for newer, cleaner technologies that could not only help us preserve the environment but do it at an affordable price. The resources used to prop up uncompetitive wind and solar projects could be invested into new emissions-free electricity sources that might be cheaper than fossil fuels. But we'll never know, because we'll be stuck with what the government gave us.
\
Chalk RES up as another policy that will increase the cost of living and curtail liberty for Americans. An RES will eliminate competition, drive prices higher, and encourage government dependence. This isn't an acceptable substitute for cap and trade, and any bipartisanship the idea receives doesn't make it a good idea. If some politicians believe wind and solar are economically viable for their respective states, they should work with state legislators to pass something for their state and not allow the rest of America to endure the economic pain of a national RES.

18,"Despite the Legislature's attempt to lift Minnesota's 17-year moratorium on new nuclear power plants and President Obama's plan that taxpayers assume the financial risk of building several more plants in the United States, the morass of issues surrounding nukes makes it unlikely that a new fission nuclear plant will be operational in Minnesota for at least the next half century.\And as the frightening events of the earthquake and tsunami-ravaged nuclear plants in Japan plays out -- not just now, which is bad enough, but for years to come with news reports of contaminated food and water, radiation sickness and premature death -- the fate of nuclear power could be sealed.\The very worst case is if a meltdown occurs at one or more of the four Fukushima reactors and prevailing westerly winds shift and carry a highly radioactive cloud 150 miles into the Tokyo megalopolis (the city alone has nearly 13 million people). The chilling scenario is too horrible to imagine.\But Japan's unfolding disaster only shovels dirt on the nukes' grave.\The high promise of the 1950s that nuclear would provide cheap, reliable power and its more recent promise of providing an answer to greenhouse gases from coal plants began to unravel with the nation's decades-long failure to find a politically acceptable storage site for growing piles of radioactive wastes. The problems continued with safety fears stoked in 1979 with a partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Penn., and again in 1986 with the Chernobyl meltdown in the Ukraine.\In all, a half century of tangled events -- some technical, some emotional and lots political -- have conspired to present daunting challenges for nuclear power. It all came to a head a few years back when lenders, faced with surging cost overruns and prolonged regulatory review, determined that financial risk of new plants is too great.\With the present disaster in Japan, industry uncertainty has grown even more, regulatory and other delays will surely increase, and building costs will be a whole lot higher.\The industry's only hope is for the federal government to step up and assume financial risk to build new plants just as it did more than 50 years ago when Congress took over a major insurance risk for nuclear plants.\That's why Obama is pushing a $54.5 billion package to have the federal government guarantee loans to build nuclear plants (a good analysis of Obama's nuclear policy is here). Back in 1957 Congress passed the Price Anderson Act, which limited operator liability in the event of a nuclear accident, overcoming a major hurdle at the time because power companies couldn't afford private-market insurance for their projects.\Minnesota's role\Nuclear power's history provides a trove of missed opportunities, safety fears and an often contradictory mix of political ideology. Through it all, Minnesota has played an important role.\In the 1960s, Earl Ewald, the visionary CEO of Northern States Power Company (NSP, now part of Xcel Energy), was convinced that nuclear was the power source of the future, despite the company's cost and safety troubles with its Pathfinder plant near Sioux Falls, S.D. (The plant was abandoned due to high cost and safety issues shortly after it opened in 1967).\In 1971 NSP built the 600-megawatt generator at Monticello, Minn., and applied for permits to build twin 500-megawatt generators at Prairie Island near Red Wing, Minn., (completed in 1973).\The process was watched closely by U.S. power companies and by the powerful -- now defunct -- U.S. House-Senate Joint Atomic Energy Committee in Washington. That's because the fledgling Minnesota Pollution Control Agency sought to regulate radioactive discharges from the nuclear plants, something that no other state had tried (see Dr. Dean Abrahamson's splendid historical piece in MinnPost).\It was a hot and humid summer day in the late 1960s at a public hearing on the proposed Prairie Island plant when a withered elder of the Mdewakanton Sioux spoke: ""My counsel to you is something my father told me: 'Measure twice and cut once.'"" He looked each hearing officer in the eye as he slowly repeated his advice, for emphasis.\The issue then was over a planned federal nuclear-waste storage facility at Nevada's Yucca Mountain and some other sites. NSP assured regulators that a waste repository would be completed by the time Prairie Island opened, and so the Indian elder and others need not worry about disposal of ""spent"" fuel rods. (Although ""spent"" rods no longer generate sufficient heat to spin turbines, they still contain material that remains highly radioactive for thousands of years.)\But no federal waste site ever opened, and political wrangling over the Yucca site has pushed development out another decade -- or at least until Yucca opponent, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., leaves Congress. Obama has defunded the Yucca site.\And so radioactive wastes are stored at all 104 plants across the United States. In Minnesota, rad-wastes are stored on a floodplain at Prairie Island, where wary tribal residents continue to live and where NSP and regulators made ""the cut"" and built without, it turns out, making certain of a critical measure as the elder long ago warned. At Monticello, rad-wastes are stored upstream and upwind of the Twin Cities -- a site that surely wouldn't be allowed today.\Dayton's position\The waste-storage issue won't go away. Gov. Mark Dayton opposes lifting the state's moratorium on nuclear power plants: (1) until a waste site is developed, (2) until it's assured that spent fuel won't be turned into weapons grade plutonium (a controversial subject involving dicey issues like nuclear proliferation in an age of Iran and North Korea), and (3) until it's assured that Xcel ratepayers won't be on the hook for ever-growing nuclear-plant development costs.\In other words, with Dayton as governor Minnesota's nuclear moratorium won't be lifted. But it all may be moot, because Xcel officials have said they have no plans for a nuclear plant in Minnesota or anywhere else in their multi-state territory.\One of the tangles in the nuclear debate is the curious ideological juxtaposition in which most nuclear proponents dislike government subsidies of private industry and don't want government to ""pick winners and losers."" Both Obama and Sen. John McCain -- and even former Minnesota governor and now presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty -- have said nuclear power plants are needed to provide reliable power without adding greenhouse gases. But the only way to accomplish that is for the federal government to continue to provide massive subsidies and assume even more financial risk because private lenders and insurers have shown they believe nuclear power is too costly and risky.\McCain has said he'd like to see 45 new nuclear power plants built in the United States by 2030, something mouthed by Pawlenty as he angled to get on McCain's presidential ticket in 2008. At about $10 billion a pop, that would mean putting federal taxpayers on the hook for a half trillion dollars to aid a single energy sector.\And since Obama's plan would cap loan guarantees at $54 billion, it means the federal government would be ""picking winners and losers"" by backing only the first few new plants. Meantime, other alternative-energy sources like solar, wind and thermal are starved of front-end cash for them to get to viability.\Another curious political cross-current arose when nuclear power advocates, for the most part, opposed so-called ""cap and trade"" policies that would drive up costs of spewing carbon and other climate-altering gases into the atmosphere. This would be accomplished by regulators setting a cap on greenhouse-gas emissions and forcing polluters to purchase (""trade"" for) credits at ever-increasing costs. ""Cap and trade"" had initial appeal because it relied on a market-sector device to assign ""external"" costs to pollution.\As governor, Pawlenty embraced a major carbon-reduction bill passed overwhelmingly by the 2007 Legislature, and he later worked with then-Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, to develop a Midwestern group to implement cap and trade and other policies to combat climate change.\The cap-and-trade approach was strongly supported by nuclear power advocates because it would help make nuclear more attractive financially.\However, Tea Party adherents and other political conservatives derided cap and trade as ""cap and tax"" and have made it a litmus test of conservatism. Pawlenty, who needs Republican conservatives next year in primary states, has done an about face on cap and trade or other carbon-reducing policies, putting him squarely at odds with the nuclear industry he says he supports.\Safety worries\Through it all, questions of the safety of nuclear plants has been at the core of most political debates.\Whether plants are safe is a matter of perspective. Nuclear advocates claim technical redundancies in modern plants result in less radiation than, say, one is exposed to on daytime commercial airplane flights. And that may be true. But it's also true that SUV vehicles are ""safe"" until they roll over or hit a bridge, or that railroad chemical tankers are ""safe"" until they jump a track.\In fact, nuclear power plants contain some pretty nasty stuff, as the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl proved, and which is now apparent by the unfolding disaster in Japan. Nuclear proponents were gaining support on the safety issue until the Japan earthquake happened, and now safety is of such concern that sales of potassium iodide (to protect from thyroid cancer in the event of excessive radiation levels) are spiking throughout the West Coast.\(In Phoenix, one person displayed his ample supply of potassium iodide he said was protection not from anything in Japan but in case of trouble at the giant, 3200-megawatt Palo Verde plant near the city or trouble at plants upwind in California, an area crisscrossed with earthquake-prone fault lines.)\Responding to developments in Japan, Obama and European leaders vowed that they will learn from the disaster and examine regulatory and other preparations.\What they will learn (again) is that nuclear power plants are dangerous places. More safety and protective measures can only add to spiraling construction costs and regulatory reform can only add time and still more cost to a process to build plants that private lenders and insurers say are too risky.\Ron Way covers the environment and energy issues.

19,"WASHINGTON - Barack Obama's virtual campaign is back in Minnesota. \Building on the massive Internet apparatus that helped him win the presidency, Obama is launching a full-tilt grass-roots campaign to drum up support for his controversial $3.5 trillion budget in politically competitive states and districts where he might be able to sway critical congressional votes. \The centerpiece of the campaign, an e-mail list of more than 13 million supporters nationwide, draws heavily on voters and activists in swing states like Minnesota that were in play at different points in the 2008 presidential election. \Among the supporters is Katie McGee, a St. Paul paralegal who volunteered for the Obama for America campaign last fall. Now it's morphed into Organizing for America -- and she spent Saturday going door-to-door in St. Paul talking about the Obama budget's remaking of the American social contract on health care, education and renewable energy. \""It's challenging,"" said McGee, noting that on the campaign trail Obama could easily galvanize large enthusiastic crowds. ""It's a little less sexy with just the issues. It's 'Why do I have to spend my Saturdays doing this? Didn't we just elect this guy?'"" \Arrayed against the campaign are most congressional Republicans, along with some Democrats, who are criticizing the budget as the largest expansion of government spending in history. The looming budget battle will be the first major test of the Obama campaign's continuing grass-roots reach and also may be a defining moment of his presidency. \Obama's budget campaign is relying on a network of groups -- including more than 40 labor, environmental and social justice organizations in Minnesota -- that can be counted on to rev up a $5 million to $7 million ground campaign of phone banks, e-mail blasts and door-knocking on behalf of the White House's new budget. \""This is the biggest, baddest coalition campaign I've ever worked on,"" said Jeremy Funk of the Democrat-aligned Americans United for Change. \One of the local groups is Environment Minnesota, which is poised to enlist nearly 8,000 e-mail activists in a budget fight that normally draws the close attention only of inside-the-Beltway policy wonks and lobbyists. \""The message is Obama is trying to bring about some of the things he campaigned on,"" said Samantha Chadwick, an organizer with Environment Minnesota, which supports Obama's $646 billion cap-and-trade plan to curb carbon emissions. ""He needs help from the same types of grass-roots people who supported his campaign."" \An air war as well \Though largely devised as a ground game, the campaign is also getting some air support in Minnesota. Funk's group, Americans United for Change, has started running AM radio ads to pressure freshman Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen, who voted with Democrats on children's health insurance legislation. \Despite the group's pressure, Paulsen echoes familiar GOP criticisms of the budget, chiefly that it would create an unaffordable public spending spree that will raise taxes, crush business and deepen the national debt. \""I can understand why a PR campaign is needed to find support for these proposals, but it would be better for everyone if they instead focused on passing a fiscally responsible budget,"" said Paulsen spokesman Luke Friedrich. \As both sides gear up for the coming battle over the budget, Minnesota Democrats are deploying a familiar cast of characters from Obama's successful presidential campaign, including Minneapolis Mayor R.T Rybak. \Rybak, who was joined by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison at a kick-off for the Minnesota campaign, called on supporters to press Congress to back Obama's budget, though it's still days or weeks in the offing. \Whether the push will work remains to be seen. \""No matter how hard anyone tries, you can't duplicate a campaign in the middle of governing,"" said Rybak, a co-chairman of Obama's campaign in Minnesota. ""But you can tell people who were part of an unprecedented grass-roots movement that their job didn't end with the election, it just began."" \The budget campaign's national director, Mitch Stewart, is also a familiar face to Obama volunteers in Minnesota. He was part of the Obama campaign's win over Hillary Rodham Clinton in the state's Democratic caucuses last year. \In an e-mail blast to Obama supporters last week, Stewart anticipated a tough legislative battle, underscoring the need to ""bring the conversation back into homes and communities across America."" \Virtual Obama \Obama kicked off the campaign with a Web video imploring organizers like McGee to take to the streets on Saturday, ""block by block and door by door."" In an accompanying e-mail, former campaign manager David Plouffe called the coming budget fight ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to lay the groundwork for Obama's sweeping agenda on energy, health care and education. \Republicans also see the budget as a place to draw lines in the sand on two key Obama proposals: creation of a health care reform fund by limiting tax breaks for the wealthy, and a cap-and-trade plan to curb carbon emissions that they view as a business tax that will hurt consumers and cripple the U.S. economy. \Chadwick and other environmental organizers see the budget's projected $646 billion in cap-and-trade revenue as a chance to invest in a new energy economy based on wind, solar and other renewable resources. \However the debate plays out in Congress, the Obama grass-roots effort depends on communicating the nexus between money and policy. ""You can't do anything in government without the money,"" Rybak said. ""That's why this matters so much."" \Obama's grass-roots push is not without precedent. To Republican strategist Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman, it is reminiscent of the early days of Ronald Reagan's White House, which won a major tax cut with the help of conservative groups flooding Congress with letters and phone calls. \But the key, Weber said, is rallying the troops around a well-defined objective that starts with popular support. ""The budget is not the place I'd start the campaign,"" he said. ""It's complicated. It's a little harder to sell."" \Obama's shock troops believe they have the public on their side. The election was evidence of that. It's just that the campaign is not over. \""The truth of the matter is it's not a one-election effort,"" McGee said as she prepared this weekend's door-knocking in St. Paul. ""It's for the long-haul."" \Kevin Diaz - 202-408-2753"
20,"Legislators involved in energy policy are increasingly doubtful that Gov. Tim Pawlenty will push, or even support, the kind of ""bold"" energy initiatives that he urged of his fellow governors in national speeches just two years ago.\Meeting in St. Paul last week, legislators were surprised when administration officials suggested that further action may not be needed to reduce carbon emissions linked to climate change, as required in a law the governor signed in 2007. At the time Pawlenty had said, ""... here in Minnesota we are kick-starting the future by increasing our nation-leading per capita renewable fuel use, boosting cost saving measures and tackling greenhouse gas emissions.""\Pawlenty's top energy-policy officials further surprised legislators by saying that millions of tons of added carbon (a key greenhouse gas) from two major coal-fired power plants being planned - Big Stone II on Minnesota's western border and Excelsior Energy on the Iron Range - could actually reduce greenhouse gases.\An energy-policy expert - earlier appointed by Pawlenty to major carbon-reduction study groups - dismissed that assertion as ""preposterous.""\Committee told that new plants would replace old ones\David Thornton, assistant commissioner for air quality at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), told the Senate Energy Committee last week that models show the two plants with state-of-the art emissions technology would replace older plants that emit proportionately higher carbon amounts.\However, Bill Grant of the Isaac Walton League and who Pawlenty named to the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group (MCCAG) and to a carbon-reduction study panel of the Midwestern Governors Association, said that when utilities were asked if they'd close older plants when - and if - Big Stone and Excelsior start up, they all said no.\Grant said utilities typically keep power plants running as long it's profitable to fulfill energy demand by the regional energy grid. Besides, he and others have noted, if the Big Stone plant would merely replace existing plants it wouldn't qualify for a ""certificate of need"" that was granted last month 5 by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.\Utilities told group they wouldn't shut down plants\Thornton cited an MCAAG work group as the basis for his statement. But Grant served on the group, which is the one that heard utilities say they would not shut down any plants.\At the Senate hearing, Thornton and the director of the year-old Office of Energy Security (OES), Bill Glahn, presented a 40-page report (PDF) that was to make specific recommendations on how Minnesota may meet aggressive carbon-reduction goals in the 2007 Next Generation Energy Act. The first of three targets - a 15 percent carbon reduction below 2005 levels - is just six years off, in 2015.\But Thornton and Glahn startled lawmakers with a graph showing that carbon emissions in Minnesota are estimated to dip slightly from 2005 to 2006, the last year for which any data is available. They testified that if the trend would continue the 2015 target may be met by doing nothing.\""This really surprises me,"" said Sen. Ellen Anderson, DFL-St. Paul. ""And I'm a little nervous about projecting that this downward trend will continue."" Anderson chairs the Senate Energy and Environment Finance Division.\The energy committee's chair and author of the 2007 Next Gen law, Sen. Yvonne Prettner Solon, DFL-Duluth, agreed: ""There are a lot of unanswered questions here.""\Recession, conversion cited\Thornton and Glahn speculated that the economic downturn, together with Xcel Energy converting three metro power plants from coal to natural gas, may account for the decline along with increased reliance on wind power (the state now has more than 1,700 megawatts of wind energy capacity, fourth highest in the nation; Iowa is third).\Other reasons may include a reduction in miles driven in the state measured by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, and increased ethanol use (refiners must blend 10 percent ethanol into gasoline, and the state is pushing to raise that to 20 percent).\Thornton and Glahn told wary legislators that they don't fully understand the decline and they agreed that the state should move ahead with carbon-reduction efforts. So, they were asked repeatedly, if the state should move ahead, exactly which policies would they recommend?\The question comes after the Legislature took years to pass the Next Gen Act, which resulted in tens of thousands of hours of study by the 56-member MCAAG, along with added study by the independent Center for Climate Strategies of Washington, D.C., on ways to reduce carbon emissions, plus additional study by the MPCA and the OES, and on-going study by task forces of the Midwestern Governors Association.\46 policy options presented\Last April, MCCAG presented 46 policy options that together could meet the carbon-reduction targets of 15 percent by 2015 and 30 percent by 2025.\But of MCAAG's several recommendations, Thornton and Glahn would embrace only two: for the Legislature to repeal the state's ban on nuclear power plants (MCCAG said the issue should be studied) and for the state to require appliance energy-efficiency rules.\Glahn conceded that no state utility has shown interest in nuclear power, and that even if planning started now there would be no plant operational by 2025. When asked whether he would support appliance-standards bills that will face first hearings at the Capitol this week, Glahn said he has not yet received direction from the governor's office.\Thornton said the market-driven ""cap and trade"" initiative from the Midwest Governor's Conference - something initially pushed by Pawlenty and Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle - may hold promise. Under ""cap and trade,"" government sets ever-lower carbon caps and emitting sources would bid (""trade"") for ever-costlier emissions rights.\Glahn said a Midwestern Governors ""cap and trade"" report is due later this year.\A somewhat related policy area not studied by MCAAG but advanced by Pawlenty is promotion of ""green"" jobs through the controversial JOBZ investment tax credits program, and by coordinating climate change actions with green job projects.\But when the joint legislative ""green jobs task force"" met last week, Glahn announced that he'd defer on any proposals by the group because he didn't want his comments to be taken as a signal by the Pawlenty administration.\""That's leadership?"" Bill Grant asked.\A growing list of legislators has questioned Pawlenty's commitment to energy policy, and most expect that his spokesmen - Thornton and Glahn - will continue to talk a lot, say little, and obstruct progress.\Example: response to Dibble bill\An example of that came in a recent meeting between Thornton and Sen. Scott Dibble, DFL Minneapolis, on a bill by Dibble to require the Metropolitan Council to incorporate state carbon-reduction goals into regional planning. Thornton said the bill could be seen by some as ""social engineering.""\Among those frustrated with Pawlenty on energy policy is Rep. Bill Hilty, DFL-Finlayson, who chairs the House Energy Committee. Hilty is assembling a Legislative Energy Commission, authorized last year in a move some see as legislative disgust with Pawlenty's lack of action and, even, stonewalling on a major carbon-reduction report presented to legislators last month (it was a year late). Among other things, Hilty sees the commission as helping drive energy policy, including MCAAG's recommendations.\To assist the commission, Prettner Solon is moving a bill to create a greenhouse-gas-emissions registry, requiring the MPCA and OES to inventory progress and develop strategies to meet the Next Gen carbon-reduction targets.\Also last week, major carbon-reducing legislation - the ""Clean Cars"" bill - was introduced by DFLers Sen. John Marty of Roseville and Rep. Melissa Hortman of Brooklyn Park. The bill would have Minnesota join California and 13 other states in adopting tailpipe-emissions and fuel-efficiency rules stricter than U.S. standards.\The controversial bill passed six legislative committees last year and was within a few votes of making to the Senate floor, where advocates expected they had the votes to pass it. Despite fierce opposition by the auto industry and ethanol producers, authors are confident of passage this year.\But so far Pawlenty isn't on board.\In the carbon-reduction report presented to Senators last week, Thornton wrote that the U.S. EPA has signaled that it would make federal rules stricter, obviating any need for the legislation. It's a position advanced by the auto industry in opposing the Clean Cars bill.\Hortman said she's unaware that the EPA is planning new auto-emissions rules. ""If anything the signal has been that states should move ahead in this area,"" she said.\Thornton declined multiple requests that he specify the foundation for his report to legislators.\Ron Way reports on energy and the environment.\Credit: Ron Way"
21,"The trope this primary election cycle is that Minnesota Republicans, like their counterparts nationwide, are so fractured that Republicans themselves will present the biggest challenge to the GOP presidential nominee. Mitt Romney's relatively narrow wins Tuesday support the contention that before the nominee can defeat President Obama this fall, he must cement together enough of these factions to bring together the base, and that may not be possible.\Carleton College political science professor and pundit Steve Schier rejects that notion with a sweeping dismissal. ""There are no Obama Republicans,"" he says.\With polls showing Republican approval of Obama at 10 percent, even Rick Santorum will get the GOP base, he said.\That is not to say that Minnesota Republicans, like DFLers, don't have specific agendas. In the Republican Party, the factions resemble a grown-up version of high school cliques. There are the social conservatives, the pro-business Republicans, the country club Republicans, the disenchanted Republicans. This last group has morphed into the libertarians and the Tea Party Republicans.\Even the splinter groups have splintered. There are Tea Party supporters who don't like Romney because of health care, don't like Santorum because of earmarks, and don't like Newt Gingrich because of his stand on cap and trade and his association with Nancy Pelosi.\Then there are the Ron Paul supporters. Republicans who will work hard in November for unified voter turnout say the biggest division stems from the Ron Paul people. Activists note that the Paul supporters show up at caucuses, never to be seen again. They have no second choice candidate.\""The Ron Paul supporter will never be an activist,"" Schier said. ""It's not the man. It's the libertarian cause. They buy a libertarian ideology and mission.""\The mission to dramatically shrink the size and scope of government has given extra weight to the one issue that cleaves Republican ranks in Minnesota: Gay rights has replaced abortion as the bright line that can't be crossed. On one side are the social conservatives. On the other are libertarians, moderates and groups who see anti-gay positions as an impediment to business growth.\The divide has widened with the proposed constitutional amendment on the November ballot that defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman. It's also strengthened the voice of the Log Cabin Republicans of Minnesota. Although in number the coalition is miniscule, Log Cabin Republicans created some ripples in their caucuses as they moved to remove anti-language from the party platform.\Republican activists are sensitive about the depiction of their party divided and point to divisions among Democrats, namely the battle over jobs versus the environment.\Schier concurs -- up to a point. ""The rift is there but it's been submerged in this election,"" he says. ""There's no evidence of this at the state level. At the national level, if there were serious rifts, Obama would have a primary opponent."" He sees no evidence of an anti-Obama Democrat when it comes to the president's reelection.\As for the Republican primary opponents, there seems to be the belief that what doesn't kill the party will make it stronger. There are three candidates that fit the bill for most of the Republican Party. They are competing with each other, and that's healthy. The party won't be fractionalized once the nominee emerges.\Given the rank-and-file Republican's determination to deny Obama a second term, turnout of the base will not be a problem. But given the positions that candidates have been forced to stake out, the question is whether the eventual Republican nominee will attract the critical percentage of independents needed to win the national election. Divisions in the party could linger until November and turnout alone will not be enough for a Republican to win.\Credit: Cyndy Brucato"
22,"Just before Congress began tackling climate change legislation this week, the Pew Research Center released a new survey showing a sharp decline in public's belief that global warming is real.\Two years ago, 77 percent of Americans who were polled said there was solid evidence of global warming. Last year 71 percent said so. Now it is 57 percent.\Pew noted that its poll was released a day after leaders of 18 prominent scientific organizations signed a ""Dear Senator"" letter reaffirming what they see as scientific consensus on climate change. (One of the 18 signers is University of Minnesota Prof. Douglas Arnold, who is president this year of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.)\Why are the public and the scientists moving in opposite directions on this issue?\I don't know. And Pew researchers said they were puzzled too.\One hint, though, comes from a different study Pew released last month. This one was a News IQ quiz.\Here's one of the 12 multiple choice questions on the quiz: Does the so-called ""cap and trade"" legislation being discussed in Congress deal with 1) banking reform, 2) energy and environment, 3) health care or 4) unemployment?\The overall news IQ was pretty low. The answers to this question, though, were near the lowest of the low. Only 23 percent of those who took the quiz chose the correct answer, which is No. 2, energy and the environment.\To be sure, reasonable people could disagree with cap-and-trade proposals circulating on Capitol Hill. That question wasn't asked. Busy people also could be forgiven for not knowing the considerable intricacies of those proposals. But not knowing so much as their general gist?\Something other than scientific argument and news coverage of the public policy issues is turning public opinion to quite a remarkable degree.\Any clues anyone?\Credit: Sharon Schmickle"
23,"AFTERNOON EDITION\LA Times questions Bachmann's collegiality, effectiveness\This is not exactly news here, but Kathleen Hennessey of the Los Angeles Times files a report on Our Favorite Congresswoman's collegiality and effectivess as a legislator: ""With its firm hierarchy, Congress is a difficult place to rack up accomplishments quickly -- or to launch a presidential bid. But what sets Bachmann apart is how her legislative colleagues view her. It is difficult to find Republicans willing to discuss her on the record. House leaders have kept their distance and rarely rewarded her with legislative responsibilities. Bachmann was recently criticized by other Republicans in a private meeting where members blamed her near-constant cycle of television appearances for undermining the House Republican message. ... Bachmann's office declined an interview request. Asked to describe the congresswoman's chief legislative accomplishments, Bachmann spokeswoman Becky Rogness pointed to her votes in opposition to major legislation -- the Wall Street bailout passed during the George W. Bush administration, and the stimulus package, auto industry bailout, cap-and-trade regulation and others. Rogness noted that Bachmann was first to introduce legislation to repeal the health care law and has since introduced another piece of health care legislation that has broad GOP support."" Now that is what I call ""gittin' 'r done.""\Jim Hightower, the progressive pundit, writes in The Austin Chronicle: ""The higher the monkey climbs, the more you see of its ugly side. So here comes Rick Perry of Texas, trying to climb the national political ladder all the way to the presidency. He's really two candidates in one suit. On the surface, Perry is vying to be the furthest out of the tea party Republicans' far-out right-wingers - sort of Michele Bachmann with better hair. He wants to scuttle Social Security and Medicaid. Also, he says the federal government should not be 'regulating the environment ... protecting civil rights ...

Tim Nelson of MPR reports: ""[Vikings stadium point man Lester] Bagley said another matter open for negotiation includes whether to make the roof retractable. The team wants to be able to open up the stadium to accommodate a major league soccer franchise, but a fixed roof, which would be less expensive, 'would cost us the opportunity to bring in an MLS team.' And the clock is ticking. 'We've got to get the project done, we've got to bring the costs down, we've got to get a package done together and get in front of the legislature,' he said. News that the team might consider upping its contribution follows a Ramsey County Charter Commission meeting Wednesday night in which members put off new restrictions on local funding through taxes or bonding, and called for two hearings for the public to weigh in on the proposed sales tax to build the stadium.""\Nice little fracas on Superior Street in Duluth. Don Kraker of MPR writes: ""A long-running and contentious dispute between the city of Duluth and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is back in federal court, where a judge could determine if a revenue-sharing agreement is legal. The legal battle is over tens of millions of dollars in casino revenue the Band once agreed to share with the financially struggling city. In a one-of-a-kind arrangement in 1994, the downtown casino signed a contract that gives Duluth 19 percent of gross revenue from slot machines -- about $6 million a year. City officials use the money to maintain city streets. Fond du Lac Chairwoman Karen Diver said the city has received way too much, and the Band doesn't owe it a penny more. 'To date the city has gotten over $80 million,' she said. 'I would think that the tab is clear.' ""\And still at MPR, Catharine Richert on its PoliGraph site gives the state GOP a ""misleading"" rating for its recent shots at Mark Dayton's ""anti-job"" administration: ""During the legislative session, Dayton wanted to raise taxes on the state's wealthiest, which the GOP said would discourage businesses from hiring. To make their case, the Republicans say in the flier that, 'After cutting taxes and declaring the state 'open for business,' Wisconsin created 12,900 new private-sector jobs in June. ... This represents the largest one-month gain of private-sector jobs in Wisconsin since 2003'. The Senate GOP gets its numbers right, but the job situation in Wisconsin is far more nuanced than the flier lets on. ... It's true that Wisconsin added 12,900 private sector jobs in June -- the largest since 2003. In fact, the state's Department of Workforce Development later increased that figure to 14,800 private sector jobs. These numbers are seasonally adjusted, but economists in Wisconsin point out that many jobs added in June were food service and leisure positions, which tend to disappear once the weather gets colder. Economists also highlight that in July, the previous gains in the private sector were wiped out when Wisconsin lost 12,500 jobs from nearly all the state's industries.""

24," The debate in Washington over climate change seems certain to intensify in the wake of an international report Friday that human activities are very likely causing rising temperatures and sea levels.\ Various proposals have been made - capping emissions and creating renewable energy standards, for example - and congressional leaders are promising a much more vigorous look at the issue than it's received in the past. But no consensus has emerged over who would pay for reducing wastes from industry, energy plants and vehicles.\ The White House on Friday solidly endorsed the report, saying it would serve as a valuable source of information for policymakers. The administration reiterated its opposition to mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases as a way of dealing with the problem.\ Nowhere is the tenor of the controversy clearer than in the Senate. Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar has ended her first month in Washington by joining a new nine-member subcommittee charged with finding ways to address global warming, putting her in position to help create a national strategy. She favors strong limits on greenhouse gases.\ Leadership on the issue in the Senate has taken a dramatic turn.\ .\ Agreed: It's not a hoax\ The last chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, called theories attributing global warming to human activities a ""hoax"" and blamed the media for hyping the issue. The new chairwoman, Democrat Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, says the United States is rapidly reaching ""a tipping point when irreversible changes to the world we know may occur.""\ Another sign of change: Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., who was criticized by environmental groups in October for floating a proposal to strip states of their ability to fight carbon dioxide emissions, has backed away from the plan. He says he is ""passionate about cutting down carbon emissions"" and that Inhofe was mistaken on global warming. Coleman predicted there will be a ""drastic difference"" with Boxer replacing Inhofe.\ While the issue of global warming has long divided politicians in Washington, Boxer said ""a real consensus is coming together,"" with scientists, the public and the Bush administration agreeing that global warming is real and that humans are contributing to it.\ ""We are at a historic moment - the tide is turning,"" Boxer said at a hearing this week. She has touted a California state law that requires lowering emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.\ So far, a handful of bills have been introduced. Many Democrats are proposing mandatory caps on emissions, while others are promoting a more flexible ""cap and trade"" system. Under such a plan, Congress would set federal emissions standards and then allow companies to sell emissions credits when they fall below the standards and to buy credits when they exceed them. Congress also must decide whether to impose a single national standard that would pre-empt state laws.\ Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said Friday he will push to expand public transportation: ""If we made a 10 percent mode shift in surface transportation to transit, we would save the equivalent of all the oil we import from Saudi Arabia in a year. That's 550 million barrels of oil.""\ .\ Seeks strong limits\ Klobuchar said she's backing strong limits on greenhouse-gas emissions and ""some version"" of a cap-and-trade system. She also wants Congress to approve renewable fuel standards for cars and trucks and to provide incentives for manufacturers and consumers to build and buy hybrid and flex-fuel vehicles.\ Klobuchar, appointed to serve both on the environmental committee and its global warming subcommittee, gave a speech this week that made reference to her state's legendary subzero temperatures: ""Many people here might wonder why Minnesotans would be concerned if it warmed up a few degrees.""\ But she said protecting the environment is part of Minnesota's heritage.\ ""Our decisions on global warming may well be the ones that have the most profound impact on our future generations and on the very fate of the Earth.""\ Coleman floated a new plan this week that would require utilities to generate a growing percentage of their electricity from clean energy sources, such as wind, fuel cells and fossil-fired plants that capture and sequester carbon dioxide emissions. An analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a Department of Energy statistical and analytic agency, shows Coleman's plan would lead to a reduction of 14.7 percent in projected increases of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 - although still 23.1 percent higher than 2004 levels.\ ""Unfortunately, this is the classic congressional response of talking about solving a problem while making it worse,"" said Kelly Scanlan, state director of the Minnesota Natural Legacy Campaign State Director.\ Coleman said he will seek changes to get better results.\ In discussing the global warming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, White House science official Dr. Sharon Hays said, ""It reflects the sizeable and robust body of knowledge regarding the physical science of climate change, including the finding that the Earth is warming and that human activities have very likely caused most of the warming of the last 50 years.""\ Separately, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman warned against ""unintended consequences"" - including job losses - that he said might result if the government requires economy-wide caps on carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.\ .\ The Associated Press contributed to this report.\ Rob Hotakainen is a correspondent in the Star Tribune Washington Bureau: 202-383-0009"
25,"Second of two parts\As Donald Trump works to ensure his status as the most environmentally regressive president since the 19th century, he is also making an important contribution in the opposite direction: galvanizing pushback.\Opposition to the administration’s rollback agenda is taking many forms, demonstrating a strength and steadiness that I think could also prove historic. And this is not my first time committing journalism on a turnover of presidential power from a Democrat with a modest and late-blooming portfolio of environmental progress to a Republican who raced to undo a series of sensible protections that industry found inconvenient.\Perhaps you, too, recall the battles of George W. Bush’s first term over the roadless rule, indefinite exemption of coal-fired power plants from clean air standards, the suppression of science, the censoring of internal dissent, the ideologue appointees devoted to retreat (remember Gale Norton and Dirk Kempthorne?). After a few years the anti-environment agenda was big enough for book-length treatment, and Bob Devine wrote one — “Bush Versus the Environment,” still on my shelf.\Ronald Reagan and his team took swings at environmental progress, too (remember James Watt and Anne Gorsuch Burford?). And both Bush and Reagan inspired significant pushback on environmental protection but not, I think, to the degree we’re already seen in Trump’s first year — starting with the sheer volume of multistate litigation by attorneys general working in concert.\Fully 17 states, including Minnesota, went to court on the eve of Trump’s inauguration to block his promised weakening of interstate rules on power-plant emissions. A similar group sued in April to block his threatened trashing of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, which remains untrashed, and may or may not be meaningfully revised in a process sure to take years at least. Other multistate challenges have been raised over efforts to weaken efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances.\According to a count by David Hasemyer at Inside Climate News, collaboratives of attorneys general had sued nearly two dozen times by mid-December over “climate change, energy and the environment,” an important limiting term. The tally does not include, say, the 11-state lawsuit defending strengthened rules on safety programs, disaster preparedness and accident investigation at chemical plants, inspired by the horrific 2013 fertilizer explosion at the storage plant in West, Texas.\Just as I think it’s a mistake to give Trump too much credit too early for starting fights he may not actually win, I don’t assume the success of these challenges. I will just point out that when the plaintiffs are a bunch of states, rather than a bunch of nonprofits, the funding is likely to be comparatively ample.\And there have been some early wins, including a court order directing the Interior Department and its Bureau of Land Management to stop delaying enforcement of certain curbs on methane flaring — a disgusting waste of a natural resource we’re striving to conserve elsewhere — and foot-dragging at the EPA on application of a national ozone standard.\To be sure, states have banded together in past administrations to sue presidents and the agencies below them — or acted singly; EPA chief Scott Pruitt, as Oklahoma attorney general, filed 14 lawsuits against the outfit he now heads. So, too, have governors joined in coalitions to make regional progress at a pace faster than Washington is delivering.\In the Bush administration, a lot of the action was around initiatives to address global warming in the face of White House indifference, and Trump’s first year has been one of renewal for workaround endeavors.\Last October, the governors of California, New York and Washington established a U.S. Climate Alliance to develop and demonstrate ways for states to work on “reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement” without any involvement from Trump and Co. With the addition of Maryland this month, membership stands at 13 states (including Minnesota) and Puerto Rico.\California continues to expand a cap-and-trade policy for its economy — which, by some measures, is larger than all but five of the world’s national economies — and a nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the eastern U.S. is poised to extend its work through 2030.\Pushback of a different and significant kind has been rising just in the last month against the administration’s moves to reopen nearly all of the nation’s coastline to oil drilling over the next five years.\Barely had the announcement been made when Ryan Zinke, the Interior secretary, indicated that Florida’s coastline would be still be protected as a favor to the Republican governor, Rick Scott, which brought a complaint for equal treatment from New Jersey’s Republican governor, Chris Christie, which led to an Interior Department clarification that Florida wasn’t being exempted.\The fumbling wasn’t all that untypical, but the breadth of pushback has been, and has reached well into the Republican caucuses in Congress. From Griffin Connolly at Roll Call, reporting that northeastern lawmakers have “united across party lines to hazard against President Donald Trump’s offshore drilling plan”:\The risk of an oil spill off the Maine coast “far outweighs any potential benefit,” Sens. Susan Collins, a Republican, and Angus King, an independent, wrote to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Monday, citing the environmental fragility of the state’s $1.7 billion lobster fishing industry.\“We oppose any effort to open waters off the coast of Maine or any proximate area to offshore drilling, which could negatively affect the health of Maine’s fisheries and other coastal resources, threatening to harm not only the environment but the state’s economy as well,” King and Collins wrote.\Both House members from Maine, Republican Bruce Poliquin and Democrat Chellie Pingree, oppose lifting the coastal drilling moratorium protections. In Massachusetts, Sen. Ed Markey has pledged to “pursue all legislative tools available” to counter the Interior Department’s drilling plan.\Other opponents: Florida Sens. Marcio Rubio (R) and Bill Nelson (D), and a number of governors and Congress members from both parties in California, Oregon and Washington, including 37 U.S. senators ... Rhode Island’s Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. David Cicilline (both D) … Gov. Christie’s Democratic successor, Phil Murphy, along with New Jersey’s entire Congressional delegation … Georgia’s Republican Gov. Nathan Deal ….\Oh, and the Defense Department, because the U.S. Navy is accustomed to conducting regular military exercises in offshore drilling zones of the mid-Atlantic states, and apparently wasn’t consulted before the plan was rolled out.\Credit: Ron Meador"
26,"WASHINGTON - Mapping out a route to the White House, Gov. Tim Pawlenty appears headed for a fork in the road: One way goes through fiscally conservative New Hampshire, the other through socially conservative Iowa.\While he courts Republicans in both early primary states, keeping his options open, modern presidential history suggests Pawlenty will have to choose.\No nonincumbent GOP candidate has ever won the Iowa caucuses and the Granite State primary.\""These two electorates have gone in different directions,"" said University of New Hampshire political scientist Dante Scala.\With neighboring Iowa looking increasingly like Pawlenty's better bet in 2012, the Minnesota Republican has focused more of his attention and message on the Hawkeye State than on New Hampshire. He has visited Iowa twice in the past month, barnstorming for local candidates and grabbing headlines with rock-ribbed conservative pronouncements on immigration, gay marriage and the ground zero Islamic mosque proposed in New York.\As Pawlenty's poll numbers lag in the low single digits in both states, some strategists say he has little choice but to fire up his public profile. In Iowa, that means connecting solidly with social conservatives, ground he has cultivated assiduously in the year since he formed his Freedom First PAC, a national political organization.\""It's not just Iowa,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""He's also got to be thinking of South Carolina and Nevada. Three of the first four Republican electorates are very conservative socially.""\Pawlenty and his closest aides say there has been no political transformation, noting he always campaigned and governed as a conservative.\""I don't think there's a calculation in his effort to move to the right,"" said former Minnesota member of Congress Vin Weber, co-chairman of Pawlenty's PAC. ""He understands he's moving to another level in terms of national politics, and he wants to make sure people understand he has the bona fides of a conservative, which he does.""\Mr. Right\Pawlenty, for his part, says his bedrock conservative principles on issues like taxes and gay marriage have not changed and could appeal to social and fiscal conservatives in either state.\""I've always functioned as a conservative in a state that leans blue,"" he said Thursday in an interview. ""So I'm familiar with both kinds of environments.""\At the dawn of his legislative career in 1993, Pawlenty was among a small clutch of House Republicans who voted for the Human Rights Amendment, the first state legislation in the country to outlaw housing and employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.\By 2002, when he first ran for governor, Pawlenty reversed himself, calling it the only vote he regretted casting.\Recently, Pawlenty has raised eyebrows with a series of provocative assertions. The most quoted was his remark suggesting the proposed New York mosque would ""degrade or disrespect"" the memory of Sept. 11, 2001, a statement that drew a retraction demand from several Minnesota Muslim groups.\In Iowa last week, Pawlenty made news by saying voters have a right to oust three Iowa Supreme Court justices over a decision that legalized gay marriage. ""I would want to look at their records, but to the extent that they have opined or decided they are not going to support traditional marriage, that's not something I would agree with,"" he told the Associated Press.\On immigration, Pawlenty said Minnesota should consider making English its official language. He has also embraced efforts to change the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, a position that puts him to the right of Mike Huckabee, Iowa's 2008 GOP winner.\New emphasis\As he looks to 2012, Pawlenty will have more media platforms to opine from on a wider array of national topics than ever before. While some of his positions might sound new to national voters, others reflect new emphasis or elaborate on old topics.\He told CNN last April that he sympathized with Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants but was concerned about ""the definition of what is the probable cause to believe that somebody is here illegally.""\Pawlenty now defends the law fully, saying the problem has reached a ""boiling point."" Pawlenty said he has consistently taken a hard line on illegal immigration and supported the Arizona law almost from the outset, once he read it.\Pawlenty has more forcefully been accused of migrating on the superheated topic of climate change. Once a leading advocate of a regional cap-and-trade pact to control greenhouse gases, he has since come out against a national cap-and-trade plan proposed by Democrats in Congress. The St. Petersburg Times' PolitiFact website rated his stance ""a full flop.""\Pawlenty said that once he fully examined the national plan, he ""came to the conclusion it was a bad idea.""\Not going solo\If Pawlenty seems to burnish his conservative credentials, he's hardly the only one in a GOP party brimming with new Tea Party energy.\""Everyone's doing what seems to be the safe thing, which is run to the right,"" Scala said. That's particularly true for those Republicans with an eye on Iowa.\New Hampshire's Republican primary voters have shown a marked preference for more moderate GOP candidates, and in 2008 threw their support behind Sen. John McCain.\Pawlenty's path may be determined partly by potential rivals. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is a part-time resident of New Hampshire and a dominant political figure in that state. Huckabee and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin are cultural conservatives who poll well in Iowa.\Pawlenty advisers say Pawlenty can appeal to New Hampshire's flinty fiscal conservatives with his record of budget cuts. But in Iowa, he can throw in his evangelical Midwestern roots. Said Iowa GOP Party Chairman Matthew Strawn: ""The vast majority of Iowa Republican voters are social and fiscal conservatives.""\Kevin Diaz is a correspondent in the Star Tribune Washington Bureau.\Credit: KEVIN DIAZ; STAFF WRITER"
27," A key Senate committee found broad bipartisan support Tuesday for doing something about global warming, but deep divisions remained over how to curb the emissions that scientists think are causing the Earth to warm rapidly.\ ""A consensus is developing that we must take action at the federal level now,"" declared Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, who's presiding over her first hearing as the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\ In the House of Representatives, Democrats charged Tuesday that they'd found repeated instances in which the Bush administration had ordered changes to scientific studies to soften references to the cause and effect of global warming.\ Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said top administration officials had sought ""to mislead the public by injecting doubt into the science of global warming and minimizing the potential dangers.""\ Boxer said she'd try to steer the Senate committee toward enacting something like California's tough global-warming law, which requires lowering emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. But she acknowledged she was uncertain how far she'd get.\ Some of the more prominent advocates of global-warming legislation are candidates for the White House. Among those speaking at Tuesday's hearing were Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and New York Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.\ The hearing was limited to senators describing where they stood on the issue.\ The hearing was the first of many Boxer will hold before trying to craft a compromise bill. Several Republicans joined committee Democrats in calling for legislation.\ Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., addressed the Boxer hearing, invoking two Minnesota adventurers, Will Steger and Ann Bancroft, who on their expeditions have seen ""firsthand the effects of global warming.""\ In the House hearing, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., accused the Bush administration of leading ""an effort to suppress and distort the science of global warming.""\ How far and how fast Congress should go to reduce emissions from cars, power plants and industry remains an issue.\ Many Democrats and industry leaders favor ""cap-and-trade"" legislation, which would set tough federal emissions standards and allow companies to sell emissions credits when they fall below that standard and to buy credits when they exceed it.\ Others want to limit emissions reductions to power plants, which are responsible for about 40 percent of total U.S. emissions. That could invite a fight with states that rely heavily on coal-fired power plants or states that provide coal for them.\ Another issue is whether a uniform national standard should preempt tougher state laws, an issue that could divide California lawmakers if the deal Boxer cuts falls short of the state's standards.\ Klobuchar said she favors a limit on greenhouse-gas emissions, the ""cap-and-trade"" legislation and stronger standards for raising the amount of ethanol and biodiesel in fuel for vehicles, among other ideas.\ .\ Staff writer Brady Averill contributed to this report.\ Credit: McClatchy News Service"
28,"What is a moderate position on the climate crisis?\At CNN’s seven-hour Wednesday night climate crisis town hall, Democratic candidates had a chance to explain how exactly they would deal with changing temperatures, increasingly devastating environmental disasters and energy production priorities.\Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s position throughout the town hall was that we need to “do what the science tells us.” To do that, she proposed that she would prioritize achieving 100% net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and said that we need to limit warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.\But like much of the rest of her campaign, when it comes to the climate crisis, Klobuchar seemed aimed to stake out the middle ground: on fracking, on coal and on the cost of her plan.\\\Prior to the town hall, Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he would commit to a ban on fracking, the process of injecting liquid underground at high pressure to extract natural gas. Earlier that night during her town hall, Sen. Kamala Harris said the same: “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.”\Klobuchar was more hesitant after the moderator asked her stance. “I see natural gas as a transitional fuel. It is better than oil, but it’s not nearly as good as wind and solar,” she said.\Klobuchar said she would approve fracking permits on a case-by-case basis. And she has suggested the same approach to permitting in Minnesota for other projects that have environmental advocates worried about negative impacts.\In Minnesota, she’s walking a careful line, not taking a stance on two copper-nickel mining projects in northern Minnesota and not taking a stance on the Line 3 Pipeline, which some tribes have said could harm their access to rice farming and water.\On how to phase out coal, and the question of “if” nuclear should be phased out, Klobuchar also took a careful stance.\“What defines safe nuclear power and clean coal? Don’t they sound like oxymorons?” Liza Cohen, a student at Fordham University, asked Klobuchar.\Klobuchar said that she is in favor of maintaining nuclear, as it accounts for 20 percent of U.S. energy production, but that she would not expand it unless it could be done more safely. Similarly, she said she would not allow for the building of new coal plants, but if elected, would try to make the currently active plants better for the environment.\ How will you pay for it? \In the backdrop of Klobuchar’s climate plan, and everyone else’s, was the question of money: How do you pay for it? Klobuchar says hers would cost around between the “two trillion to three trillion range.”\“I only know how I’m going to get the funding, and I think you’ve got to be honest with people about how you’re going to get the money and what you’re going to spend it on, or it’s going to be really hard to bring along those people that we need to win in the middle of the country,” she said, implying that other climate plans, proposed by candidates like Sen. Sanders, are unrealistic.\Klobuchar said she’d pay for her plan by increasing the corporate tax rate and repealing parts of the Republican’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and with a carbon tax, which she described “cap-and-trade.” Both policies are different in that with a carbon tax, companies are charged for each ton of carbon they produce, and with cap-and-trade, companies are limited yearly in the amount of emissions they produce. Her climate plan does not specify which she would pursue.\“I want to be honest of what I think we can bring in,” she said.\Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the total cost of Klobuchar’s climate plan. She estimates it at $2-3 trillion."
29,"
North Dakota's beef about Minnesota's restrictions on electricity generated from coal together with California's new greenhouse gas cap-and-trade system illustrate a knotty economic question. How does a society decide issues in which some, but not all, people feel morally bound to take actions that may have immediate economic costs in return for uncertain benefits?
\
North Dakota has sued the State of Minnesota challenging our 2007 Next Generation Energy Act that limits utilities' ability to import electricity from new coal-fired plants in other states. North Dakota has enormous deposits of low-BTU coal that is not a competitive fuel source except for power plants located near the mines. It generates more than three times as much energy as the state itself uses, with much sold to Minnesota.
\
Minnesota's law, like California's new cap-and-trade system, is intended to reduce environmental harm from electricity generation. Such harm includes climate change from greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has become politically charged, to put it mildly.
\
The North Dakota attorney general, in arguing that the law represents unconstitutional meddling with interstate commerce, asserts that it will have little effect on global warming. This is true since other emitters are not cutting back and some, particularly in newly industrializing countries like China and India, are increasing emissions rapidly. This position is supported by economic theory that demonstrates people have little incentive to take some positive action when other ""free riders"" don't. This is an outcome of the game theory analysis that has come to play a major role in economics.
\
Economic theory also supports the argument that if one political jurisdiction, state or nation, takes some isolated action that increases the cost of a major input like electricity, businesses located there will face higher costs than their competitors in other areas that avoid similar actions. Output and employment will be lower than otherwise, as will cash incomes for residents.
\
If the area in question gains substantial non-monetary benefits, such as improved environmental quality for the current generation or their descendants, then the trade-off nevertheless may be a good one. But if the benefits are small, or most of them accrue to people elsewhere who make no current sacrifice, then the result is a lowering of the economic well-being of the group.
\
Yet many feel that climate change is a moral issue on which they must take a stand - by not only reducing emissions caused by their own consumption, but those of our society as a whole, even if that has a significant economic cost.
\
That sort of ""here I stand, I can do no other"" position is familiar to most people. Nearly everyone has some belief, some moral value, that supersedes any calculation of cost and benefit.
\
Unfortunately, such issues vary from one person to another. For one it may be the environment; for another, abortion; for a third, freedom from government intrusion; and so on.
\
Jeremy Bentham, the 19th-century philosopher, argued that public policies should result in ""the greatest good for the greatest number."" Humans, he said, make a ""hedonic calculus"" weighing the pleasure and pain derived from each alternative in life. The same should hold true for collective decisions that affect society as a whole. This approach became known as ""utilitarianism.""
\
Unfortunately, we cannot measure ""utility"" or human satisfaction in any objective quantifiable manner. And thus there is no way of knowing what set of policies produces the greatest satisfaction for society at any given juncture. Moreover, barring any dramatic breakthrough in neurology or psychology, perhaps we never will.
\
Yet society must somehow decide divisive issues on which people have deep moral convictions. It took a century for us to resolve slavery and the bloodiest war in our history. All subsequent issues, including abortion, women's rights and climate change, pale in comparison.
\
What is clear is that economic analysis is limited. Microeconomists like Nobel laureate Gary Becker and Gordon Tullock extended economic analysis to individual personal decisions like marrying or having children. Their insights are useful, even if the decisions are far more complex than Becker or Tullock admit. But when it comes to collective societal choices, economists cannot say much. We know that democracy is the best process for making such choices, but can add little beyond that.

30,"By Mackenzie Ryan, maryan@stcloudtimes.com\Advocates say one person can make a difference. One person's conscious decisions can protect the environment, reduce carbon emissions and help stop global warming.\Really? One person?\Think of it as the domino effect, said Sunita Karmacharya, an intern with the Minnesota Environmental Partnership who has changed her lifestyle to be more environmentally friendly. ""It has to start with one person,"" she said. ""If I can act but I don't, then by my inaction I cannot convince anyone else to do it.""\So we asked people with a desire to help the environment if there were everyday, low-cost things people could do. Here are some of the options:\1. Calculate your carbon footprint, or carbon emissions you produce each year. Compare it to what U.S. households on average produce, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Check it out at www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html.\2. Adjust your heat or air. Heating and cooling accounts for almost half of a home's typical energy usage, according to Xcel Energy. Turning heat down 2 or 3 degrees can decrease energy used - and save you a chunk of money. Each summer, if you raise your thermostat's temperature from 72 to 78 degrees, you can save about $100. Another option: Open a window.\3. Drive your car fewer days a week. You'll use less gas, saving money and carbon emissions. Leave your car at home two days a week and you'll cut greenhouse gas emissions about 1,590 pounds a year, the EPA says.\4. Buy used instead of new materials and goods. Producing new items and shipping them takes energy and fuel. Shop at secondhand stores.\5. Get involved. Expressing your views on the environment and how officials are addressing the issues is as simple as writing to them. ""People need to share their views politically. That's the avenue I feel we can make the most difference,"" said Jenny Bedell-Stiles of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership.\6. Learn the carbon emissions issue. The Global Warming Mitigation Act (search HF 375 or SF 192 at www.leg.state.mn.us) would set statewide goals to cut carbon emissions by 15 percent of a 2005 baseline by 2015, 30 percent by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050. It would require the Pollution Control Agency and the Department of Commerce to submit plans to cut emissions. It would establish a cap and trade system on emissions, and make a failure to carry out a requirement of the act a violation, allowing citizens to bring civil action.\7. Learn funding issues. Last year, Minnesota lawmakers passed a framework for cleaning up polluted waters, but not how to pay for it. This year, a proposal would fund the Clean Water Legacy bill, along with arts and habitat preservation, through a three-eighths percent state sales tax increase voters would have to approve. There are several versions of the plan, with and without funding for the arts. One proposal, seeming to lead the way, is the Dallas Sams Outdoor and Cultural Legacy Act (search SF 6). It proposes a state constitutional amendment to divide funds raised through the tax: 43 percent to protect and restore waterways and wetlands, 33 percent for wildlife habitat and restoration, and 24 percent for arts, arts education and art access.\8. Change your light bulbs to compact fluorescent bulbs. They use at least two-thirds less energy than standard incandescent bulbs, and can last up to 10 times longer. If you replace five of your most frequently used lights, it would cut more than 1 trillion pounds of greenhouse emissions.\9. Request paper bags instead of plastic. Plastic bags don't biodegrade. Go a step further: Bring your own reusable bag.\10. Buy locally grown food. It supports the local economy and cuts down fuel and carbon emissions of transporting food from far-off locations. Check out www.foodroutes.org for more ideas.\11. Cut down on meat. A 2006 United Nations report said livestock emits more greenhouse gas than transportation: About 18 percent of human-induced emissions are from livestock.\12. Start a compost bin. Estimates place food waste as high as 15 percent of household garbage. During winter months, a worm bin can be kept inside. ""I try to put all my compostable kitchen scraps in there, it ends up being quite a bit and it cuts back on the trash that I put out on the curb,"" said John Roberson of Monticello. He has both a compost and worm bin. Learn more at www.howtocompost.org.\13. Buy alternative energy. Learn more about buying wind power at www.xcelenergy.com. ""We purchase 100 percent wind power. On my bill of $189 for electricity use, it was $5 more expensive,"" said Peggy Scott-Lumbar, local organizer of Step it Up!, a national global warming campaign.\14. Google ""global warming."" More than 40 million links will come back, with the top sites being various government, nonprofit and advocacy organizations. There's plenty more to learn about the issue - and do.\15. Recycle. It takes 90 days for a recycled aluminum can to be reused, but put it in the trash and it survives up to 100 years. Throw away a plastic bottle and it stays 700 years. Trash glass? It'll stay 1 million years. Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to keep a 100-watt bulb burning almost four hours or your TV on for three hours."
31,"WIKILEAKS' ASSANGE\He does the impossible: sympathy for Palin, Visa\It has to be the irony of the year, maybe even the decade: WikiLeaks supporters are enraged about the attacks against their beloved Julian Assange (""WikiLeaks attacks and counterattacks take on an air of cyber war,"" Dec. 10). WikiLeaks supporters are now illegally launching counter attacks designed to disable the websites sites of those with whom they disagree.\So let me get this straight. Assange is asserting the right to free speech and, in the process, his supporters are working feverishly to cut off the same right to free speech for anyone opposed to them?\Hey, I'm no fan of Sarah Palin, but who do these people who illegally broke into her website and commit an act of online vandalism think they are? The same goes for Visa and MasterCard.\(Oh my God, they've made me feel sympathy for Palin, Visa and MasterCard. Trust me, they have really screwed up here).\Note to hacker ""Anonymous"" -- those of us who cheer on the rights of Assange and his WikiLeaks crew are quickly turning our backs on all of you.\We thought you were about transparency, free speech and doing the right thing. Turns out that instead of transparency, you are hiding behind anonymous online identities. Rather than supporting free speech, you are killing the freedom of others -- and acting like punks and thugs in the process.\PATRICK MILAN, EDINA\- - -\When the Bush administration decided that warrantless wiretapping was OK, privacy got thrown out the window.\Now it's being demanded for the documents on WikiLeaks.\When did privacy become a right of government and not of individuals?\PAUL OMAN, BROOKLYN CENTER\clean air act\Great achievements over the last 40 years\The Clean Air Act is turning 40 this year and in its lifetime it has made great achievements. It has reduced air pollution, which has alleviated an estimated 1.7 million asthma attacks nationally. The Clean Air Act is our greatest tool for protecting the air we breathe. So why then are there some U.S. senators trying to delay the authority of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the act?\I think it's because big oil and coal companies care more about their pocketbooks then ours (or our health). The EPA has proven that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are harmful to human health and should be regulated by the law. Once coal and oil lobbyists got wind of this, they pushed for a bill that would delay the EPA's authority to enforce the Clean Air Act.\The act has proven to be a cost-effective investment for the American people, saving us more than $22 trillion in health benefits in its first 20 years.\The EPA's job is to ensure that our air does not make us sick -- that is why the agency gets our tax dollars. It is not their job to make sure that big polluters make the most money possible.\KAITLIN FERDELMAN, CHAMPLIN\- - -\The Congressional House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming recently met for the last time (""House Republicans kill global warming committee,"" Dec. 1). Earlier this year, a bill that would have established a cap-and-trade market for carbon dioxide was defeated in the Senate. Things look grim for the environment.\But despite congressional setbacks, there are other actions that our government can take to ensure that we reduce our reliance on foreign oil, support green jobs as we compete with China's clean energy industry, and lower our greenhouse gas emissions.\As a member of the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, Minnesota has already begun a process that could lead to participation in a cap-and-trade system with a coalition of other states. On the federal level, the EPA has latitude to regulate greenhouse gases on behalf of public health. The United Nations Climate Change Summit is working toward brokering an international climate treaty. It's critical that our domestic opportunities to regulate greenhouse gases are supported.\Prioritize the regulation of greenhouse gases on the local, state and federal level. Let politicians know that you oppose any measures that weaken the EPA. And spread the word.\Setbacks in Congress shouldn't stop us from protecting Minnesota's future.\CHRISTINE O'CONNELL, MINNEAPOLIS\transit spending\New Legislature should scrutinize cost-benefit\Recent letter writers have bemoaned the possibility that the Republican-controlled Legislature may cut funding for mass transit projects, possibly including a train to Duluth and high-speed rail to Chicago.\When Amtrak took over passenger rail service from the railroads, it discontinued passenger service to Duluth due to its high cost and low ridership. What has changed in the interval since this decision was made that indicates that passenger rail service to Duluth would come even close to breaking even? Where are the projected ridership figures for high speed rail to Chicago? Would it even make a dent in airline traffic or automobile traffic between the two cities sufficient to justify the rather large capital expenditure?\I personally enjoy traveling by train and have taken several trips on Amtrak over the last few years. However, not every project that sounds like a good idea deserves to receive government funding. If the Legislature questions some of the mass transit proposals currently being considered, more power to them. We don't need to waste billions funding train systems or any other mass transit systems that relatively few people will ever use. But if it can be demonstrated that these projects would eventually pay for themselves without an ongoing subsidy by the taxpayers, I would be among the first to support them.\ROBERT SULLENTROP, MINNEAPOLIS"
32,"OBAMA VS. LINCOLN \No comparison \The June 13 Letter of the Day correctly concluded that Barack Obama's lack of experience might not be critical because Abraham Lincoln himself only had two years of congressional experience prior to his presidency. But the author overlooked three key differences between the men. \First, Lincoln was willing to fight, while Obama seems to want to surrender. Second, Lincoln was insightful, while Obama seems naive. (Just ask Bill Clinton how far talking to terrorists like Yasser Arafat got him!)

He calls for unity and creativity to ""wean us off carbon fuels."" \In the same issue of the paper, U.S. Rep.

Bachmann's commentary on cap-and-trade legislation would be humorous if it were not so offending in its assertions. \She first refers to the Heritage Foundation as ""nonpartisan,"" despite the statement on its website that its ""mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies."" \She then states that global warming and cap-and-trade are nothing but hype with little hard-nosed analysis. I guess she has missed the thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies supporting the science of global warming, and the support of major scientific organizations, such as the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \She might have gathered her information from the oil industry-funded Competitive Enterprise Institute and the National Center for Policy Analysis, the industry-sponsored entities often quoted by global-warming doubters. \It is a shame that Bachmann continues to support the interests of the oil industry instead of those of her constituents. \THOMAS ARCH, LINO LAKES \. \HABEAS CORPUS RESTORED \A win for justice \Thursday's Supreme Court decision restoring habeas corpus rights to Guantanamo detainees may be the most important ruling in our lifetimes. \The unconstitutional Military Commissions Act had allowed the president to designate anyone an ""enemy combatant"" and to detain them indefinitely without ever defending that accusation in court. This shifted power from the judicial branch to military tribunals that fall under the executive branch. \In his drive to increase presidential power, Bush has subverted fundamental principles of our Constitution. Our founders understood habeas corpus to be critical to the balance between state power and individual liberty. In this decision the court has not only defended freedom against Bush's overreaching, but also has moved toward restoring the tripartite balance of governmental powers set forth in our constitution. \THOMAS E. NOERPER, MINNEAPOLIS \. \Roll out the red carpet \Now foreign terrorists have been afforded certain rights under the Constitution, thanks to our liberal Supreme Court. Should we now post signs at our airports saying: ""Welcome, terrorists! Attack at will without fear of punishment while under the protection of Constitutional rights."" \MICHAEL GEORGE, BEMIDJI, MINN. \. \LETTER OF THE DAY: MSOP isn't serving anyone well \Minnesota's practice of labeling sexual predators as mentally ill debases both our commitment law and the scope of ethical medical and psychiatric practice. \Civil commitment laws are designed to treat patients who are sick and to protect society while they are sick. That's why years ago we wisely stopped committing mentally ill people indefinitely to mental institutions. \However, in recent years, Minnesota has chosen to use our compassionate civil commitment laws to put away socially undesirable sex offenders. Although many clients in the Minnesota Sex Offender Program (MSOP) have or have had mental illness and/or drug addictions, committing them as mentally ill or as having ""personality disorder"" reminds me of the ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" character McMurphy, who was neither committable nor in need of psychiatric treatment. \Studies show a very limited effectiveness for using psychotherapy or medications to prevent reoccurrence of sexual violence in such clients. Such efforts have merit. But violent offenders, victims and society all deserve better. Our policymakers are understandably reluctant, for political reasons, to let them out of their current psychiatric prisons. One reoccurrence is one too many. \Compare this to goals and standards of care for bona fide medical conditions -- including mental and addictive disorders: patient-centered treatment, rehabilitation, social supports and a mainstream life in the community to the extent possible. \Pretending that most sex offenders are really patients diverts money and resources from application of evidence-based treatments for mental and addictive disorders. Criminal sex offenders need to be managed in the corrections system rather than in the health-care system. That said, it is shamefully true that jails and prisons are currently overused and not the right venue for mentally ill patients needing psychiatric care. \And yes, Minnesota needs specialized psychiatric hospitals for patients who are mentally ill and dangerous. But we need to rescind mistaken legal notions of ""patienthood"" for most predatory sex offenders in the system. \LEE BEECHER, MAPLE GROVE; PSYCHIATRIST"
33,"Money may not grow on trees – but the carbon that trees store could be worth millions, as consumers, companies and governments ramp up efforts to fight climate change.\Earlier this week, a group of land managers and scientists from around Minnesota came together in Duluth to start a conversation about how the state can join in the growing marketplace that pays to keep carbon sequestered in forests.\Minnesota's climate change-fighting efforts have focused largely on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by moving away from coal power and toward cleaner energy like wind and solar.\But there's been a lot less focus on the other side of the carbon equation: What to do with those greenhouse gases that continue to be emitted into the atmosphere, the heat-trapping culprits that cause global warming?\California is one of the few states that has taken the lead on incentivizing practices that lead to carbon sequestration, and established an official statewide cap and trade system in 2013. Dozens of forestry projects around the country are part of the program, including many on tribal lands.\But none of the carbon sequestration projects that are involved in California's marketplace are based in Minnesota – at least, not yet. The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe is exploring the possibility of creating a forest carbon offset program on 14,000 acres of its reservation in northern Minnesota, and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is exploring a 9,000-acre program on its land near Cloquet.\The idea is that polluters in California or elsewhere could then purchase offsets from those programs, as a way to counterbalance their own greenhouse gas emissions.\In Minnesota, land managers and forestry experts are looking for ways to encourage landowners to manage their forests in such a way that sucks more carbon out of the atmosphere.\""We have a tremendous opportunity right now, to unleash the power of nature, and help us get into a problem solving mode with climate change,"" said Meredith Cornett, director of conservation science with the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which has led some peer-reviewed research on the role of plants in the fight against climate change.\It comes down to Biology 101: Through photosynthesis, plants breathe in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen.\That's important, because carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to climate change.\Trees, especially, are capable of storing massive amounts of carbon. The Nature Conservancy's research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, found that nature could deliver more than a third of all the greenhouse gas reductions that scientists say are necessary to prevent the most severe effects of climate change — targets laid out in the recent Paris climate agreement.\""These solutions are very economical. They're things we already know how to do, and if we start doing more of them at scale – forest management, grassland restoration, cover crops – then we can turn the ship,"" said Cornett.\Cap and trade systems like California's can provide the economic incentive to drive more of these so-called ""natural climate solutions.""\Here's how California's program works: Large emitters of greenhouse gases – mainly power companies and large industrial facilities – are assigned a cap, an emissions limit they can't go over.\If companies emit greenhouse gases beyond their cap, they have two options: They can buy carbon credits from companies whose emissions are under their set cap; or they can purchase carbon offsets – investments in things like forestry projects that sequester carbon. It's similar to buying carbon offsets for air travel – a way to make up for the carbon they're emitting.\The idea is to create a market incentive to encourage forest landowners to alter their practices, to manage their land not just to maximize profit, but to store more carbon than they would in a ""business as usual"" situation.\Outside Minnesota, carbon offsets have been big money-makers for some tribes. The Passamaquoddy Tribe in Maine expects to earn around $40 million in carbon offsets on a project that protects 90,000 acres of land.\""In my opinion, we're starting to see a big influx of tribal nations exploring these opportunities because they can be significant revenue generators for the tribes themselves,"" said Bryan Van Stippen, who works for the Minnesota-based National Indian Carbon Coalition, which is consulting with both the Fond du Lac and Leech Lake bands as they explore the possibilities of carbon sequestration.\The only large-scale carbon offset program that exists in Minnesota now is run by the Blandin Paper Company. It covers about 175,000 acres of Blandin-owned forest near Grand Rapids in north-central Minnesota.\The 20-year project is expected to keep about 3.6 million tons of carbon dioxide sequestered in trees. That's the equivalent of taking about 760,000 cars off the road for a year.\To do that, Blandin won't forego harvesting trees. Rather, said Blandin forest ecologist Sawyer Scherer, the company sequesters additional carbon by taking a more ecological approach to forestry.\""The most simple way to think about this is, if we leave trees out there longer, they're storing the carbon longer, and result in a net increase in carbon storage,"" said Scherer.\Blandin will also selectively cut trees, rather than clear-cutting them, which is typical practice, and will plant a mix of longer-lived tree species, which soak up more carbon before they're harvested.\But that kind of forest management is expensive. And that's where the carbon offsets factor in. They give landowners like Blandin added incentive to do what's right for the environment, by paying them to do it.\To try to encourage more Minnesota landowners to follow Blandin's lead, Chris Wright, an ecologist with the University of Minnesota Duluth's Natural Resources Research Institute, convened a discussion of different stakeholders earlier this week in Duluth, that he described as a conversation starter.\Wright plans to develop a web-based tool to allow forest managers to estimate the amount of carbon they could potentially capture on their lands, to help them decide whether it makes sense to enter the offset market. But additional projects in Minnesota will likely take several months, if not years, to develop.\Still, Wright expects more to do so as landowners increasingly realize that by making relatively minor changes to the ways they manage their forests, they can store more carbon, earn more money and build up the additional ecosystem benefits that healthy forests provide, like clean water and wildlife habitat.\CREDIT: Dan Kraker"
34,"Greenhouse gases are trapping heat in our atmosphere and warming the planet at an alarming rate. Climate scientists believe if we don't respond appropriately in the next decade or so, global warming will cause oceans to rise, disease to spread, droughts to prolong, storms and wildfires to intensify, and scores of species to go extinct.\The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, however, foresees a different apocalyptic vision: a future in which American businesses are forced to do their part to help avert the crisis.\The Chamber has turned up the heat on itself in recent months by making a series of statements aimed at killing a bipartisan effort to pass climate-change legislation in Congress. And the Chamber's extreme position is drawing criticism by its members, from such global giants as Nike and Apple to a few local Minnesota firms that spoke out at a media event earlier this week.\The comment that ignited the firestorm came in August from the Chamber's vice president for environmental regulation, who called for a sort of ""Scopes monkey trial"" for global warming science. (The Chamber later tried to take back the comment.) As the Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times and others have reported, the Chamber has called greenhouse-gas regulation ""a job killer"" that would ""completely shut the country down"" and ""virtually destroy the United States.""\Arguing that a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program would ""destroy"" or ""shut the country down"" is no less off-base than the recent claims about health reform resulting in government-run death panels. It assumes Americans have zero ability to innovate or adapt, and it ignores the costs of doing nothing. (And, by the way, that public trial? It already happened. It's called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and you can read its latest report here.)\The Chamber's attacks have cost it high-profile members and raised questions about how broadly the organization actually represents the views of businesses. Apple, Levi Strauss and the nation's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, have dropped their memberships. Nike resigned its seat from the board of directors, and other firms, including Microsoft, Toyota and Johnson & Johnson have publicly stated their disagreement.\On Wednesday, Clean Water Action attempted to show similar dissent among Minnesota business leaders. The environmental group organized a teleconference for reporters featuring three past or present local chamber members who favor federal climate-change legislation, though none packed the star power of a Nike or Apple. They were Doug Pierce, a senior architect with Perkins and Will in Minneapolis; Dave Danielsen of Conservation Technologies in Duluth; and Tom Gegax, an investor and business consultant who co-founded Tires Plus in 1978.\""Clinging to the status quo kills economies,"" Pierce said. Energy-efficient buildings are a key part of Perkins and Will's business, and Pierce said clean-energy legislation can help advance Minnesota's economy and position the United States as a leader.\But if there's a serious rift on climate change among Minnesota chamber members, however, it hasn't reached Bill Blazar's office. ""What we're hearing from our members is pretty simple: We want to reduce emissions without costing the state jobs,"" said Blazar, the group's public affairs and business development director.\Climate change isn't a top-three priority among members, he said, and those who do rank it as a priority don't see regulation as the best solution. The answer, in their view: building new nuclear power plants in Minnesota and finding ways to award and assist companies that voluntarily reduce emissions.\He wouldn't answer a question about whether the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce accepts that global warming is real and human-caused. Instead, he said members accept that they should find ways to voluntarily reduce emissions. He cited the Chamber's Waste Wise and Energy Smart programs.\""Those are two pretty significant initiatives that are well under way and didn't require anyone to pass a law,"" Blazar said. ""We don't need any more mandates or laws telling people to do it.""\What climate-change legislation would the Minnesota Chamber support? Blazar said they support repealing the state's ban on nuclear power plant construction and changing the state's definition of renewable energy to include large-scale hydro-power projects.\The Minnesota Chamber is an independent member of the U.S. Chamber. The national organization doesn't necessarily speak for the local organizations, but Blazar praised the U.S. Chamber's approach on climate change, saying that cap-and-trade regulation needs to include China and India.\""Let's lower our emissions, but let's do it in a way that actually reduces emissions and does not hurt the economy and maybe even makes it better off,"" Blazar said. ""We're going to pursue that path and hope that the federal government doesn't get in the way.""\Getting in the way, however, doesn't necessarily mean grinding the country's economy to a halt. Sweden is the best example of this. The country has taxed fossil fuels to encourage the use of cleaner, renewable fuels. Between 1990 and 2006, the country's emissions fell almost 9 percent while its economy grew 44 percent. Will Steger, speaking at a green business conference Thursday at the Mall of America, noted that many of the new jobs in Sweden have come in renewable industries, such as bioenergy.\Jenna Garland, a climate-change campaign organizer with Clean Water Action, says the Chamber doesn't represent all businesses. ""Clearly, these businesses leaving the Chamber or stating publicly that they support climate legislation indicates that the Chamber's position is not representative of its membership,"" Garland said.\Aveda, the eco-conscious salon and beauty-supply brand based in Blaine, was invited but unable to participate in the teleconference this week. In an interview, Chuck Bennett, Aveda's vice president of earth and community care, said the brand, a subsidiary of Estee Lauder, hasn't taken any official stance on the Chamber's statements.\However, Aveda's support for the 2007 renewable-energy standard passed by the Minnesota Legislature can be seen as reflective of the company's values, Bennett said. Aveda supports aggressive action on climate change, he said, but its efforts are typically more focused on business practices than legislation.\Gegax is a past Chamber member who served as chairman and chief executive of Tires Plus for 24 years before selling the company in 2000. His split with the Chamber came shortly after that, when he resigned from the Minnesota Chamber's environmental policy committee after serving just a few months. He hasn't been a member since.\""I called it the anti-environmental policy committee,"" Gegax said.\He quit after clashing with other members who were more interested in blocking environmental measures, he said, though he couldn't recall specific examples of disagreements. ""I had many people come up to me and say, 'I feel the way you do, but I can't risk [speaking out].' There's a lot of peer pressure,"" he said.\Now, as then, he believes the Chamber's official positions do not reflect the views of business owners as a whole.\""Typically, it's: 'Let's not bother our economic engine for things that could be positive for the environment,' and I disagree with that.""\Credit: Dan Haugen"
35,"Gov. Tim Pawlenty poked not just Minnesota's environment in the eye, but countless residents and even the Department of Natural Resources this month when he rejected proposed updates to Minnesota's shoreland development rules.\After years of scientific study, dozens of public meetings and solutions built on feedback from all sides of this development debate, the DNR was set to begin final public hearings on changes to rules not updated in 21 years.\Instead, Pawlenty claimed the ideas usurped local control, were too restrictive on property owners and amounted to a ""one-size-fits-all"" statewide plan.\Never mind that it was a legislatively mandated plan supported by a wealth of scientific research and public testimony. Or that most local governments simply can't say no to lucrative shoreland development regardless of impacts on the environment.\As for one-size-fits all, remember, it's 115 pages and still could have been tweaked in public hearings. Even if it is too broad, implementing some changes sooner and letting the courts sort out the rest later is probably better for shoreland than the current here's-your-variance mentality.\Motivations?\While some claim Pawlenty acted to protect those who have trampled local controls to build their ""up north"" mansions, we see his rejection more in keeping with his presidential ambitions and building a conservative base.\Remember, just last year he flip-flopped from a governor supportive of reducing carbon emissions (see his self-congratulatory approval in 2007 of Minnesota's Next Generation Energy Act) to one who opposes all things cap-and-trade.\Now he rejects much-needed, common-sense shoreland protections by citing property rights and local control, which, of course, also lets him pass solving the problem to the next governor and Legislature.\See also GAMC, education funding, state budget deficit, etc.\What's next?\Pawlenty's order to the DNR was to basically start over.\That's an idea we believe most Minnesotans do not support in part because tax dollars might be used to do additional research when there is nothing scientifically wrong with this research.\A better solution would be to put the whole issue aside until Minnesota elects a new governor and Legislature. Let those leaders determine what can be salvaged from this multiyear effort and then request the DNR fast-track a new set of proposals for public comment and passage.\Even those recommendations won't draw unanimous support, but much like those Pawlenty rejected, they will have some commonalities that can be applied so that Minnesota shoreland can be developed in ways that at least give Mother Nature a seat at the table."
36,"CLIMATE CHANGE |\By now you should know what Exxon knew and when it knew it. Based on reporting by the Los Angeles Times, Inside Climate News, and the Energy and Environment Reporting Project at Columbia University, it's clear that Exxon's own scientists had confirmed by the late 1980s the serious problem of global warming caused by carbon emissions, but the company in public chose to ""emphasize the uncertainty."" Even the Dallas Morning News, Exxon's hometown newspaper, reported thoroughly on the scandal this week.\As a member of the Star Tribune Editorial Board during the 1990s, I received reports from the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) and the World Climate Report, edited by Patrick Michaels, then the state climatologist of Virginia, now at the Cato Institute. Filled with information, charts and graphs that debunked or questioned other scientists' work, the reports pointed out contrary ""evidence"" and mocked the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 by the United Nations to develop the best science to help governments and the public respond.\I read those critical documents seriously, as my job was to render what the science was saying into fact-based recommendations for readers to evaluate.\I was horrified, therefore, to discover soon enough that the GCC and the World Climate Report were not legitimate scientific bodies, but Potemkin villages of partisans funded by the fossil-fuel industry and, at the time, the auto industry, to market misleading information in order to slow public understanding that fossil-fuel emissions cause climate change. Exxon was a charter member of the GCC and among the corporations that supported it the longest. (The GCC collapsed in 2002.)\Some are calling for a criminal investigation of Exxon. I doubt that lying to the public is a crime, though Exxon may have had a legal obligation to shareholders to report on risks to its business model.\But defending one's business against threats is what businesses generally do. We expect that. What we do not expect, nor should we condone, is public propaganda. And that is what this was -- a Goebbels-style campaign of public deception, one that proved shockingly effective at stalling significant climate action until, as is widely expected, global climate accords are signed in Paris this December, 25 years later.\What should Exxon have done? Pointed out that fossil fuels are a global market, with Saudi Arabia's hand on the spigot, and that constraining carbon emissions requires a global solution. That would have meant supporting the deliberations and conclusions of the IPCC and endorsing carbon cap and trade, or carbon fee and dividend, with border tariff adjustments to avoid exporting carbon pollution, instead of undermining those policies in public and behind the political curtain.\The good news, and it is good, is that current CEO Rex Tillerson has publicly endorsed a carbon tax, or fee, saying in 2009 that ""a carbon tax is also the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions -- from investments made by companies to fuel their requirements to the product choices made by consumers.""\He is right. Now the public has a right to expect that, in private as well as in public, Exxon will support the politics as well as the policies to bring about such a tax or fee, to efficiently bend the curve of carbon pollution away from climate calamity and turn Exxon toward becoming a global energy, not just a fossil energy, company.\James P.

37,"The McKnight Foundation is announcing today that it will spend an unprecedented $100 million over the next five years to attack global warming worldwide. \The state's largest private foundation, McKnight is joining forces with other large U.S. foundations, including the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, in pledging more than $1 billion to prevent climate change. \McKnight's President Kate Wolford said the highly coordinated strategy among foundations is unique, but that's what is needed. \She called climate change an ""extraordinary challenge"" that must be addressed within the next decade to prevent irrevocable harm to the planet. ""Without immediate action, climate change will put at risk all those served by our programs,"" she said. \In 2008 the foundation provided $99 million from its $1.6 billion endowment for a variety of programs, including the arts, housing, children and families, sustainable agriculture and the environment. About 70 percent of McKnight grants in 2008 went to Minnesota organizations. \Wolford said the foundation will distribute the same amount of money in 2009. However, some programs will receive smaller grants because McKnight focuses $20 million annually on climate change. The change represents a dramatic ""ramping up"" internationally of programs originally developed in the Midwest, she said. The foundation is not seeking applications from those who might desire grants; it has committed most of the money to two foundations working on climate change policy and strategy. \About $5 million a year is going to the Energy Foundation, a grant-maker that has received McKnight money to develop renewable and sustainable energy policies in the Midwest that do not rely on coal and other fossil fuels. \Much of the rest will go to the new ClimateWorks Foundation, which has coalitions in several countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. ClimateWorks is a network of international philanthropists, policy and clean technology experts. Their goals are to stop building new sources of carbon emissions, to promote a carbon cap and trade system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S., and to help establish an international system to reduce global warming gases. \""It definitely is not about sending American experts overseas,"" said Energy Foundation president Eric Heitz. ""It recognizes that the problem is international and that the best minds of the U.S. and China and India and Europe and other places have to work on it,"" he said. That includes pooling international expertise so that countries can develop their own strategic plans, he said. Those could include policies that encourage energy conservation, more efficient appliances, cleaner fuels, preservation of tropical forests, and renewable energy requirements for utilities that sell electricity. \Michael Noble, executive director for St. Paul-based Fresh Energy, said that McKnight has realized that global warming is an overarching problem that jeopardizes goals that the foundation's programs have funded for decades: housing and health, water quality, natural resources, and health of ecosystems. \""Even though a lot of attention is rightfully focused on how we can get our economy straightened out, the solutions have to be low-carbon, clean energy, and innovative solutions that we can grow our economy without damaging the environment,"" Noble said. Fresh Energy receives about 20 percent of its budget from McKnight grants. \Wolford said that the scale of the commitments is what is needed to prompt action on multiple fronts for an urgent problem. ""It's not only the right thing to invest in, but now is exactly the time when we should make this commitment,"" she said. \Tom Meersman - 612-673-7388"
38,"""The economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment, not the other way around.""\Gaylord Nelson first uttered those bits of wisdom more than 40 years ago at the dawn of environmental consciousness. It was the Wisconsin senator's way of reminding his fellow politicians about the interrelated nature of economics, the environment, demographics, health, land use, transportation and energy, segments that were (and still are) parts of a single thread.\Minnesota responded to this idea in 1973 by launching the Environmental Quality Board. The EQB was envisioned as an independent, nonpartisan arm of state government that would investigate issues that overlapped the purview of regular departments. The intention was to take a longer, wider view, thereby guiding the state toward wiser policy decisions. Possible intertwined topics laid out in the founding legislation included demographic trends, settlement patterns, air and water quality, transportation needs and utility corridors. In today's parlance, the EQB was designed to help make the state sustainable, smart and competitive.\It never really worked out. If the agency reached a peak, it was in the 1980s and '90s, when its research led to better protection from pesticides for farm drinking-water supplies and new building practices and codes that cities now routinely describe as ""green."" But it took a pass in 1998 on what's now called climate change, the alarming rise in atmospheric carbon that scientists have been tracking since the 1950s.\By the 2000s, a number of factors -- including interagency turf battles, a shift in political ideology and a series of budget crises -- led to the EQB's dilution and the breakup of its parent agency, Minnesota Planning. Legislative leaders at the time went so far as to describe planning as a luxury that the state could no longer afford. Some even argued that planning, while fine for individuals and private companies, was an overreach for government.\Actually, planning's value is highest in moments of fiscal crisis. And responsible governments always strive to anticipate complex problems. Indeed, the best governments use proactive investigations (planning) to drive efficient responses.\Fortunately that view is again on the upswing, and the EQB, while still on life support, shows signs of resuscitation. Gov. Mark Dayton has challenged the agency to prove its potential. The Legislature last month increased the agency's tiny budget from $150,000 to, effectively, more than $700,000. While its full-time staff remains at two (down from 30), there's a move afoot to hire a full-time director and relaunch the EQB (perhaps by another name) as an independent, nonpartisan investigator of cross-jurisdictional problems.\Climate change and water management are likely targets, each topic having been drawn from a series of well-attended listening sessions held around the state last fall and an environmental ""congress"" held in March. Minnesotans are apparently curious about how the state intends to meet its ambitious greenhouse gas targets (reducing carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050). And they would like assurance that the state's top competitive asset (water) can be protected and improved, both in quantity and quality.\Those issues pose multidimensional challenges that are central to Minnesota's prospects for economic growth and quality of life in the coming decades. A truly independent evaluation and road map would greatly benefit policymakers, especially in a sharply partisan world that seems to run on short-term thinking and to value spin over facts.\New York, Maryland, Arizona and Massachusetts are among the states trying to overcome all of that by taking a more strategic approach. Whether a Minnesota agency could become a reliable custodian of the facts, and whether those facts could drive sensible, effective, efficient policies, might be a long shot given today's political realities. But this state is a more thoughtful, mature, collaborative place than it was a decade ago. Maybe an EQB revival is worth a try.\Cross-jurisdictional topics that a new EQB could address to prepare the state for climate change: Building codes, energy conservation, carbon emission reductions, renewable energy, transit-bicycle-pedestrian investments, efficient land use, efficient electricity transmission lines, pay-as-you-drive pricing, farm drainage practices, cap and trade programs.\From the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group Final Report, April 2008."
39,"
Pope Francis is one of the world's most inspiring figures. There are passages in his new encyclical on the environment that beautifully place human beings within the seamless garment of life. And yet overall the encyclical is surprisingly disappointing.
\
Legitimate warnings about the perils of global warming morph into 1970s-style doom-mongering about technological civilization. There are too many overdrawn statements like ""The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.""
\
Hardest to accept, though, is the moral premise implied throughout the encyclical: that the only legitimate human relationships are based on compassion, harmony and love, and that arrangements based on self-interest and competition are inherently destructive.
\
The pope has a section on work in the encyclical. The section's heroes are St. Francis of Assisi and monks -- emblems of selfless love who seek to return, the pope says, to a state of ""original innocence.""
\
He is relentlessly negative, on the other hand, when describing institutions in which people compete for political power or economic gain. At one point he links self-interest with violence. He comes out against technological advances that will improve productivity by replacing human work. He specifically condemns market-based mechanisms to solve environmental problems, even though these cap-and-trade programs are up and running in places like California.
\
Moral realists, including Catholic ones, should be able to worship and emulate a God of perfect love and still appreciate systems, like democracy and capitalism, that harness self-interest. But Francis doesn't seem to have practical strategies for a fallen world. He neglects the obvious truth that the qualities that do harm can often, when carefully directed, do enormous good. Within marriage, lust can lead to childbearing. Within a regulated market, greed can lead to entrepreneurship and economic innovation. Within a constitution, the desire for fame can lead to political greatness.
\
You would never know from the encyclical that we are living through the greatest reduction in poverty in human history. A raw and rugged capitalism in Asia has led, ironically, to a great expansion of the middle class and great gains in human dignity.
\
You would never know that in many parts of the world, like the United States, the rivers and skies are getting cleaner. The race for riches, ironically, produces the wealth that can be used to clean the environment.
\
A few years ago, a team of researchers led by Daniel Esty of Yale looked at the environmental health of 150 countries. The nations with higher income per capita had better environmental ratings. As countries get richer, they invest to tackle environmental problems that directly kill human beings (though they don't necessarily tackle problems that despoil the natural commons).
\
You would never suspect, from this encyclical, that over the last decade, one of the most castigated industries has, ironically, produced some of the most important economic and environmental gains. I'm talking of course about fracking.
\
There was recently a vogue for polemical antifracking documentaries like ""Gasland"" that purport to show that fracking is causing flammable tap water and other horrors.
\
But a recent Environmental Protection Agency study found that there was no evidence that fracking was causing widespread harm to the nation's water supply. On the contrary, there's some evidence that fracking is a net environmental plus.
\
That's because cheap natural gas from fracking displaces coal. A study by the Breakthrough Institute found coal-powered electricity declined to 37 percent from 50 percent of the generation mix between 2007 and 2012. Because natural gas has half as much global-warming potential as coal, energy-related carbon emissions have declined more in the U.S. than in any other country over that time.
\
Fracking has also been an enormous boon to the nation's wealth and the well-being of its people. In a new report called ""America's Unconventional Energy Opportunity,"" Michael E. Porter, David S. Gee and Gregory J. Pope conclude that gas and oil resources extracted through fracking have already added more than $430 billion to annual gross domestic product and supported more than 2.7 million jobs that pay, on average, twice the median U.S. salary.
\
Pope Francis is a wonderful example of how to be a truly good person. But if we had followed his line of analysis, neither the Asian economic miracle nor the technology-based American energy revolution would have happened. There'd be no awareness that though industrialization can lead to catastrophic pollution in the short term (China), over the long haul both people and nature are better off with technological progress, growth and regulated affluence.

The innocence of the dove has to be accompanied by the wisdom of the serpent -- the awareness that programs based on the purity of the heart backfire; the irony that the best social programs harvest the low but steady motivations of people as they actually are.

40,"WASHINGTON -- Minnesota doesn't have a pure ""toss-up"" House race this fall, instead a smattering of races where one can see a path to victory for challengers who will go into Election Day as decided underdogs. It wouldn't surprise me at all if we all woke up on Wednesday with two or three new members of Congress, but every incumbent is favored as voters go to the ballot box.\With that in mind, here's a look at what to watch for in the House races.\Tier One: Challenger favored\None.\Tier Two: Pure Toss-up\None.\Tier Three: Incumbents favored, but challengers competitive\1st District, Tim Walz (D) vs. Randy Demmer (R): It has become almost an article of faith among Republican campaign strategists that Walz snuck up on Gil Gutknecht in 2006, that Gutknecht wasn't paying enough attention to his race until it was too late. Walz, in that race, didn't have the money Gutknecht had, but was able to mount an intelligent campaign and, aided by a Democratic wind at his back, knocked off the Republican incumbent.\In the 1st District, that story is most often told by Republicans. This time, they say, the wind is at their backs. Like in 2006, they have a well-funded candidate running a solid campaign. The difference, as Democrats are happy to counter, is that Walz has been acting like he's got a race on his hands since before state Rep. Randy Demmer was the choice to face him.\The 1st is the GOP's best hope for an upset in Minnesota. Demmer is on the highest tier of the GOP's Young Guns ladder, which identifies the best and brightest candidates from across the nation. Republicans poured money in here, forcing Democrats to follow with a cash infusion of their own and now more than $1 million has been spent by outside groups on ads here this cycle.\This was not a race on most people's radar at the end of 2008. Walz had just beaten Republican Brian Davis by 30 points in an absolute landslide. 2010 is a different story -- the latest polls show Walz leading, though Demmer is close behind. Three weeks ago, Walz led by five. Last week he led by nine.\Walz and Demmer have both sought to play up their strengths on health care, particularly their ties to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. The city and its suburbs comprise the largest population center in the 1st, and it has become the prime battle ground in this race.\As he's fond of reminding whenever the topic comes up, Walz was on the phone with the Mayo Clinic the morning of the final vote on the health care bill. He, along with Betty McCollum, met with Speaker Nancy Pelosi to ensure that some quality of care metric would be added to Medicare reimbursement rates, a provision Mayo has long advocated for.\Walz leads in donations from people associated with the Mayo Clinic, according to federal campaign finance records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Mayo workers gave Walz $31,450, by far the most he got from any firm's employees. Demmer, in contrast, took in $3,300 from people associated with Mayo.\Demmer, whose state house district covers much of the Rochester suburbs, including communities where a majority of people are employed by or because of the renowned Mayo Clinic, credits Walz for that outreach to the world-famous hospital system -- though he's clear he would have ultimately voted no on the health care bill. Asked earlier this year about Walz's perceived closeness to Mayo, Demmer listed Mayo executives whose cell phone numbers he had -- and would have called before just such a vote.\Walz's home, meanwhile, is the central point of his district, Mankato. West of there, as far as the eye can see, and a little bit more, is rural farm land that stretches from the edges of the Rochester metro almost uninterrupted across the state to the South Dakota border.\Walz has a seat on the Agriculture Committee, a big plus in a district that, by area, is mostly rural farmland. Aiming to blunt that advantage, House Minority Leader John Boehner promised Demmer that committee slot if he wins. Demmer has also attacked Walz over his vote for the carbon cap-and-trade bill that cleared the House but stalled in the Senate, saying it would hurt agriculture.\Back to those polls referenced earlier. In each of them, gubernatorial candidates Mark Dayton and Tom Emmer are running about evenly, so if Walz is to win he'll have to outgain the top of his ticket, as he did in 2006 and 2008. Watch the early returns -- doesn't matter from what part of this district -- to see if Walz is outdistancing Dayton, and by how much. Any percentage to the positive should be a good sign.\Republicans can take the House without winning a single seat in Minnesota, but if they're having a really great night this is the first seat you'll see it in. While Walz goes into Election Day the favorite on analysts' scoreboards, Demmer is in with a real chance.\8th District, Jim Oberstar (D) vs. Chip Cravaack (R): Jim Oberstar has been representing the 8th District of Minnesota longer than Chip Cravaack has been living in it. Usually he coasts to victory on Election Day, with vote percentages in the 60s. The last big challenge Oberstar fended off was from Rod Grams in 2006 -- and he won that by 19 points.\The turning point in this race came on Oct. 4, when Cravaack released an internal poll showing him down just three points. I haven't seen a public poll of the race yet, but every major election handicapper now lists it as competitive -- some placing it alongside the 1st as Minnesota's most competitive district.\""I'm not a big fan of 'own' polls, so Cravaack's survey kind of set off my skeptical meter,"" said Bob Benenson, senior elections analyst for CQ Weekly in Washington (CQ rates MN-08 as Likely Democrat). ""But who knows... I'm the one who keeps warning people to look out for out-of-nowhere surprises on Nov. 2. Complacency kills in this kind of political environment.""\Since then, the drumbeat of headlines has trended toward Cravaack, though the Oberstar camp has contested them vigorously. POLITICO on Oct. 13 ran a story saying Oberstar had only one donor from within his district in the 3rd quarter. After Oberstar campaign manager Bryan Yunis called POLITICO's math ""faulty,"" the newspaper hit back with a deeper analysis, unhelpfully headlined ""Jim Oberstar money base: Way outside Duluth.""\Then perhaps the toughest break of all -- the Duluth News Tribune, the largest newspaper in the 8th District that has backed Oberstar in each of his previous campaigns, broke for Cravaack instead. http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/182080/ Again, camp Oberstar complained that the endorsement was due in large part to Forum Communications' takeover of the paper, though it should be pointed out that the paper endorsed Oberstar for two consecutive cycles since the takeover.\The biggest surprise so far followed on Friday: A shock SurveyUSA poll that put Cravaack within a single point of Oberstar, leaving no doubt at all that this will be the stiffest challenge Oberstar has ever faced.\Yet astute readers will have noted that I don't list this race in the most competitive ""toss-up"" category. There are three reasons for that, all of them structural.\1 -- Here in the Northland, Mark Dayton leading the Democratic ticket is a terrific boon. Consider this statistic: More Democratic votes were cast in the DFL primary in the 8th (72,000) than in the 5th (70,000). If the gubernatorial race drives voters to the polls, there may be a whole host of Democratic leaners there for Oberstar to pick up.\2 -- Oberstar has been in Congress a really, REALLY long time. Which is to say, people have voted for him for a really, REALLY long time. And as anyone who works campaigns can tell you, there's a distinct advantage when someone has already pulled the lever next to your name more than once before. It's not impossible; in fact it's probable that Cravaack has pulled a number of those voters over to his column (the folks on the News-Tribune's editorial board, for example). But enough to swing this race?\3 -- Sometimes when driving across state lines you can literally feel the border under your car as you move from good pavement to bad, or vice versa. Ever driven from Minneapolis to Duluth? Same thing happens when you cross into the 8th District. Incumbents who survive big opposition waves generally do so because upset voters are willing to make an exception for them, for some specific reason. In Oberstar's case, he'll be pointing to some of the best road stock in Minnesota and bridges that wouldn't have been built had it not been for Oberstar, the long-time chairman of the House Transportation Committee.\Yes, Chip Cravaack can win; he has a path to victory. And you certainly have to tip your cap to a candidate and his campaign that go into Election Day with the chance to unseat an incumbent that no one has ever even threatened. But it would take something of a GOP tsunami to flush Oberstar out of office -- especially in a generally Democratic district -- and it remains to be seen if the wave is that big.\6th District, Michele Bachmann (R) vs. Tarryl Clark (D) vs. Bob Anderson (I): Simply put, this the most expensive House race in the history of the United States of America. Never has so much cash flowed into one congressional campaign, with records set by both the incumbent and the challenger.\More than $16 million had been raised. More than $13 million has been spent. And those numbers, the last available from federal campaign finance reports, are probably way too low because they're half a month old.\Part of the reason, undeniably, is that Clark is an amazing fundraiser. She'd have to be to set the sort of fundraising records she has. But don't kid yourself, the reason money is flowing into this race from Seattle to South Beach is because of who Clark is running against: Michele Bachmann.\Bachmann took just over 46 percent of the vote in 2008, one of the lowest vote percentages of anyone elected in that year. She took just 50 percent when first elected in 2006. She's been victorious, yes, but in both campaigns Democrats woke up the morning afterward thinking they could have beaten her had they done just a little bit more.\This race was the chance for Democrats to defeat the titular head of the Tea Party in Congress. Bill Clinton came to town for Clark -- twice. Her fundraising pitches are authored by the voice of idyllic Minnesota, Garrison Keillor, who set Lake Wobegon (where every child is above average) in the 6th.\Clark's campaign was a departure from previous efforts, which aimed to paint Bachmann as too ""extreme"" for her district, which at 57 percent Republican is the most conservative in Minnesota. Instead, Clark argued that Bachmann had forgotten where she came from and morphed into the representative of Tea Party-At Large.\To counter that, Bachmann has run a campaign emphasizing her ties to the district. On board her campaign bus, she eschews the casual Sunday attire so beloved by other candidates in favor of a Joe Mauer or Randy Moss jersey. She began a debate in St. Cloud by rattling off a list of obscure, microscopic hamlets in her district. And in between her frequent and fervent attacks on the stimulus, Wall Street bailout and health care bills, Bachmann inserts scorn for the EPA, which she says is blocking a bridge project in her district. And if voters somehow mistake Clark's first name as ""Taxin' Tarryl,"" well, that won't be by accident.\But Bachmann's central retort is simple: National issues on the size and scope of government, and the lagging economy, are by definition local issues. In focusing on them, she's doing her job.\But what about Bob Anderson, the Independence Party candidate? While Anderson has been overlooked and underfunded this whole race, he had an impressive showing during a trio of debates in the last week of the campaign.\Remember that in 2008, Bachmann's margin of victory was just three percentage points, while Anderson received 10 percent of the vote. Democrats grumbled that, had Anderson not been in the race, they might have beaten Bachmann, though I'm not as sure that he took as many votes from El Tinklenberg as some people think.\Anderson's policy stands raised in the few debates this race saw in its last week tracked much closer to Bachmann than Clark, so if he does garner enough votes to impact the race I'm expecting they'll come more from conservative independents than progressive ones.\The most amazing thing about this race has been the consistency. A SurveyUSA poll in July showed Bachmann leading Clark by nine points. A SurveyUSA poll in September -- three months and millions of dollars later -- showed the same thing: Bachmann by nine. The most important poll comes Tuesday; what will it show?\Tier Four: District makeup says maybe, but incumbents widely favored\Now we're into the realm of races that no national pundit sees as competitive. Yet the district makeup suggests that, in an absolutely perfect storm, they could be.\3rd District, Erik Paulsen (R) vs. Jim Meffert (D): Paulsen took over the suburban 3rd District from the retiring centrist Jim Ramstad in 2008, but make no mistake, Paulsen is not a Ramstad clone. Paulsen's voting record places him squarely in the center of the House Republican caucus, which winds up being well to the right of where Ramstad was. The theory among Ramstad supporters was that one had to be much more moderate to hold the district -- and this race will test that hypothesis.\This district is a classic swing district -- where George W. Bush narrowly held off Al Gore and John Kerry, but where Barack Obama bested John McCain by six points. Given that Paulsen took just 48.5 percent of the vote to win in 2008, this race seemed at the outset of 2009 like it would be a squeaker.\Three things have happened since. One, Paulsen has emerged as a wonkish Republican lawmaker who has quietly gone about his business and wound up passing more bills than John Kline and Michele Bachmann combined, while the more vocal Bachmann and more senior Kline have diverted attention from him. Two, Paulsen has raised tons of cash, while his opponent, Jim Meffert, struggled to find donors. Ironically, Meffert's phone started ringing when Paulsen began airing negative ads against him, thus inadvertently upping the challenger's name identification.\Third, which partly explains point two, the neighboring 6th District has vacuumed up a ton of cash and airtime that might have otherwise gone to this race. Not only is it difficult to raise money against an incumbent, it's hard to raise enough to penetrate the cacophony of the media war that is Bachmann vs. Clark.\Meffert's camp sees a window here -- their internal polling during the summer showed Paulsen's approval underwater. When they've been able to get their message out, they say, Meffert's message has been resonating with voters. But that money gap is huge: Meffert has been outspent more than five to one, and Paulsen had a seven to one cash advantage going into the final three weeks.\7th District, Collin Peterson (D) vs. Lee Byberg (R): The reason this race isn't in the tier below is because the 7th went for John McCain over Barack Obama. The reason it isn't in the tier above is because of the incumbent, Collin Peterson.\In North and South Dakota, which border the 7th on the west, two moderate Democrats are in the fight of their political lives. South of Peterson, Walz faces the toughest race in Minnesota. Peterson, however, seems to be an island of political stability. He's chairman of the Agriculture Committee in an ag-heavy district that counts on the Farm Bill, which he'll be a lead author of whether Dems hold the House or not. He's a political moderate who voted no on both the stimulus and health care -- though his opponent has hit him hard on a yes vote for the House's version of a carbon cap-and-trade bill.\Challenger Lee Byberg has run a spirited campaign, even making it onto the first rung of the GOP's national ""Young Guns"" candidate program. He has raised more money that any challenger to ever face Peterson and both Byberg and his campaign staff say they're hearing no end of northwest Minnesotans say they're voting for change for the first time in a long time.\Yet Peterson's own internal polling shows him up 34 points, consistent with his history of vastly outpacing his own party in the 7th. In 2008, he took 72 percent of the vote, running 25 points better than the man at the top of the ticket, Democrat Barack Obama. In fact, he hasn't been held under 65 percent of the vote since the last big Republican wave election in 1994.\Tier Five: Off the radar\5th District, Keith Ellison (D) vs. Joel Demos (R): Credit to Demos -- he has had by far the best ads of any candidate in Minnesota this cycle. The amusingly bizarre monster truck. The zeitgeist-poking Facebook ""like"" spot. And most notably, the too-cute-for-words ""Kids"" ad, where his two little ones comically attempted to work off the national debt burden placed on America's youth.\But this is the 5th District, which two cycles ago elected the first Muslim member of the House of Representatives. Now, Ellison has become such a voice for progressives that he is running to lead them in the next Congress. Arguably the most prominent liberal voice in Congress is heavily favored in arguably the most liberal district in Minnesota.\2nd District, John Kline (R) vs. Shelly Madore (D): I should say that I'm not expecting this to be a run-up-the-score blowout. Kline has never eclipsed 60 percent in this district. And Democratic challenger Madore has already beaten the odds once this election season -- the former state representative won the DFL primary over party-endorsed candidate Dan Powers.\However, Kline has a giant fundraising lead and is widely expected to not just win but take over the gavel of the powerful Education and Labor Committee when he does. Despite taking vote percentages in the 50s, Kline has a history of winning by a large enough margin that the race isn't really that close -- his last four elections were won by 15, 16, 16 and 11 points respectively. And this is expected to be a very good year for the GOP.\4th District, Betty McCollum (D) vs. Teresa Collett (R): The reason one can't convincingly state that the 5th is the most liberal district in Minnesota is because the 4th also exists. Its hub is the state capital of St. Paul and Ramsey County, where the state and federal governments are large employers and reliant on federal funding to continue paying for those paychecks. McCollum just so happens to be the only Minnesotan on the Appropriations Committee -- and has emphasized that role when talking about the funding she's brought back for massive district projects like the renovation of St. Paul's Union Depot or construction of the Central Corridor light rail line.\Collett's campaign has attempted to seize on an eight-year-old clip of McCollum omitting ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance, as well as comments they say show McCollum doesn't sufficiently weight the threat posed by al Qaeda. However, we have yet to see a sign that an upset is really possible here.\Credit: Derek Wallbank"

LIVINGSTON, N.J. -- A tough-talking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie launched his 2016 campaign for president Tuesday with a promise to tell voters the truth even if it makes them cringe.
\
The Republican governor, a one-time GOP favorite who has faded and is now trying to climb back, lashed out at ""bickering leaders"" from both political parties in a kickoff rally in the gymnasium of his old high school. And in his trademark blunt style, he told voters -- and warned Republican rivals -- that he's ready to be aggressive in the 2016 contest.
\
""You're going to get what I think whether you like it or not, or whether it makes you cringe every once in a while or not,"" Christie declared. He added: ""I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America.""
\
He went on to a town hall meeting in Sandown, N.H., receiving enthusiastic applause from the standing-room crowd as he arrived with his family. ""I want to be the next president of the United States and I intend to win this election,"" he told the meeting, held in an actual town hall.
\
Christie enters a Republican presidential field that already has more than a dozen candidates. He will compete for the same slice of the electorate as pragmatic-minded White House hopefuls such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
\
While Christie's turn as head of the Republican Governors Association was widely viewed as a success in the 2014 midterm elections, he's also faced the fallout from the actions of three former aides, charged with creating politically motivated traffic jams at a bridge to retaliate against a Democratic mayor who declined to endorse Christie's re-election.
\
Christie has not been tied directly to wrongdoing. He denies he had anything to do with the bridge closing and has seen no evidence emerge to refute that.
\
Here's where Christie stands on some of the issues:
\
FOREIGN POLICY
\
Christie said in April that U.S. combat troops might be needed to fight the Islamic State. ""We have to be willing as Americans to say, if need be, we'll also put soldiers into the fight."" He said he had ""grave concerns"" about a potential deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program. He has been critical of President Barack Obama's warming of ties with Cuba, and of Americans who travel there, saying Cubans ""can't vote, they can't speak, they can't own property."" Addressing Russia's support of separatist rebels in Ukraine, he said that Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, would be more fearful of him than of Obama.
\
ENVIRONMENT
\
Christie is not a climate change denier: ""I think global warming is real,"" he said in April. ""And I do think human activity contributes to it."" But he withdrew New Jersey from a regional cap-and-trade program intended to limit carbon emissions that cause global warming, and he argued last year against unilaterally curbing emissions when people in China are ""doing things to the environment that would never be done in our country.""
\
IMMIGRATION
\
Christie, unlike many of his Republican rivals, plays down the need for stricter border security. He says illegal immigration will drop ""if we clamp down on folks who are hiring people in this manner."" He had New Jersey join a lawsuit against Obama's executive order seeking to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation but says Republicans should work with the president to push such legislation in Congress.
\
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
\
Christie opposes same-sex marriage and as governor vetoed a bill in 2012 that would have allowed it. But the next year he dropped a state challenge to a court ruling allowing same-sex marriage in New Jersey, calling it futile.
\
EDUCATION
\
Christie said in 2013 that he would be ""leading the charge"" for Common Core, the national set of education standards meant to raise proficiency in math and English. But in May he called for new standards for New Jersey, saying Common Core is ""simply not working.""
\
BUDGET AND ECONOMY
\
Christie gained wide attention for his confrontation with public employees over benefits and pensions, and he boasted at the 2012 Republican National Convention that he had ""fixed"" the state's problem of ballooning pension costs. But two years later, he said that New Jersey lacked the money to meet its pension obligations. In May he proposed simplifying the federal income tax code from six brackets to three, reducing the top rate to 28 percent from 39 percent, and cutting the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. He would also eliminate the wage tax for anyone older than 62 and those entering the work force before age 21.

42,"I worry about China. I have been worried about China most of my life -- for different reasons, every 10 years or so. I was born to parents who were afraid of China's military might and penchant for being against whatever Americans were for. I grew up being afraid of China's nuclear arsenal and Mao Tse Tung and his ""Little Red Book"" of quotations I saw my radical classmates carrying around in college. China, I was sure, would convert the masses, including me, to communism. There was a cultural revolution happening. Mao's sayings became so ubiquitous on campus, that I quit college. I joined the service, and the friend of my enemy was -- China.\China became my friend for a short time when it became the enemy of my real enemy, Russia. There was Richard Nixon smiling and shaking hands with China. That got me through the 1980s. Late in that decade a fledgling democratic movement burst to life in Tiananmen Square and the government moved in and killed or imprisoned the protesters. The actual numbers have never been released by Chinese authorities. Authorities in China don't often release actual numbers on anything, and when they do, I rarely believe them.\Nevertheless, I find myself going to the NDRC website every week to find out how the old enemy is doing. You can find the site here. The last part of that URL stands for Chinese Government. The first part stands for the National Development and Reform Commission.\It is a big website that has a function which will translate the words into any language spoken on the planet. There, Chinese politicians and scientists lay out, in plain English (if you hit the right key), how China will lead the world. If my nightly dreams have not been recently visited with thoughts of China taking over my life, I go to this site to reassure myself that I'm not delusional. The website doesn't so much confirm that the Chinese will take over as it confirms that the Chinese are already doing it.\So, if you don't want your grandchildren speaking Chinese as their mother tongue, do whatever you can to encourage your lawmakers to support the University of Minnesota with research money. The Gophers are the Marines in this science war with the Chinese. They are boots on the ground.\According to the NDRC, China already leads the world in the production of wind turbine technology. It leads the world in solar technology. It has grand goals for the development of alternative energy sources, it intends to raise the price of petroleum to curb demand and it is setting up its own cap and trade system, in its new free market, to drive down its CO2 emissions. It is pouring government money into the development of its renewable energy portfolio while, to the consternation of environmentalists everywhere, developing nuclear power to eventually replace its coal-fired electricity generating plants.\The Chinese nuclear plant of the future isn't your father's Oldsmobile. China is talking about fast neutron reactors that produce no plutonium (from which nuclear weapons are made) and produces little waste for storage. China is also messing around with thorium. It is a slightly radioactive salt that can do the work of uranium more safely. And it is four times as abundant. It is found in what is called ""rare earth."" Guess who has the lion's share of the earth's ""rare earth""? Not us.\So, meanwhile, over on the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota, the Institute on the Environment (IonE) and its off-shoot, the Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment (IREE), is taking on China. It is like hand-to-hand combat, except they are using their minds.\Jonathan Foley is the director of IonE. Foley says:""The Chinese might be beating us today. So, we've got to get ahead of them. We've got to be thinking about tomorrow, and that's where America shines -- tomorrow's technology.""\If the University of Minnesota were a start-up company, you might want to invest. IonE recently reported that it picks up $20 for each one dollar invested. But a definite anti-science gloom has descended over the state Capitol, and with budget cutting on everyone's mind, the University is trying to convince skeptical legislators that it is perilous to cut funding for research. The same legislators would never dream of cutting a defense budget.\Steve Kelley spent 13 years at the state Legislature and is now a senior fellow at the Humphrey Institute and director of the Center for Science, Technology and Public Policy. Kelley says: ""It is essential to this country's economic future to support science. And that means more than dollars. It means leaders, when they speak publicly, ought to be supporting science as a concept. If they don't, it is like surrendering to the Chinese before we are halfway through the battle.""\Then, Kelley emphatically adds, ""It is not patriotic!""\The University of Minnesota is in a war of science with the Chinese. The Prussian von Clausewitz said war is simply politics by other means. To win this war, it seems, we need to get our politics straight when it comes to putting tax money into the part of our budget once the domain of science nerds. At the University of Minnesota, they are nerds no more. Think bulging muscles, tattoos, rifles in both hands and chomping on a cigar. The GI Joes in this war wear a white lab coats.\IonE's director Jon Foley, a mild scientist by day, says, ""We are ready to fight.""\I say, support our troops.\Credit: Don Shelby"
43,"
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs's recent complaint about the ingratitude of the ""professional left"" is a small symptom of a larger problem for President Barack Obama: He has left wide swaths of the Democratic Party uncertain of his core beliefs.
\
In interviews, a variety of political activists, operatives and commentators from across the party's ideological spectrum presented similar descriptions of Obama's predicament: By declining to speak clearly and often about his larger philosophy -- and insisting that his actions are guided not by ideology but a results-oriented ""pragmatism"" -- he has bred confusion and disappointment among his allies, and left his agenda and motives vulnerable to distortion by his enemies.
\
The president's reluctance to be a Democratic version of Ronald Reagan, who spoke without apology about his vaulting ideological ambitions, has produced an odd turn of events: Obama has been the most activist domestic president in decades, but the philosophy behind his legislative achievements remains muddy in the eyes of many supporters and skeptics alike. There is not yet such a thing as ""Obamism.""
\
The ability to transcend ideological divides and unite disparate parts of the electorate was a signal strength of his candidacy in 2008. But that has given way to widespread -- if often contradictory -- complaints about his agenda (too radical or too cautious?) and the political tactics (too partisan or too conflict averse?) he uses to pursue it.
\
At first blush, it is a mystery: How could a political leader preside over nearly $1 trillion dollars in stimulus and other spending, and pass overhauls of the health care and financial services sectors, but still leave many of his own supporters uncertain of his larger aims?
\
""He hasn't sought, I think, to bring coherence to the achievements of the last 20 months,"" said former Democratic senator and presidential candidate Gary Hart, adding that ""it would not hurt"" to do so soon.
\
""What may be missing from the White House is a clear and convincing narrative into which all the various initiatives neatly fit, so that the public can make sense of everything that's done,"" said Robert Reich, a former labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, now a frequent commentator.
\
By contrast, Reich said, Republicans have stuck with what he views as a wrong-but-consistent message about how Obama's agenda is simply too big: ""They're connecting the dots in a way that has hurt the administration and harms Democrats. Obama needs to connect the dots in a way that explains to the public what he's done and where's he's taking the nation.""
\
Notably, the judgments of liberals such as Reich are echoed at the other end of the Democratic spectrum -- by the moderate ""New Democrats"" who in the 1990s backed Clinton as a way to steer the party away from doctrinaire interest-group liberalism.
\
Will Marshall, head of the moderate Progressive Policy Institute, said, ""If you're a serial pragmatist and just go from issue to issue and say, 'Here's a problem we need to solve,' then the play of values and ideas gets lost in that.""
\
By these lights, Obama's opaque ideology invites everyone to see something different in him -- and those perceptions often do not work to his advantage.
\
In liberal intellectual circles, it is now common for Obama to be described as rudderless and politically expedient. Liberals said he retreated too early on a public option for health care, was too soft on big banks during financial reform and has continued too many of George W. Bush's national security policies. These criticisms prompted Gibbs's recent catcalls -- starting in an interview in The Hill newspaper -- that some people on the left would not be happy unless Dennis Kucinich were president and the Pentagon were dismantled.
\
While liberals wonder where Obama stands, in many precincts of the right there seems to be no uncertainty about who he really is: a would-be socialist, determined to dethrone private enterprise and individual liberty in favor of government power.
\
Disaffection on the ideological wings might be a good bargain for Obama if it were matched by robust support in the center. But, for the moment, he does not have that either. Obama's disapproval rating cracked 50 percent for the first time in a Gallup poll this month, while his approval rating dropped to a new low -- 44 percent -- for the week of Aug. 9-15. That's driven in part by the flight of the independents who put him over the top in 2008: The same Gallup survey showed only 39 percent of independents approve of his performance.
\
A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll last month found a plurality of voters, 47 percent, saying Obama is too liberal, up from 35 percent in April 2009. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in the spring found the same trend -- a notable spike in the number of voters who think Obama's views are too liberal.
\
In a ""60 Minutes"" interview after his election but before his inauguration, Obama spoke of his ""pragmatism"" and said he doesn't ""get bottled up in a lot of ideology and 'Is this conservative or liberal?' My interest is finding something that works.""
\
This was consistent with his aversion to being boxed in by philosophical labels in the campaign. During the primaries, he steered clear of the familiar Democratic intraparty debate over whether he was a liberal or a ""New Democrat"" centrist. He avoided linking himself with the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, as Clinton did in the 1990s. He ran to the left of Hillary Rodham Clinton and other rivals (with his early opposition to the Iraq war) or slightly to the right of her (with a more incremental plan for health care), depending on the circumstances.
\
In the general election, he easily united the disparate wings of his party and attracted a clear majority of independents around disdain for the Bush years and the symbolic power of his personal story.
\
By some lights, however, he and his team became so enthralled with the idea of a personality-driven ""Obama brand"" that they neglected the need to explain -- and, in a modern media environment, to explain and explain again -- the ideas behind the personality.
\
""You have to provide the country with a narrative of where we have been and where we need to go and how to get there,"" said Don Baer, a communications director in Bill Clinton's White House. ""That requires a theory of the case on the role of government -- and the role of the president.""
\
Clinton, Baer said, spoke often about the general state of the country, and ""the specifics of policy flowed from that."" Obama, by contrast, seems more comfortable talking about the specifics of policy and then letting people conclude the general from the specific. ""This poses a challenge because people need context, and I imagine this leaves the president unhappy when they reach what he thinks is the wrong conclusion"" about his vision for the country.""
\
The question of Obama's ideological true colors will likely come into sharper relief over the next several months. He faces questions on Afghanistan (whether to continue a surge or begin to withdraw), Iran (whether to threaten and conceivably use military pressure against that regime's nuclear program), the environment (whether to try to revive a cap-and-trade plan on carbon emissions) and the deficit (how seriously to try to tame it, and what mix of tax increases or spending cuts to employ) -- all questions that sharply divide the Democratic Party along ideological lines.
\
Eric Alterman, who wrote an influential article in The Nation last month urging progressives to be patient even though Obama's presidency has been a ""big disappointment"" for them so far, thinks Obama errs by flinching from the dramatic promise of his own campaign.
\
During the primaries, Obama tweaked Clinton by praising the leadership style (not the policies) of Reagan, who he said made Republicans ""the party of ideas.""
\
""Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not,"" Obama said in early 2008.
\
Alterman complained in an interview: ""The vision of progressive values that was enunciated by (Obama) disappeared the day after Inauguration Day."" This vision, he added, ""would have provided much better context for a discussion of his policies -- that's really missing.""
\
An Obama aide asked to be ""on background"" to address the intraparty quarreling among Democrats who think the president is insufficiently ideological or too compromise-minded.
\
""Most Americans aren't looking for ideological debates; they want pragmatic, common-sense solutions,"" the aide said. ""The campaign was, in many ways, premised on the idea that people wanted to stop some of the '80s and '90s that made a lot of noise but not a lot of progress.""
\
Obama, the aide continued, ""believes that government has a role to play, but he's not dogmatic in his approach. He believes that progress sometimes requires compromise, which is honorable and justified, so long as you don't compromise your principles or the ultimate goal.""
\
In an article in the current issue of The New Republic, writer John Judis hits Obama for ideological skittishness -- noting the ""fitful and sporadic"" way he confronted Wall Street leaders and then seemed to retreat during the financial crisis.
\
Robert Borosage, president of the Institute for America's Future, a liberal policy shop, said Obama has been bold in trying to pursue a lot of big policy changes quickly. But he faulted him for trying to cut deals before drawing clear battle lines against conservatives and their ideas -- looking for incremental changes instead of pushing for an elemental shift in the country's direction.
\
""From the beginning, if you listen to his description of why we're in this mess, he's chosen not to make it ideological or partisan"" -- running against Washington or the excesses of both parties rather than making a direct attack on the failures of Republican rule, Borosage said.
\
He said Obama has been willing to pursue big policies, but has focused too much on Washington deal-making at the expense of rallying a progressive coalition. ""This combination of bold objectives and insider dealing, as opposed to outside mobilization politics ... confused everything,"" Borosage argued. ""The right went after the bold objectives, and the left focused on the special deals.""
\
Although they disagree on many policies, DLC founder Al From echoed a key part of Borosage's analysis: Obama has been too defined by Washington. Because Obama ""doesn't have such a clear philosophy of his own,"" From said, ""he's more been defined by congressional leadership of his party, which most Americans see as left of center.""
\
In private conversations, particularly early in Obama's term, it was striking how many of his close aides expressed contempt for Bill Clinton's presidency, even as Obama was enlisting Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state, and former Clinton aide and then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel to be chief of staff. The Obama crowd tended to dismiss Clinton's presidency as too timid, with too many small policies.
\
The reality, said From, is that Clinton had a more fully formed worldview -- and more ease in talking about it -- than Obama has demonstrated. Clinton launched his candidacy in 1991 with a sustained critique of where both parties had gone wrong, and constantly explained his policies with the same mantra: Using government to expand opportunity, demand more responsibility from citizens and restore a sense of national community.
\
""It seems to me that one of the big differences between Clinton and Obama is Clinton's political strength came from what he stood for and what he did,"" From said. ""Obama's political strength comes more from who he is. ... He tries to be practical, but practical without a philosophy can look political.""
\
In fact, Obama has given some major statements of philosophy. In a speech at Georgetown University in April 2009, he spoke of the ""five pillars"" of his domestic agenda. But he has not returned frequently to these themes or imprinted them on the public mind.
\
For now, Gibbs's shots at the ""professional left"" continue to echo in the party.
\
Matt Bennett, with the centrist group Third Way, expressed sympathy. ""The Gibbs comments were accurate, if not too politic,"" he said. ""So it's the blogosphere. It is the cable guys and others out there who feel he has betrayed them, notwithstanding the fact that he has done pretty much what he said he would do on most things.""
\
But political consultant and commentator Bob Shrum called the Gibbs episode ""politically stupid"" and ""a train wreck."" Shrum, a former speechwriter for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, said Obama needs to be rallying his most ardent supporters, not picking fights with them.
\
""I think he has to have the courage and smarts to do what Roosevelt and Reagan did, which is draw a real-life contrast: What does he stand for? What does the other side stand for?""

44,"So, are untrained teachers the answer?\Being just a teacher, I realize I'm not very smart, so I write this in the hope that those who know better will enlighten me.\There has been much said about how inadequate today's teachers are and how much better it would be if we would just make the teacher certification process easier. So my question is: If the current system -- which involves having a prospective teacher earn a degree in his subject, has him attend a program that not only teaches the pedagogical but the practical by requiring a practicum, and then on top of that requires a student-teaching assignment before he sets foot in a classroom of his own -- is producing our current crop of failing teachers, then how does it follow that someone with even less training and experience will do any better?\Secondly, it is repeatedly said that our current system is not developing minority teachers. Is that because it is designed to keep them out? If that is that case, then why haven't lawsuits been filed?\That is a strong accusation. If that's not the case, then is it suggesting that we should lower the bar to make it easier for minorities to become teachers? And if so, wouldn't that be completely against what...\Like I said, someone smarter needs to answer.\GREGG L. KOTSONAS\APPLE VALLEY\Curb the global warming alarmism\I am shocked, yea aghast, that the environmentalists have not launched an urgent program to control volcanos to limit the damage to our environment and the economy caused by volcanic eruptions and the resulting ash and debris thrown into the atmosphere. Just kidding...\But the likelihood of our being able to control global warming is comparable to our ability to control volcanos.\Common sense, to say nothing of the vast amount of information available that does not support global warming, plus the fact that we have experienced global cooling for more than 10 years, all should convince any honest and objective person that global warming is nothing but a clever hoax which is costing vast amounts of money.\The earth has undergone many temperature cycles over the centuries, some more pronounced than others.\Long periods of cooling such as during past ice ages have always been followed by long periods of warming; otherwise, we would likely still be living in the last ice age.\And all of this transpired when the release into the atmosphere of significant amounts of greenhouse gases by man was trivial compared to what it is today.\The dire predictions of academia in the '70s, which undoubtedly catalyzed the global warming hysteria, have long since been proven to be ridiculous.\Given the lack of any convincing evidence to support global warming, there are several things that need to be done.\The first thing we need to do is scrap ""Cap and Trade."" This will save our country and the world trillions of dollars.\Then the government should get out of the business of supporting non-viable energy technology such as wind energy, solar energy and alcohol fuels.\ROBERT L. MOISON\BURNSVILLE"
45,"The first Monday in September is Labor Day, a bittersweet end to the summer, and a chance to honor the working men and women of the country.\With the unemployment rate just less than 10 percent (18 percent if you count discouraged or part-time workers), this won't be a festive day for many Americans. About 6.5 million workers have been out of work for more than six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Deficits remain high, consumer spending is down. The current ratio of job applicants to jobs is 6 to 1.\Job vacancy rates should lead to a 6.5 percent unemployment rate rather than 9.5 percent, said Narayana Kothcerlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, in a recent speech.\It's the private sector -- Main Street -- from which 75 percent of our new jobs arise. Main Street historically has led the way in all job creation. In particular, smaller firms have provided the bulk of job creation, but not this time.\How much of the 2009 stimulus bill ($875 billion) even went to Main Street's smaller businesses? Very little. Most went to fund ""shovel-ready"" public projects. In the long run, sadly, the stimulus bill did not create economic growth.\Many people, fortunate to have jobs, are finding their hours (and wages) cut, and are required to take periodic furloughs from work. Many small-business owners are staying alive by hiring temporary workers and keeping their payrolls low. Some jobs are lost forever.\Government needs to get out of the way, and let the economy recover on its own.\The uncertainty from nationalized health care, cap-and-trade proposals and other proposed taxes and mandates is creating anxiety and keeping businesses from purchasing and hiring.\Polls show most Americans think the country is on the wrong track, and they are wary of a new stimulus program. They don't want government to try to create jobs. They understand that it's futile and could lead to a rise in taxes. And with any increase in taxes is a concomitant loss in spending, and a reluctance of employers to hire new workers.\The president's administration should ask how to get more jobs to get us out of the recession. Regulations and taxes are killing incentives. Businesses are in business to make profits, not social statements.\By taxing and punishing innovation and success, we are creating a hostile environment that makes business want to flee to other countries where the cost of doing business is cheaper. We lost more than 7 million jobs in the past two years, and getting back to 5 percent unemployment won't happen overnight.\But there are things we can do. We should focus on tax incentives and increasing exports. How can we bring back the jobs that were exported to far-flung regions? Can we invest in innovation, ease credit for small business? Why not decrease corporate tax rates to zero for the next five years, or forgo payroll taxes on hiring new labor?\Without a growing economy or jobs, Labor Day seems less a celebration and more just the last sigh of summer.\This is the opinion of Barbara Banaian, a professional pianist who lives in the St. Cloud area. Her column is published the first Friday of the month."
46,"President Obama delivered a clear message to Wall Street last week on the one-year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the chaos seen shortly after in America's financial markets.\He wants to prevent the risk of another systemic crisis by teaming up with the financial industry to ""... update the rules and regulatory structure to meet the challenges of this new century.""\Well, the good news is that since he took office in January, his administration has offered some promising ideas. The bad news is that the financial industry, having survived the collapse thanks in part to a taxpayer bailout, doesn't seem all that willing to jump on his bandwagon.\For example, news reports about his speech indicate Wall Street applauded only twice.\Now add to the mix the toxic partisan environment, especially in Washington; the health care reform obsession; and the apparent end of the latest economic free fall -- and it's easy to see why reforming Wall Street is slowly slipping off the public's radar.\But unless Americans want to jeopardize the tender economy or reopen wounds that caused their financial holdings to bleed so profusely this past year, voters must keep the pressure on both sides to make reforms.\As with the health care debate, a good starting point is to fill in the details of common ground.\Based on that limited applause last week, it might exist in Obama's idea to create a financial protection agency for consumers. The goal is to give consumers easily understandable financial information in part by providing more regulatory oversight of mortgages, credit cards and other lending practices cited as causes of the crisis.\Main Street Americans should be able to embrace that concept. So Wall Street execs, what do you say?\Of course, other aspects of the markets and reform aren't quite so easy to understand for Main Streeters. Take derivative investing, hedge funds and the like.\By now most consumers simply know that a lack of regulation on such measures were a major reason they had to bail out Wall Street. Accordingly, Obama wants changes. However, his plans have drawn critics from both sides -- those who say they are not tough enough and those who say nothing, which apparently means they want no part in reforms.\We would simply note that in the wake of the taxpayer bailout, more regulation -- not less -- would be a reasonable price for Wall Street to pay, along with the billions it borrowed to survive the past year.\As with health care, cap and trade, and transportation bills, these reforms will not come quickly or easily. But they must come. American taxpayers can't afford to have to save Wall Street again."
47,"
West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin is taking a political battering thanks to his support of Barack Obama, so he's uniquely qualified to offer counsel on what many think is the president's central political problem -- his failure to connect with white working-class voters.
\
His advice: Go to where they live and work. Listen. And don't talk down to them.
\
""If I were him, I'd start going to the places where people don't like you that much,"" says Manchin, who is locked in a close race to replace Robert Byrd in the Senate and struggling mightily to shrug off his opponents' description of him as Obama's ""rubber stamp.""
\
""You can't win if you only go where you are comfortable,"" added Manchin, who was speaking to Politico a day before Obama appeared in a place that was very much in his comfort zone -- before a crowd of 35,000 admirers at Ohio State University.
\
In the two weeks before the Nov. 2 midterms, Obama has focused on helping his party energize its demoralized base, traveling to seven states that delivered him double-digit margins of victory two years ago and to comfortable venues like big city stadiums and university campuses.
\
On Saturday, he's scheduled to do it again, coming to Minnesota to campaign for DFL gubernatorial candidate Mark Dayton, before a presumably supportive crowd at the Northrop Mall on the University of Minnesota's Minneapolis campus.
\
But in the process, Obama is also re-living one of the few unsuccessful phases of his campaign -- the spring of 2008, when Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton struck a chord with white blue-collar voters in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
\
Obama advisers analyzed Clinton's success and applied some of the lessons to his general election campaign. But this year, they have reverted to a base strategy, even as it's increasingly clear Obama must reconcile with disaffected white supporters to stand a chance in 2012.
\
Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, arguably Obama's most effective 2008 surrogate with working-class voters, says it's a ""tragedy"" Obama hasn't been able to convince blue-collar families he's on their side, and her solution is the same as Manchin's.
\
""He's just got to get out there and hear more bad news,"" McCaskill added. ""That event where the woman said, 'I'm exhausted with defending you' was perfect. He needs a lot more of that.""
\
The confrontation took place at a CNBC forum, precisely the kind of semi-hostile environment McCaskill was referring to. Obama also has embarked on a series of quick trips and ""backyard barbeques"" in purple-red zones like St. Louis, Charlotte, Kansas City, Richmond and Columbus.
\
But by necessity, they have taken a back seat to Obama's central strategy in 2010 of pumping up turnout among blacks, Latinos, urban voters, union members and educated whites.
\
Apart from a last-ditch effort to energize women voters, there's been no equivalent push to regain lost white independents and conservative Democrats who flocked to Obama in 2008 -- only to abandon him over huge spending bills and the sputtering recovery.
\
Twice as many noncollege-educated whites (60 percent) now plan to vote for a Republican this year rather than a Democrat (31 percent).
\
Embattled Democrats -- even friendly ones like Rep. Zack Space, D-Ohio, whose districts are awash in stimulus funding -- don't want Obama anywhere near them.
\
Instead, the president has been forced to stick, for the most part, to college campuses and big cities, like Seattle, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Madison, Wis., and Portland, Ore., where he appeared Wednesday.
\
Meanwhile, the white, blue-collar bastions such as Youngstown, Scranton and Louisville have been outsourced to surrogates like Vice President Joe Biden and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
\
Obama's West Wing aides argue that his national approval ratings -- stable in the mid-40s since spring -- are actually pretty good considering the unemployment rate is hovering around 10 percent.
\
The president himself, while acknowledging his administration's shortcomings in getting out its message, has dismissed the idea that communication alone would improve his political standing.
\
""I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years,"" Obama told Peter Baker of the New York Times earlier this month. ""I was reminded that in '94 -- when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up being bad for Democrats -- unemployment was only 6.6 percent.
\
""And I don't think anybody would suggest that Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or didn't show empathy.""
\
Republicans agree, saying it's Obama's policies -- especially cap and trade, the stimulus and health care changes -- that are dragging him down.
\
So do some white Democrats, especially union members, who don't think Obama has delivered on promises to pass new worker protections or protect the auto industry rank and file from mass layoffs during a government-initiated restructuring effort.
\
""It's not whether Obama is doing enough politicking,"" said John Russo, co-director of the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University. ""The real issue is policy, all the things (that) have not happened over the last two years.
\
""We're in a situation much like 1994, when after the labor movement and community groups did so much for Bill Clinton, he did not follow through on the promises he made to them. And it took 12 years in Ohio and 14 years nationally for working people to suspend their disbelief and again support the Democrats.""
\
The long-term danger for Obama is that if his approval ratings among whites stay low, the revolt could take root -- shredding a 2008 map that included single-digit wins in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia, Michigan, Florida and all-important Ohio, which Obama won by 3 percentage points with the political wind at his back.
\
""Right now, he couldn't sell ice water in hell,"" said Dee Davis, who runs a Kentucky nonprofit that studies voting patterns in the Appalachian belt, which encompasses southern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, western Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
\
Davis and other analysts say racism, especially among older voters, plays some role in Obama's plummeting popularity. But even Obama's friends concede that much of his trouble attracting working-class whites is less racial than cultural and that some wounds have been self-inflicted.
\
""Here's the gorilla in the room,"" said McCaskill. ""He can roll up his sleeves and he can take off his jacket and he could not wear a tie, but it is very hard for a lot of people in working-class families to imagine him next to them at the laundromat.
\
""His vocabulary is beyond impressive, (but) the fact that he stays visionary sometimes slows him down"" when he needs to be ""granular and really nitty-gritty and saying things in a way that makes people relate to him,"" McCaskill said.
\
Her solution: Obama needs to go on a listening tour -- more like a let-them-yell-at-you tour -- to establish a more visceral rapport with people's anxieties and fears. It's something he's done successfully in the past.
\
When Obama first ran for the Illinois Senate in 2004, his staff had to coach him on the ways of the state's southern agricultural belt -- urging him to ditch the suit jacket for rolled-up shirt sleeves.
\
In the summer of 2008, Obama enlisted two highly regarded young Clinton advisers, Aaron Pickrell and Isaac Baker, to craft a strategy for reducing John McCain's advantage among rural and Rust Belt whites.
\
The result was a well-received barnstorming tour through small Ohio towns like New Philadelphia and Steubenville, accompanied by similar trips through nonurban Indiana and western Pennsylvania.
\
At his best, Obama can be charming, funny, witty and warm -- such as earlier this year in Jefferson County, Mo., when he commiserated with laid-off workers at a Chrysler plant. During a trip to Iowa in April, he shooed away the press to chat with the wait staff at a diner.
\
Yet sometimes, he can be windy -- he delivered a nearly half-hour answer to a simple health care question at the Charlotte plant this spring -- and diffident, injecting complex policy discussions when confronted with wrenching kitchen-table problems.
\
At an MTV-sponsored forum for young voters last week, Obama blamed a ""tribal attitude"" among economically strapped Americans for a recent rise in racial incidents.
\
At a recent event in Massachusetts, he declared that ""fear and frustration"" among ""scared"" voters fueled anti-Democrat sentiments. That earned Obama the scorn of political blogger Mickey Kaus, who termed it ""political malpractice,"" adding, ""Insulting voters is rarely a good way to win them over.""

48,"Nature, endlessly fascinating and essentially unmanageable, despite the belief otherwise of environmental theologians, has repaired six great lakes, Superior, Michigan, Huron, Ontario, Erie and White Bear.\In Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and California, rivers are running fast and deep. This was reported last week on an inside page with a dateline of Yosemite National Park, where the Merced River is running like a wild freight train.\Unfortunately, the news that record snowfall on the towering mountain peaks has eliminated California’s five-year drought played secondhand to the dangers the swollen rivers present to tourists and rafters and swimmers.\Well, yes, have a care. News-gathering institutions, acting in concert with environmental theologians, present nature as a fearful godless entity, when the opposite is true. Nature is a constant blessing of new miracles.\The Great Lakes Hydraulics and Hydrology Office at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Detroit District announced last week in its six-month water level forecast that summer water levels on Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie will be at their highest since 1996-1998. Lake Ontario is up nearly three feet from last year. That lake has exceeded its highest level for June, which was set in 1952.\Year-round recording of Great Lakes water levels has occurred since 1918. With the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars spent on “climate science’’ these pleasant facts apparently could not be known. We are to believe that climate science can tell us what the temperature will be in 100 years - we must do something about this! - but they missed the great news of the Great Lakes, right in their own back yard. Sometimes you get a really wet spring.\Just a few years ago, the news for the Great Lakes was written with doom, and disaster was predicted for the lakes because of, well, man’s behavior. But, goodness, the lakes were plump and at all-time highs as recently as not even 20 years ago. Might that fact have mitigated the doom scenarios?\In our desperation to believe that we can control nature with meaningless and unenforceable climate accords, cap and trade policies and increasingly intrusive governmental regulation, all of which have nothing to do with the environment, we certainly lose sight of patience. More important, we lose the truth that man is not bigger than nature.\Nature wins, as it most recently has at White Bear. Ramsey County Beach - White Bear Lake County Park - is open for the first time since it was closed due to low lake levels in 2008. It has been a long nine years of watching the lake in such a decline that lawsuits were fashioned, docks extended, boat ramps closed and swimming beaches roped off. Rocky outcroppings appeared in the northwest bay of White Bear. Those were astonishing to see for those of us familiar with the lake of our youth, which always seemed brimming.\I went out to look the other day. Those rock islands are slowly disappearing under rising water. Water is lapping at docks that now need to be raised. I went to the public beach in Mahtomedi, where a lone worker was attempting to fix a submersed public boat dock at the beach.\“Looks good,’’ I said. “But I seem to remember the lake being even higher.’’\“We are within inches of the all-time high,’’ the guy said, somewhat frustrated, holding as he was a long, wet and unwieldy dock plank.\It did look good, though, healthy. I don’t know what nature has in store for the old girl, but nature will remain endlessly fascinating and miraculous. The old-timers on White Bear called this, by the way. They had seen it down before and they knew it would come back.\If only nature could heal this country.\Credit: Joe Soucheray"
49,"When President Obama referred to ""the destructive power of a warming planet"" in his victory speech Tuesday night, the words caught Jonathan Foley by surprise.\It wasn't because Foley, director of the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment, shares the view that Obama has shrunk from the issue of climate change during his first term.\Rather, Foley said that Obama has made remarkable progress on climate change initiatives, but that with the economy under a brighter political spotlight, ""he couldn't talk about it.""\""I hope it frees his hand to talk about the issue more,"" Foley said of Obama's election to a second and final term, which could reduce the restrictions that can come with eyeing re-election. ""I think he sent the environmental community a big message. Maybe now that the election is over with, he can broaden the palette of issues.""\This past year, Obama has overseen a mandate to increase the average gas mileage of new cars and light trucks sold in the United States to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. It's currently 29 mpg. That is ""the biggest single step the U.S. has taken to date to reduce carbon pollution,"" said J. Drake Hamilton, science policy director for Fresh Energy, a St. Paul-based renewable energy advocacy group.\Hamilton said pending standards that would set limits on carbon emissions from new coal plants -- even though few are being built -- are another significant step by the Obama administration.\With a gain of two Democratic seats in the U.S. Senate, and wins by climate-sensitive candidates including Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Obama may find more interest in legislation focusing on links between carbon emissions and threats to the economy and public health, as well as to expensive damages from severe storms, Hamilton added. However, he may also find opposition in the House, whose Republican majority just before the election recess passed a bill called the ""Stop the War on Coal Act"" aimed at blocking the coal-plant emissions standards. Voters re-elected a Republican House majority Tuesday.\Foley said Obama ""deserves a pat on the back"" for tying the auto industry bailout to the high fuel-efficiency standards. His strategy for the next four years, in the face of likely Republican opposition, Foley said, will probably involve relatively small rule-making through agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, rather than broad, high-profile efforts such as the failed bid to establish a cap-and-trade market for carbon emissions.\""A thousand little initiatives in government that add up: Maybe that's the way to get things done,"" Foley said.\Bill McAuliffe - 612-673-7646\Credit: BILL McAULIFFE; STAFF WRITER"
50,"Hennepin County is engaged in a tug-of-war with Xcel Energy Inc. over who gets to keep renewable energy credits generated by the county's garbage burner.\Those credits might not be especially lucrative now, but they're expected to become increasingly valuable as state and federal governments require utilities to provide more energy from renewable sources in the years ahead.\On Tuesday, the Hennepin County Board Energy and Environment Committee extended the county's contract with a Minneapolis law firm to handle its case against Xcel before the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC).\As renewable energy standards rise in coming years, selling the energy credits could bring Hennepin County up to $1 million annually, Commissioner Peter McLaughlin said.\""This is serious money,"" he said, especially if cap-and-trade programs to buy and sell emissions permits take hold.\Minnesota requires that by the end of this year, 15 percent of the energy Xcel provides must be from renewable sources such as solar, biomass or wind. That mandate grows to 25 percent by 2016 and 30 percent by 2020.\Xcel argues that it should be able to keep renewable credits associated with energy it buys from the county's garbage burner.\The credits, issued by the government to a utility, essentially certify that a specific amount of electricity came from a renewable source. Buying a credit is said to be the same as buying renewable energy.\""We just believe that if we're buying renewable energy, it's appropriate to count that toward the renewable energy standards the state has established,"" said Jim Alders, Xcel's director of regulatory administration.\It's an issue that also affects 100 other power producers around the state that sell energy to Xcel, county environmental services director Carl Michaud told commissioners.\Xcel agreed to buy energy at a lower rate from Hennepin County in the mid-1980s. There was no pricing for renewable energy then, let alone renewable energy credits; the contract didn't mention them because the concept didn't exist. It was only later that the idea of trading or selling credits as a commodity developed.\Xcel asked the PUC a couple of years ago to rule that it could apply credits from the energy it was buying toward meeting its state mandates. Hennepin County proposed talks to resolve the matter, but ""we didn't feel like we were having much success,"" Michaud said.\So the county has asked the PUC to decide the issue. A meeting will be held in June. Michaud said the commission could decide in a few months.\Renewable energy credits were ""never envisioned by the original contract, so it's something new,"" Michaud said. ""And Xcel didn't have any requirements placed upon it by the state at the time.""\Alders acknowledged that Xcel might choose to sell renewable credits it doesn't need. He said the market for such credits is still young and that they're of little value right now. ""That may change over time,"" he said.\Xcel has sold energy credits only in Texas and Colorado, Alders said. The utility recently got permission from public utility commissions in North Dakota and South Dakota to start pilot programs to sell renewable credits and use the revenue to reduce energy costs for customers, he said.\Kevin Duchschere - 612-673-4455\Credit: KEVIN DUCHSCHERE; STAFF WRITER"

The Minnesota weather is warming, but is the globe's climate?
\
We pause for a minute to let the shouting die down.
\
Every time the issue of global warming or climate change arises, it produces a solar flare of invective. The most recent hot spot, involving a British viscount and a prof at the University of St. Thomas, reminded us of someone's great idea that Minnesota host a public trial on the science of climate change.
\
Oh, wait -- that was our idea, cadged from a columnist on these pages. Well, we continue to think it's a good one.
\
We proposed this back in February, on a day when there were icy flurries outside our seventh-floor aerie. We come back to it today, as heat and humidity are mounting, as a way of isolating and publicizing the main points of contention, in a calm, deliberative, courtroom-like setting. We propose allowing citizens to reach verdicts that will not stop the shouting but which will be a step forward for rational debate.
\
Which this issue desperately needs.
\
There is a combative global-warming skeptic in England named Lord Monckton, who is the third viscount Monckton of Benchley. (We do not know if viscounts one and two kept track of polar bear drownings.) He gave his spiel at Bethel University in Arden Hills in October.
\
There is a professor of thermal science at St. Thomas named John Abraham, who lists no peerage after his name beyond Ph.D. He took issue with Monckton's conclusions and posted an online slide show critiquing it.
\
The Viscount went after the professor in a lengthy rebuttal. He trashed the prof, the university, the university president and even the archbishop, often in foul language. He said he has contacted St. Thomas donors.
\
Memo to your Viscountship: We here in the colonies believe in free speech, which both you and the prof are exercising. Take him to task, yell and scream, verbally slap him upside the head -- but don't go running to the archbishop.
\
Science must be our guide. For the purposes of this climate-change trial, we are not interested in whether we mine more or less coal, whether we cap and trade or whether we all get bicycles or buy big SUVs. We don't care who likes Al Gore or who doesn't. We want to hear the best evidence for and against -- the data at the heart of this volcano of invective and passion. We want to hear real scientists, speaking everyday English, tell us what the evidence is and what it means.
\
A courtroom format offers formal rules of procedure and evidence, structured dispute, methods for dividing the question. A jury of citizens from varied backgrounds would require that the science be boiled down and understandable to laypeople.
\
The point of our exercise would be this: a clearer, broader understanding of what we know, what we think we know and what we don't yet know about whether and why the Earth's climate is changing.
\
Minnesota is a great place for such a great debate. We define ourselves by our natural environment. We are a center of inquiry, home to many great institutions of higher learning in addition to the two (Bethel and St. Thomas) involved in this latest dispute. We have an old-fashioned sense of civic fairness, advocacy groups of all stripes, brilliant attorneys and distinguished judges, and smart people who know science from many angles.
\
And the fact that our ""verdict"" is in no way binding gives Minnesota the freedom to look at this issue not as combatants in the political struggle but as citizens trying to figure it out.

52,"
Greece is the proverbial ""canary in the coal mine"" in that it shows what will happen to the U.S. in 10 years if we do not control our deficit spending and our national debt. The U.S. national debt is 52 percent of our GDP and current projections show it will be 90 to 100 percent of GDP in 2020 or sooner. This level of national debt is unsustainable and will lead to an economic, financial and national security crisis.
\
The European PIGS (Portugal, Ireland/Italy, Greece and Spain) show that long-term socialist programs weaken a country and society's ability to compete in the world economy. The U.S. has its own ""PIGS"" in California, New York and Illinois. We must learn from history to avoid it happening again.
\
As Margaret Thatcher said, ""The problem with socialist governments is that they eventually run out of other people's money."" Voters must heed this clear advice on Nov. 2.

A record on abortion
\
President Obama was asked if he would apply the litmus test on abortion when he considered an appointment of a new Supreme Court justice to replace Justice Stevens. He replied in the negative.
\
He didn't need to apply it, because Elena Kagan passed his pro-abortion litmus test when he appointed her solicitor general. Kagan has strong ties to abortion-advocacy organizations and has a long track record of abortion advocacy.
\
She has publicly opposed Rust v. Sullivan, a Supreme Court decision that upheld the right of the Health and Human Services Department to restrict funding for groups that performed or promoted abortion. She also publicly and repeatedly criticized federal regulators that prohibited Title X family planning funds for counseling or referring women for abortions. She argued that the regulations amounted to a subsidization of anti-abortion speech.

Another side of mothering
\
I laughed and cried reading ""Truth be told: Confessions from moms on Mother's Day"" (May 9).
\
Brava, ladies, for your brave witness that motherhood is not all hearts and flowers. As a mom of the '80s, I feared my like confessions would have resulted in a shunning by my family and friends. Gratefully, my therapist never judged me. Cheers to the Pioneer Press for allowing moms an outlet to feel OK about the other side of mothering.

Mischaracterized
\
""Target taking on climate change"" (May 4), by reporter Tom Webb, mischaracterized the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's position on energy and climate change.
\
In the article, a Target spokeswoman notes that the climate change debate isn't a matter of ""us versus them."" We agree. As the world's largest business federation, the U.S. Chamber has forcefully advocated for common-sense policies that would increase America's energy security and benefit the environment. Last year, our Institute for 21st Century Energy released a comprehensive, 88-point plan that includes many provisions to combat climate change, such as innovative financing mechanisms for clean energy technology, increased energy efficiency, and expanding our use of emissions-free nuclear energy.
\
We agree that America must transition to a lower carbon economy and lessen reliance on foreign oil. However, we believe that transition should be managed carefully in accordance with our increasing need for more energy supplies and regard for our struggling economy.
\
Like many leaders from both parties, the Chamber could not support the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill last year due to its negative impacts on the economy. However, we have remained engaged in a constructive dialogue with members of Congress about ways to increase energy supply and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and will continue to do so.
\
A comprehensive energy and climate bill that effectively manages the transition to a lower-carbon future without harming our economy is in everyone's best interest. We look forward to continuing to work toward that goal, and hope that the ""us versus them"" attitude that was exhibited in the Pioneer Press's coverage does not become even more pervasive.

53,"Ashwin Madia, the Dem nominee for the open congressional seat in the suburban 3rd Congressional District, gave a presentation on the green energy issue Monday at the Humphrey Institute. The Humphrey's Center for the Study of Politics and Governance will have all three 3rd District contenders this week for solo, substantive talks on a subject of each candidate's choice.\Madia made a strong a presentation of a case that most candidates seem to be pitching this year: That U.S. overconsumption of oil and other carbon-based fuels, and overreliance on foreign sources for it, is hurting the environment (global warming which, for some reason, we are all supposed to now call ""global climate change""), the U.S. economy (Madia said half of the U.S. $700 billion trade deficit is represented by the purchase of foreign oil) and U.S. national security (the oil boom strengthens many nations that don't like America very much).\On the last point, quoting columnist Tom Friedman, Madia said, ""we are funding both sides in the war on terror.""\The solution, you guessed it, various government initiatives, mostly tax incentives, to promote the development of solar, wind, ethanol and other renewable energy sources, plus mass transit and cars that can run on electricity.\In what is a widely used pitch for what is portrayed as a win-win-win-win and several more wins idea, Madia said that progress on clean new energy sources will not only mitigate the triple threat (as above) represented by overreliance on foreign oil, but also can spur a sustainable economic boom by making the exporter of these new technologies to the world.\A favorite quote\Madia, who has always impressed me as a speaker, showed mastery of the facts and arguments, which he laid out via a PowerPoint presentation. My personal favorite slide, which Madia didn't actually mention, was a quote from early 20th century writer/activist Upton Sinclair that went like this: ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon not understanding it."" (I suppose someone should alert Madia that Sinclair was a socialist, but it would be a shame to lose such a great quote, with so many applications.)\During a question-and-answer session, led by Humphrey Institute polysci guru Larry Jacobs, Madia continued to impress with the depth of his vocabulary and understanding on energy issues (many of which, I confess, were over my head). He said carbon sequestration technology is feasible and promising. He endorsed the cap-and-trade approach to limiting greenhouse gases. He said he ""probably"" would not favor government price controls in the energy field, that additional drilling for offshore oil might be part of the overall solution but not on a carte blanche basis that he accuses some Republicans of advocating. He said he was open to some nuclear energy as part (but not a big part) of the picture, then listed many impediments to a resurgence of nuke power plants in the United States.\For me, the weakest part of Madia's presentation was his failure to identify any costs that ordinary Americans might have to bear to make his green energy vision come true. More mass transit? Yes, Madia said, but not at the cost or more roads for cars. Increase the federal tax on gas to pay for the subsidies for green technology or to make alternative energy more cost competitive? ""I don't think we're there,"" Madia said. All of his ideas, he said, can be paid for by ending tax breaks given to the oil companies, by repealing tax breaks for companies that move U.S. jobs overseas, by ending the Iraq war, by giving the federal government authority to negotiate Medicare drug prices and by painless efficiencies in health care (""electronic medical records"") that will save tens of billions.\Sacrifices?\Maybe so. I don't know enough about those miraculous electronic medical records and Madia, like almost every candidate, denounces the ballooning national debt. When asked explicitly what sacrifices ordinary, non-corporate citizens might have to make, either to balance the budget or to foster the green energy revolution that will improve all of our lives and save the planet, he said pretty much what Barack Obama said to a similar question during the second presidential debate:\Madia (and Obama) will ask Americans to conserve energy, maybe by driving less, and to recycle more. To me, that's not imposing sacrifice unless you're prepared to mandate changes that people don't want to make. Maybe it's some secret Calvinist gene, but I do get nervous when anyone offers to sell me something for nothing.\Erik Paulsen, Madia's Repub opponent, will speak at the Humphrey at noon today on a subject of his choosing that he had not yet disclosed as of Monday noon.\Credit: Erik Black"
54,"Gustavus Adolphus College put a physicist, a geoscientist, an engineer and an economist all in the same room and asked them how to save the Earth's environment. \They all said: Put a price on carbon dioxide. \No joke. \Make it more expensive for industry to continue spewing the greenhouse gases than not, and clean alternatives will have to follow, said the world-class scientists who gathered Tuesday and Wednesday for ""Heating Up: The Energy Debate,"" the 43rd annual Nobel Conference at the small liberal-arts college in St. Peter, Minn. \The expert lineup had different favorites among the new technologies - solar and wind, ""biomass"" fuel, ""clean coal"" and hydrogen-powered cars among them. But they were united on these points: If you don't believe in global warming, get over that. In fact, inject the issue into the current elections, all the way up to president. And make conservation part of your daily life - such as switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs. \""We really are talking about a different planet if we don't do anything,"" said Jim Hansen, lead climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. \The audience of 6,500 rose for two standing ovations, both for men dedicated to convincing the unconvinced that the Earth is in the midst of a man-made warming. \Hansen was one, credited for sounding the alarm since the 1980s, even when his employer is unhappy with him. \The other was for Minnesota's own polar explorer, Will Steger, who came with photos of huge stretches of ice on the top and bottom of the world that he once crossed by dogsled and now are gone. \In his presentation, Hansen warned that the Earth is on course to warm by 3 degrees Celsius over the century - enough to raise sea level by 25 meters (82 feet). Cutting gases - the vast majority, carbon dioxide (CO2) - enough to drop that to 1 degree Celsius, may just avert a ""tipping point,"" where global warming becomes self-perpetuating and beyond human control, he said. \On Minnesota's current warming path, a decade from now its summers will resemble those in Kansas today, said J. Drake Hamilton, science policy director for Fresh Energy, a St. Paul-based clean-energy advocate. \. \Worked for acid rain \Paul Joskow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said putting a price on carbon dioxide springs from a basic motivational principle: ""The rat needs to smell the cheese."" \The whole system would work like this: The country caps its carbon dioxide emissions at a certain level, then deals out ""pollution permits"" to companies and utilities up to that cap. If anyone spills out more CO2 than it can cover with its permits, it has to buy some from others that don't need all of theirs - Joskow figures at about $50 per ton. It's called ""cap and trade,"" and it makes pollution expensive and clean energy profitable. \Joskow would even give some permits to consumers, so they get a share of the wealth in this new marketplace. \The method worked before in this country, virtually eliminating the sulphur dioxide emissions behind acid rain, he said. \Corn ethanol was recognized as the only commercially viable new energy really up and running. Already 20 percent of the state's corn crop goes into ethanol production, and one in 10 service stations here carry the E85 fuel, according to industry experts. That accounts for one-fourth of all the E85 pumps in the country. \The scientists criticized corn ethanol for all the fossil fuel used in growing the corn - including fertilizers, tractor fuel and irrigation systems - and processing it to fuel. After all that, it comes in at just 10 to 20 percent below regular gasoline, said Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics and director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. \. \A breakthrough away \All the other energies-of-the-future at the conference are at least one breakthrough short of practical utility. \One of the most promising - converting nonedible ""biomass"" such as tall grasses, plant stalks and wood chips into fuel - is still looking for an affordable conversion process, Chu said. One avenue of exploration involves termites, whose digestive systems manage this naturally with wood, he said. \The hurdles for solar and wind energy, most environmentalists' favorites, are large-scale storage and distribution. \The technology for ""clean coal"" exists - turning the old standby to a gas, generating energy, and catching all the CO2 before it blows out the smokestack. But it's very expensive, and requires burying all that CO2 underground, probably in old oil fields. \Cars that run on hydrogen came off as the most exciting but farthest-off alternative. The cars - and many carmakers have demonstration models - are powered by a fuel cell, where hydrogen and oxygen go in, and pure energy and water come out, explained Joan Ogden, co-director of the Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways Program at the University of California, Davis. The problem is most hydrogen now is produced with fossil fuels. \The most likely future is some mix of these new technologies, the scientists said, but they warned the days of cheap energy are over. \""It's all going to increase energy prices, and anyone who tells you it isn't is lying,"" Joskow said. \. \H.J.

55,"It isn't as famous as Grover Norquist's ""Taxpayer Protection Pledge,"" but the billionaire Koch Brothers have apparently been getting candidates to sign a pledge to oppose any effort to address climate change by imposing a net tax on the sale and use of fossil fuels. (The Kochs are in the fossil fuel game.)\Signatories to the pledge promise to vote against ""legislation relating to climate change unless it is accompanied by an equivalent amount of tax cuts."" And they've had quite a bit of success.\An American University-based outfit called The Investigative Reporting Workshop has released a reporting project on the Kochs, their campaign spending, and the pledge. Here's a little chunk:\""An analysis by the Investigative Reporting Workshop found that from 2007 through 2011, Koch private foundations gave $41.2 million to 89 nonprofit organizations and an annual libertarian conference. Koch Industries and Charles and David Koch contributed $8.7 million to candidates and the Republican Party in the three election cycles between 2007 through 2012. In addition, Koch private foundations contributed $30.5 million to 221 U.S. colleges and universities and $46.3 million to the arts and other more traditionally charitable purposes during this period.\And while Koch Industries' lobbyists were spending $53.9 million to further the giant corporation's federal and state policy agenda, the nonprofits it funded were simultaneously 'educating' the public and lawmakers about energy, the environment and other issues in public testimony on Capitol Hill.\For example, in 2011 and 2012, Koch Industries Public Sector LLC, the lobbying arm of Koch Industries, advocated for the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which would have rolled back the Supreme Court's ruling that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could regulate greenhouse gases. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and co-signed by 92 Republicans (and three Democrats), 61 of whom signed an anti-climate tax 'pledge.' An economist with the American Council for Capital Formation -- a nonprofit group that receives Koch money -- testified about that same bill before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Margo Thorning told members of the House in February 2011 that regulation of greenhouse gas emissions 'makes little economic or environmental sense,' according to her testimony.""\Jane Mayer of the New Yorker writes that ""Since most solutions to the problem of greenhouse-gas emissions require costs to the polluters and the public, the pledge essentially commits those who sign to it to vote against nearly any meaningful bill regarding global warning, and acts as yet another roadblock to action.\Piggy-backing on the Workshop's findings, Mayer put up a summary that emphasizes the pledge, including:\""Starting in 2008, a year after the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency could regulate greenhouse gasses as a form of pollution, accelerating possible Congressional action on climate change, the Koch-funded nonprofit group, Americans for Prosperity, devised the 'No Climate Tax' pledge. It has been, according to the study, a component of a remarkably successful campaign to prevent lawmakers from addressing climate change. Two successive efforts to control greenhouse-gas emissions by implementing cap-and-trade energy bills died in the Senate, the latter of which was specifically targeted by A.F.P.'s pledge. By now, four hundred and eleven current office holders nationwide have signed the pledge. Signatories include the entire Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, a third of the members of the House of Representatives as a whole, and a quarter of U.S. senators.\The 2010 mid-term elections were a high watermark for the pledge. The Kochs, like many other conservative benefactors, gave generously to efforts to help shift the majority in the House of Representatives from Democratic to Republican. Koch Industries' political action committee spent $1.3 million on congressional campaigns that year. When Republicans did take control of the House, a huge block of climate-change opponents was empowered. Fully one hundred and fifty-six members of the House of Representatives that year had signed the 'No Climate Tax Pledge.' Of the eighty-five freshmen Republican congressmen elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, seventy-six had signed the No Climate Tax pledge. Fifty-seven of those received campaign contributions from Koch Industries' political action committee. The study notes that more than half of the House members who signed the pledge in the 112th Congress made statements doubting climate-change science, despite the fact that there is overwhelming scientific consensus on the subject.""\Credit: Eric Black"
56,"http://www.flickr.com/photos/trp0/ / CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\St. Paul Ford Plant, which has been teetering on closure for years.\While Gov. Tim Pawlenty is urging Minnesota to ""do all we can do to help"" keep the St. Paul Ford Plant open and protect nearly 1,000 jobs, critics say his administration is working behind the scenes on a plan that would hasten the plant's demise.\In his final State of the State address Thursday that focused on jobs, Pawlenty asked legislators to create a special ""CARZ"" zone around the 84-year-old plant that Ford Motor Co. has said will close next year because of waning demand for the light-duty Ranger pickup built there. Pawlenty's plan is tailored after his controversial JOBZ program that targets tax breaks to stimulate economic development in depressed areas.\But last fall in Washington, D.C., Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Gene Hugoson led -- and is still pushing -- an effort critics say would dismantle an alliance of auto manufacturers, labor unions and the Obama's administration to improve fuel efficiency of American-made vehicles -- a plan seen as a bright ray of hope to keep the St. Paul plant open.\Hugoson is supporting a proposal by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, to strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of authority to regulate green-house gas emissions, the bulk of which come from passenger vehicles.\Critics of the Murkowski proposal say it could derail the alliance that has taken years to put together and slow down a paradigm shift by auto industry to bring build smaller and more fuel efficient cars that produce less carbon and other emissions linked to climate change.\""Pawlenty's positions and rhetoric are inconsistent,"" said state Rep. Jeremey Kalin, DFL-North Branch, a member of a national coalition of state legislators formed to promote initiatives to address climate change.\Kalin said that the Ford Plant, which has been teetering on closure for years, is a candidate to produce of the kind of fuel-efficient vehicles that automakers and the Obama administration see as the future of car-making. Supporters say the Ford Plant line could be easily adapted to build small, fuel-efficient cars and trucks.\Kalin said Murkowski's proposal endangers the future of the Ford Plant.\'Uncomfortable' with EPA rules\Hugoson, first appointed Minnesota agriculture commission by Gov. Arne Carlson in 1995, crafted a resolution supporting the Murkowski plan and won endorsement from the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\Hugoson said he and other ag commissioners ""are uncomfortable with the EPA putting together regulations that could affect agriculture.""\Hugoson noted farmers use small trucks in their operations, that food is delivered nationally in trucks and that these vehicles would be subject to regulation.\Hugoson said he informed Pawlenty's office that he planned to offer his resolution supporting Murkowski's efforts to stop the EPA's rulemaking, ""and I didn't hear back, so I just went ahead and did it.""\Hugoson said he did not consult with the Minnesota Office of Energy Security or the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, both of which have led the Pawlenty administration's involvement in energy policy matters.\""I didn't think I needed to consult with them,"" Hugoson said.\Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung did not directly address Hugoson's position on the Murkowski proposal, but said in a statement that the governor opposes another major environmental proposal, so-called cap-and-trade legislation, before Congress.\Update: McClung issued another response -- which is on the right of this page -- after this story was posted.\How agreement came about\Responding to a U.S. Supreme Court decision three years ago ruling that the federal Clean Air Act required the EPA to regulate carbon emissions and to the 2007 Energy Security Act that requires improved fuel-economy in passenger vehicles, the Obama administration in May put together the alliance of automakers, unions and the EPA to promote a cleaner car industry. The objective is to require an average fuel efficiency of 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016 model-year vehicles.\Passage of the Energy Act, signed by President George W. Bush, was the first time in nearly 30 years that the auto industry was unable to resist improved fuel-economy standards, requirements initiated by President Gerald Ford in 1975 in response to the Arab oil embargo.\The law, together with massive federal subsidies to the auto industry to retool its lines to build cleaner cars, spawned a concerted push by Obama, automakers, unions, several states and environmental advocates to build smaller cars with much improved mileage.\The push gave a boost to supporters of the St. Paul Ford Plant, who have long seen clean-car production as the plant's best hope to remain open.\But the counter-push by Murkowski could throw a wrench in the effort, and the Obama administration, together with clean-air advocates and the auto industry, have worked to derail the senator's plan.\Energy Secretary Steven Chu has said legislation containing Murkowski's language would be vetoed by President Obama, and that threat helped Democratic leaders block an amendment Murkowski offered in September that would have prevented the EPA from issuing greenhouse-gas regulations for one year.\The Murkowski amendment has been criticized by automakers. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said [PDF] the senator's plan could ""subject automakers to a patchwork of state and federal regulations.""\Kalin said that Murkowski and her Congressional supporters -- which, she says, number more than 30 senators and representatives -- will now seek to block the EPA through the Congressional Review Act that can overrule any regulation by passing a House-Senate joint resolution.\Ron Way covers the environment and energy issues.

57,"If you want to keep tabs on the progress of the climate talks that started this week in Paris, and -- in the longer run -- on the efforts to prevent the worst effects of global warming, it's worth keeping an eye on one major country.\It's not China or the United States. Those two countries are important, of course, because they emit more greenhouse gases than any others.\Instead, watch what India does.\After launching the climate summit with fine words stressing the importance of the endeavor, President Obama and other world leaders have returned home, leaving the details of a global agreement in the hands of their negotiating teams.\Much of what the leaders said was predictable. Some of it was surprising. Obama expressed optimism about the world's ability to tackle the problem, and touted the importance of U.S. leadership (even while Republicans in Congress were passing legislation that would undercut a major piece of the U.S. effort). Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has a history of mocking worries about climate change, surprised many by calling it ""one of gravest challenges humanity is facing"" (while offering little new by way of a solution).\If implemented, plans submitted by 146 countries would limit the increase in the globe's temperature to 2.7 degrees Celsius. That falls short of the goal of 2 degrees, which scientists say is the threshold for avoiding the most serious effects of climate change. Even that level of reduction will be difficult to achieve.\Major consequences for India\India is subject to all the crosscurrents that make the issue so difficult for the Paris negotiating teams, and their bosses back home.\It is a country of global ambition that will need vast new sources of energy to keep growing its economy, bring millions out of poverty, and keep pace with an increasing population. But the cheapest way to provide that energy, fossil fuels, will only increase the impact of climate change, and probably will make India's food and water resources less secure.\Here is a World Bank summary of what could happen in India: erratic monsoons resulting sometimes in floods, sometimes in drought, rising sea levels affecting both urban centers and agricultural areas, and even warmer temperatures, among them.\Through years of international negotiations, India also has been a leading voice among developing nations. They are demanding steeper cuts in emissions from rich countries, and well-funded efforts to help poorer countries deal with the effects of climate change and develop new sources of clean energy. Those are some of the biggest issues that must be addressed before the Paris summit can achieve a binding agreement to cut carbon emissions.\Like Obama -- and virtually every other national leader -- India's officials face political pressure at home. Climate change isn't only an international issue. In very many countries, it's a very big domestic issue, as well. In India, climate change will have very concrete effects, which will carry major political consequences.\A problem they didn't create\Two facts about India's carbon emissions help illustrate the country's rather unique position. According to one of the charts in this handy BBC primer on climate change, India produces about 6 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, putting it in the top 10 polluters. But its emissions per person are a fraction of those in the U.S. or China.\Indian officials say they are being pressed to help solve a problem they didn't create.\Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, quoted in this article, argues forcefully that India will have to rely on fossil fuels such as coal in addition to rapidly increasing its use of renewables. ""My energy consumption is one twelfth that of U.S. and one tenth that of Europe, so don't you think that my people also have a right to grow and use energy? ... Should they remain in the dark? Is that humanity? That is why I will need power from all sources.""\Some experts argue that for the United States, the relationship with India on climate change may in the future become more important than that with China.\Obama, who considers the issue to be an important part of his legacy, courted Chinese President Xi Jinping and came away with an agreement last year to tackle the issue together. China now says its emissions will peak in 2030, if not before, and Xi says the country will institute a cap-and-trade system for key industries.\Obama has tried to woo India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, as well. The climate conference will help show whether he has had any success.\Billionaires offer help\It's likely to come down to a question of money, and India will negotiate hard. Help may come from an unlikely source.\While governments struggle to find the money to assist India and other developing countries, some of the world's richest people, including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, stepped in this week to dedicate billions of dollars to a clean-energy fund. Their announcement coincides with an initiative 20 governments, including the U.S.\The idea, says John Healey of the Los Angeles Times, is that the governments would fund basic research, while the business leaders would focus on bringing ideas to market.\The billionaires group includes two from India. In addition, according to this New York Times report, Obama and French President Francois Hollande, the host of the climate talks, have been working with Gates to find ways to accommodate Modi.\Credit: Mark Porubcansky"
58,"John Watson, CEO of one of the world's largest energy companies, spoke last week in Minneapolis about rising U.S. oil and gas production, the need for new pipelines and the case for allowing U.S. crude oil exports.\Chevron's top executive also took questions from the audience after his speech to the Economic Club of Minnesota, and from reporters in a separate session. Here are some of the questions and answers. A longer version is on the 3D Economics blog:\Q: A question on infrastructure. What do we need to do to continue to build out to where we should be?\A: There's a great deal of effort that's needed locally in the area of gathering lines and major trunk lines. The Keystone pipeline is the most visible example, but Canada has infrastructure requirements that they need to put in place by going east to west. We have issues with natural gas. Think about it this way. We're shutting down nuclear plants in the Northeast. We're shutting down coal-fired plants in the Northeast. Where is the energy going to come from? It's going to come from natural gas that needs to be imported to the area. How's it going to move to the area? We have to have pipelines. And you better have capacity that will be sufficient both at the wellhead and in the pipelines to meet seasonality requirements ... The industry has to do its part, whether it's the joint work that's being done with the rail industry on safety, of moving products out of Bakken and elsewhere in this country. We need to keep the trains on the tracks, and over time need to upgrade the rail cars that are being used. We have to have good assurances in place, particularly with some of the aging pipelines.\Q: I'm interested in your projections for oil prices, because there has been downward pressure. What would be the effect of changing oil prices on our economy?\A: My general view is that oil markets are pretty well supplied today. On the other hand, there's relatively little true surplus capacity. The only country that has voluntary spare capacity now is Saudi Arabia. There's some capacity that's been offline because of some of the civil strife around the world ... Unlike the typical manufacturer, where you build a plant and then it's online forever and that capacity doesn't go away, in our business there's this thing called the decline curve, and so it requires perpetual reinvestment. Some oil fields have long, slow declines. Some, like those in the unconventional business, the shales, have very rapid declines ... The break-even cost for most supplies is in many cases $100 and higher. Some it's lower, but over time... you're going to see prices stay at or near the level they are, or potentially higher.\Q: You mentioned three objectives for good energy policy, one being preserving the environment. Where does curbing greenhouse gas emissions fit into that, and what can Chevron do to help?\A: ...I'm not aware of a company that has done more than my company. It's worth noting that, because I do understand the concerns that are out there, I understand the risks of climate change. My company has the largest carbon storage project in the world in Australia. We and our partners are spending $2 billion. We're a part of a carbon sequestration project in Canada. These are among the very largest in the world. We're the largest renewables producer, thanks to our geothermal business ... Here in the United States, we're fortunate. Because of the boom in shale gas, it is naturally displacing coal. Here we have a circumstance where the U.S. is reducing its greenhouse gas emissions without significant intervention in the markets. There's been a great deal of conversation about a carbon tax, or other vehicles, cap and trade. We have one in California. If you think about pollution markets in general, they've been effective when you've had local pollution to deal with, and all emitters could be included. The U.S. is 16 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and falling. It's estimated that without much change we'll be at 13 percent ... You need global engagement on those mechanisms for them to be effective, in my opinion.\Q: What do you see as the prospect, moving forward, of the U.S. exporting crude oil?\A: This is one of the issues that should be allowed on inspection. It doesn't need a lot of discussion when you think about it. Right now, we can export oil products -- gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. What you consume can be exported. You don't consume crude oil. It's just an ingredient in the products. We can put more oil on world markets if we don't artificially constrain U.S. exports of oil ... As a practical matter, the imbalance we have in the United States is that we're producing more light oil, which doesn't fit our refineries very well. So the idea would be to export lighter oil that is being produced out of the shales and import heavier oil to fill out our refineries. It's more of an economic efficiency argument. We have some big projects underway to export natural gas from the Gulf Coast of the U. S. ... I think the U.S. can do a great service to the world's economy by exporting natural gas to help the economies of Europe and Asia develop and have access to cheaper sources of energy than they would otherwise have. So I'm bullish on both, just as I favor exporting farm products and a variety of other goods.\Q: Can you comment on the policy implications of the rise of the Islamic State and instability in North Africa and Nigeria?\A: The effect on the ground of course is very difficult and heart-rending for the people involved. It's significant. People displaced. The impacts that are being felt on the business will in time also be significant. It's hard to get drilling engineers and geologists and the talent to go to places that have these kinds of instabilities. While some oil will continue to be produced in some of the hottest areas, I think over time you'll see investment slow and production decline. Now, there's enormous potential in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq. My company has a presence in Kurdistan, and we evacuated our expatriots, who will return in due course when it is safe to do so. We also have significant business in Nigeria. Most of the conflict you described is in the north. The oil-producing region is to the south. But all of these trends where government is overwhelmed and society becomes dysfunctional, I don't think they're good for consumers, they're not good for people, and they're not good for developing energy resources, where that's possible.\Adam Belz - 612-673-4405 Twitter: @adambelz\Credit: ADAM BELZ; STAFF WRITER"
59,"MINNESOTA'S RIVERS The three-part series ""Danger Downstream"" (Oct. 2-4) is prophetic. Minnesotans/Americans need to be made aware of the immediate danger to not only our rivers and lakes but our drinking water. Phosphorus/nitrates are choking our water. The comments in the articles like ""We are going downhill"" and ""it's like a big gun barrel ... we are on the other end"" are spot-on. I have a cabin that is being choked to death, and there are many, many other lakes and rivers in Minnesota that are impaired. Any person who lives, works or plays on the water needs to be involved. We need to ask ourselves, politicians, farmers, corporations like Cargill (with headquarters in Minnesota) and universities to be invested in making change through conservation and research.Bill White, EaganALLINA NURSES' STRIKEIn whose interest is their resistance? Theirs? Everyone's?I am all for organized labor, collective bargaining, the right to strike, etc., but have found myself struggling to empathize with the union representing Allina nurses after reading Tuesday's front-page article (""Allina nurses reject contract with 'resounding' no, stay on strike"").If I understand correctly, the primary sticking point in the negotiations is health insurance, and the union's desire to protect its no- or low-deductible health plans instead of joining the standard corporate health plan that the rest of the company has.From my perspective, the days of gold-plated health insurance are long gone. The majority of Minnesotans, me included, have been dealing with high-deductible health insurance plans for over a decade now.Health insurance costs continue to spiral out of control, and as a result the vast majority of working Minnesotans have seen their premiums and deductibles rise in tandem, year over year. It's a painful reality and a byproduct of the unsustainable rise of health care costs.The article states that the latest offer to the union included provisions to leave two of the current plans untouched through 2019, and then cap them after that at 7 percent over a three-year period. On paper, that sounds like a reasonable offer to me. I think the majority of us would jump at such an opportunity in our current health insurance environment.And so I'm having a hard time empathizing with the union. To think a select few should continue to enjoy the gold-plated health insurance of years gone by is unrealistic at best, and at worst unfair to the rest of us who continue to shoulder the higher premiums and deductibles required to support the current system.Brad McFaul, Rosemount- - - Martin Shkreli bought a drug company and raised the U.S. price of a pill for parasitic infection from $14 to $750. He cannot make that huge price increase in Japan, Germany and most other industrialized countries, but in the U.S. he can do it because of our obsession with avoiding regulation. Japan is strongly capitalistic (it has few natural resources), but its Health Ministry sets all the prices, and the drug companies must accept them. Germany requires all of its 240 ""sickness funds"" (insurers) to collectively negotiate the prices with the drug companies. The Germans have learned there is strength in collective bargaining.My wife (a nurse on strike) wants to keep her collectively bargained union health insurance, and she voted accordingly on Monday. If she is forced by Allina to give that up, her out-of-pocket maximum, which is now $500 in the union plan, will increase to $4,500 in Allina's core plan in the year in which the change occurs. As her husband, the same numbers apply to me, so together we could incur an $8,000 increase. Too much!Nurses, demand to keep your union health plan, and continue advocating to achieve affordable health care for all Americans.Mark Nelson, AftonMINNEAPOLIS CRIMENew approach to gangs seems like little more than a showSo Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and Police Chief Janee Harteau are going to spend $250,000 to solve the gang problem (""Shootings spark pledge for gang reform efforts,"" Oct. 4). Let's look at the dynamics. Hire a program administrator for, say, $75,000, an assistant, a press representative; staff the offices with cellphones, car allowances, rent, paid interns to do the work, a holistic consultant, coffee and doughnuts for the ""gang summit,"" and some T-shirts with a novel theme. A grand opening gala, balloons and Kool-Aid. Meanwhile, a whole generation of people will be ignored, forgotten, continued to be buried while the politicians continue to pat themselves on the back. Gun buybacks, hire a grant writer to reapply for the grant next year, a party for the businesses that are suffering downtown property damage and a contingency fund for the next public uprising ...What is left? Surely nothing for the kids.David Bordwell, MinneapolisVOTINGTurnout numbers matter in an election and referendumIn the referendum held in Hungary (""Hungary: Anti-quotas vote invalidated,"" Oct. 3), 98.8 percent of respondents rejected the idea of mandatory European Union quotas for accepting asylum seekers and migrants. An astonishing number. Forty-four percent of eligible voters cast a ballot. To validate the vote, the current government a few years ago raised the bar from 25 percent participation (undemocratic) to 50 percent (democratic). By the latter criterion, the vote is invalid.On the same day, Colombians voted to accept or reject the peace treaty negotiated between the government and the FARC rebels. The voters by a razor-thin margin (50.25 vs. 49.75 percent) rejected the treaty (""Colombia votes no on peace accord,"" Oct. 3). The Star Tribune called the result ""stunning."" The voter turnout was 40 percent.In the U.S., about 52 percent of voters turn out to vote in a presidential election year and between 40 to 45 percent in a nonpresidential election year.Geza Simon, MinneapolisCLIMATE CHANGECanada sets an example for the U.S. to emulateCongratulations to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for announcing that his government will impose a nationwide tax on fossil fuels (""Canada plans to implement carbon tax,"" Oct. 4). As Trudeau said, ""the effects of climate change itself cannot be denied. There is no hiding from climate change. It is real, and it is everywhere.""Like Canada, every community in Minnesota is subject to the risks of climate change: frequent floods, droughts and wildfires. Just last month, another record-setting rainfall damaged Waseca and other communities in the southern part of the state.The Minnesota Department of Health has identified the climate hazards that can sicken and kill us: increased air pollution, extreme heat, flood, drought, insect-borne diseases and harmful algal blooms in our lakes. We feel these hazards in both our bodies and our pocketbooks.Congress can emulate Canada and put a tax on carbon-emitting fossil fuels, return 100 percent of the revenue to U.S. households, and both promote renewable energy and reduce the greenhouse gases. This market-based approach can satisfy both conservatives and liberals. We can protect U.S. producers and farmers by putting a border tariff on imported goods from counties that don't tax carbon (though even China is experimenting with cap-and-trade policies) and thus encourage international action on climate.We can cheer on elected leaders who acknowledge the reality of climate change and are willing to take meaningful action to halt it. Let's remember them when we vote in November.Claudia Egelhoff, West St. Paul"
60,"LETTER OF THE DAY: When city councils get their hands on trans fat, watch out \The Jan. 18 article about Minneapolis and St. Paul preparing ordinances to ban trans fat is exactly what I wrote about when these same nanny-state politicians banned smoking. What is next, I asked? \Apparently oblivious to the fact that a trans fat ban in New York City is forcing some chefs there to abandon butter because it contains small amounts of natural trans fat, the nannies who run Minneapolis and St. Paul will vote to take choices about what to eat away from you the consumer, cooks and restaurant owners and place all authority in the hands of the bureaucrats. \Little did Minneapolis and St. Paul voters know when they voted in the last elections that they were electing chefs-in-chief. Never mind that naturally occurring trans fats may help prevent cancer, according to research at Cornell University. Never mind that some people may prefer to eat foods made with trans fats over foods made with high levels of saturated fat, such as palm and coconut oils. The cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul know better. I am sure their nanny-state liberals in the Legislature will propose a statewide ban next. \Having completed its work on trans fats, the city councils of Minneapolis and St. Paul will be searching the universe for things to ban. Please help: What would you like to see them tackle next? \DAVID ANDERSON, LONSDALE \. \OBAMA'S INAUGURAL SPEECH \Let's hope the left doesn't douse his realism \While President Obama's goal of a new beginning between the United States and the Muslim world is admirable, for pundits to suggest his comments are a break with the Bush administration is nonsense. But I hope this deception works. It gives Muslims yet another opportunity to close ranks with the Western world against the extremist Islamists. \I'm guessing most Americans have forgotten that one of George W. Bush's best speeches soon after 9/11 made a significant distinction between most Muslims and terrorists who want to kill and destroy Western society. He was extraordinarily gracious and inclusive to the Muslim world. \Thank goodness for the U.S. electoral system, which enables the perception of change so folks will be open to previously rejected initiatives. That's not to say there won't be real, substantive and positive change. But much of what is perceived as change will be rebranded initiatives. For me, what's most exciting about Obama's election is the promise of a less adversarial and more inclusive, civil dialogue that will inspire others to follow his example. \Frankly, this is why I'm such a supporter of Obama. He's said what he needed to do to be elected, but so far he's been a realist. I'm hoping this is his nature, but it also stems from now being accountable for results rather than just critiquing those who are. That's why we've seen Obama change his positions on the timeline for getting out of Iraq, offshore drilling, tax policy, direct talks with Iran, Korea and Venezuela without preconditions, etc. I hope he'll be able to resist the myopic and dogmatic extremists in his party so he can continue down the realistic path he's charted. But since he campaigned on a total rejection of the Bush administration, it will take all his extraordinary charisma and eloquence to do something else. \JOHN NERDAHL, Lakeville \--- \Barack Obama's inauguration was an outstanding event and a unique addition to our country's history. I wish President Obama the very best, and I'll continue to pray for his success. Unfortunately, the left is seeing fit to spew its ad homonym by badmouthing George W. Bush, the vitriol being led by Star Tribune commentary editor Eric Ringham. \I would think that this epochal event would be positively and singularly dedicated to our new president. It should be exclusively Obama's time in the sun, not spoiled by regurgitated remarks demeaning Mr. Bush. \BILL FITZGERALD, MINNETONKA \. \Energy future shouldn't include a Big Stone II \Tuesday's inauguration speech was a clarion call to all Americans: We need to repower, refuel and rebuild America in a way that jump-starts our economy, creates new jobs and helps protect our environment, especially by reducing global warming pollution. The recent Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) decision to allow the Big Stone II coal plant to move forward is a giant step backward. \We should be sending a price signal to the market that the old polluting technologies of the past have seen their last bailout and it's the growing clean energy economy that will help put America back on track to be a leader in innovation and sustainability. The best policy mechanism to deliver that market incentive is a cap-and-trade program to limit and lower global warming pollution. \CARIN SKOOG, \GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS COORDINATOR, \FRESH ENERGY, ST. PAUL \. \'ALL DESERVE A CHANCE' \How will Obama apply that to abortion? \In the wake of President Obama's inauguration, it is tempting to use today, the 36th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, to recite a litany of policies we want our new administration to enact. While policy changes are important, they will remain vulnerable to the ebb and flow of politics if we do not also help change the public conversation about abortion. \We know that women have abortions for many reasons. Even if we disagree on the issue of abortion, we can agree that we should respect and support a woman and her family as they face the life-altering decision of whether to have a child. \While each woman's life is different, we all care about life and about doing our best for the people we love. When we bring children into the world we want them to have the opportunity to live a good life. And we want to build a better future for our children and grandchildren. \Abortion and reproductive freedom more broadly defined are important pieces of ensuring this common dream. As with all freedoms, there are limits. But a government that respects the personal integrity of its people both interferes in these essentially private decisions as little as possible and helps ensure that everyone has the opportunity to make these decisions responsibly. \LORRAINE KENNY, Reproductive \Freedom Project, ACLU, New York \--- \During his inaugural address, President Obama stated, ""The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness."" \I am saddened to learn that within 24 hours of the president's first address to our nation he is preparing to sign an executive order to fund international abortions. He obviously is not concerned that all have ""a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness,"" such as poor women and their preborn children in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia. \Obama promised to decrease abortions during his campaign. I fail to see how increased funding for abortion around the world will bring about fewer abortions. \JO TOLCK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, \HUMAN LIFE ALLIANCE, MINNEAPOLIS"
61,"We've heard the presidential candidates weigh in on matters such as marriage and bathroom use. But are these truly the pressing issues of our day? Shawn Otto thinks they should be talking instead about science. The next president is going to be dealing with agriculture and clean water supply, health care and pandemics, energy policy and the impacts of climate change, and myriad other matters that depend on science for solutions -- yet few candidates are willing to even talk about it.\""Science has a huge PR problem. We need to re-educate the public and the media about science in order to solve most of the problems we will face in the near future,"" said Otto. ""We are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The world is beginning to see catastrophic flooding and fires due to climate change. Clean water is becoming a global scarcity. This country loses $300 billion every year to mental health issues. Mike Osterholm is worried that Ebola is going to make a comeback in Kinshasa -- a city with 11 million people -- and Obama just moved funding away from the fight against Ebola and put it into Zika because Congress wouldn't approve enough Zika funding. All of these issues come back to science. We need to talk about it if we are going to solve these problems.""\In advance of the 2008 election, Otto, along with Science Debate 2008, a grass-roots campaign supported by leading scientific institutions, pushed the candidates to talk about science in public debates. Barack Obama and John McCain ultimately declined to participate in a science debate. [However, they did answer questions for an online version.] Today, Science Debate is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization and they are trying again to make science part of public policy discussion.\Otto says a science debate is still a possibility this year, although the candidates didn't touch science in the primary season. ""All of America's leading science organizations are working together on this to get them to engage on these questions in the general election. The candidates may choose to engage outside of the debate format, either in a town hall forum, or a sequential forum with a single moderator. We are talking with a couple of different networks about this possibility, and will also be exploring getting questions into other debates and engaging online.""\Otto's new book, ""The War on Science: Who's Waging It, Why It Matters, What We Can Do About It"" (Milkweed Editions) discusses how anti-intellectualism has hampered progress, endangered life and redirected public policy discussions away from things that impact everyone.\MinnPost: Your book, ""Fool Me Twice: The Assault on Science in America,"" originally came out five years ago. Tell me how this new book is different.\Shawn Otto: Well, it was supposed to have been the paperback version, but when I looked at updating it, I realized that so much has changed in the past five years, and I ended up completely rewriting the book. Unfortunately, the changes aren't good: The war on science has accelerated. Anti-science interests have invested a lot of money in well-developed PR efforts to battle back attempts to include scientific understanding and reality in our public policy, and it's had a huge effect. In addition, my own understanding of the situation has evolved, and I wanted the book to reflect that.\MP: What specifically have you come to understand?\SO: I have a lot more clarity on how exactly the war on science is being waged. Science is a force for equality. When we base public policy on facts, we can make decisions that benefit everyone, not just specific companies or individuals. Science is the force that protects the least of us from the most powerful. But when science is not advantageous for powerful entities, big money comes in to influence public opinion. That is not limited to corporations or a particular political viewpoint. For instance, left-leaning academic institutions have extended identity politics to the point that some think there is no such thing as a scientific reality, that it's just a matter of perspective. But science ignores perspectives; it relies on facts. Similarly, journalism schools still teach people that there is no such thing as objectivity. When we extend that towards public policy, we can get into serious trouble.\MP: Give me an example.\SO: Vaccines. Many people on the left have bought into the anti-vaccines story, despite all scientific evidence to the contrary. And people on the right have, too. We saw that when Michele Bachmann weighed in on the HPV vaccine [claiming it caused 'mental retardation']. On that side, there is a strong focus on origins -- origins of the cosmos and origin stories relating to human reproduction. Both fundamentalist Islam and Christianity oppose science when it begins to talk about reproduction, and that focus on origins stories is so dominant that when they reject scientific information about origins, they also feel they have to reject all other scientific information, even when matters of health and the environment can have catastrophic effects on the future of humanity.\MP: Since Science Debate started, it seems we have seen some progress in the discussion about climate change. Politicians are recognizing it and dealing with its effects. Does that bode well for your efforts to bring it into the presidential conversation?\SO: Well, that is largely limited to the Minnesota media. MPR has the Climate Cast broadcast, which really illustrates the impact this topic has on nearly every other topic. MPR made a specific decision to drop the debate over whether or not climate change is real and just move forward on talking about its effects and implications. No other state does that. There are states that are dealing with catastrophic effects that are directly attributable to climate change, and their leadership refused to acknowledge it, despite the evidence of what their eyes are telling them. They may privately acknowledge it, but there are business interests, such as in coal country, that prevent them from saying a word. In the short-term, it is more profitable to pretend it isn't happening. We see some of this here in mining country.\MP: States aside, President Obama has been much more vocal about talking about climate change, though.\SO: Yes, but that has only started in the past year or so. After the failure of the cap and trade legislation, he didn't even talk about it. He could only use pro-business language and talk about clean tech or the new energy economy. That has changed, as it has had to. Drought, fire and flooding are going to impact the way the world governs. Other leaders are starting to discuss it, but many are going with the approach of, 'climate change is real but there's nothing we can do about it.'\MP: Do you think it's too late?\SO: No. It's not too late to do anything about it. We can devise a clean power plan. The technology is already here; we just need to refocus attention away from fossil fuels and look at a full adoption of a clean power plan. That includes incentives for things like geothermal and electric cars; deployment of current solar energy technology; and licensing of nuclear electric plants. The technology is in our hands right now, but the vast majority of incentives are still flowing to old methods.\Event\7 p.m. June 7. Open Book's Target Performance Hall. Book launch and discussion.

62,"A historic budget shortfall is certain to dominate the 2009 legislative session, which opens Tuesday. All parties predict, for now, that the scale of the problem will bring together Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty and majority DFLers in the Legislature. Don't be surprised if a few disagreements arise. Among the key issues: \. \budget \THE ISSUE: The task that will overshadow and determine the shape of all others will be erasing a projected $4.8 billion budget shortfall for the 2010-11 period. And that's without assuming any inflationary spending increases. Already last month, Gov. Tim Pawlenty acted to eliminate a $425 million deficit for the remainder of the current budget period, which ends June 30. Collapsing revenue from income taxes, sales taxes and capital gains taxes has produced the daunting deficit, which totals around 13 percent of the projected $35.7 billion budget for the two-year period starting July 1. \THE OUTLOOK: Legislative leaders and Pawlenty are pledging a new spirit of cooperation, in recognition of the enormous challenge they face. But that is likely to be tested quickly. Pawlenty says he will adhere to his no-new-taxes mantra. He will present a budget proposal, but the Legislature, where DFLers hold heavy majorities in both chambers, will craft the final version. \State agencies and local governments already are bracing for large cuts, with agencies expected to absorb reductions in the 5 to 10 percent range. State aid to local governments already was targeted to help fix the short-term deficit for the current budget cycle, and many local communities are threatening significant cuts in basic services such as police and fire protection if the reductions continue. Pawlenty has dismissed those concerns as the-sky-is-falling rhetoric and said that cities and counties that cut public safety have misplaced budget priorities. \Many other possibilities exist, including the sale or lease of state assets such as public land, the State Lottery and the airport. Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said he is interested in long-term structural change in the budget process and doesn't want mere budget shifts to mask the problem. But it's reasonable to assume that every available shift will be made. \. \taxes \THE ISSUE: Despite a general tighten-the-belt-and-cut-first mentality, the state is likely to look for new sources of revenue to help balance its books. \THE OUTLOOK: There are signs that such ideas as closing corporate tax loopholes and exemptions are on the table, as well as the possibility of some fee increases. \One of the hottest topics is likely to be debate on expanding (rather than increasing) the state's sales tax, possibly to include such things as clothing, car repairs and tax preparation services. Senate Tax Committee Chairman Tom Bakk cautions, though, that the sales tax is regressive, saying it unfairly hurts those with lower incomes. \One possible fracture point: whether to tap money being brought in from a constitutional amendment approved in November that increases the sales tax but dedicates the additional revenue exclusively to the outdoors, clean water and the arts. \. \bonding \THE ISSUE: The state's large capital improvements bills are usually passed in even-numbered years, but the prospect of a federal economic stimulus package might spur state action on this front. \THE OUTLOOK: Watch for salivating over the announcement of any federal package. Legislative leaders will hope to dovetail any state borrowing for building projects to maximize the federal dollars. \Government building means construction jobs. Roads and bridges will probably be high on the list of potential targets, but money could also be directed toward other infrastructure, such as sewer and water facilities. \Some Republicans are cautioning about ringing up the state's credit card for another bonding bill at such perilous times. ""We don't believe government make-work jobs spur the economy,"" House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall, said recently. Countered Senate Majority Leader Pogemiller: ""If you are out of work, I don't think you view those as make-work jobs. I think you view those as food on your table."" \. \education \THE ISSUE: A huge plan designed to reform school funding and add hundreds of millions of additional state dollars to schools' annual budgets will be introduced. It's designed for gradual phase-in over many years. \THE OUTLOOK: Though educators and lobbyists are putting up a brave front, they'll be lucky to prevent K-12 education -- the largest single portion of the state budget -- from getting whacked in the budget battle. Regarding the funding reform proposal, there's a good chance it will generate some polite discussion about what to do when times get better. \On other fronts, legislators will consider changing Minnesota's 11th-grade graduation requirement test in math, rolling back some district spending mandates, and raising the minimum school dropout age from 16 to 18. \. \health care \THE ISSUE: Health care makes up a rapidly growing part of the budget and that has made it a prime target for cuts in these lean times. Gov. Pawlenty has already used his ""unallotment"" powers to reduce some spending in the short term. DFLers have opposed him for the most part, but acknowledge that there is little hope of shielding health care from the budget reductions that lie directly ahead. \THE OUTLOOK: Both sides would like to continue the incremental health-care reforms begun last year, setting course for expanded use of results-based reimbursements and more information on costs and quality for consumers. But few think that the reforms would save the kind of money needed to stanch the flow of red ink from publicly subsidized health care. \. \transportation \THE ISSUE: After a turbulent 15 months, the Minnesota Department of Transportation hopes to find itself less in the spotlight this year. In a mid-December address to employees, Transportation Commissioner Tom Sorel said the agency ""will be OK in 2009"" and added that ""there will be a small deficit that can be addressed internally"" with no layoffs, at least in the foreseeable future. \Those words followed a year in which MnDOT faced intense scrutiny as a new Interstate 35W bridge replaced the one that collapsed in August 2007. In an official report on the collapse issued late last year, the National Transportation Safety Board largely cleared the agency's maintenance of the fallen bridge as a reason for the disaster. \THE OUTLOOK: MnDOT is pushing forward with several ambitious programs -- including replacing or rehabbing 120 state bridges by 2018 -- but the recession is already siphoning away revenue for such endeavors. Steve Murphy, DFL-Red Wing, the Senate Transportation Committee chairman, said a drop in revenue from the motor vehicle sales tax is alarming. ""Because of the recession, folks simply can't afford to buy vehicles,"" he said. ""This means less funding for our roads, bridges, and transit systems."" \. \environment \THE ISSUE: Legislators will consider new strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and move further toward goals that they and Pawlenty set two years ago. \THE OUTLOOK: Most visible will be tougher emissions standards for cars and light trucks sold in Minnesota, in tandem with proposals to get gasoline producers to develop more ""low carbon"" fuels from corn, grasses and other non-fossil sources. New land use policies will also be proposed, aimed at getting people to drive cars less. Greenhouse gas emissions may be added to environmental impact assessments, and legislators may explore nuclear energy as a new power source, said Sen. Yvonne Prettner-Solon, DFL-Duluth, chairwoman of the Senate Energy, Utilities, Technology and Communications Committee. \A carbon ""cap and trade"" plan, which would affect the cost of both producing and using energy (and, some hope, encourage new technologies), is not likely to advance this session, Prettner-Solon added. It's being superseded by regional and national efforts and, in Minnesota, by the state's budget shortfall. \. \stadium \THE ISSUE: In the next 15 months, the University of Minnesota football team and the baseball Twins will leave the Metrodome for new homes built in part with public help, and the Vikings have been seeking a new stadium as well. \THE OUTLOOK: The Vikings, who say that construction of a stadium might be a worthy, jobs-creating public works project, may come calling, and legislators may listen. But money for a refurbished Metrodome or for a new football stadium isn't likely to flow this year, when many other programs will face cuts. Still, on any given session, anything is possible. \. \STAFF WRITERS MARK BRUNSWICK, MIKE KASZUBA, PATRICIA LOPEZ, NORM DRAPER AND BILL MCAULIFFE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT"
63,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Rep. Collin Peterson said he decided to sit on the Republican side of the aisle for Wednesday's State of the Union speech, the first time he's ever done so.\""About halfway through the speech, he had those guys coming along, but then he got to health care and he lost them,"" said Peterson, a Democrat.\Such was the nature of President Obama's first State of the Union in an increasingly polarized Capitol. This is an even-numbered year, an election year, and the speech came a week and a day after the election of a Republican to Ted Kennedy's old Senate seat in Massachusetts. Health reform seems stalled even after the House and Senate passed separate bills. A carbon cap-and-trade bill is stuck in the Senate. And while Obama has had some legislative successes, he's had to find a way to pass his priorities with almost no Republican support.\The president is many things, but he is not a magician. And as good as his rhetorical skills are, his microphone wasn't a wand, with which a simple arrangement of words could abracadabra Washington into some mystical post-partisan capital city.\But to judge Obama's speech on whether he was able to single-handedly bring Republicans and Democrats on board with his agenda in more than an hour of verbiage would be a mistake, lawmakers and analysts said.\""Well a speech never would. Speeches can't do that,"" said Rep. Keith Ellison. ""What speeches do is help inspire people and inform them, and they lay out a vision. Now what may happen is that Americans across this country may call their senators and say 'Get to work, quit messing around.'\""Now, when constituents start calling you, telling you they want you to do something, that's what makes them move, so hopefully the speech may have done that.""\Obama acknowledged as much, but said he stood resolved to continue pressing forward with an agenda fixated on spending to create jobs and overhauling what he called a ""broken"" health care system.\""I know it's an election year. And after last week, it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual,"" Obama said. ""But we still need to govern.""\Jobs\Obama's first and largest segment of the State of the Union focused on jobs, no surprise given that the unemployment rate is at 7.4 percent in Minnesota and 10 percent nationally -- and Obama said it might be ""double what it is today"" had the Wall Street bank bailout not passed in late 2008. That legislation was and remains unpopular -- Obama compared the measure to a root canal and joked that hatred of it is the ""one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans.""\Rep. Betty McCollum said Obama ""set the tone"" that people need to hear in these tough economic times, while Ellison said Obama ""made it very clear that jobs are number one.""\Sen. Amy Klobuchar called Obama's plan ""nation building in our own nation"" -- citing Obama's plans to unfreeze credit for small businesses, increase exports\""The President is where Minnesota wants him to be -- focused like a laser on jobs,"" Sen. Al Franken said in a statement. ""The only way we're going to turn this economy around is to put people to work right away.""\No doubt Minnesota's junior senator enjoyed Obama's focus on a wage stimulus plan for small businesses, particularly given that Franken introduced a bill to do just that earlier this week.\Franken's isn't the only framework that would accomplish that goal: New York Democrat Chuck Schumer and Utah Republican Orrin Hatch proposed Tuesday to suspend payroll taxes for any newly hired employee who had been unemployed for at least 60 days.\Health care\Given the focus on jobs and the economy, Obama cast his support for health care in an economic light, saying it would ""relieve the burden on middle-class families"" and noting a Congressional Budget Office estimate that the health care bill would lower the deficit by up to $1 trillion over the next 20 years.\""I think the message was that he didn't want to give up, that he was moving forward,"" Klobuchar said.\Obama even called for Republican lawmakers who have another plan to come forward and let him know.\Rep. Michele Bachmann tried to do just that earlier Wednesday as she and a group of House Republicans unveiled a Declaration of Health Care Independence, a 10-point platform she said should be used to frame any health care debate going forward.\""We hear you, American people. We are for having talks out in the open. We are... against kickbacks but for holding a bill in the right way, and we are FOR making sure we don't add any more to our federal deficit,"" Bachmann said.\Bachmann suggested that a bill she introduced more than a year ago could be a good first step. That legislation would allow every dollar spent on health care, be it insurance premiums, copays or what have you, to be fully tax deductible. That legislation was introduced on Jan. 14, 2009, referred to the House Ways and Means Committee and hasn't been heard from since.\Rep. Erik Paulsen followed after the speech with his own proposal, suggesting lawmakers start by allowing people to buy health care plans across state lines, letting small businesses pool together to buy insurance and making sure that those with preexisting conditions can get coverage.\Rep. John Kline said the only next step on health care can be to ""press the reset button.""\""The American people have spoken: a government takeover of our health care system will not be tolerated,"" Kline said in a statement. ""No matter how Washington Democrats dress it up, boil it down, or break it apart, any proposal that puts government bureaucrats in control of our health care system will be soundly rejected by the American people.""\While the president didn't lay out a strategy for getting health care reform to his desk for a signature, he did suggest that the fight isn't over.\""This is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became,"" Obama said. ""I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most Americans wondering what's in it for them.\""But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.""\Next steps\Among the many other points in Obama's 7,077-word speech was a renewed call for increased investment in high-speed rail, money that could go to help construct just such a proposed link between the Twin Cities and Chicago.\""From the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.""\Today he begins selling that and the rest of his plans at a soon-to-be high-speed rail construction site in Tampa, Fla. Early next week he'll head to Nashua, N.H., to continue promoting his jobs agenda.\Sandwiched in between those two trips is possibly Obama's most important speaking engagement -- he'll head to Baltimore on Friday to speak with House Republicans during their annual caucus retreat. There he'll hope to turn some of his opposition into case-by-case allies.\For example, the president may find an ally in Paulsen on cutting the deficit. ""Good message,"" said Rep. Erik Paulsen of Obama's spending and deficit-reduction plans. ""The devil is in the details, of course, but the message, I think, was appropriate.""\Kline was more skeptical.\""Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, and one tenth of our nation's workforce is unemployed,"" he said. ""Yet the Administration has shown no sign of backing away from its policies of government expansion at the expense of our nation's job creators.""\There remains the question of what to do in the Senate, where the Democrats' loss in Massachusetts leaves them one seat short of that ever-elusive filibuster-proof majority. As Klobuchar said after the speech, ""we can't do anything now unless it's bipartisan.""\""Obama depends on congressional support to enact his ambitious agenda, and he acknowledged the challenges of getting his agenda through Congress in today's highly polarized environment,"" said Kathryn Pearson, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota.\""While the immediate analysis of the president's speech will focus on whether he has regained the trust of the middle class and re-inspired his supporters, the success of his agenda -- and ultimately the determinant of his support by the middle class -- hinges on congressional support in the months ahead.""\Derek Wallbank is MinnPost's Washington, D.C., correspondent and can be reached at wallbank[at]minnpost[dot]com.\Credit: Derek Wallbank"
64,"MORNING EDITION\Today in Bachmannia: If she were politicaly dead, she wouldn't be on ""Face the Nation"", right? Our Gal showed fire on the Sunday talk show, calling Newt Gingrich ""The King of K Street."" A post by CBS News says: ""Bachmann continued an ongoing offensive against Newt Gingrich Sunday, hammering her presidential competitor for being a 'consummate establishment insider,' and targeting his history brokering influence on behalf of Freddie Mac and others. 'He's the 'King of K Street,' Bachmann said of Gingrich ... 'For a person who's been influence peddling for over 30 years in Washington, D.C. -- to think that Newt Gingrich is somehow an outsider, when he is the consummate establishment insider' ... The Minnesota congresswoman also presented herself as the only candidate who has taken on President Obama and been 'tested by fire in the lion's den.' 'Barack Obama knows me in Washington, D.C., because I've taken him on. I've been on the tip of the spear fighting him on 'Obamacare,' on cap-and-trade, on issue after issue,' she said. 'There's a clear distinction in the candidates. I'm the proven candidate who has been tested by fire in the lion's den of Washington, D.C.' "" Has she spent enough time in D.C. lately to mix her metaphors like that?\The Strib's Janet Moore takes the latest look at what comes next for the 122 acres that the St. Paul Ford plant sits on: ""What's next for the signature 122-acre property, just beyond the bluffs of the Mississippi River? The answer in part depends on the extent of the environmental cleanup, which won't be known until mid-2012. A tough economy also conspires to slow redevelopment of what will likely be a multimillion-dollar, years-long project of enormous complexity in one of the Twin Cities' most-desirable neighborhoods. And there's no consensus just yet on what the site -- one of the last substantial tracts of land left for development in the Twin Cities -- should become. That, too, depends on the extent of the site's pollution.""\The Strib also adds its voice to those upset with the Obama administration's decision to prohibit over-the-counter sales of the so-called ""morning after"" pill: ""With an election year around the corner, the move could be a concession to the anti-abortion, anti-birth control crowd. Whatever their reasons, it's disappointing to see an administration that promised to ""return science to its rightful place'' go so far afield from that pledge. Obama has said he would base his choices on evidence, not politics, and that he would listen to experts in technology, health and science. That approach was touted as a dramatic change from his predecessor, who regularly ignored research on everything from climate change to public health. In this case, the Obama administration disregarded FDA studies that found the Plan B pill to be safe and effective when sold over-the-counter to all females. Multiple studies agreed, concluding that young people were not more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior when they have unrestricted access to contraception."" I doubt Obama is counting on a landslide of pro-life, single-issue voters.\Catharine Richert, MPR's PolitiGraph fact-checker, gives GOP Rep. Steve ""The Draz"" Drazkowski a ""Misleading"" for his claim that the country's best-performing states, economically speaking, had enforced male-female only marriages. Says Richert: ""Those who argue that banning same-sex marriage will be bad for the economy are wrong, he wrote in a November 21, 2011, opinion piece. 'To the contrary, the facts show that states with a marriage protection amendment are our top performing economic states,' he wrote. 'For example, eight of the top 10 'best states for business' according to a survey of 556 CEO's by Chief Executive Magazine have a state marriage amendment in their constitution'. ... Chief Executive Magazine Editor JP Donlon said that Drazkowski is wrong to link a ban on same-sex marriage to economic performance. 'We neither looked or thought about such a correlation because it doesn't have a bearing on a state's performance one way or another,' Donlon said. Rather, the survey asked the CEOs questions about taxes and regulatory issues, quality of workers and living environment in each state. It's also useful to look at other rankings. For example, Forbes Magazine released its list in November, and it includes Iowa, where same-sex marriage is allowed. A recent study conducted by the Williams Institute found that legal same-sex marriage boosted the wedding and tourism industries in Iowa by upwards of $13 million.""\The Minneapolis impound lot story has echoes in St. Paul. Matt McKinney and Jane Friedmann of the Strib report: ""The city of St. Paul has kept nearly a quarter-million dollars from impound lot auctions this year that should have gone to vehicle owners, city records show. The city's practice of keeping all auction proceeds is outlined in Mayor Chris Coleman's 2010 annual financial report, despite a state law and a city ordinance that says a chunk of it belongs to the people who failed to pick up their towed cars within 15 days. The amount from this year's auctions that could be claimed by vehicle owners stands at $237,462 and counting, according to city records. It's the largest haul in the past three years, a period during which the city generated some $515,497 in surplus auction proceeds.""\Ol' Sooch served up another one Sunday in the PiPress. Sticker-shocked by property tax bills, Joe is most angry ... about ... the waste of money he sees going on all around him: ""The other evening, the St. Paul City Council chambers were packed with residents who have awakened. They have awakened to the canard of ""shifting tax burdens."" We are being sold the idea that, well, certainly your property taxes have increased because the Legislature cut back, or eliminated entirely, local government aid. I have never bought that one. For my city or county politicians to tell me that my property taxes are going up because the state has cut off funding the city relied on to continue its profligate ways is tantamount to a kid on a playground telling the other kids that his parents have shut down his allowance but that he found one of their credit cards and he intends to keep spending. The credit card they use is your house. We shouldn't be buying it. It was your money in the first place, not the state's, that was returning to the cities so that the cities could magnanimously tell you they found a way to hold down your property taxes. Utter nonsense."" Run that business with the kid and the credit card by me again, Joe.\Related ... condo associations (as in not your city government), are having a hard time keeping up with repairs and such amid declining values. Mary Jane Smetanka at the Strib writes: ""Empty units, foreclosures and residents who are frustrated that association dues are increasing even as home values sag have put associations and the residents they serve at loggerheads. In Hopkins, residents have sued the state's largest homeowners association, charging mismanagement. In Eden Prairie, a man fought his association for the right to have birdhouses. Some cash-strapped homeowners have simply stopped paying their association dues. Add the emotion connected to home -- the sanctuary, the castle, the biggest investment most people ever make -- and confrontations can get serious. Some associations have hired off-duty police to provide security at meetings or sought restraining orders to keep residents away from board members.""\No word if this will keep him in the lineup ... but Joe Mauer is getting married. The PiPress story by Charley ""Shooter"" Walters says: ""Mauer, perhaps Minnesota's most eligible bachelor, on Saturday became engaged to fellow Cretin-Derham Hall graduate Maddie Bisanz. Mauer, 28, the Minnesota Twins catcher, proposed to Bisanz, a St. Paul nurse, in Sanibel, Fla. 'A place that is special to both of us,' Mauer said Sunday from Florida. 'We couldn't be happier, and we're both really excited.' No wedding date has been set. The couple has been friends for about seven years and has been dating for about 1-1/2 years. 'I was hoping for a yes and she said yes,' Mauer said when he proposed. 'I'm getting to marry my best friend.' ""\Up at the Grand Forks Herald, veteran sportswriter Ryan Bakken takes his shot at persuading Vikings fans to become ""shareholders"" in their favorite team: ""Green Bay is the only publicly owned NFL team. It has sold almost 5 million shares to more than 100,000 stockholders. And it's currently selling another 250,000 shares to finance a $143 million improvement of Lambeau Field. In the first two days, it sold 185,000 shares at $250 apiece. Given the team's success, you may think this is a wise investment. It would be, except the shares are worthless other than for bragging rights about being an 'owner' of the world champions. That's because the stock never increases in value and dividends are never awarded. All profits are reinvested in the team; there's no billionaire owner taking his cut to finance a jet with mink seat covers. Even though it's a worthless piece of paper, the stock certificate means bragging rights, which have high value in our brash society. Besides, ownership means they honestly can use the word 'we' when talking about the team. They honestly can wear team jerseys with their last names on the back.""\Credit: Brian Lambert"
65,"
West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin is taking a political battering, thanks to his support of Barack Obama, so he's uniquely qualified to offer counsel on what many think is the president's central political problem - his failure to connect with white working-class voters.
\
His advice: Go to where they live and work. Listen. And don't talk down to them.
\
""If I were him, I'd start going to the places where people don't like you that much,"" says Manchin, who is locked in a close race to replace Robert Byrd in the Senate and struggling mightily to shrug off his opponents' description of him as Obama's ""rubber stamp.""
\
""You can't win if you only go where you are comfortable,"" added Manchin, who was speaking to POLITICO a day before Obama appeared in a place that was very much in his comfort zone - before a crowd of 35,000 admirers at Ohio State University.
\
In the two weeks before the Nov. 2 midterms, Obama has focused on helping his party energize its demoralized base, travelling to seven states that delivered him double-digit margins of victory two years ago and to comfortable venues like big city stadiums and university campuses.
\
On Saturday, he's scheduled to do it again, coming to Minnesota to campaign for DFL gubernatorial candidate Mark Dayton, before a presumably supportive crowd at the Northrop Mall on the University of Minnesota's Minneapolis campus.
\
But in the process Obama is also re-living one of the few unsuccessful phases of his campaign - the spring of 2008, when Sen. Hillary Clinton struck a chord with white blue collar voters in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
\
Ceding the Appalachian heartland to Clinton helped Obama sew up the nomination, but it deprived him of a chance to make inroads with voters who have become increasingly alienated, even hostile.
\
Obama advisers analyzed Clinton's success and applied some of the lessons to his general election campaign. But this year they have reverted to a base strategy, even as it's increasingly clear Obama must reconcile with disaffected white supporters to stand a chance in 2012.
\
""It's becoming a crisis,"" says one Democratic House member, who asked not be identified.
\
Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, arguably Obama's most effective 2008 surrogate with working-class voters, says it's a ""tragedy"" Obama hasn't been able to convince blue-collar families he's on their side, and her solution is the same as Manchin's.
\
""He's just got to get out there and hear more bad news,"" McCaskill added. ""That event, where the woman said 'I'm exhausted with defending you,' was perfect. He needs a lot more of that.""
\
The confrontation took place at a CNBC forum, precisely the kind of semi-hostile environment McCaskill was referring to. Obama has also embarked on a series of quick trips and ""backyard barbeques"" in purple-red zones like St. Louis, Charlotte, Kansas City, Richmond and Columbus.
\
But by necessity, they have taken a back seat to Obama's central strategy in 2010 of pumping up turnout among blacks, Latinos, urban voters, union members and educated whites.
\
Apart from a last-ditch effort to energize women voters, there's been no equivalent push to regain lost white independents and conservative Democrats, who flocked to Obama in 2008 - only to abandon him over huge spending bills and the sputtering recovery. Twice as many non-college-educated whites (60 percent) now plan to vote for a Republican this year than a Democrat (31 percent). And approval of Obama's handling of the economy has tanked by 20 percentage points among white Democrats since April, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll taken earlier this month.
\
Embattled Democrats -- even friendly ones like Rep. Zack Space, D-Ohio, whose districts are awash in stimulus funding -- don't want Obama anywhere near them.
\
Instead, the president has been forced to stick, for the most part, to college campuses and big cities, like Seattle, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Madison, Wis., and Portland, Ore., where he was scheduled to appear today.
\
Meanwhile, the white, blue-collar bastions such as Youngstown, Scranton and Louisville have been outsourced to surrogates like Vice President Joe Biden and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
\
Obama's West Wing aides argue that his national approval ratings -- stable in the mid-40s since spring -- are actually pretty good, considering the unemployment rate is hovering around 10 percent.
\
The president himself, while acknowledging his administration's shortcomings in getting out its message, has dismissed the idea that communication alone would improve his political standing.
\
""I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years,"" Obama told Peter Baker of The New York Times earlier this month. ""I was reminded that in '94 -- when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up being bad for Democrats -- unemployment was only 6.6 percent.
\
""And I don't think anybody would suggest that Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or didn't show empathy.""
\
Republicans agree, saying it's Obama's policies -- especially cap and trade, the stimulus and health reform -- that are dragging him down. So do some white Democrats, especially union members, who don't think Obama has delivered on promises to pass new worker protections or protect the auto industry rank and file from mass layoffs during a government-initiated restructuring effort.
\
""It's not whether Obama is doing enough politicking,"" said John Russo, co-director of the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University. ""The real issue is policy, all the things (that) have not happened over the last two years.
\
""We're in a situation much like 1994, when after the labor movement and community groups did so much for Bill Clinton, he did not follow through on the promises he made to them. And it took 12 years in Ohio and 14 years nationally for working people to suspend their disbelief and again support the Democrats.""
\
The long-term danger for Obama is that if his approval ratings among whites stay low, the revolt could take root -- shredding a 2008 map that included single-digit wins in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia, Michigan, Florida and all-important Ohio, which Obama won by 3 percentage points with the political wind at his back.
\
""Would he win the state now? Can he win it in 2012? Geez, that's going to be a tough one for him,"" said a staffer to an endangered Democratic House member in Ohio.
\
""Right now, he couldn't sell ice water in hell,"" said Dee Davis, who runs a Kentucky nonprofit that studies voting patterns in the Appalachian belt, which encompasses southern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, western Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
\
Davis and other analysts say racism, especially among older voters, plays some role in Obama's plummeting popularity. But even Obama's friends concede that much of his trouble attracting working-class whites is less racial than cultural and that some wounds have been self-inflicted.
\
""Here's the gorilla in the room,"" said McCaskill. ""He can roll up his sleeves and he can take off his jacket and he could not wear a tie, but it is very hard for a lot of people in working-class families to imagine him next to them at the laundromat.
\
""His vocabulary is beyond impressive, (but) the fact that he stays visionary sometimes slows him down"" when he needs to be ""granular and really nitty-gritty and saying things in a way that makes people relate to him,"" McCaskill said.
\
Her solution: Obama needs to go on a listening tour -- more like a let-them-yell-at-you tour -- to establish a more visceral rapport with people's anxieties and fears. It's something he's successfully done in the past.
\
When Obama first ran for the Senate in Illinois in 2004, his staff had to coach him on the ways of the state's southern agricultural belt -- urging him to ditch the suit jacket for rolled-up shirt sleeves.
\
In the summer of 2008, Obama enlisted two highly regarded young Clinton advisers, Aaron Pickrell and Isaac Baker, to craft a strategy for reducing John McCain's advantage among rural and Rust Belt whites.
\
The result was a well-received barnstorming tour through small Ohio towns like New Philadelphia and Steubenville, accompanied by similar trips through nonurban Indiana and western Pennsylvania.
\
At his best, Obama can be charming, funny, witty and warm -- such as earlier this year in Jefferson County, Mo., when he commiserated with laid-off workers at a Chrysler plant. During a trip to Iowa in April, he shooed away the press to chat with the wait staff at a diner.
\
Yet sometimes he can be windy -- he delivered a nearly half-hour answer to a simple health care question posed to him at the Charlotte plant this spring -- and diffident, injecting complex policy discussions when confronted with wrenching kitchen-table problems.
\
He can't bowl. He can't pronounce Yuengling beer. And at his worst, he sounds less ""I feel your pain"" than like America's anthropologist in chief.
\
During one infamous April 2008 speech to wealthy Democrats in San Francisco, Obama said that some Pennsylvania voters, made ""bitter"" by the bad economy, ""cling to guns or religion.""
\
Despite the huge backlash against those comments, he's strayed back into social science. At a forum for young voters last week sponsored by MTV, Obama blamed a ""tribal attitude"" among economically strapped Americans for a recent rise in racial incidents.
\
At a recent event in Massachusetts, he declared that ""fear and frustration"" among ""scared"" voters fueled anti-Democrat sentiments. That earned Obama the scorn of liberal blogger Mickey Kaus, who termed it ""political malpractice,"" adding, ""Insulting voters is rarely a good way to win them over.""
\
Obama's shortcomings, friends say, are embedded in his strengths -- a searching intellect, a Roget's vocabulary and a lofty determination to elevate the public discourse -- and not dumb down his public utterances.
\
Hence McCaskill's frustration when she learned Obama had apologized for the God-and-guns remark by blaming his own tortured ""syntax.""
\
She got him on his cell phone and opened up on him: ""The only time I want to hear you use that word is when you're talking about the tax people in Missouri pay on their beer!""

"
66,"Why are tariffs a good idea? That's the excellent question I keep hoping the mainstream media will ask. Instead, when President Donald Trump delivered on tariff promises he made again and again on the campaign trail to tumultuous cheers, the press reacted with shock and awe.\This was unheard of. Unacceptable. How could he do this? It was as if Trump has been found in bed with Putin's mistress. And Putin, too. Gloom-and-doom pronouncements over a certain (and devastating) trade war with countries that have been benefiting for years from trade policies that have gutted America's aluminum and steel industries were almost as over-the-top as the Cold War histrionics of earlier days (these rather more legitimate) when schoolchildren practiced hiding under their desks in the event that Khrushchev dropped the big one.\Trump is worse than Khrushchev. Not just immoral and sexist and greedy and so on, but craaaaaaazy. OK, we thought Khrushchev was crazy ... but not this crazy. And as it turns out he was far more moderate than most in the Kremlin and many in our own State Department, which at that time was in a panic not over Russia so much as the spread of communism (that, too, was inevitable -- just like the coming trade war) to countries we much preferred to see run by dictators who protected the interests of the foreign corporations (especially ours) that effectively ran their economies.\Talk of runaway inflation and rampant unemployment in industries that would have to pay more for raw materials, and of course that trade war (oh, boy, are the Chinese ever gonna be pissed) has lately had the pundits in a blithering frenzy. That the tariffs could have any redeeming features was simply out of the question as far as CNN and the New York Times were concerned.\What went unsaid was that the tariff hikes' gravest flaw was the man who proposed them. Trump is worse than a lame-duck president. Every move he makes is regarded as just one more reason to impeach him. He may wriggle out of this or that imbroglio on some technicality, but his emotional shortcomings are so glaring and so embarrassing that he simply must go, so say his critics.\I agree, even though I am among the handful of people on the planet who actually think his tariff proposal has merit.\Trump's America First campaign is clearly a conundrum and a probably a shibboleth. Who knows? The devil is in the details, and Trump is not a detail guy. I have my own version. My America First would take its inspiration from what I call China First. In China, global domination is the means to an end -- improving the quality of life for all in China. The rest of the world must fend for itself against China's brazen theft of markets and intellectual property (while closing off its own markets). The Chinese have us on the defensive, no doubt about that. Above all, they love manipulating our inability to call a spade a spade. They see it as a weakness and they are right.\Here's what I mean: While China makes no bones about its indifference to the quality of life of other peoples, most Americans see globalization as a hallmark of their Christian values: Everyone's welcome and everyone's the same. This is a false equivalence, of course. Globalization is about money and power. Period. It has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter or the Dreamers, much as the neoliberal left would like to pretend it does.\For me, protecting the environment tops the list of pressing policy issues facing our nation and the world. Most people don't see it that way. (Why should they when they have bills to pay and social media to distract them?) Moreover, as long as leadership is itself an endangered species, climate change and other urgent environmental crises will go on being treated as of nebulous consequence.\A protectionist visionary in the White House might help people connect the dots -- might even persuade Americans to shift to a more sustainable world economy, one less dependent on China. This visionary president might show how an America First policy offers a pathway to independence and self-sufficiency, and why that isn't just good but necessary. Voters might actually be convinced that the U.S. has a huge and vibrant domestic economy, that we-the-people don't need foreign trade nearly as much as our multinational corporations and their shareholders do.\For me, the climate crisis (and related threats to our planet) represents a moral imperative because it involves defenseless species without which human society cannot function. I'm talking about microorganisms that, for no charge, keep our world safe and habitable. How that relates to Trump's tariffs is this: Steel is one of thousands of products whose transport around the globe is irresponsible in light of the catastrophic long-term consequences of fossil-fuel consumption.\Modern shipping is highly efficient and cost-effective -- until you factor in government actions of various kinds, from tax loopholes to subsidies to currency tampering to tariffs, that have kept oil prices artificially low so as to grow the global industrial economy. If you add to that the environmental costs, as Trump might say, this is a terribly bad -- very, very bad -- deal.\In my view we should be remaking our domestic economy with the principles of ecosystem balance front of mind, just as the South had to remake itself after slavery was abolished. This 21st-century transition would be far less traumatic. Could be. It's government's job to manage change in a way that delivers a soft landing. In a democracy, the people (not just the elites) have to be fully informed and on board. They need something the Chinese lack, as least for now -- the kind of original thinking that flourishes in a free society, the ability to find creative solutions to thorny problems and an attitude that says anything is possible if everybody pitches in.\A coherent America First program would use the tax code and other government incentives to create new products and markets. It would stimulate a paradigm shift from making things merely for money to making things that promote equity for all and freedom from fear. Automation is a big fear in Trump country. Anti-protectionists say the tariff issue is moot, as automation kills jobs anyway. I say that's short-term thinking.\Why can't taxes on an increasingly automated (and profitable) U.S. steel industry be used to pay for universal health care, quality public schools, better roads and highways, renewable energy, a shorter workweek, healthy organic food and conservation programs?\Anti-protectionists say planned economies are socialist. Yup. So what? And by the way, since when has government not governed? Isn't government supposed to offset corporate short-term thinking? Isn't it supposed to protect the greater good, and doesn't that mean the long-term good of all citizens?\Sadly, Trump is no Lincoln. Moreover, we have dug ourselves a very deep hole. Big business has never been more powerful or more concentrated. It quashed the cap-and-trade system that might have given us a true accounting of our carbon footprint. It even quashed a tax on carbon. This adversarial behavior (with big business winning every time) has been the new normal since Detroit and Big Oil gutted the CAFE gas mileage standards by pushing (paying) politicians to create a loophole for gas-guzzling SUVs.\There, too, ""jobs"" and ""American competitiveness overseas"" were the excuse for kicking the problems facing the planet down the road. Big Steel wasn't the victim that time but a co-conspirator. Japanese cars flooding the market may have been more efficient but they were so darned small.\Big business has mastered not the art of the deal but the art of the pre-emptive strike against anything that threatens its inexorable growth. This is how we became a knee-jerk nation. Linear thinking rules our political discourse. Protectionism smacks of populism. Populism smacks of nationalism. Nationalism smacks of fascism. Fascism smacks of Nazism. Nazism smacks of isolationism circa 1935. Isolationism smacks of nativism -- anti-Islam, -black, -woman, -Jew ... ergo, Trump is a white supremacist no different from those people who delayed our entry into World War II.\This is nonsense, of course, as ridiculous as the fake news that is decried in books like ""Fantasyland"" and ""Bunk."" If we are so exceptionally prone to the poppy- cock spewed by con artists like Trump, how come populism (aka fascism, nativism, nationalism, protectionism, isolationism) is afflicting Europe as well?\Was Brexit caused by ""something in the water"" exported from the New World back to the old? Why is Steve Bannon playing to packed audiences in Italy and France?\The contempt being heaped on Trump's proposed tariffs is just another distraction that will prevent ordinary Americans, who still have the right to vote, from arriving at the more logical and correct (in my view) conclusion: Protectionism is a way to address the glaring and growing divide between haves and have-nots. The majority of humans are fighting for their very survival (by that I mean for the right to live past, say, age 30) as the rich grow their power and wealth on every corner of our ever-more-polluted and overpopulated globe.\Everywhere but China.\The objectives of the Chinese government's seamless interface with its corporations are clear. China's president-for-life is fully aware of the consequences for the ""haves"" of government turning its back on the have-nots. He is unwilling to risk a populist uprising because in China, given its huge population, underrepresented citizens actually might throw the bastards out, or at any rate seriously destabilize that stressed-to-the-limits nation.\That is why China, because it is a nation on the brink and knows it, represents the planet's last, best hope for a future that offers some semblance of protection for defenseless people and other species. Our own best hope is a response in kind. Instead of China stealing our intellectual property and messing with our markets, maybe it's time we steal something from China.\America First, China-style, would put we the people ahead of transnational corporations that are American in name only. It would promote the growth of self-sufficient communities. There, business owners know their customers personally. They establish bonds of trust. We used to call this way of assimilating people of differing ethnicities ""the melting pot.""\Statistics show that while global concentration of wealth and power has accelerated dramatically (along with the wealth gap) in recent years, the disparities are worse in the U.S. than other Western democracies. It would be tragic if the American dream turned out to be just that, a figment of our imaginations. A dream and nothing more.\Bonnie Blodgett, of St. Paul, is a writer who specializes in environmental topics (bonnieblodgett@gmail.com).\Credit: BONNIE BLODGETT"
67,"
The passage of financial overhaul, just a couple of months after the passage of comprehensive health care changes, should decisively end the narrative that President Barack Obama represents a Jimmy Carter-style case of naive hope crushed by the inability to master Washington.
\
Yet the mystery remains: Having moved swiftly toward achieving the policy objectives he promised voters as a candidate, Obama is still widely perceived as flirting with a failed presidency.
\
Eric Alterman, in a column in The Nation that drew wide notice, wrote that most liberals think the president is a ""big disappointment."" House Democrats were at near-insurrection after White House press secretary Robert Gibbs stated the obvious -- that the party has a chance of losing the House under Obama's watch. And independent voters have turned decisively against the man they helped elect 21 months ago -- a trend unlikely to be reversed before November.
\
This is an odd reversal of expectations. When he came into office, the assumption, even among some Democrats, was that he was a dazzling politician and communicator who might prove too unseasoned at governance to win substantive achievements.
\
The reality is the opposite. You can argue over whether Obama's achievements are good or bad on the merits. But especially after Thursday's vote, you can't argue that Obama is not getting things done. To the contrary, he has, as promised, covered the uninsured, tightened regulations, started to wind down the war in Iraq and shifted focus and resources to Afghanistan, injected more competition into the education system, and edged closer to a big energy bill.
\
The problem is that he and the West Wing are not especially good at politics or communications -- in other words, largely ineffective at the very things on which their campaign reputation was built. And the promises he made during two years of campaigning have turned out to be much less appealing as actual policies.
\
""I tell you, it's very frustrating that it's not breaking through, when you look at these things and their scale,"" said a top Obama adviser, who spoke on background to offer a candid take on the state of play. ""Can you imagine if Bill Clinton had achieved even one of these? Part of it is because we are divided, even on the left ... And part of it is the culture of immediate gratification.""
\
But there are many other reasons for Obama's woes. Based on interviews with officials in the administration and on Capitol Hill, and with Democratic operatives around town, there are a half-dozen reasons why Obama is perceived as failing to win over the public, even though by most conventional measures, he is clearly succeeding:
\
THE FLIGHT OF INDEPENDENTS
\
Obama sees himself as a different kind of Democrat: one who transcends ideology but is basically a centrist. By some measures, his self-image fits. His war and anti-terrorism policies are remarkably similar to those advocated by the man he blames for most the country's problems: former President George W. Bush. He's butting heads with teachers unions by enticing states to stop rewarding teachers on tenure rather than on merit. On immigration, he stresses border security instead of amnesty for illegal immigrants.
\
But on the issues voters care the most about -- the economy, jobs and spending -- Obama has shown himself to be a big government liberal. This reality is killing him among independent-minded voters -- a trend that started one year ago and has worsened lately. On the eve of his inaugural address, nearly six in 10 independents approved of his job performance. By late July 2009 -- right around the time Obama was talking up health care and pressuring Democrats to vote on cap-and-trade legislation -- independents started to take flight.
\
Many never returned. For the first time in his presidency, Obama's approval rating among independents has dropped below 40 percent, according to the widely respected Gallup.
\
A recent poll by Democrat Stan Greenberg's Democracy Corps found that 57 percent of likely voters regard Obama as ""too liberal.""
\
""The key thing here is the economy and the unemployment rate hangs over everything,"" another top White House official told us. ""Until that gets better, for most people, they will be frustrated.""
\
THE IDEOLOGY CONUNDRUM
\
Even as Obama pays the price for liberal positions, he doesn't manage to reap what should be the rewards. That's because he has never adequately reckoned with the divisions in his own party and taken a clear stand of his own. During the campaign, he avoided the whole question of whether he is a centrist ""new Democrat"" or a ""traditional liberal"" by insisting the debate was irrelevant and uniting the party around hatred for Bush and the power of his own biography.
\
But on a score of questions -- how long to pursue war in Afghanistan, how much to emphasize deficit reduction versus stimulus, whether to court the business community or condemn it -- the Democrats' internal debate is relevant. By failing to clarify and speak often about his larger philosophy, the way that former President Bill Clinton did, and instead responding tactically to circumstances on Capitol Hill or on the day's news cycle, Obama pays a price.
\
What is Obamaism? Conservatives think he stands for backdoor socialism. Liberals think he is a sell-out. Independents think he is a president with no clear compass who is breaking the bank with excessive spending.
\
Every move Obama makes, whether he is accommodating the center or the left, is interpreted through the prism of process and derided as reactive and expedient.
\
The tactical improvisation leaves even many Obama supporters saying they ""don't know what he really stands for"" -- as though there could somehow be a mystery as to where he stands after nearly a trillion dollars in stimulus spending and two landmark pieces of legislation passed within 18 months.
\
THE LIKABILITY FACTOR
\
Many Democrats on the Hill don't much like Obama, or at least his circle of advisers. They think the White House makes them take tough votes but doesn't care that much about the problems those votes cause politicians facing in tough races in 2010. Numerous Democrats have complained privately that Obama only cares about Obama -- a view reinforced by Gibbs's public admission that Democrats could lose the House.
\
It was no coincidence that Majority Leader Harry Reid criticized Obama for not being tough enough in some legislative showdowns -- and that Democrats leaked word that Nancy Pelosi ripped into a top White House official about the Gibbs comments.
\
In what would surprise media critics outside Washington, many reporters don't much like Obama or his gang either. They accurately perceive the contempt with which they are held by his White House, an attitude that undoubtedly flows from the top. Insults and blustery nonresponses, f-bombs flying, are common in how West Wing aides speak to reporters.
\
In a transactional city like Washington, personal relations usually only matter at the margins. But in a poor political climate those margins can be important, and there's no mistaking that across the capital there are many people who seem to be enjoying the president's travails, and cheering whenever he takes a cream pie to the face.
\
As individuals, most of the people who work in this West Wing are plainly decent and hard-working folks, who say the modern media echo chamber leaves them no choice but to be aggressive.
\
But collectively Obama has recruited a team with an uncommonly brash personality.
\
HIS WEST WING IS UNSTEADY
\
A lot of attention was paid to how Obama surrounded himself with powerful and skilled personalities in his Cabinet: Hillary Rodham Clinton at State and Robert Gates at the Pentagon sit atop that list.
\
But Democrats privately complain that the real power center -- the West Wing staff -- isn't nearly as impressive. A common gripe on the Hill and on the lobbying corridor is that the communications team isn't great at communicating, the speech-writing team isn't great at speech writing (exemplified by Obama's flaccid Oval Office speech in June on the BP spill and energy policy) and the political team often botches the politics.
\
The criticism is probably unfair on several fronts. It would be impossible for the best of communicators to offer clarity and convincing words when the country is locked in two wars, wrestling with a once-in-a-lifetime oil spill and mired in high unemployment. But the White House didn't help its cause by wrongly predicting a record-sized stimulus plan would hold unemployment below 8 percent and then waffling on its commitment to deficit reduction while signing into law massive expansions of the federal government. As for the big speeches, Obama is often the main author.
\
The political team is rightly knocked for hamhandedness. The White House failed to clear the Senate primary field in Arkansas, Colorado and Pennsylvania -- even after dangling government jobs to help its preferred candidate in two of them. And it couldn't land the candidate it wanted to run for Obama's old seat. But, then again, it is operating in a political environment in which the establishment has very little control in many of the biggest races.
\
NUMBERS MATTER
\
Obama is swimming up Niagara until joblessness improves. But, even while Obama doesn't directly control the economy, he has not been a disciplined or effective communicator about the state of the economy and his prescriptions for it. People will tolerate a weak economy if they feel there is an upward trajectory. But Obama has not managed to instill that confidence.
\
""The economy is off the charts on what people care about -- nothing is a close second,"" one of the advisers said.
\
The unemployment rate is expected to remain near 9.5 percent through the election, which is a big reason that some White House officials are even more pessimistic than Gibbs about the chances of keeping control of the House.
\
It doesn't matter that Republicans such as Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., say Obama's policies helped avert a worse economic calamity than most Americans will ever realize -- or that the federal government is turning a profit on some of the investments it made in bailing out companies in 2009.
\
No politician can escape the gravitational pull of bad employment numbers and economic figures in real time.
\
THE LIBERAL ECHO CHAMBER
\
Polls show most self-described liberals still strongly support Obama. But an elite group of commentators on the left -- many of whom are unhappy with him and are rewarded with more attention by being critical of a fellow Democrat -- has a disproportionate influence on perceptions.
\
The liberal blogosphere grew in response to Bush. But it is still a movement marked by immaturity and impetuousness -- unaccustomed to its own side holding power and the responsibilities and choices that come with that.
\
Many liberals seem shocked and dismayed that Obama is governing as a self-protective politician first and a liberal second, even though that is also how he campaigned. The liberal blogs cheer the fact that Gen. Stanley McChrystal's scalp has been replaced with Gen. David Petraeus's, even though both men are equally hawkish on Afghanistan, but barely clapped for the passage of health care. They treat the firing of a blogger from the Washington Post as an event of historic significance, while largely averting their gaze from the fact that major losses for Democrats in the fall elections would virtually kill hopes for progressive legislation over the next couple of years.
\
In private conversations, White House officials are contemptuous of what they see as liberal lamentations unhinged from historical context or contemporary political realities.
\
THE BP CAM
\
Rep. Edward Marke, D-Mass., beat his chest to force BP to make public the footage of gushing oil from an underwater camera. Democrats celebrated that as a victory for public accountability. But it was actually a painful defeat for Obama. The camera produced an indelible image played 24-7 on cable that highlighted how ineffectual Obama was for two months in stopping this catastrophe.
\
Obama is not responsible for the leak, and realistically there was little he could do to expedite the repair. But for an irritable public the Gulf Coast debacle was a reminder -- horribly timed, from Obama's perspective -- that big business and big government are often a problem, not a solution.

"
68,"Tim Walz was an enlisted soldier in the Minnesota National Guard in 1999 and defensive coordinator of the Mankato West High School football team. A student at the school, where Walz taught geography, wanted to start a gay-straight alliance.\This was three years after the president, a Democrat, signed a law forbidding same-sex marriage. Soldiers suspected of being gay in Walz's own unit could be discharged from the military. But Walz, now Minnesota's Democratic candidate for governor, had seen the bullying some students endured and agreed to be the group's faculty adviser.\""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married,"" Walz said. In other words, he would be a symbol that disparate worlds could coexist peacefully.\A southern Minnesota congressman, Walz, 54, has won six elections in a mostly rural, conservative-leaning area. The theme of his campaign -- ""One Minnesota"" -- reflects a politician who firmly believes he can straddle entrenched political divisions. Growing up in a small Nebraska town, steeped in the Catholic social justice traditions of his parents and expectations of service to country, Walz said he saw firsthand how government can help families.\""I never went to the Democrats. They came to me,"" Walz said, mentioning the GI Bill that funded college educations for him and his father, and the Social Security survivor benefits his mother lived on when his dad died young.\""There's a collective good,"" Walz said. ""We all benefit from programs like that.""\Walz is a college graduate who passed up the officer corps for enlisted life. He revels in a Norman Rockwell family life, beaming as he watched his daughter play soccer at Mankato West's ""Senior Night"" in September. But in an interview, he talked about his own ""white privilege,"" echoing a term young progressives use to discuss race relations. He's a veteran who stands ramrod straight and hand over heart during the national anthem, and a man whose political career was born after he was blocked from entering a political rally for former President George W. Bush.\Walz, facing Republican Jeff Johnson for governor, said his experience crossing cultural and political fault lines positions him to rise above the partisanship that has stunted progress at the State Capitol. He hopes to forge unlikely coalitions to boost spending on schools, improve the health care system and accelerate repairs to the state's aging transportation system.\While Walz sells himself as a uniter, critics see an opportunist.\""Walz has campaigned for years in southern Minnesota as a moderate, but during this campaign for governor, he has abandoned any hint of moderation,"" said Gina Countryman, executive director of Minnesota Action Network, a Republican fundraising group trying to stop Walz. ""He's run to the left on spending promises, tax increases, environment, mining and immigration issues, and Minnesotans are left to wonder where he stands on anything. If you ask him, he's apt to ask where you're from before answering you.""\As a congressman, Walz has been hard to categorize. He voted for the Affordable Care Act and a failed cap-and-trade system that aimed to reduce emissions, but against bailing out the nation's banks and auto companies that many Democrats supported. He voted for tighter vetting of refugees into the U.S., then as candidate for governor said he regretted it. He once earned an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association and its endorsement as recently as 2012, but now denounces the group.\""In my core values of equity, and in freedom, those remain the same. But a rigidness in all situations? That's weak leadership,"" Walz said. He added: ""If you can't change your mind you're never going to change anything.""\•••\Change and disruption are a theme in the life of Timothy James Walz, born in 1964 in West Point, Neb., to a stay-at-home mom and a school administrator. In the summers between school years, they farmed.\Driving in rural southwestern Minnesota recently, Walz spotted two turkeys bounding on the side of the road. ""Big ones,"" he said, recalling how he and friends would bring their guns to school so they could hunt after football practice.\At 17, Walz joined the National Guard. ""The path seemed like it was supposed to be kind of set,"" he said.\Then, when Walz was 19, his father died. Feeling life had been ""ripped up,"" Walz meandered from Nebraska to Houston to Jonesboro, Ark., where he worked in a factory building tanning beds. He returned to Nebraska and earned a teaching degree at Chadron State College.\His father's death and the years that followed led him to live life with some risk, Walz said. Soon after graduating college, he was bound for China. It was just his second trip on an airplane, following his journey at 17 to Fort Benning, Ga., for basic training.\Through a Harvard program, Walz taught high school for a year, one of the first government sanctioned educators in the country. It was 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre. He still speaks a little Mandarin.\Back home and working full-time for the Nebraska National Guard, Walz was also teaching and coaching about an hour away from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. There he met Gwen Whipple, a fellow teacher and a Minnesota native. On their first date (to the only movie theater in town, then Hardee's), she refused a kiss. He said they'd be married someday. Their honeymoon was a trip to China with 60 kids in tow.\After fertility treatments at the Mayo Clinic, the Walzes had a daughter, Hope, in 2001. Gus arrived in 2006, three weeks before Walz was elected to Congress.\•••\In the fall of 1995, Tim Walz, then 31, was pulled over for going 96 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone. He said he'd been watching college football with pals. Walz failed a sobriety test and a breath test and later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.\""You have obligations to people,"" Gwen Walz said she told her husband. ""You can't make dumb choices.""\It was a gut-check moment, Walz said, an impetus to change his risk-taking ways. He no longer drinks alcohol; today his beverage of choice is a seemingly bottomless can of Diet Mountain Dew. At times, it seems to fuel Walz's dizzying conversational style, as he moves from education policy to football, words tumbling out like coins from a slot machine.\The Walzes ended up in Minnesota after Gwen Walz, who grew up in the Lincoln County town of Ivanhoe, decided she wanted to move home. They both got jobs at Mankato West and found a house within walking distance.\Settled into a life of teaching and coaching, Walz led the football team's defense, culminating in a state championship. And he was helping gay and lesbian students deal with bullying.\""There was no mandate to do this,"" said Jacob Reitan, a Mankato West student at the time who is now a Minneapolis attorney. ""It was one teacher saying I know kids are suffering in the silent closet of fear and misunderstanding. What an important moment that was for me.""\Walz retired from the National Guard after 24 years; in 2003 he served with his Guard battalion in Italy in support of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\Three years later, the second President Bush was running for re-election, and Walz tried to bring a group of students to a Bush rally in Mankato. The goal, he said, was to show them politics up close. But one student was carrying promotional materials for Democratic challenger John Kerry, and the group was barred.\""It just seemed so wrong that there would be a gatekeeper, especially stopping young people from seeing the president in their hometown,"" Walz said. He signed up to volunteer for Kerry.\•••\The 2006 midterm election saw Democrats elected in huge numbers nationwide, driven in part by the unpopularity of the war in Iraq. Initially viewed as a long shot, first-time candidate Walz went on to unseat Gil Gutknecht, a 12-year Republican incumbent.\The highest-ranking enlisted military member in the history of Congress, Walz took up veterans' issues when he got to Washington. Former Rep. Chet Edwards, a Democrat from a similarly conservative-leaning Texas district, said Walz paid attention to overlooked problems of military life, such as day care on military bases, mental health and suicide among soldiers and veterans, and pain management.\""He didn't take credit. His name wasn't out front,"" Edwards said. ""But as one member of Congress, I can attest to his impact.""\Walz held the seat through five more elections, including two in which Republicans made big congressional gains around the country, especially in rural districts. In 2016, Walz was narrowly re-elected even as President Donald Trump won his district by more than 15 points.\In 2011, Walz invited Julie Rosen, a longtime Republican state senator from southern Minnesota, to be his guest at the State of the Union. ""I hope the amiability, respect, and dedication that Congressman Walz and I share will continue in the future,"" she said in a news release at the time.\Many Republicans saw Rosen as well-positioned to challenge Walz and win, but she never ran against him. Rosen now said she suspects Walz wanted to give her an up-close look at the difficulties of life in Washington.\•••\""Pull!"" Walz growled at a recent stop to shoot sporting clays at Caribou Gun Club and Hunting Preserve in Le Sueur, as he aimed his Beretta A400 12-gauge skyward. Commended for marksmanship in his military years, Walz used to visit the club twice a month.\The raw state and national debate over guns is one Walz said he's well-positioned to mediate. He said he can unite ""responsible"" gun owners with gun control activists behind legislation like red flag laws -- letting law enforcement take guns from someone determined mentally unstable by a judge.\His shift angered many gun activists in Minnesota. Bryan Strawser, chairman of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, said his group is impatient with elected officials who retreat from gun rights, and that Walz would pay dearly at the ballot box.\Despite losing the party endorsement at the DFL convention, Walz won the DFL primary. He has continued to court Democratic constituencies. Always capable of a fiery stemwinder, at a recent carpenters' union meeting he castigated Johnson's support for a right-to-work law.\""With us, that bill won't come to our desk. But if it does, we'll tear it up!"" Walz said to thunderous applause.\At a recent debate, Johnson ticked off his case against Walz.\""I believe Minnesotans and Minnesota businesses are overtaxed, and Tim Walz believes we are undertaxed,"" Johnson said. ""I believe that you should have more control over your health care. And Tim has said we need to move to a single-payer system. I believe we should cooperate with the federal government when it comes to illegal immigration enforcement. Tim believes we should become a sanctuary state.""\Walz said he thinks the state can afford a more active government but would consider raising taxes on upper incomes. He's said he'd sign a gas tax increase to pay for transportation improvements. He defends sanctuary policies by arguing that state and local law enforcement should focus on state and local issues, not immigration. And he said ""Medicare for All"" -- as Democrats call their plan to expand government health insurance -- is a federal, not a state priority. But he does agree with it.\Joseph Eustice, a fellow command sergeant major who lives in Ortonville, served under Walz in the Guard. He said he's been voting mostly Republican these past few years but has faith in Walz.\""I don't always agree with Tim. I've disagreed with him about politics and other things,"" Eustice said. ""But if you get a chance to talk to him, you'll have an exchange of ideas, and at the end, he'll either convince you, or he'll understand your viewpoint. And I think then he'll make a decision that he thinks is in the interest of everyone.""\J.

69,"Executive Summary\While there are signs of improvement in national business conditions, the weakness of the St. Cloud-area labor market continues to be a drag on the overall health of the local economy. All available indicators of local labor market activity -- including measures of employment, unemployment, employee compensation, help-wanted advertising, business surveys and written comments by business leaders -- point to ongoing challenges for both workers and their employers as the local economy tries to emerge from a recession that is in its second year.\Area employment declined by 2.7 percent over the year ending July 2009 as only two categories of area private sector employment experienced an increase in annual job growth. July's local unemployment rate of 7.6 percent was much higher than was experienced one year ago when it stood at 5.4 percent. In addition, help-wanted advertising linage at the St. Cloud Times is abnormally low.\Employment conditions around the state appear to be worse than is being experienced locally. For example, statewide employment declined by 3.7 percent over the year ending July 2009. Education/health and government are the only two sectors experiencing employment gains around the state over the past 12 months. Minnesota's manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11.3 percent of statewide employment, experienced a year-over-year decline in employment of 11.4 percent. Locally, manufacturing employment (which accounts for 15.8 percent of area employment) shrunk by 9.6 percent over the same period.\Three of the four components of the St. Cloud Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose in the latest quarter. However, due to time lags in forming the index, we already know that two of these indicators will decline in the next survey. The index continues to point downward over a six-month span.\Eighteen percent of surveyed firms report a decrease in economic activity over the past three months, while 45 percent report an increase. This is a marked improvement over last quarter -- which is a normal seasonal effect -- and is better than one year ago. Survey responses designed to measure the health of the area labor market remain very weak, though. Twenty-four percent of respondents report declining employment and only 20 percent increased payrolls. The length of the workweek has declined for one-fifth of surveyed firms and only 6 percent of firms report an increase in difficulty attracting qualified workers. Nearly 80 percent of firms report no change in employee compensation over the last three months and 10 percent actually decreased wages and benefits. Many area firms continue to report declining prices received for their products and 86 percent of firms either cut back on capital expenditures or left them unchanged over the past three months. On the bright side, companies' evaluation of national business activity was positive for the first time in one year.\Relative to one year ago, the future outlook for surveyed companies is mixed. Thirty-nine percent of the 87 area firms that responded to this quarter's survey expect conditions to improve six months from now, while 21 percent expect a decline in future business activity. Last year at this time, 30 percent of area firms expected declining activity. The outlook for national business activity is much improved from last August and now stands at its highest level in two years. On the other hand, survey responses on future employment, capital expenditures, employee compensation and prices received are much weaker than normal. The index values for these items are the lowest ever recorded in the summer survey. Indeed, the future employment and the future employee compensation indexes are both at their all-time lows.\In special questions, 43 percent of surveyed firms are ""strongly opposed"" to the proposed health care reforms being discussed by Congress. Another 21 percent are either moderately or mildly opposed to proposed reforms. Only 8 percent of surveyed firms are in favor of the proposed reforms. In a separate question, area firms appear to be largely unaffected by the recent increase in the minimum wage. Eighty-two percent of surveyed firms report that they are unaffected by the new law and 10 percent of firms indicate a small negative effect.\Current Activity\Tables 1 and 2 report the most recent results of the business outlook survey. Responses are from 87 area businesses that returned the recent mailing in time to be included in the report. Participating firms are representative of the diverse collection of businesses in the St. Cloud area. They include retail, manufacturing, construction, financial, health services and government enterprises of sizes ranging from small to large. Survey responses are strictly confidential. Written and oral comments have not been attributed to individual firms.\Survey responses from Table 1 are weaker than usually occurs in the August survey. Six of the eight survey items measuring current economic performance are worse than they were one year ago (at which time the local economy was just entering into recession). The diffusion index (representing the percentage of respondents indicating an increase minus the percentage indicating a decrease in any given quarter) on current activity is 26.4, higher than its 17.9 value one year ago. Forty-five percent of surveyed firms reported increased activity over the past three months while 41 percent of firms reported an increase one year ago.\The only other index that was improved from August 2008 was national business activity. With a current value of 3.4, the index on this item is marginally higher than its level 12 months ago, but much higher than its value of -34.7 recorded in February 2009. Fiscal stimulus, low interest rates, and improved financial markets are probably having a favorable impact on local perceptions of national business conditions.\Labor market conditions in the St. Cloud area continue to be extremely weak. Twenty-four percent of surveyed firms report decreased employment over the past three months and 20 percent increased hiring. This is normally a time of the year when employment conditions are much more favorable. For example, in August 2005, 34 percent of firms reported increased employment and only 13 percent reduced payrolls. Indeed, the -4.6 index value for number of employees is the lowest ever recorded in our summer survey, and the only time it has been negative at this time of the year.\With zero or lower index values in length of workweek, employee compensation and difficulty attracting qualified workers, it remains clear that area labor market weakness persists. The index values for length of workweek and employee compensation have never been lower in the summer survey. Likewise, the index value for difficulty attracting qualified workers, while improved from last quarter, is worse than was recorded during the 2001-03 local recession. As we have noted in previous editions of the St. Cloud Area Quarterly Business Report, this is an interesting series to watch since it closely tracked economic performance during the last local recession.\The prices received index in Table 1 is measurably different from that which was found one year ago. With a value of -17.2, current prices received suggest a deflationary trend. One year ago, the value of this index was 13.1 and firms appeared concerned about future inflationary pressures. Area firms continue to either delay or cut back on capital formation projects. Eighty-six percent of surveyed firms report either unchanged or decreased capital expenditures over the last quarter and the -12.6 diffusion index on this item is the second lowest ever recorded.\As always, firms were asked to report any factors that are affecting their business. These comments include:\* ""Interesting times like I have NEVER seen. SURVIVAL - (I) so like this community.""\* ""We face a very competitive environment (competition is companies in other states). Minnesota needs to improve its climate for doing\business.""\* ""(Business) volume and revenue ... is down. Our customers have equipment (idled) and are concerned that the economy will not improve for quite some time.""\* ""Lack of bank financing for small business is our biggest problem.""\* ""If I can pay my bills, I will have a good year.""\* ""Our clients have a much more positive attitude than they did six months ago.""\* ""Without the work (from highly visible local projects), we would be extremely slow. We have yet to see any work from any stimulus funds.""\* ""We have a lot of government office leases. They are requesting rate reductions and shorter leases due to budget cuts.""\* ""We are normally getting contracts during the summer for projects we complete during the fall and winter. This year, there are few, if any, commercial construction projects to bid on. It's going to be a difficult winter for construction-related business.""\* ""We are seasonal. For many of our field employees, we anticipate a seasonal layoff this winter.""\* ""Credit markets remain very tight. We have willing buyers but have a turn down rate of 1 in 3. We are seeing people with 700+ (credit) scores turned down on a regular basis.""\* ""We will not resume capital expenditures until there is a multiyear bill (that supports our industry). Held up in Senate due to health care and Cap and Trade. 11 percent lower head count from same week last year.""\Future Outlook\Table 2 reports the future outlook for area businesses. Survey numbers are improved from one year ago in the overall outlook, length of workweek and national business activity items. All other items are below the August 2008 readings and are much weaker than that which is expected in a normal summer survey.\The future business activity index is 18.4, its highest value in the summer survey since August 2006, at which time it stood at 24.3. Another encouraging sign is the 13.8 value for the national business activity outlook. This is the highest reading on this item since August 2007. There is little doubt that the national outlook is improved from, say, nine months ago -- and there certainly have been a number of monetary and fiscal stimulus efforts that have been undertaken over the past year. The improvement in this index is to be expected. The only other indicator that is improved from one year ago is the length of workweek item. With a value of -3.5 (it was -13.1 one year ago) it is in line with what is normally expected in the summer survey.\Twenty-four percent of surveyed businesses expect to reduce employment over the next six months and 15 percent expect to increase hiring. As shown in the accompanying chart, the diffusion index on future employment is at an all-time low. Likewise, the employee compensation index, at a value of 10.3, has never been lower. Only 15 percent of surveyed businesses expect to increase wages and benefits over the next six months (and 5 percent of firms expect to decrease compensation over this period). By comparison, consider the August 2005 survey, when the index was 45.6 and 47 percent of firms planned to increase employee compensation and only one firm expected to decrease wages and benefits.\Firms also expect little pressure on prices over the next six months. As is seen in the chart below, the prices received index from Table 2 is very near its all-time low recorded in February of this year. Firms also don't expect to experience much difficulty attracting qualified workers over the next six months. The index number on this item remains negative and only 7 percent of surveyed firms expect it to become more difficult to attract qualified workers by next February.\Finally, survey responses suggest we should not expect increased capital expenditures to lead us out of the local recession. Only 11.5 percent of firms anticipate an increase in capital formation over the next six months, and 84 percent plan to either reduce these expenditures or to leave them unchanged. These responses suggest a local economy that has yet to begin a recovery phase -- and it is our expectation that any such recovery will begin no earlier than the fourth quarter and will unevenly impact the varied sectors of the local economy.\Special Questions\The most visible public policy issue that has emerged in recent months has been related to proposed health care reform that is being considered by Congress and the Obama administration. Everyone has seen media clips of town hall meetings that have been conducted by elected representatives in their home states. Public discourse on this topic has been filled with emotion and seems to have attracted a great deal of interest from those who appear to have extreme views.\As we write this report (at the beginning of September 2009), several proposals have emerged from Congress, with fairly common approaches. So, with the understanding that we were unable to identify any particular health care reform proposal under consideration in Washington, we asked the following special question:\""President Obama and Congress are currently debating health care reform legislation that would include nearly universal health insurance coverage, small business payment responsibilities, expansion of Medicaid, subsidies for lower income families, and reduced Medicare provider payments. To what extent does your company oppose or favor the proposed reforms?\Sixty-three percent of surveyed firms are opposed to the proposed reform (and 42.5 percent are ""strongly opposed""). Only 8 percent of firms are in favor of the suggested reform. This is an interesting result, since area firms have consistently identified health care reform as a (and perhaps ""the"") top legislative priority.\Written comments include:\* ""We would most likely drop this benefit or reduce our participation dramatically. We cannot carry any extra load in expenses.""\* ""Who gets to pay for this? We do!""\* ""I'm concerned that this plan will increase the cost of insurance for both my company and my employees.""\* ""Our company does not offer health care. As a single person, I cannot afford health insurance. I am considered 'uninsurable' for a minor reason and (MinnesotaCare) wants $4,800 per year for a $10,000 deductible (policy). Is it worth it?""\* ""Reduction of Medicare payments will further hurt our industry.""\* ""Feds should look to Minnesota on how to manage health care.""\* ""Even temporary government programs become permanent programs. Where will the money come from?""\* ""Conflicting details are confusing.""\* ""I do not believe the government can do anything as well as free enterprise.""\* ""We are moderately in favor of health care cost reform. In order to make any progress with the issue. Congress must decide a) is health care really an entitlement and b) how will health care be rationed and who will suffer when the rationing is imposed.""\* ""Health care reform as Obama proposes would be very negative for U.S. businesses.""\* ""As soon as someone can tell me for sure what is contained in the 1,400 + page bill, I will reserve judgment. No one knows how, or if, this is going to affect any of us. The politicos sure as hell don't know!!!""\* ""We need to take care of our people. We can take care of health care. It is ridiculous that there's so much hyperbole creating nonsensical dialogue.""\* ""They have no business running health care. The way that (they) have run the 'Cash for Clunkers' program is poor enough ... this country does not need socialized medicine.""\* ""I believe the requirement to pay for these benefits will fall on too small of a group.""\* ""Opposed to the 8 percent tax on small businesses!""\* ""We need reform -- but not a program run by the government.""\* ""We already provide health insurance for our employees. The government has proved to be inefficient at every program they get involved with. Why would health insurance be any different?""\* ""Universal coverage will be more expensive and less accessible than the current system. It will punish small business which cannot afford to offer health care.""\* ""A reform such as this would severely (harm) small business ... would decrease quality of health care.""\* ""If the legislation puts a heavier burden on us as a business, I'm against it. We have enough challenges right now.""\* ""We saw a 20 percent increase last year for health insurance and our taxes are continuing to increase. We are a small business and we may need to make cuts that we do not want just to stay competitive if this would pass.""\* ""Concerned about cost to the businesses.""\* ""Unsure of what these reforms are going to be! Do not want to see added responsibilities to the small business sector!""\* ""We need to keep health care private.""\* ""Too soon to tell.""\* ""Sounds like more burden put on small business.""\* ""There needs to be reform but it must first control the liability exposure for doctors and hospitals, and then work on reform -- but not have federal government control health care as it has done with other industries.""\* ""I'm perplexed by the industry. Could health care be considered a public good?""\* ""We provide insurance now, but don't want the idiots in Washington in charge so our coverage goes down!""\* ""If the government gets involved, I expect higher costs due to higher administrative costs and more delays and confusion due to more levels of bureaucracy.""\* ""Opposed, but don't have an alternate suggestion.""\* ""Free trade and health care go together. Government does not belong in business of health care.""\* ""Full employment (is) best option.""\Economists have long debated the efficacy of minimum wage laws. The common view has typically been that there is little need for the government to establish a wage floor in a competitive labor market in which impersonal supply and demand forces determine the optimal equilibrium wage. Some have pointed out, however, that there are market settings in which these competitive forces do not exist to the extent that is needed to achieve the optimal outcome. In these circumstances, it is argued, there may be a role for government to establish a minimum wage in an effort to achieve improved economic outcomes. Of course, minimum wage programs are rarely applied only to those areas in which competition is lacking -- they are, for the most part, universally applied.\While the authors of this report have never found it very advisable for governments to try to legislate wages, we have always taken some comfort in the belief that minimum wages have little effect on the area economy, where strong competitive forces appear to have produced normal entry wages well in excess of any minimums established by law. So, with this in mind, we decided to ask surveyed firms how the recent increase in the federal minimum wage has impacted their company. We asked:\""The federal minimum wage has recently increased to $7.25, affecting some, but not all, businesses that pay the minimum wage. How is your business directly and/or indirectly affected by the minimum wage increase?""\The results are largely as expected. The wages area firms pay is typically in excess of any minimum established by the federal government. Of those local firms that are impacted by the new law, 10 percent say it has a small negative effect.\Comments include:\* ""Right now -- we at the moment could use more help, but can't afford it.""\* ""Our lowest paid employee is at approximately $10 per hour.""\* ""We pay a lot more than minimum wage.""\* ""We pay at the 75th percentile for like jobs in the area/region. Our minimum starting wage is $13 per hour.""\* ""Anything related to construction is above minimum wage.""\* ""Since we pay well above minimum wage, it puts more teenagers out of work.""\* ""Hurts those it intended to help -- typical federal program.""\* ""Our lowest wage is $12 per hour and no pay is based upon minimum wage.""\* ""Cannot hire at minimum wage.""\Sifting the Data for Green Shoots\Early in the summer many economic forecasters discussed ""green shoots,"" or signs of the end of the recession from scattered bits of positive data brought forward against the background of declining output and employment. No doubt there was some evidence of green shoots -- perhaps most notably the stock market recovery from March through late summer. But at least for Central Minnesota, you need to look hard to find any green shoots.\The background can be seen in Table 3. Private sector employment fell by 3 percent in the 12 months up to July 2009, with only two sectors -- education and health, and leisure and hospitality -- showing gains. Goods production and trade were both decidedly down. Some of the losses in the manufacturing sector in late summer have not yet filtered into the data, so we can expect this to continue for the next few months. For the state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities the story is the same, with only education and health bucking the long-term trend. Recoveries normally begin in a few sectors and then spread. A few industries act as a locomotive for the rest. So far we do not see that engine.\Nor do we find any green shoots in Table 4. Unemployment reached relatively high levels in June before receding in July in St. Cloud. The drop in building permits and help-wanted advertising, and the increase in new claims for unemployment insurance, all indicate that the economy remained weak and some leading indicators continued to decline.\Indeed, the year-over-year drop for help- wanted advertising is striking. Newspaper print advertising for jobs in the local market had held significantly above its long-term declining trend through most of 2006 and 2007. It began a sharp contraction to its current position toward the second half of 2008, well below trend. Some have suggested advertising is shifting to online forms. We do not have local data for this (yet) but the Conference Board notes that online help-wanted advertising around the country shot up from April to August by about 8 percent. It notes that Minnesota's help-wanted advertising online has continued a downward trend since February 2008. We will watch this indicator closely in coming months, and we will look into online advertising for help wanted in the local market.\That large decline in help-wanted advertising mostly offset small gains in three of the other leading series. The time series that contribute to leading economic indicators are collected for different time periods, so sometimes we are using data from a few months ago to compute the current number. While new claims for unemployment insurance are rising, they contribute to leading economic indicators that lag, so that the declines in that number from spring are showing up now. The increases of summer will impact LEI in the fall.\Those same lags apply to the Probability of Recession index, which continues to read above 99 percent over the next four to six months. This measure includes the economic conditions index from Creighton University, which still showed Minnesota in contraction through July. Other indexes similarly constructed for Oregon and Washington showed recession probabilities above 95 percent. The coincident indicator series for Minnesota compiled by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve fell 0.96 percent between April and July. This is worse than North and South Dakota and Wisconsin. We feel relatively confident in saying the recession is not over yet as Minnesota is taking a bit longer than other Upper Midwest states to turn around.\The nature of these indicators, however, is that they rely heavily on labor market data. Data on sales and output in a local market is impossible to acquire in a way that is both comprehensive and timely. In the last two national recessions, employment lagged the growth in output and sales more than had been experienced in the first eight post-war recessions, when all three rose almost simultaneously. It is possible this is happening now, too. If so, state and local economic indicator forecasting like we do here may miss the bottom of the economic cycle. (Their performance in calling the start of a recession is better.) Using data on new business formations (in both LEI and the recession probability index) helps us offset this somewhat, as do the St. Cloud Area Business Outlook Survey results found earlier in this report.\While the survey's results on length of workweek are mildly positive -- which we would expect as we approach the bottom of a recession -- none of the other survey questions for future outlook show a turnaround yet. Business leaders still expect to trim their work forces, prices are still declining and few expect to need to increase wage offers to attract workers. Capital spending plans are still muted. Combined with the data above, we think the data show we are approaching the bottom of the cycle rather than it being behind us.\We would urge readers to use all the information in this report together to form expectations for future local market performance. Picking one or two data points is risky.\About the diffusion index\The diffusion index represents the percentage of survey respondents who indicated an increase minus the percentage indicating a decrease.\If manufacturing, when? If not, what's next?\It seems hardly a week goes by that we do not hear of more job losses in the manufacturing sector. Outside of construction, the percentage loss of jobs in manufacturing has outpaced every other sector of the national economy. Since the St. Cloud economy has a higher concentration of jobs in manufacturing than many other places, the impact of manufacturing on St. Cloud is particularly strong.\This has of course happened over a long period of time, and in some ways St. Cloud has been more fortunate than most places. Nationwide, the share of employment in manufacturing since 1990 fell from more than 17 percent to below 10 percent currently. In Detroit, which is heavily dependent on the production of automobiles, employment in manufacturing fell by one-third since 2001, from 17.5 percent of employment in 2001 to 12.9 percent in 2008.\In Central Minnesota, however, the share of employment in manufacturing is higher than the national average and has not experienced the same decline. In St. Cloud, the share of manufacturing in total employment was 18.7 percent in 1990, 18.2 percent in 2001 and 16.4 percent in 2008. The decline in the share of manufacturing in St. Cloud is mirrored by that in Wright County: a gradual decline with periodic larger drops when a sizable firm lays off staff.\One could argue that we are no longer holding a comparative advantage in the production of manufactured goods, lost to China, India or elsewhere. But that is a misunderstanding of the concept. We produce a high amount of manufactured goods but do so with such increases in productivity that fewer workers are hired. The decline in manufacturing jobs does not mean a decline in manufactured goods. Technology that drives manufacturing productivity may have been applied elsewhere before Central Minnesota, but as it spreads to our firms we would expect that trend to continue. Recessions are in this way an encouragement to firms to adopt new technologies faster.\So in one sense we do not argue that manufacturing is dying in Central Minnesota. We do not expect that downward slide in manufacturing to turn around sharply. But those jobs may shift to other areas. Where? We cannot say; it is tempting to believe it is in our one area that grows in jobs -- health and education -- but the long-term trend for population in outstate Minnesota is flat to downward. To the extent St. Cloud may gain residents, people are increasingly likely to move here from other countries, which present challenges to training for higher-technology jobs in health sciences. Likewise, a service-based economy needs a population to serve. So if St. Cloud is to grow in retail or hospitality, one must ask, Who will buy these services? It is an interesting period that the local economy will go through in the next five to 10 years.\In the next QBR Participating businesses can look for the next survey in November and the St. Cloud Area Quarterly Business Report in the Jan.-March edition of ROI. Area businesses that wish to participate in the survey can call the St. Cloud State University Center for Economic Education at 320-308-2157."
70,"Three decades of declining interest rates making debt financing more attractive, increased access to private equity dollars, robust mergers plus acquisition activity have all contributed to a continued decline in the number of public companies both in Minnesota and nationally.Craig Johnson, senior technical research analyst for Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray, has maintained years of pricing data on public companies across the United States.He's seen more than a 20 percent drop in qualifying companies since 2000.""We used to have over 6,000 stocks in our micro group project,"" he said. ""Active and participating right now we have 4,672.""Those ""active and participating"" stocks Johnson tracks have two clear basic qualifications: higher than a $25 million market cap and trade at more than $2 per share.And Minnesota is losing public companies faster than the nation as a whole. Because of the decline, the Star Tribune has decided to recast our former Star Tribune 100 to the Star Tribune 50 list of public companies.In 2000, the Star Tribune 100 list was culled from a universe of 202 companies, and the 100th-largest public company had to have more than $74 million in annual revenue to make the list.On last year's Star Tribune 100, $74 million in revenue would have been good enough for No. 61 on the list.""I think having your list at 50 showcases great companies,"" Johnson said.Jeff Cotton, managing partner for the Minneapolis office of Deloitte, said Minnesota is still blessed with a diverse mix of companies, and a recent national survey taken by the firm shows they are increasingly confident in a strengthening economic environment here and nationally.""We still continue to have a very diverse economy with organizations in all segments of the marketplace across more than a dozen industries that fuel our state and regional economies,"" Cotton said. ""We are less vulnerable to economic shocks that come from these corporations relocating than other parts of the country.""The 50 companies on this year's list saw a collective revenue increase of 4.4 percent to $521.9 billion. Total profits increased 12.3 percent to $36.1 billion.The list is led by the $184.8 billion health care goliath UnitedHealth Group. The Minnetonka-based company alone accounts for 35 percent of the total revenue and 19 percent of total profits.The results when parsed company by company are mixed; 29 of the 50 companies on the list saw revenue increases and 27 saw profit grow. ANI Pharmaceuticals of Baudette, Minn., had the largest percentage jump at 68.5 percent, boosted by the acquisition of two hypertension drugs to its portfolio of generic and branded pharmaceutical products.The 30 companies that didn't make the Top 50 had collective revenue of $1.6 billion. While their revenue as a whole grew at a faster clip of 5.3 percent, collectively they lost $83.7 million.Recasting our list to the top 50 companies makes it more manufacturing centric. Now, 23 of the 50 companies are in the manufacturing sector, and the 30 smallest skew toward medical device and information technology companies. Among those 30 smaller companies, there are some interesting stories that draw attention from some investors.Beth Lilly is a longtime investment manager who throughout her career has invested in small-cap and micro-cap companies. She recently opened her own boutique firm, Crocus Hill Partners, to invest private dollars in those unloved companies. She says there are good investment options among Minnesota's small- to micro-cap companies that didn't make the Top 50.One of those she has recently invested in is Minneapolis-based Tactile Medical, which was ranked 56th this year. Tactile Medical makes pneumatic compression devices that provide treatment options for lymphedema and venus ulcers.""They are going to benefit from treating chronic conditions at home,"" Lilly said.Another one she likes is Eden Prairie-based SurModics (ranked 59th) a maker of drug-coated balloon catheters.""There are really a lot of wonderful companies that size that nobody is paying attention to,"" Lilly said.There could be an uptick in IPOs in coming years if one survey holds true. A national survey from Deloitte of middle-market companies, ""America's Economic Engine: Breaking the Cycle,"" showed that more companies are at least thinking of pursuing an IPO. The survey, published in February, indicated companies are still concerned about operational requirements that make going public more difficult but companies are growing more interested.In 2015, only 15 percent of the companies surveyed said they might pursue an IPO in the next year, in 2016 28 percent of the companies said they might pursue the option.Patrick Kennedy - 612-673-79261UnitedHealth Group Inc.A diversified company offering health insurance and other products, UnitedHealth has two primary units.

71,"John Watson, CEO of one of the world's largest energy companies, spoke last week in Minneapolis about rising U.S. oil and gas production, the need for new pipelines and the case for allowing U.S. crude oil exports.\Chevron's top executive also took questions from the audience after his speech to the Economic Club of Minnesota, and from reporters in a separate session. Here are some of the questions and answers. A longer version is on the 3D Economics blog:\Q: A question on infrastructure. What do we need to do to continue to build out to where we should be?\A: There's a great deal of effort that's needed locally in the area of gathering lines and major trunk lines. The Keystone pipeline is the most visible example, but Canada has infrastructure requirements that they need to put in place by going east to west. We have issues with natural gas. Think about it this way. We're shutting down nuclear plants in the Northeast. We're shutting down coal-fired plants in the Northeast. Where is the energy going to come from? It's going to come from natural gas that needs to be imported to the area. How's it going to move to the area? We have to have pipelines. And you better have capacity that will be sufficient both at the wellhead and in the pipelines to meet seasonality requirements ... The industry has to do its part, whether it's the joint work that's being done with the rail industry on safety, of moving products out of Bakken and elsewhere in this country. We need to keep the trains on the tracks, and over time need to upgrade the rail cars that are being used. We have to have good assurances in place, particularly with some of the aging pipelines.\Q: I'm interested in your projections for oil prices, because there has been downward pressure. What would be the effect of changing oil prices on our economy?\A: My general view is that oil markets are pretty well supplied today. On the other hand, there's relatively little true surplus capacity. The only country that has voluntary spare capacity now is Saudi Arabia. There's some capacity that's been offline because of some of the civil strife around the world ... Unlike the typical manufacturer, where you build a plant and then it's online forever and that capacity doesn't go away, in our business there's this thing called the decline curve, and so it requires perpetual reinvestment. Some oil fields have long, slow declines. Some, like those in the unconventional business, the shales, have very rapid declines ... The break-even cost for most supplies is in many cases $100 and higher. Some it's lower, but over time... you're going to see prices stay at or near the level they are, or potentially higher.\Q: You mentioned three objectives for good energy policy, one being preserving the environment. Where does curbing greenhouse gas emissions fit into that, and what can Chevron do to help?\A: ...I'm not aware of a company that has done more than my company. It's worth noting that, because I do understand the concerns that are out there, I understand the risks of climate change. My company has the largest carbon storage project in the world in Australia. We and our partners are spending $2 billion. We're a part of a carbon sequestration project in Canada. These are among the very largest in the world. We're the largest renewables producer, thanks to our geothermal business ... Here in the United States, we're fortunate. Because of the boom in shale gas, it is naturally displacing coal. Here we have a circumstance where the U.S. is reducing its greenhouse gas emissions without significant intervention in the markets. There's been a great deal of conversation about a carbon tax, or other vehicles, cap and trade. We have one in California. If you think about pollution markets in general, they've been effective when you've had local pollution to deal with, and all emitters could be included. The U.S. is 16 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and falling. It's estimated that without much change we'll be at 13 percent ... You need global engagement on those mechanisms for them to be effective, in my opinion.\Q: What do you see as the prospect, moving forward, of the U.S. exporting crude oil?\A: This is one of the issues that should be allowed on inspection. It doesn't need a lot of discussion when you think about it. Right now, we can export oil products -- gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. What you consume can be exported. You don't consume crude oil. It's just an ingredient in the products. We can put more oil on world markets if we don't artificially constrain U.S. exports of oil ... As a practical matter, the imbalance we have in the United States is that we're producing more light oil, which doesn't fit our refineries very well. So the idea would be to export lighter oil that is being produced out of the shales and import heavier oil to fill out our refineries. It's more of an economic efficiency argument. We have some big projects underway to export natural gas from the Gulf Coast of the U. S. ... I think the U.S. can do a great service to the world's economy by exporting natural gas to help the economies of Europe and Asia develop and have access to cheaper sources of energy than they would otherwise have. So I'm bullish on both, just as I favor exporting farm products and a variety of other goods.\Q: Can you comment on the policy implications of the rise of the Islamic State and instability in North Africa and Nigeria?\A: The effect on the ground of course is very difficult and heart-rending for the people involved. It's significant. People displaced. The impacts that are being felt on the business will in time also be significant. It's hard to get drilling engineers and geologists and the talent to go to places that have these kinds of instabilities. While some oil will continue to be produced in some of the hottest areas, I think over time you'll see investment slow and production decline. Now, there's enormous potential in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq. My company has a presence in Kurdistan, and we evacuated our expatriots, who will return in due course when it is safe to do so. We also have significant business in Nigeria. Most of the conflict you described is in the north. The oil-producing region is to the south. But all of these trends where government is overwhelmed and society becomes dysfunctional, I don't think they're good for consumers, they're not good for people, and they're not good for developing energy resources, where that's possible.\Adam Belz - 612-673-4405 Twitter: @adambelz\Credit: ADAM BELZ; STAFF WRITER"
72,"If the Republicans’ objection to taking action on climate change is because they fear it will lead to more regulation and central planning of the economy (“The conservative case for a carbon tax,” June 10), they need look no further than the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763), introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this year. Putting a price on carbon is something that conservatives can vote for if it is market-oriented and revenue-neutral.\To make it effective, a carbon tax should gradually rise over time. A steadily increasing tax would make fossil fuels more expensive, nudging us consumers to become more efficient in our use of them. It would also spur innovation to find cleaner and more affordable sources of energy, thereby creating a clean energy economy with thousands of new jobs.\To make it politically viable, all the money collected from the tax should be returned to the American people on an equal basis. I for one would welcome a regular dividend check in the mail. As the fee would rise so would the dividend I’d receive. This component should calm the fears of fiscal hawks who don’t want to see our government grow bigger.\Conservatives’ aversion to regulation and mandates don’t have to stand in the way of their taking action on reducing our nations’ carbon emissions. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act gives them a credible way to show that they too can be stewards of our nation’s environment.\Mary Haltvick, Shoreview\ Minnesota’s attractive welfare system \Buried in the article regarding the shake-up at DHS is a sentence that points out that DHS spending has increased by 40% in the last decade!\This is in spite of of Minnesota having one of the strongest job markets in the nation. But it comes as no surprise as Minnesota has one of the most, if not the most, generous welfare systems in the USA along with work requirements that are easily avoided. Hence the 40% increase in spending in an already extremely high budget. This is because of the influx of welfare seekers that have traveled far and wide to get here. These are the least motivated and the least capable. It should comes as no surprise to anyone that their children do poorly in school or the rate of incarceration is high in a community that does not share values that are mainstream in Minnesota. Tighten up on the work requirements and things will change for the better for everyone very soon. It would also be very helpful to increase the minimum wage in the metro area to $15 per hour and $10 in outstate.\Tom Bates, St. Paul\Crédito: Letter Writers"

WASHINGTON -- The president downplays it. Insiders insist it doesn't stand a chance. Yet as negotiations between the Obama administration and Congress take form over a deal on taxes and budgets, the idea of a carbon tax is discussed with greater frequency.
\
Oddly enough, there's no high-profile leader out there championing a carbon tax, yet it's the subject of reports, conferences and a flurry of maneuvers by groups for and against it.
\
""We would never propose a carbon tax, and have no intention of proposing one,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said.
\
A day earlier, President Barack Obama was asked during a White House news conference about the prospects for a carbon tax to address climate change. The president outlined a number of steps his team had taken to lower carbon emissions, but said there was no consensus for a tax on carbon.
\
""That I'm pretty certain of. And, look, we're still trying to debate whether we can just make sure that middle-class families don't get a tax hike. Let's see if we can resolve that. That should be easy. This one is hard, but it's important because one of the things that we don't always factor in are the costs involved in these natural disasters,"" he said.
\
It was music to the ears of oil refiners.
\
""I applaud the president for recognizing that now is not the time for a new, regressive carbon tax that will hamper the nation's ability to get the economy back on track,"" Charles Drevna, the president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, said in a statement.
\
Even with no one formally proposing a carbon tax and the leader of the free world opposing it right now, the group Americans for Prosperity, which advocates limited government, issued a statement boasting that the entire Republican leadership of the House of Representatives had signed its pledge to ""oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.""
\
Also undaunted by the lack of any leader pitching a carbon tax, the environmental group Green For All issued a statement from CEO Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins that sounded as if a carbon tax were now inevitable.
\
""Yes, polluters will fight a carbon tax tooth and nail, just like tobacco companies raged against cigarette taxes. But far from costing jobs, a carbon tax will provide a net benefit to our economy,"" she said.
\
In the simplest terms, a carbon tax is a levy on fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas. They emit carbon dioxide when they're burned, which traps heat in the atmosphere and causes global warming. Such a tax is usually discussed in the context of climate change and global warming, but now it's also viewed as a possible way to raise revenue in a race to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.
\
Congress is trying to forge a deal, or at least a down payment on a deal, that would address expiring Bush-era income tax cuts, stave off deep reductions in government spending and raise the government's borrowing threshold. Everything potentially is in the tax mix, from a carbon tax to caps on popular income-tax deductions such as mortgage interest and charitable giving.
\
The idea of raising revenue from a carbon tax to protect the environment and to lower budget deficits and the national debt isn't farfetched. It almost made it into a widely praised deficit-reduction proposal from the Bipartisan Policy Center, a research organization that's home to former lawmakers and top staffers.
\
The center crafted its November 2010 blueprint called ""Restoring America's Future"" to provide a path for lawmakers who want to get the nation's fiscal house in order. The carbon tax was removed only at the end of the group's internal discussions.
\
""We had a majority of votes in favor of a carbon tax. At the last moment, we couldn't get the unanimity,"" said Steve Bell, a former chief counsel to the Senate Budget Committee who's now the economic policy director for the center.
\
The problem? The center's road map also called for a temporary national sales tax, and members didn't want to have two new taxes.
\
A carbon tax could raise $1 trillion over 10 years without touching income taxes, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That makes it an attractive source of new cash, and the reason Bell thinks it may still be on the table even if no one is saying so.
\
""It's been alive. It's like a cat: It's had nine lives. It's back again,"" Bell said. ""I would not be surprised to see a serious attempt to get that in.""
\
In a sign of the times, the center-right American Enterprise Institute and the center-left Brookings Institution held a joint daylong conference on a carbon tax, exploring everything from its fairness to how much revenue it could generate before it started reducing carbon dioxide emissions -- and consequently reducing the tax revenue.
\
Economists at the American Enterprise Institute don't dismiss the idea of a carbon tax outright, but they caution that its burdens would fall disproportionately on the poor. They concluded, using 2010 tax data, that the burden on the lowest 10 percent of income earners would be five times higher than the burden on the top 10 percent of earners when measured as a fraction of annual income.
\
Researchers on the political left and right have suggested that part of the revenue could be used to defray the costs of social welfare programs or to make up for lower corporate tax rates in a revamp of the tax code.

"
74,"What would the Founding Fathers make of a young congresswoman of Puerto Rican descent and modest means calling for a sweeping overhaul of our nation's political infrastructure?\First, remember that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's plan is inspired by a similar overhaul successfully enacted into law by a rich old white guy.\Yes, we've come a long way since the 1930s. The other key difference between Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and this updated one is that, whereas for Ocasio-Cortez the impetus is global ecological collapse, back then it was mass unemployment following a stock market crash.\Noteworthy, too, is how the 2008 financial meltdown, in many ways more catastrophic even than the one in 1929, was managed so as not to result in another Great Depression. The ""fix"" was a taxpayer-funded bailout paired with the few remaining New Deal protections from financial overreach left after decades of bank deregulation. The 2008 crisis wouldn't have happened at all if FDR's Glass-Steagall Act had not been repealed by the Clinton administration.\It is ironic that socialist intervention, in the form of that bailout, kicked the can down the road. Nothing fundamentally changed. The issues underlying the mortgage crisis were not resolved or even addressed. Too-big-to-fail banks are bigger than ever and increasingly interdependent. So are many other sectors of our economy. And as wealth concentrates, the majority of Americans are increasingly left behind. It has gotten to the point where the New York Times, in a recent piece about the wealth gap, defined as ""upper middle class"" anyone in the top 10 percent of earners. It used to be the upper third, didn't it?\In truth, only the upper 1 percent of Americans with stock portfolios are benefiting from rising GDP and low unemployment. Most people's income hasn't budged since the 1970s, when the relatively low cost of living meant a family could still survive on one paycheck.\The day of reckoning has arrived. It is called, appropriately, I think, the Green New Deal. It begins with values, which is also appropriate. This is how the Founders crafted their vision for America. The Declaration of Independence set forth the ""why"" and the Constitution, hammered out through intense negotiation, created the ""how."" The system of checks and balances seemed foolproof and set the course for steady improvement in America's quality of life.\Unfortunately, it was not able to withstand globalization's promise of both free and fair trade. The Founders' central fear was international pressure to conform to the values of other nations, mainly the European powers whose practice of imperialism (as opposed to high-minded talk of manifest destiny) most of the Founders deplored.\That fear became real in the Reagan era with the ascendancy of laissez-faire capitalism. The Founders' vision of a democratic oasis of fairness and equality was eventually eroded by a corporate-sponsored propaganda campaign that convinced most Americans that less is more when it comes to government.\The Green New Deal challenges Americans -- all Americans -- to link arms and take government back. Young people face a terrifying future. Only they understand that climate change is not an economic opportunity but a crisis more dire than Pearl Harbor -- and that just as World War II was managed by FDR and not a handful of CEOs in some private resort in Davos, only government can fix this.\To patronizing comments by the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, young advocates of the Green New Deal have responded with reasoned insights. In a New York Times op/ed, the millennial Jedediah Brittoin-Purdy, author of ""After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene,"" wrote this: ""What has taken liberal critics aback is that the Green New Deal strays so far from the traditional environmental emphasis on controlling pollution, which the carbon tax aims to do, and tries to solve the problems of economic inequality, poverty and even corporate concentration (there's an antimonopoly clause).""\The young minds behind the Green New Deal know full well that, as Britton-Purdy writes, ""[c]entrist proposals will concentrate on promoting investment in new technologies, with profits going, pharma-style, to private researchers and manufacturers.""\He goes on to educate his elders with memory problems on the American history they lived and he only read about. ""Curiously, the idea that environmental policy could ever be separated from the larger economic order, or from fights over fairness, is recent, a product of an unusually technocratic period in American politics.""\The old attitude toward environmental policy was alive and well as recently as 1970, on both sides of the aisle, he adds. ""Arguing for the Clean Air Act on Earth Day 1970 [it is now being dismantled], Senator Edmund Muskie, Democrat of Maine and the law's lead drafter, insisted that 'man's environment' included 'the shape of the communities in which he lives' and that 'the only kind of society that has a chance' was 'a society that will not tolerate slums for some and decent houses for others, rats for some and playgrounds for others, clean air for some and filth for others.' ""\What's changed isn't just our climate but our national priorities. By conflating socialism with Joe Stalin, the right succeeded in scaring Americans into thinking their democratically elected government with its elaborate checks and balances was somehow not just hopelessly inefficient at decisionmaking (true) but ruthlessly efficient at destroying freedom.\The Founders would have been appalled. Their own idealism was if anything more quixotic and impractical than the moonshot that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez invokes when she compares her plan with the can-do America that was still awed by supersonic jets and yet undaunted by the notion of putting a man on the moon. After all, the Founders had just whipped the mightiest military force in history.\Among them, the federalist Alexander Hamilton would be especially pleased to see that his beloved federal government was still powerful enough, 200 years on, to mobilize around a threat to the common good. Hamilton may have been an elitist, but he was also a staunch democrat who believed in fairness and would not have approved of a system as rigged in favor of the rich as the global economy is in 2019.\Historians generally agree that Hamilton would not only have deplored the serial laissez-faire administrations of Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover in the 1920s, but vigorously applauded FDR's moves to strengthen the banking system that Hamilton himself had invented.\All the Founders would have seen that the current crisis is about preserving U.S. values from the same influences that threatened their new nation -- cynicism and greed.\As for land stewardship, Thomas Jefferson adopted regenerative practices at Monticello after learning from his own mistakes as a farmer. He would have loved FDR's Subsistence Homesteading Act because it helped farmers who had unwittingly exhausted the soil (arguably a minor offense compared to knowingly polluting it with chemicals toxic to soil microbes and other wildlife). The act did what the Green New Deal will do if its vision becomes law: Government subsidies enabled small-scale farmers to learn from their mistakes, adopt more eco-friendly practices and make the Dust Bowl productive again. This turnaround was accomplished long before the ""green revolution"" forced small-scale farmers off the land.\John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" tells how the Okies were demonized by fellow American citizens when they migrated to California in the '30s, reminding us of yet another inconvenient truth about American history and basic human nature. Bigotry can almost always be traced to the survival instinct and its corollary in humans, fear of poverty. It isn't dark skin that causes prejudice but its negative associations.\Fear of poverty is why Hoover brutally dismantled an encampment of mostly white veterans, the Bonus Army, who were only trying to collect back wages for serving in World War I.\Then as now the poor were branded as lazy and shiftless no matter who they were. There is one difference: People were kinder to the Okies and the hobos and the refugees from the Bonus encampment and Hoovervilles because they knew that ""there but for the grace of God go I.""\They also knew the crisis would pass. They had confidence in FDR. Climate change is different. It is unprecedented in human history. Fear of losing advantage has gripped the elites of both parties. This is why they are loath to surrender power to young idealists.\But those agitating for a Green New Deal have their own truth. They know that the ""measured approach"" the elites pretend to believe in is in fact a shibboleth. By opposing a risky (to them) fight on all fronts, the elites are simply hedging their bets. They have built up defenses against any ideology other than dog-eat-dog. And now, they are willing to sacrifice not just the common good but a sizable portion, perhaps the majority, of their fellow human beings.\This is the greatest unfairness of all. Unless the Green New Deal is embraced, only the rich will have the means to place a bet. Ordinary working Americans must win this fight. It's not about the survival of the species, as the elites would have us believe (though they know otherwise: Homo sapiens is as resilient as the cockroach). It's about who will survive … and why they will survive … and how that story will be told for generations to come.\BONNIE BLODGETT\The St. Paul writer specializes in environmental topics.

75,"It's encouraging that President Obama has declared his commitment to a ""national conversation"" on climate change just as 2012 is confirmed as the hottest year on record in U.S. history, and among the hottest 10 years in the modern global temperature record.\Solving what England's Stern Commission called ""the greatest market failure of all time"" -- allowing the fossil fuels industry to use the atmosphere as a free sewer for carbon waste that alters the climate -- must inform the energy and tax policy debates of the next three years, with the president committed to resolving it in favor of the health of the planet.\Before that conversation begins, let's review energy issues the last election settled. For although climate change was shamefully not raised by debate moderators, the election became a clear referendum on energy policy -- and green energy won.\In the debates, Mitt Romney made clear his priority was to quickly approve the Keystone XL Pipeline to move dirty Canadian tar sands oil to Gulf ports. Obama was wisely mute. Now it is Obama's time to speak up, cancel the pipeline by presidential order and use his State of the Union address to tell Americans why. This export pipeline will provide few long-term jobs, and may well raise oil prices. Far more important, canceling it would be the beginning of the end of the oil industry's political and economic hegemony.\Subsidies to the oil industry must end. This issue was fully vetted in the campaign, and Obama won, in spite of at least $136 million of direct oil industry attack ads.\Subsidies for noncarbon energy, especially wind, have already been renewed, another victory. Romney lost Iowa, where wind power is well-established, in part by opposing such subsidies, which Obama supported.\Finally, Obama and Romney agreed that the federal government should expand research into next-generation energy, the kind that is already bearing fruit in new storage battery technology soon to be commercialized from MIT laboratories, research partially funded by Obama's Department of Energy. The president has a mandate to increase funding for such research.\The major climate policy not addressed in the campaign was a carbon tax or cap-and-trade regime. Here is where the ""national conversation"" is essential. Obama certainly supported the cap-and-trade bill that died in the Senate early in his first term, and has expressed doubts about the carbon tax. Romney endorsed neither.\Some environmentalists are critical of the president for his apparent passivity on carbon solutions. But gridlock politics requires just this conversation. The costs of carbon taxes or cap-and-trade will be broad, with impacts greater on some sectors than others, and tens of thousands of workers in the coal and oil industries need to prepare for the mostly coal- and oil-free world a stable climate demands. That transition will be wrenching, and the impacts need to be mitigated as much as possible.\In the climate wars, President Obama must be our Roosevelt, rallying the nation and the world to the cause of saving the future. For all of us now know that a rising sea level is no cheap laugh, and that the record heat and drought of the last year is no statistical blip but a crippling trend. Crops withered in the fields; 75 million acres of western forests have died; acidification of the oceans has begun to damage shellfish production. The symptoms of a planet reeling from carbon sickness, a form of cancer, are all around us.\President Obama -- it is time for you to lead this war for all of us. You did not ask for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, one ended, the other ending, nor for the recession, which you defeated. Nor did you ask for the carbon war. But you understand it. History demands that you be not only America's first black president, but America's first green president.\James P. Lenfestey is a former Star Tribune editorial writer.\Credit: JAMES P. LENFESTEY"
76,"The author Edward Arlington Robinson would like the name Michael Noble. Robinson enjoyed giving his protagonists names that reflected their true character. You can't spend 10 minutes with Michael Noble without recognizing that he is, in fact, a noble man.\For 30 years, Michael Noble has dedicated himself to a vision of an energy-efficient economy. For 16 of those years, he has been the executive director of Fresh Energy and its predecessor organization. When politicians at the state Legislature start spouting off about energy and the environment, they look around to see if Michael Noble is in the hall. If he is present, they resort to the facts. When he is not around, legislators sometimes simply make things up.\Michael Noble, more than even journalists, keeps politicians honest when they start creating facts out of thin air. That's because Noble knows more about energy, global warming, state law and the environment than any of our elected officials.\You don't think politicians just make things up? When the Legislature was considering what amount of sulfates ought to be allowed in wild rice rivers near a proposed mining site, Rep. Tom Rukavina stood up and said the limit should be 250 milligrams per liter. The current standard is 10 milligrams. Rukavina wants the mine built, so he just made up a number. He said that's the allowable measure of sulfates in the human body, so why wouldn't it be good for wild rice? No science. Just politics. The body looked around for signs of Michael Noble, and decided it might be best to wait for some actual research before acting on Rukavina's suggestion.\Noble tried his hardest last Thursday, but the state Senate voted 42-18 to lift state restrictions on coal plants. The law has been in place since 2007. Out of 201 legislators, 184 voted for the coal restrictions. Times have changed. The Legislature has changed. And, now it appears, Minnesota's national leadership on energy and the environment is changing. One of those who voted to lift the restrictions was Sen. Julie Rosen, Republican from Fairmont. But Sen. Rosen voted for the restrictions four years ago. Things change.\Noble is noble. ""Julie Rosen is a very fine senator,"" he told me. ""I admire her and how she is managing a good committee. She continues to voice support for renewable energy and energy efficiency legislation.""\Yet Rosen voted to lift restrictions that require any new coal plant to reduce emissions elsewhere in the utility's system. Noble told me: ""She is fond of saying that man can't live by renewables alone.""\Pawlenty's leadership\The laws, passed by a super-majority in 2007, came about as a result of then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty's leadership on global warming, energy and the environment. That leadership is something of an embarrassment for him now. One poll showed his impressive energy credentials turn out to be his biggest negative among Tea Party regulars. He has a defense. Pawlenty actually started backsliding a long time before this presidential campaign.\Pawlenty put together a group called the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group (MCCAG). There were 56 members and Noble remembers, ""the largest fraction of the group was from business and industry, and the smallest fraction came from the environmental side.""\It was the task of the MCCAG to come up with recommendations to implement the 2007 Next Generation Energy Act. Among other things, like restricting new coal plants without emissions reductions, it required an overall reduction in greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050. It was a tall order, but the MCCAG went to work and reported out 46 recommendations to help the state reach its goals. Once the recommendations were in Gov. Pawlenty's hands, he sat on them. He could have given them to the Legislature to debate, but he didn't. After all of the work of the MCCAG, Pawlenty did nothing. Actually, he did do two things. He reversed himself on the coal restrictions, and called for a lifting of the moratorium on new nuclear plants.\Noble thinks Pawlenty was scared off the coal restrictions by the governor of North Dakota. You see, this whole coal restriction controversy has little to do with the future of Minnesota coal plants. The argument is really over whether Great River Energy can import coal-fired electricity from the new Spiritwood plant in North Dakota. North Dakota threatened to sue Minnesota. It was going to claim the Minnesota restrictions violated our neighbor's rights and was a hidden carbon tax on North Dakotans. If that sounds like a weak argument to you, you are not alone. One senior legislator thought it was a bluff play. But Pawlenty folded his hand.\I asked Noble why everyone was so united back in 2007 and so divided today. He said: ""In 2007, the industry was sure there was going to be a carbon cap-and-trade bill at the federal level."" That didn't happen, and now a slow dismantling has begun. ""The upshot of the Legislature's attempt to lift the restrictions sends the wrong signal to investors in clean-tech global capital, which is, by the way, the fastest-growing segment of the nation's investment economy. We are giving the signal that Minnesota, once a leader, is backing away from a clean energy economy.""\Xcel as rock star\Another part of Minnesota's energy picture has to do with efficiencies. It is axiomatic that conserving energy is like finding energy, without building a new plant. Noble has high praise for Xcel. ""It is the rock star,"" he said. ""It is trying to get everyone to conserve energy. If people conserve energy, Xcel doesn't have to go out and borrow money to build an expensive new electricity plant.""\He has less praise for small co-op utility operations. ""They don't produce the electricity, they buy it, and turn around and sell it. They don't want to conserve. The more electricity they sell, the more money they make."" And, Noble adds, they don't have to worry about paying for a new plant. ""We know energy savings is the easiest and cheapest way to meet our energy needs, by far.""\The 2007 law was wisely written. It has an anti-backsliding provision, but the backsliders are in ascendance. The dismantlers are concerned that Minnesota will be unable to meet industrial demands, won't be able to attract business and build jobs. Noble says that's hogwash. ""The renewable energy standard creates a $10 billion new electricity investment at or below market rates.""\At the Legislature, one hears the refrain that renewables cause electricity rates to skyrocket. ""That's not true,"" says Noble. ""Xcel shows no upward effect on rates as it adds renewables.""\Noble adds: ""You always know how much renewables will cost. You have no idea what the upward price pressure will be of coal, whether through regulation or the cost of the product."" No new coal, without emission offsets, is the law of the land, unless Gov. Mark Dayton signs the repeal. Noble says, ""It's going to be a brawl.""\Few people, and certainly not Michael Noble, question Sen. Julie Rosen's ethics. When it comes to Minnesota's advanced energy policy, Noble remembers Rosen saying that Minnesota can on longer be out there by itself, an island.\It takes pure courage to lead, to walk the point of a platoon. It is the definition of feeling alone. And, as it concerns her view that man can't live by renewables alone, I'm reminded that before the Wright brothers lifted off from Kitty Hawk, clergymen of every stripe preached from their pulpits that God never intended man to fly.\Credit: Don Shelby"
77,"This being Earth Day, I call your attention to the 2014 edition of the Environmental Performance Index, a massive inventory of global progress, stasis and backsliding on all things environmental.\Issued biennially by researchers at Yale and Columbia universities, the EPI ranks 178 countries of the world in ways that may test some of your preconceptions.\The top-ranked nation is Switzerland, and No. 2 is Luxembourg. Both fit the notion that exemplary environmental stewardship is the prerogative of wealthy Western nations possessing not only the means but also the cultural mores and advanced economies that make it easier to be green.\But Singapore -- populous, cramped, port-oriented, Southeast Asian Singapore? Or Australia -- with its horrific wildfires and retreat from initially aggressive policies on climate change? And the Czech Republic -- just a couple of generations into its post-Soviet history?\Yet those are the countries rounding out the top five, for reasons I'll come back to in a moment.\No surprises at the bottom of the list: Afghanistan is dead last, with Lesotho, Haiti, Mali and Somalia ranking only a bit better.\And as for the U.S., well, extend three fingers on each mitt and get ready to pump them skyward as you shout, ""We're No. 33! We're No. 33!""\Which is actually about where we've typically ranked since 2002 in the data assembled by the EPI, despite a dramatic change in environmental rhetoric, at least, from Washington.\The Chinese paradox\Perhaps the most interesting metrics this year are those that attach to China -- leading contributor to global warming, frequent focus of headlines about environmental evil-doing.\China comes in at No. 118 on the list, but that summary ranking, like the typical news footage, obscures some quite high marks earned for serious efforts to do better, particularly on climate change.\Writing a few weeks ago at ChinaFAQs, an interesting blog supported by the World Resources Institute, EPI chief author Angela Hsu had this to say about the paradox:\Although the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China is emerging as a leader in tackling climate and energy issues. Their standing at 21st out of 121 countries, while Germany stands at 31st and the United States at 49th, is a testament to the actions the Chinese government has taken over the last decade to reduce the energy intensity of their economy.\This is not a strictly apples-to-apples comparison, because Germany and the U.S., as developed economies, earn their rank based on how well they reduced carbon intensity over the decade from 2000 to 2010. China, still developing, is scored slightly differently -- on how much it slowed its growth in carbon intensity in the five year period 2006-2010 versus the period 2000-2005. But still:\China performed better than all other emerging economies (Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa) in reducing its rate of carbon intensity growth.\The goal set by the [Beijing] government was to reduce energy intensity 20 percent by 2010 from 2005 levels, and the government's programs and policies to reach this goal are well documented.\These efforts include the closure of small, inefficient industrial and manufacturing facilities; a program aimed to improve efficiency at the Top 1,000 energy-consuming enterprises; and standards for energy efficiency aimed at buildings and appliances.\Rigorous and readable\The EPI has earned a reputation for rigor over the years, and earned good marks last week in an independent review by the European Union's Joint Research Center. It computes rankings in nine separate subject areas: environmental health impacts; air quality; water and sanitation; water resources; agriculture; forests; fisheries; biodiversity and habitat, and climate and energy.\This year's list of 178 countries is larger by 46 than in 2012. With these additions -- mostly from sub-Saharan Africa or of small island states -- the index covers environmental activity under flags that account for 99 percent of global population, 98 percent of the world's total land area, and 97 percent of global gross domestic product.\So you could say the analysis is exhaustive, but I would also point out that in the run of such reports this one is, at least to my eyes, not only exceptionally readable but so attractive it's even pleasant to peruse, whether the news in a particular section is good or bad.\(My favorite place for reading the whole thing online is over at the magazines-on-the-Web site Issuu; and if you register, you can download the PDF. If you'd rather just sort and crunch numbers to dig deeper into topics or places of particular interest, there are impressive interactive features available as well at Yale and Columbia; see links at end.)\And though I think over-summarizing the findings may be a disservice, it's worth pointing out that this year's best news is probably about continuing progress on assuring steady access to safe drinking water and sanitation, advances that have led directly to reductions in child mortality.\More than 2 billion people who lacked a safe water supply in 1990 have it today, according to the EPI, a pace that exceeded agreed-upon global goals. Singapore's achievements were a key reason for its high rating; even Afghanistan made big progress.\On the other hand, worsening air quality in many parts of the world has continued to take a toll on public health. For one grim example, premature deaths from air pollution in India (No. 155) rose from 100,000 a year in 2000 to more than 600,000 in the next decade.\Better on health than habitat\In general, the report found more progress on environmental measures related to human health and mortality than to ecosystem health and habitat protection. For just one discouraging example of the latter, the report finds that 87 percent of the world's fisheries are in serious trouble, many so overexploited they will never recover.\It was performance on some of these more traditionally ""environmentalist"" initiatives that seemed key to the rankings of this year's top performers. Switzerland got high marks for the creation of national parks as a vehicle for land and habitat conservation, while also pursuing a carbon-reduction program in its energy sectors that outpaced even Germany's.\Land preservation, high water quality and sustainable development initiatives lifted Luxembourg into the second spot despite poorer marks on climate and energy systems.\Australia overcame poor performance on climate, energy and fisheries management with traditional environmental protection and conservation policies; its recent work toward a carbon tax and a renewed bolstering of climate policy also scored some points.\Singapore won recognition for all it does to manage the impacts of a large population in a small space, from land-use planning to sustainable development to recycling, along with investments in wastewater treatment and sanitation.\The Czech Republic's poor air quality -- linked to the highest cancer rates in the European Union -- was outweighed in the EPI rankings by its investments in public lands conservation aimed at protecting habitat and biodiversity.\The U.S. rankings were little changed, as I said, from previous years. Our score for fisheries management dropped dramatically in the standard 10-year comparison, but this was offset by slight gains in air quality, agricultural practices and environmental health.\Most of western Europe ranked higher, as did Japan and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Israel, South Korea and Taiwan ranked lower.\Somehow I never get used to seeing that we rank 35th in the world for child mortality.\* * *\More information about the EPI in its present and past editions is available at the websites of its authoring organizations, the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network.\Credit: Ron Meador"
78," This year's legislative session isn't over yet, but environmental leaders are already counting their losses.\ ""It's not that we expect all our bills to pass,"" said Lisa Doerr, Minnesota executive director of Citizens for a Better Environment. ""But we think in a democratic process that they at least deserve to be heard.""\ Usually lobbyists are reluctant to criticize specific lawmakers during the final month of a legislative session. It's simply not good politics to risk angering the elected officials who, until final adjournment, can delete, amend and attach provisions to bills on the floor or in conference committee.\ But several environmentalists are sounding off against Sen. Bob Lessard, DFL-International Falls, who heads the environment and natural resources committee.\ ""We're definitely seeing gridlock in the legislature on environmental bills,"" Doerr said. ""It's not a mystery where the problem is. The current leadership in the Senate does not allow discussion.""\ Said Judy Bellairs, Minnesota legislative director for the Sierra Club, ""It's been a disappointing session, and the environment didn't really seem to be on the agenda again this year. The big roadblock is the fact that Bob Lessard is able to refuse to hear bills in the Senate.""\ In a letter last week to members of the Minnesota League of Conservation Voters, Chairman Ernie Diedrich wrote, ""The legislature is caving in to those who wish to see environmental legislation weakened or stopped dead in its tracks. This legislative session has been eco-miserable!""\ Some of the bills that Lessard's committee did not hear include the following:\ Packaging-reduction bill. Establishes requirements that packaging material contain a certain percentage of reusable or recycled material and sets 1- to 4-cent fees on packaging that is not recyclable. Requires mandatory refillable pesticide containers,\ greater production of refillable beverage containers, possible deposits on some containers.\ Sustainable Energy Transition Act. Establishes a tax on carbon content of fuel to discourage use of coal and other fossil fuels, and to provide incentives for wind and other renewable sources of energy.\ Toxic Air Emissions Act. Expands the number of large users of toxic chemicals who are required to report emissions, including more than 200 government, transportation, utility and service industries. Requires those firms to pay fees on some chemical releases. Mandates that big firms report the quantities of certain chemicals they use each year, not just how much they emit into the air.\ Landfill Cleanup Act. Provides funds for cleaning up about 100 leaking municipal landfills by assessing surcharges on pollution-insurance policies and on products containing hazardous chemicals, or by increasing garbage taxes.\ The first two bills are considered dead for this session, and only a small portion of the air-emissions act is still under consideration by legislators as part of a different bill. Legislators have effectively postponed the final decision on landfill cleanups until next session.\ Lessard defended his decisions not to allow these proposals to be discussed, and called them either ""extremist"" or ""fraught with controversy."" Members of the environment and natural resources committee did hear other bills, he said, including ones that require planning for water shortages, encourage redevelopment of polluted land and mandate the labeling of hazardous household products. The panel also spent a considerable amount of time on Indian treaty rights.\ ""My approach on environmental legislation is that you can pass sound bills and protect jobs and allow for economic development if you just use common sense,"" Lessard said. ""One-sided"" ideas have no place before his committee, Lessard said, unless environmentalists work out ahead of time some of their differences with labor, industry and other groups.\ ""If anyone disagrees with this philosophy, the leadership should remove me as chairman of this committee,"" he said.\ Sen. Steven Morse, DFL-Dakota, wrote many of the bills that were not heard, and said, ""Getting a hearing in the Senate on a good environmental bill is like pulling teeth. That's become fairly common knowledge.\ ""Some people feel that everything should be done ahead of time, and the deals cut in the back room,"" Morse said. There's nothing wrong with bringing controversial matters into a committee hearing process, he said. ""Industry folks are afraid to do that. They don't like to talk in public about their positions on environmental issues.""\ Environmentalists contend that not having the opportunity to debate proposals in committee also robs them of the chance to educate legislators about new and better ways to protect the environment. ""The other problem is that groups that oppose our bills are not willing to sit down and compromise,"" said Bellairs of the Sierra Club. ""They figure they can just block the bills completely. When you see what other states are doing, I think we're falling behind.""\ Bob Rootes, Minnesota lobbyist for United Steelworkers-District 33, said that the proposals on packaging, the carbon tax and air toxins would have resulted in major costs for labor and industry. If environmentalists are concerned about the democratic process, he said, they should be more open to other interest groups such as his.\ ""Environmentalists have been going to meetings in certain lawmakers' offices and crafting these environmental bills with no input from people who are impacted,"" Rootes said.\ ""It's been partly our fault that in the past we were too busy with other matters to be involved in the formation of environmental policy. We should have a piece of this. We should be talked to,"" he said.\ Rootes is cochair of a new organization called the Minnesota Environmental Coalition that includes many of the state's larger business and labor organizations. Among coalition proposals for next year, Rootes said, will be a bill that would require state environmental agencies to specify potential job losses and consumer costs whenever they propose rules that are stricter than federal regulations.\ In recent months, legislators have also been considering a bill that would prohibit expansion or enhancement of coal-fired power plants along the Mississippi River in the greater metro area, including a proposed steam-heating facility for the University of Minnesota. That bill may be debated on the House floor this week, according to its author, Phyllis Kahn, DFL-Minneapolis, and is still under consideration in the Senate.\ Legislators have also debated amendments to Minnesota's 1991 Wetlands Conservation Act that environmentalists say will weaken it, but that others contend are reasonable and practical changes.\ Another set of amendments involves the state's Waste Management Act. One proposal defeated on the House floor Tuesday would have required manufacturers by 1996 to begin putting labels on household products such as cleansers that are hazardous and should be not be thrown away with regular trash.\ A second change would formalize an existing rule that prohibits businesses from throwing away fluorescent bulbs and other high-intensity lamps that contain mercury.\ Although environmentalists are disappointed with the session, some environmental agencies are pleased. Deputy commissioner Ann Glumac of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency said legislators have shown strong interest in her agency's programs and funding needs.\ ""Minnesota has a tremendous environmental infrastructure of programs that need to be reviewed and maintained,"" Glumac said. ""It's a mistake for anyone to judge success only by new things, or to feel that the environment hasn't had a successful year because a couple of new proposals haven't been adopted."""
79,"President Barack Obama has announced that his decision on the Keystone XL pipeline will be based on ""the net effects of the pipeline's impact on our climate,"" as he called on the United States to lead international efforts to combat global warming.\He now has a detailed study of the global-warming issue from the School of Earth Sciences at Canada's University of Victoria. Published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the study's calculations showed that retrieving and burning all of the 170 billion barrel economically viable Alberta oil sands reserve would raise global temperature by 0.03C, or one thirtieth of a degree centigrade.\He also has the State Department report that approval or denial of Keystone XL ""is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands, or on the amount of heavy crude oil refined in the Gulf Coast area."" Lack of pipeline capacity simply diverts oil transport to rail or tanker-truck transport with the type of hazard seen in the recent oil train derailment in eastern Canada.\Pulling the president away from Keystone XL approval is political pressure from a large bloc of supporters who regard the Alberta oil sands as the ""dirtiest oil"" on the planet. The president is caught between his campaign promises to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and concerns about global warming versus the science and economics supporting the pipeline.\Dependable, friendly source\Keystone XL assures oil from a dependable, friendly source, instead of imports from Venezuela and the Middle East. If we don't take the oil, it will likely go to customers in Asia with no net benefit to the environment. He could also point to thousands of new jobs, which could be an offset for environmentally conscious supporters.\The world runs on oil, whose compounds provide everything from transportation to the asphalt that paves our roads. Petroleum feed stocks provide building materials, fertilizers, pesticides, medicines, plastics and more. Our older domestic oil reservoirs are declining, and there are three major North American sources to fill the gap. There's the oil in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico; the Alberta oil sands; and the oil shale in regions like the Williston Basin's Bakken field, which require hydraulic fracking.\Of the three, the largest source is in Alberta. It can be pipelined here, or we can use long lines of oil tanks pulled by diesel-burning rail and truck power.\The Ogallala aquifer\Opponents of the pipeline point to threats to the Ogallala aquifer. But a big threat there is from biofuel farming. Millions of tons of fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation water are continuously dumped on the soils that drain directly above the aquifer. A study by Professor Sangwon Suh of the University of Minnesota reported that in Kansas and Nebraska, 500 gallons of water are required to grow and process the corn for each gallon of ethanol produced. Much of that water is drawn from the Ogallala.\There are thousands of miles of oil and gas pipelines in the United States. They operate with minimal safety problems. Some of those lines are directly above the Ogallala aquifer, which is unaffected. The new Keystone XL pipeline will continuously monitor sensors that register pressure and leak issues. Valves are spaced along the pipeline and are closed from remote centers to limit loss from leaks.\Lacking serious carbon-tax and fuel-conservation measures to drastically reduce fossil-fuel consumption, pipelines are the best way to transport oil, our largest energy fuel source.\Rolf Westgard is a professional member, Geological Society of America.

New York State has become the country's most intense battleground in the fight over unconventional natural-gas drilling, known as fracking. Now anti-fracking activists in the Empire State are claiming a victory. They ought to think twice about what they are wishing for.
\
Those who would ban fracking or regulate it into oblivion ignore the exceptional benefits that inexpensive natural gas can provide in the biggest environmental fight of our time -- against climate change.
\
After four years of review, state regulators opted for another round of public-health analysis before they permit new unconventional wells. More analysis will probably trigger another public-comment period, even though the state has already taken in nearly 80,000 comments.
\
Why more delay? Among other things, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and other officials say that environmentalists have threatened to sue the state if it permits fracking. Cuomo argues that a thorough environmental and health review will make the state's eventual fracking rules more resistant to legal challenges. ""Months or years of litigation may be avoided,"" Cuomo said.
\
We are in no position to judge what combination of politics and legal judgment pushed New York toward this latest delay, and we're all for making sure that fracking is safe. Fracking involves pumping a mixture of water and chemicals deep underground to free trapped gas, and it should proceed with due care and proper regulation. The federal Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency have proposed some sensible rules.
\
But anti-fracking activists who hope delay begets delay and eventually prohibition are doing the environment no favor. Burning natural gas produces only about half the carbon emissions as burning coal, which produced 42 percent of America's electricity in 2011. With the increasingly common use of fracking, natural gas prices have plummeted, encouraging a switch from coal to gas, and the country's emissions trajectory has improved.
\
True, half the emissions does not mean no emissions. But the United States does not have to eliminate its carbon footprint all at once, nor should it. Doing so would cost far too much. Instead, natural gas can play a big role in transitioning to cleaner energy cheaply. A recent analysis from Resources for the Future, a think tank, shows that low, fracking-driven natural gas prices combined with efficiency measures and a serious carbon tax would result in a massive increase in the use of natural gas, nearly eliminating America's coal dependence by 2035 and cutting emissions from the electricity sector by more than half.
\
Renewable technologies, meanwhile, would have time to lower costs and address other hurdles to widespread deployment before picking up more of the load later in the century.
\
Environmentalists, in other words, should hope fracking is safe -- and permitted.

Wouldn't it be even lovelier with the absence of buses and taxis? We have the opportunity to make the new mall a true park experience with grass, flower gardens, open plazas, performance spaces, and open-air eating without the stink and noise of buses and cars. Further, consider one of these vehicles going out of control, wiping out a bunch of the pedestrians this new sculpture will attract. I say put that lovely new sculpture in an appropriate setting with no wheeled vehicles.\Harald Eriksen, Brooklyn Park\TERROR ATTACK\Massacre in France can't pass quietly\What can France do to preserve freedom of religion and freedom of expression in light of the brutal killings in Paris?\Should the French become more politically correct by self-editing themselves as is done for the ""n"" word in the United States?\Should they not give in to a minority of radical jihadists and treat criticisms or satire of Jesus and Mohammed the same?\What will America be like in 30 or 50 years if anti-free-speech fatwas and jihadists continue to spread throughout the West without more forceful condemnation of this strategy from the more moderate majority?\Jim Stattmiller, Minneapolis\- - - \Quick and simple: The imams seem too quiet.

(I wonder how he feels about health care, which now looks free to many). Thus, more carbon taxes are needed in order to prevent overuse and, besides, even the middle- and low-income consumers would be no worse off with such a tax than they were before the price of carbon fell. How wonderful is that?\While arguing that his vision is not one of ""government planning,"" Summers speculates how nice it would be to have the projected ""trillion"" dollars of revenue such a tax would provide over a 10-year period. He envisions that this money could be put to good use in pro-work tax credits and similar government largesse. How super.\Such theories are the musings of an awakened progressive former Harvard president -- a man who, along the way, made millions heading a hedge fund, supported the repeal of key provisions of Glass-Steagall and once argued against the Kyoto protocol.\As suggested, it is a tangled and amusing piece by, as it turns out, an equally tangled and amusing man.\Paul Bearmon, Edina\- - - \I support the proposal for a tax on fossil fuels because it would reduce CO2 emissions that harm our natural world. But what would the people of Minnesota gain?\First, a carbon fee would hasten the closure of coal plants in the Midwest region, reducing pollutants such as mercury, soot and arsenic that contribute to asthma and health disease.\Second, it would promote good jobs by driving business innovation. The authors of a Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development study wrote: ""The concentration of green vacancies in the manufacturing sector -- where Minnesota already has a competitive advantage in terms of employment concentration, firm concentration, and locally available workforce -- suggests that the\greening of the economy could contribute to strengthening the state's manufacturing base."" A border tariff on imported goods from countries without a carbon tax would protect our local industries.\Third, making the carbon fee ""tax neutral"" and returning all revenue to U.S. households would shield Minnesota residents from rising prices for fuel and manufactured goods as we transition to a renewable-energy economy.\A revenue-neutral carbon tax: good for the environment, and good for Minnesota residents.\Claudia Egelhoff, Minneapolis\THE ECONOMY\It works, one might say, despite the GOP\A Jan. 5 letter writer suggested that Republican policies are better for business and therefore the economy than are Democratic ones, but that Democrats get rave reviews for the slightest improvement on the economic front and that Republicans are ignored. The actual facts, beginning with Herbert Hoover's presidency, are these:\- Personal income has grown six times more under Democratic presidents.\- GDP has grown seven times more under Democrats.\- Corporate profits have grown 16 percent more per year under Democratic administrations (and the most under President Obama) and declined under Republicans by an average 4.5 percent a year.\- Average annual compound return on the stock market has been 18 times greater under Democratic presidents.\- Republican presidents added 2.5 times more to the national debt than did Democrats.\- The Great Depression and Great Recession occurred during Republican administrations pursuing austerity programs.\- Obama has outpaced President Ronald Reagan on several economic metrics: the unemployment rate, the national deficit and government cost-cutting.\Obviously, Democrats actually have something to crow about. That's not to say that Democratic presidents are better in every way than Republican ones, but the facts above should give one pause about believing that the unfettered capitalism advocated by Republicans will be our country's salvation. So far, small government and limited regulation of business and financial austerity have, by any reasonable measure, bombed.\Kathryne Sanders, Maplewood"
82,"CLIMATE CHANGE |\By now you should know what Exxon knew and when it knew it. Based on reporting by the Los Angeles Times, Inside Climate News, and the Energy and Environment Reporting Project at Columbia University, it's clear that Exxon's own scientists had confirmed by the late 1980s the serious problem of global warming caused by carbon emissions, but the company in public chose to ""emphasize the uncertainty."" Even the Dallas Morning News, Exxon's hometown newspaper, reported thoroughly on the scandal this week.\As a member of the Star Tribune Editorial Board during the 1990s, I received reports from the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) and the World Climate Report, edited by Patrick Michaels, then the state climatologist of Virginia, now at the Cato Institute. Filled with information, charts and graphs that debunked or questioned other scientists' work, the reports pointed out contrary ""evidence"" and mocked the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 by the United Nations to develop the best science to help governments and the public respond.\I read those critical documents seriously, as my job was to render what the science was saying into fact-based recommendations for readers to evaluate.\I was horrified, therefore, to discover soon enough that the GCC and the World Climate Report were not legitimate scientific bodies, but Potemkin villages of partisans funded by the fossil-fuel industry and, at the time, the auto industry, to market misleading information in order to slow public understanding that fossil-fuel emissions cause climate change. Exxon was a charter member of the GCC and among the corporations that supported it the longest. (The GCC collapsed in 2002.)\Some are calling for a criminal investigation of Exxon. I doubt that lying to the public is a crime, though Exxon may have had a legal obligation to shareholders to report on risks to its business model.\But defending one's business against threats is what businesses generally do. We expect that. What we do not expect, nor should we condone, is public propaganda. And that is what this was -- a Goebbels-style campaign of public deception, one that proved shockingly effective at stalling significant climate action until, as is widely expected, global climate accords are signed in Paris this December, 25 years later.\What should Exxon have done? Pointed out that fossil fuels are a global market, with Saudi Arabia's hand on the spigot, and that constraining carbon emissions requires a global solution. That would have meant supporting the deliberations and conclusions of the IPCC and endorsing carbon cap and trade, or carbon fee and dividend, with border tariff adjustments to avoid exporting carbon pollution, instead of undermining those policies in public and behind the political curtain.\The good news, and it is good, is that current CEO Rex Tillerson has publicly endorsed a carbon tax, or fee, saying in 2009 that ""a carbon tax is also the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions -- from investments made by companies to fuel their requirements to the product choices made by consumers.""\He is right. Now the public has a right to expect that, in private as well as in public, Exxon will support the politics as well as the policies to bring about such a tax or fee, to efficiently bend the curve of carbon pollution away from climate calamity and turn Exxon toward becoming a global energy, not just a fossil energy, company.\James P.

83,"Second of two parts\So how did ""the environment"" do in this year's elections?\Pretty well would be the prevailing view, in that the winning candidates from President Barack Obama on down were usually much more progressive than the losers on matters of energy and environment. Certainly the shift in control of Minnesota's Legislature to the Democrats can be scored that way - even though, as I wrote yesterday, the new majorities are far from unified on what the state's environmental agenda should be.\The voters, if asked what they want, will say in poll after poll that they value resource conservation, progressive energy systems, pollution controls, public land, cleaner water and cleaner air.\But it's rare to encounter an actual ballot choice between candidates who present a stark contrast on such issues only. Almost always some other subject - unemployment, terrorism, taxes - ranks higher in the public conversation, their campaign strategies, or both.\Division over hydrofracking for natural gas production may be creating exceptions to this pattern in some eastern states; certainly there have been roundup stories this month suggesting that's so. But the rule of thumb still seems to be that it's easier to lose an election as an environmental champion than to win one.\Every election cycle brings a flurry of self-congratulory PR from green groups who claim with scant evidence to have elected or defeated particular candidates, usually on unpersuasive evidence.\But for the most part, when Americans want to register their environmental views in a polling booth, it's going to be on a ballot initiative rather than a candidacy, and this year's cycle brought a handful of these as well -- interesting, varied and often hard to find in a flood of other results.\What do the voters want? The sampling that follows shows they want more public land, some limits on hydrofracking, responsible resource management - and maybe faster progress on renewable power, too, if it doesn't further burden a struggling state economy.\Michigan rejects more renewables\There's no getting around it: Renewable energy development took a hit, and not a trivial one, when voters lined up 62 percent against a constitutional amendment that would have raised Michigan's renewables standard to 25 percent by 2025.\That may not sound like an ambitious goal to Minnesotans who know that our utilities are required to be at 27.5 percent renewables by 2025 (averaging the 30 percent requirement for Xcel Energy with the 25 percent bar for others). But in Michigan it has been but a short four years since the Legislature adopted a 10-percent-by-2015 standard.\An interesting analysis in Midwest Energy News endorses a view advanced by the amendment's supporters: that many voters were willing to support the new standard but didn't want to see it written into the constitution. Some poll data supports it, too.\But another factor is the immense spending on anti-amendment advertising, which ramped up sharply in late October and early November. The amendment also drew editorial scorn from the Detroit News, which joined with Dow Chemical and other big employers in trashing the measure as a job-killer.\I'm sure the arguments for constitutional purity resounded with lots of civics-minded voters in Michigan. But even if I hadn't spent some time in Michigan this year, noting signs of economic stress and joblesness everywhere, I'd be inclined to read this as a case of the clean-energy side getting outspent and perhaps outsmarted in a well-timed, negative advertising blitz.\Colorado city curbs fracking\You couldn't ask for a clearer, up-or-down vote than the hydrofracking referendum in Longmont, Colo., where voters amended their city charter to place a moratorium on drilling and related activity by oil and gas companies within the city limits. The margin of victory was an ample 17 points - 58 percent for the ban, 41 percent against.\Longmont can be understood only partly as a suburb of ecotopian Boulder; it's also part of the Front Range zone where oil and gas production are important, and expanding, economic drivers.\Opponents of the measure - including the state's largest newspaper - extolled those benefits, championed the state's regulatory safeguards and predicted that the limits couldn't possibly withstand court review. In Colorado, local governments cannot adopt outright bans on drilling.\But voters rejected those arguments, and also the prediction that their city would be only the hook for huge payments to energy companies whose mineral rights had been ""seized.""\This was another big-spending campaign considering the electorate's small size: Campaigns for and against the amendment reported outlays totaling $920,834 by the end of last month, which by my quick calculation is a bit over $28 for for each of the 32,514 votes cast. And the two sides were almost evenly matched; 55 percent of the money went for efforts to defeat the measure, essentially all of it from industry.\(Down the road in the People's Republic of Boulder - I say that fondly, as a guy who loves the place and sometime wishes he still lived there - the electorate surprised exactly no one by extending both a municipal carbon tax and a sales tax supporting parks and open space, by 4-to-1 margins on each.)\Alabama extends public-land purchases\By another lopsided margin, about 3 to 1, Alabama voters approved Amendment 1 to extend by 20 years the state's Forever Wild Land Trust. The trust buys land for state parks, trails and wildlife management areas, spending in the neighborhood of $50 million a year in natural gas royalties, matching federal grants and revenue from special ""Go Wild"" license plates.\Alabama is not a big public-lands state. Indeed, it has the smallest percentage of state-owned conservation land of any in the Southeast. Nevertheless, it keeps renewing a fund that since 1992 has expanded those holdings by more than a quarter-million acres.\Arizona rejects ... um, something\For sheer weirdness I include Arizona's vote on Proposition 120, a ""Declaration of State Sovereignty Amendment"" to the state constitution that went down by a margin of 2-to-1.\Had it passed, according to a neutral account at Ballotpedia, it would have claimed state sovereignty - as a counter to federal authority - over such natural resources as land, air, water, minerals and wildlife. A leading proponent in the legislature called it ""10th Amendment, state's rights initiative""; opponents said it was an effort to undermine federal environmental protections.\And the Arizona Republic, hardly the most liberal of voices on environment, had this to say:\""This ridiculous measure declares state sovereignty over all federal land in Arizona. A state that can't afford to manage its own parks system is going to take on running the Grand Canyon and other iconic national parks, forests, wilderness areas, monuments and preserves. Really?""\As it happened, not so much.\Credit: Ron Meador"
84," Not everyone will be living in new houses come 2037. So what about your house, the neighbor's house and all the existing buildings in Minnesota? They won't operate the way they do today, say architects and scientists.\ The average Minnesota house emits 15 tons of carbon dioxide yearly, according to Center of Energy and the Environment (CEE), a nonprofit organization dealing in environmental issues. That number needs to drop dramatically to slow global warming and climate change, experts say. The goal is zero emissions by 2030.\ But homes and buildings won't be razed and rebuilt to accomplish this; they will be improved and remodeled. Indeed, three-fourths of the built environment will be new or renovated by 2035, according to architect Edward Mazria. He's founder of Architecture 2030, a phased- in plan for achieving carbon-neutral buildings by 2030. (See www.architecture2030.org.) Changing our buildings can make a huge difference. They account for nearly half of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions yearly, Mazria said.\ In addition, homes will need to be fortified to reduce the chance of storm-related damage. For both jobs, homeowners will need incentives. They'll come in the form of rising energy and insurance costs, tax breaks or even a carbon tax, experts predict.\ To step toward the future, take the Minnesota Energy Challenge to calculate your emissions and learn steps to reduce them (www.mn energychallenge.org).

Since that day, we have seen an ever-increasing rise in incidents of gun violence at schools and mass shootings in this nation. As we reflect this holiday season, let us honor all victims of gun violence by turning tragedy into transformation. There are many seemingly simple -- yet incredibly powerful -- things we can do today to prevent gun violence, including advocating for sensible gun-safety laws and access to programs in our schools and communities that help us identify the signs and signals before a shooting might happen and intervene to get help for at-risk individuals.\More and more people are uniting to bring the change we need. The phones in Congress are ringing off the hook with calls for ""common-sense"" gun reform, peaceful rallies are growing in cities across the country, and families and friends are gathering together in their own living rooms to talk about bringing violence-prevention programs to their schools. The movement is growing, and we must keep the momentum.\To keep this hope alive and bring the change we need, I am asking everyone to take three simple actions today. First, call your member of Congress and ask that he or she support gun- violence-prevention legislation to keep guns out of dangerous hands. Second, ""Know the Signs"" to prevent gun violence at sandyhookpromise.org. And third, ""Make the Promise"" at www.sandyhookpromise.org/promise and truly honor victims by turning tragedy into transformation.\Mary Cook, Andover\CLIMATE CHANGE\Americans do care. They decisively support a carbon tax and dividend.\Contrary to claims in the Dec. 12 commentary ""The (political) science behind climate change,"" the public does support effective solutions to the climate change crisis.\In March 2018, the Yale University Program on Climate Change Communication survey showed that 68 percent of Americans favored a revenue-neutral plan to ""require fossil fuel companies to pay a carbon tax,"" with only 29 percent opposed. That matches a 2014 poll from Stanford, the New York Times, and Resources for the Future that found that requiring companies to pay a greenhouse-gas tax and then giving ""all this tax money … to all Americans equally"" was favored by 67 percent to only 31 percent opposed.\While the specific poll language and methods differ, these reports show that the public approves of a policy that imposes a price on greenhouse-gas emissions and then returns all of the money to American households.\Fortunately, there is now a bill in Congress (the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act) that does just that. This bipartisan bill (HR 7173) will drive down carbon pollution and bring climate change under control while benefiting people and the economy. Just what the public wants.\Claudia Egelhoff, West St. Paul\• • •\It's not possible to ponder every hunk of data that floods by each day.\But here are a couple bits of information that deserve a little contemplation from recent Star Tribune articles.\• From a Dec. 12 article on EPA plans to roll back the Clean Water Act:\""Farm groups also worry that strict clean water regulations will limit their ability to use pesticides and fertilizer that could drain into creeks and swamps.""\• From a Dec. 11 article on the Trump team pushing fossil fuels at the climate summit in Poland:\President Donald Trump's energy and climate adviser said, ""We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice their economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability.""\Mull over those for a minute.\Greg Larson, Excelsior\• • •\It amazes me that climate-change deniers think that the economy is not at all connected to the environment. Former U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson, father of Earth Day, had said: ""The economy is a wholly dependent subsidiary of the environment."" As we are seeing from the reports out of Poland where current climate-change talks are being held, most of the countries realize this truth, while the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia reject the truth.

Math with me.\Dec. 21 is the deadline to fund the federal government or it will be ""shut down."" Of course, a government as large as ours cannot truly shut down completely, and despite attempts to gin-up fear about a ""shutdown,"" essential services will continue and benefit checks will continue to be sent, because statutory safeguards were put into place decades ago to continue such services.\At issue is that President Donald Trump is asking for $5 billion in funding for ""border security"" to build a wall on our border with Mexico to help prevent illegal immigration. I lived in Los Angeles for 17 years and saw firsthand the negative effects of illegal immigration and how a sanctuary city operated to the detriment of legal taxpaying citizens.\Democratic leaders have said that a wall would be ""immoral, ineffective and too expensive."" The purpose of this letter is to focus on the issue of the wall being ""too expensive.""\For most people, $1 million seems like a ridiculous amount of money, so when you see a $5 billion price tag, that must be outrageous, right? For 2018, the federal government has a budget of approximately $4.1 trillion dollars. Here is the math on ""too expensive"" in a few intuitive steps: (1) $5 billion is 5 percent of $100 billion; (2) there are 10 $100 billions in $1 trillion, so $5 billion is 0.5 percent of $1 trillion; and (3) with a budget of $4.1 trillion, that means $5 billion is 0.0012 percent of the total budget. Putting this math into monetary terms to which all of us can relate, compared with $100, what is being opposed is 12 pennies, which is the monetary equivalent of 0.0012 percent of $100. Opposition to the president's request based on a ""too expensive"" standard is outrageous and ridiculous.\Carter J. Erickson, Nevis, Minn."
86,"What is a moderate position on the climate crisis?\At CNN’s seven-hour Wednesday night climate crisis town hall, Democratic candidates had a chance to explain how exactly they would deal with changing temperatures, increasingly devastating environmental disasters and energy production priorities.\Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s position throughout the town hall was that we need to “do what the science tells us.” To do that, she proposed that she would prioritize achieving 100% net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and said that we need to limit warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.\But like much of the rest of her campaign, when it comes to the climate crisis, Klobuchar seemed aimed to stake out the middle ground: on fracking, on coal and on the cost of her plan.\\\Prior to the town hall, Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he would commit to a ban on fracking, the process of injecting liquid underground at high pressure to extract natural gas. Earlier that night during her town hall, Sen. Kamala Harris said the same: “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.”\Klobuchar was more hesitant after the moderator asked her stance. “I see natural gas as a transitional fuel. It is better than oil, but it’s not nearly as good as wind and solar,” she said.\Klobuchar said she would approve fracking permits on a case-by-case basis. And she has suggested the same approach to permitting in Minnesota for other projects that have environmental advocates worried about negative impacts.\In Minnesota, she’s walking a careful line, not taking a stance on two copper-nickel mining projects in northern Minnesota and not taking a stance on the Line 3 Pipeline, which some tribes have said could harm their access to rice farming and water.\On how to phase out coal, and the question of “if” nuclear should be phased out, Klobuchar also took a careful stance.\“What defines safe nuclear power and clean coal? Don’t they sound like oxymorons?” Liza Cohen, a student at Fordham University, asked Klobuchar.\Klobuchar said that she is in favor of maintaining nuclear, as it accounts for 20 percent of U.S. energy production, but that she would not expand it unless it could be done more safely. Similarly, she said she would not allow for the building of new coal plants, but if elected, would try to make the currently active plants better for the environment.\ How will you pay for it? \In the backdrop of Klobuchar’s climate plan, and everyone else’s, was the question of money: How do you pay for it? Klobuchar says hers would cost around between the “two trillion to three trillion range.”\“I only know how I’m going to get the funding, and I think you’ve got to be honest with people about how you’re going to get the money and what you’re going to spend it on, or it’s going to be really hard to bring along those people that we need to win in the middle of the country,” she said, implying that other climate plans, proposed by candidates like Sen. Sanders, are unrealistic.\Klobuchar said she’d pay for her plan by increasing the corporate tax rate and repealing parts of the Republican’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and with a carbon tax, which she described “cap-and-trade.” Both policies are different in that with a carbon tax, companies are charged for each ton of carbon they produce, and with cap-and-trade, companies are limited yearly in the amount of emissions they produce. Her climate plan does not specify which she would pursue.\“I want to be honest of what I think we can bring in,” she said.\Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the total cost of Klobuchar’s climate plan. She estimates it at $2-3 trillion."
87,"Minnesota imports most of the oil and natural gas that helps drive our economic engine from Canada, the Saudi Arabia of the north.\""And you don't need a U.S. battle group to protect it,"" Ronald Liepert, the Alberta oil minister, reminded me last week on a visit to Minneapolis.\Canada, largely because of Alberta's vast deposits of oil sands, has the second-largest known oil reserves in the world.\Our No. 1 trading partner to the north, which also is a healthy democracy and buys $4 billion-plus worth of Minnesota goods annually, provides about a 25 percent of the more than 12 million barrels per day of imported oil that Americans consume.\Canada, through its western oil sands, is increasing daily production from 2 million to 3 million barrels over the next several years. Although it doesn't bear the higher risks of deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, tar sands production still presents significant environmental concerns.\That's why Liepert and Alberta's top diplomat in Washington, Gary Mar, are part of a Canadian offensive to address concerns in America about those ""dirty tar sands"" that critics say are an environmental disaster. The thick bitumen must be heated with steam from natural-gas fired boilers in order to strain the thick oil and send it by pipeline to our Pine Bend or other U.S. refineries.\This is also a huge issue for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whom one Canadian opinion writer recently said ""seems hell-bent in exploiting our natural resources for economic gain, regardless of the environmental consequences.""\These arguments frame critical pipeline discussions now underway between Canada and the United States amid the continuing discussion over cutting our carbon emissions and making progress on gradually reducing our oil use.\The Canadians make a solid case for their oil exports, producing statistics that demonstrate the ""life-cycle"" emissions from Alberta crude are less than emissions from Middle Eastern or Nigerian crude. The reasons? The tar-sands extraction process is getting more efficient. And shipping the oil through a pipeline is a lot less polluting than hauling it aboard diesel-powered super tankers from the other side of the world.\Moreover, Canada is committed to cutting carbon emissions by nearly 20 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels. And they detailed the extensive efforts to return the sands to their original state after mining, and to curb water usage and pollution.\Alberta already has a carbon tax of $15 per ton that funds environmental remediation. And the oil sands harvesting area, home to an estimated 170 billion barrels of proven reserves, is about half the size of Hennepin County in a province about the size of Texas.\Environmentalists argue that Canada is spoiling its land and our environment and that we should move more quickly to oil alternatives.\The experts at the Minneapolis-based Great Plains Institute try to find common ground among stakeholders in accelerating to a cleaner, more secure energy future.\Brendan Jordan, a scientist who heads the institute's bio-energy and transportation section, said Canadian tar sands are more polluting that conventional oil extraction.\""It feels in a way that we're devoting a lot of time to which oil is best,"" said Rolf Nordstrom, the institute's executive director. ""It's like deciding whether smoking or drinking is better for you, when less of both is what you really need.""\Great Plains is pushing for next-generation fuel sources, beyond corn ethanol, and also championing efforts to use waste carbon from U.S. coal-fired power plants to be pumped into partially depleted underground oil fields around this country.\""Enhanced oil recovery can increase our U.S. proven reserves by three to five times,"" Nordstrom said. ""And this leaves the polluting carbon dioxide buried in the ground"" instead of out the smokestack to pollute.\It's going to take time as we transition to more efficient vehicles, cleaner fuels, electric- and natural gas-powered transport and other measures that will result in a cleaner, more powerful, job-producing American economy that doesn't spend $400 billion annually for imported oil.\In the meantime, we also are going to need that Canadian crude. The Canadians have already committed to a carbon cap; Alberta has a carbon tax to fund environmental remediation. A cap or a tax on carbon pollution in the United States would spur us to cut emissions, not just for environmental but also for economic and efficiency reasons.\Unless you like being held hostage to foreign oil producers, that's the conservative and smart way to go.\Neal St. Anthony - 612-673-7144 - nstanthony@startribune.com\Credit: NEAL ST.

88,"TARGET\Target's new ""centers of excellence"" will be a great opportunity to create new synergies, intent thinking outside the box, maximize input and take Target to the next level; Target 2.0 (""Target starts tearing down walls,"" March 12). ""Centers of excellence"" team players will no longer just spitball ideas or throw concepts up against the wall to see what sticks. No, before recommendations are run up the flagpole to see who salutes, the company will have to de-silo and integrate across a complex, matrixed decisionmaking environment that taps the hidden potential of individual contributors and focused teams. Looking at the project from the 30,000-foot level, this reorganization will be a game-changer, a win-win that will enable Young Turk rock stars, under the guidance of their gurus, to push the envelope right to the bleeding edge of retail sustainability. At the end of the day, this new paradigm will be a value-add. And as long as team members give 110 percent, Target can pluck the low-hanging fruit and futureproof its deliverables. Hey, it ain't rocket science or brain surgery.\Those who do not learn the absurdity of buzzwords are doomed to reuse them.\Jack Sheehan, Eden Prairie\LEBANON HILLS\So, an overwhelming majority is nothing to public policy?\So members of the Dakota County board have approved a paved trail in the beautiful Lebanon Hills Regional Park despite the fact that 97 percent of the people who submitted comments about the plan were opposed to it. It sounds as if the board members took the fact that only 690 people responded as silent approval of their intentions. No! The people who didn't respond are not park users or are not passionate about the park. Why not listen to those that really care?\This flawed decision only throws additional fuel on the fire for the similar proposal in Bloomington to pave the river bottoms, a similar wild area, despite thousands of protests from hikers, birders and mountain bikers. What's next -- will we be paving the Superior Hiking Trail and some of the portages in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness? One of the Lebanon Hills Park users said it best in the article: ""We have so few open spaces. We don't need more asphalt."" Let's hope board members reconsider their decision.\Dave Mott, Minneapolis\ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS\Many are responsible; the military has also been helpful\Duane Cady (Opinion Exchange, March 10) points out that war is bad for the environment, and that is demonstrably true. But the same charge could be levied against every major economic sector, whether it's agriculture, health care, transportation, the built environment, coal-burning power plants, manufacturing and you name it. In fact, the military has been at the forefront of warning us of the dangers of climate change to international stability and leading the way in adopting clean technology right on the battlefront.\Rather than beat up on any one sector, we have to concentrate on stopping the use of fossil fuels, and the best way to do that is with a carbon tax that will drive adoption of clean tech and create millions of jobs to boot.\Jeanne Johnson, Alexandria, Minn.\POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY\Legislative power grab would corrupt the process\The attempt by the certain elements of the Legislature to exercise rule-making review, taking it away from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, is a bare-knuckled effort to unfairly favor certain industries, businesses or local water plants (""Dayton, safety rules get blasted,"" March 11). The MPCA uses science-based standards to create one set of rules for everyone similarly situated. The new bill opens the door to influence-peddling and vote-buying. It is quite cynical and must be defeated.\Robert Lyman, Minneapolis\TEACHERS\'Last in, first out' looks shoddy from student's perspective\Minnesota has some of the best educational facilities in the nation; however, the rules regarding teacher layoffs have always been mediocre. The number of years a teacher works in a certain district in no way correlates with their ability to be successful. Seniority does not control how the students respond to a teacher or how engaged they are during the lesson; the abilities of the teacher do.\I have seen a fair share of teachers get laid off, and I recall a teacher of mine whose layoff came as a shock to the student body. She was the last one hired in the science department, thus she was the first one laid off. We were appalled that it did not matter that she was one of our favorite teachers, or that she was a fantastic teacher.\I understand that sometimes layoffs need to occur due to budget cuts, but it is time that we start laying off teachers because of quality of performance and not the quantity of years they have worked in the district.\Stephanie Skonieczny, Eden Prairie\- - - \Judging from the March 8 editorial ""Change LIFO law to benefit students,"" you'd think that elected politicians are experts on education, but they're not. Laws that benefit students and affect teachers should be made at the local level by school administrators and school boards. Period.\The recent proposal by conservative Republicans to reform teacher tenure laws is popular because it doesn't cost any money. But it is nothing more than a green light for school administrators to fire teachers who are more highly paid because of years of experience and knowledge, while replacing them with younger, inexperienced teachers with a pay so low that they'll leave education within five years. The House of Representatives ought to address more universal problems and leave the management of education issues to knowledgeable and experienced educators and professionals at the local level.\Scott Werdahl, Chaska\VETERANS EAGER TO FIGHT\That mercenary impulse can be turned in our favor\I read with interest the article ""U.S. veterans volunteer to help repel ISIL"" (March 12). Those brave Americans are following the tradition of Crockett at the Alamo, Hemingway in the Spanish Civil War, and Clair Chennault in pre-World War II China with his Flying Tigers. I think there is a connection with this willingness of former soldiers to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and the fact that our country's recent military forces in Mideast civil wars were composed of maybe 50 percent private contractors -- paid by us. Let's have our oil-rich Mideast friends hire our mercenary contractors directly to fight their wars, so we can apply our tax dollars to domestic problems. Republicans and Democrats should be able to get behind that idea.\David Craig Smith, Minneapolis\MEAT RAFFLES\Careful, article writers, with your use of the royal 'we'\So ""we"" love meat and ""we"" love gambling (""Wiener takes all,"" Variety, March 12).

89,"How did the environment fare in Tuesday’s voting?\If you ask Gene Karpinksi, who heads the League of Conservation Voters, the good-news return on his group’s $80 million midterms investment includes “new leadership and a pro-environment majority in the House” and maintaining “the green firewall in the Senate.” Also:\As we’ve said, if we’re going to make progress in the short term, it’s going to come from the states. And we have many, many new governors and statehouses that are committed to fighting for clean energy and action on climate.\If you ask me, though — well, I wish I could share Karpinksi’s optimism, and maybe whatever he’s vaping.\I’ve no gift for assessing what the changes in the House and the statehouses are likely to deliver. Instead, as I’ve done over the years of increasing Washington gridlock, I thought I’d take a look at ballot initiatives for evidence of policy advances and public opinion shifts on matters of resource protection, pollution control, cleaner energy and such.\This year, people, the results are pretty bleak, perhaps especially so, and even in places where progressive thinking usually holds unusual sway.\Washington state, for example, made a third run at its first-in-the-nation carbon tax, which was also on the ballot in 2016 and 2017. This year proponents decided to call it an emissions “fee,” made other adjustments to increase its appeal, and managed to run their record to 0 for 3.\Tuesday’s defeat wasn’t even close, 56.3 percent to 43.7 at this writing (the margin may shift a bit when the last vote-by-mail ballots are tallied). Led by BP America, the anti-fee coalition of business and industrial interests spent twice as much as supporting groups. Combined outlays exceeded $45 million and also, according to Benjamin Storrow of E&E News, the tabs for all but three of the U.S. Senate races this cycle.\(Unless otherwise attributed, these and the other vote/spending figures herein are from Ballotpedia; I’ve rounded them to a single decimal place.)\On a brighter note, Floridians voted by a wide margin (68.7 percent to 31.3) to ban offshore oil and gas drilling from state waters, approving a constitutional amendment that also banned vaping in most indoor workplaces.\This odd pairing is a consequence of the Sunshine State’s singular approach to constitutional change: Measures get to the ballot only by approval of an appointed commission (which is almost entirely Republican, for what that’s worth), which groups them as it pleases in deliberations that take place once every 20 years.\Amendment 9 drew fire from the Florida Petroleum Council as well as the state Chamber of Commerce, Libertarian Party and a group that promotes “smoke-free alternatives.” But their efforts couldn’t compete with support generated by a wide range of conservation, tourism, public health and clean energy groups, as well as the League of Women Voters (which prefers an uncluttered Constitution but felt protecting coastal waters belonged in the document, while vaping did not).\Elsewhere around the country, though, energy companies and other industrial interests had little difficulty beating back a variety of green initiatives.\ Mining on the ballot \Addressing a question of considerable interest to Minnesotans, Montana voters rejected a measure to deny permits for hardrock mines that lack features “sufficient to prevent the pollution of water without the need for perpetual treatment.”\Recent polling had shown supporters comfortably outnumbering opponents, but also a high percentage of undecided voters — all to be expected, perhaps, given The Treasure State’s long and double-edged tradition of mining as both economic driver and source of permanently poisoned water resources. In the end, the measure went down by 57.2 percent to 42.8.\The disparity in financing for this contest was even sharper: The measure’s supporters put up $1.3 million, with Trout Unlimited the largest donor; the Montana Mining Association had the leadership role on the other side, providing the entire $5.2 million spent to ensure that mining’s long-term costs remain a public burden.\Mining interests in Alaska, meanwhile, helped to beat back a protective measure for salmon streams by a nearly 2-1 margin.\The Stand for Salmon initiative was launched by conservation groups and small commercial fishing operations, partly in response to the Trump administration’s turnabout on the Pebble Mine at Bristol Bay. It sought to tighten requirements for permits and impact analysis for mines, oil and gas drilling, and other major construction in riparian zones that could threaten spawning habitat for salmon, trout and other anadromous fish.\Opposition came from a variety of industrial interests; the largest single funder was Conoco Phillips, which put up $1.4 million of the $12.1 million in cash and in-kind services gathered by the Stand for Alaska opposition. (Stand for Salmon had about $2 million in the fight.)\Thanks to Tom Steyer’s NextGen America, which financed nearly all of the proponents’ $23.7 million effort, an Arizona renewable energy measure became the most expensive battle over a ballot initiative in state history. And, as usual, an industry-funded opposition campaign spent even more — some $31.2 million, mostly from utilities.\Proposition 127 would have committed Arizona to getting half its juice from renewables by midcentury (the current goal is 15 percent by 2025). It failed by 69.6 percent to 30.4, with Steyer attributing the loss in part to a rewrite of the ballot language by the state’s attorney general in an effort to make it unattractive to voters.\ A win in Nevada, maybe \A similar NextGen effort paid off, however, in Nevada, where voters approved the same renewables standard and timetable with a slightly different mix of qualified sources, and at a more modest pace (the current program aims at 25 percent by 2025). NextGen put up nearly all of the $10.4 million spent to promote Question 6; the opposition was organized as a nonprofit and didn’t have to report financials. The winning margin: 58.8 percent to 41.2.\However, under Nevada’s system, the same measure will have to succeed with voters in 2020 to take effect, and that’s not necessarily a slam-dunk. Two years ago, the state voted to replace the current monopoly on electric power held by NV Energy with a competitive retail market; this year, the vote went the other way, 67.6 percent to 32.4 in a fight between business interests, whose combined outlays approached $100 million.\In Colorado, the oil and gas sector spent $30.3 million — more than 15 times as much as the other side — to defeat Proposition 112, which would have required a minimum distance of 2,500 feet between new drilling and homes, schools, hospitals and other occupied buildings deemed “vulnerable” to harm from the activity. The same buffer would have been required around “playgrounds, permanent sports fields, amphitheaters, public parks, public open space, public and community drinking water sources, irrigation canals, reservoirs, lakes, rivers, perennial or intermittent streams, and creeks, and any additional vulnerable areas designated by the state or a local government.”\With some mail-in ballots remaining to be counted, the vote stood at 56.8 percent against and 43.2 percent in favor.\Californians rejected a nearly $9 billion bond measure to finance groundwater protection and improvement through a range of infrastructure programs — dam repair, watershed protection and restoration, drinking-water treatment — with about half the amount either set aside or prioritized for disadvantaged communities. Opponents prevailed, 52.4 percent to 47.6; supporters spent $4.9 million to promote Proposition 3, with hunting and conservation groups in the lead (no opposition group put its name or spending on the record).\By a slightly larger margin, California did approve $4 billion in bonding for parks, environmental restoration, water infrastructure and flood protection via Proposition 68, with The Nature Conservancy and Trust for Public Land among the key sponsors.\Georgia also voted, 82.6 percent to 17.4, to put more money into parks and such, amending its constitution to allow earmarking of up to 80 percent of the sales tax collected on “outdoor sporting goods” to be dedicated to land conservation.\Specifically, it would pay for park and trail projects, land purchases for resource protection and recreation (including hunting and fishing), and “stewardship of conservation land.” It will be up to the legislature to decide how much to actually spend for those purposes; calculations in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution suggest the maximum would be $20 million a year for 10 years.\*** One lesson here, I guess, is that even in bad years for green ballot initiatives it’s not hard to get people to vote for more parks, so long as the cost isn’t too high. Surely a good thing — but a new direction for America?"
90,"THE LEGISLATURE\State thrived under GOP policies? Hardly.\It is difficult to believe that state Sen. David Hann and state Rep. Kurt Daudt could produce their Jan. 16 commentary ""With fiscal discipline, state thrives"" with a straight face.\Two years ago, their party shut down state government (actually wasting tens of millions), then relied on additional borrowing from schools and tobacco money, along with other gimmickry, to balance the budget. The party actually raised property taxes by a convoluted formula that, last fall, even its candidates had great difficulty grasping.\Where did the GOP take its stand? In refusing to raise taxes on Minnesota filers with annual taxable income over $1 million.\These honorable public servants need to get out more and see what has happened to tuition since former Gov. Tim Pawlenty's inauguration, along with the abysmal condition of much of our state and municipal infrastructure and the overlooked needs of the public schools.\Minnesota needs to spend and, if necessary, raise taxes in a progressive manner.\MARTIN DEMGEN, MINNEAPOLIS\The environment\Advocates must bring Republicans on board\James Lenfestey is right (""The environment cries for Obama's leadership,"" Jan. 14), but that's just part of the solution. Theda Skocpol, a Harvard scholar, just released a report for an upcoming symposium ""The Politics of America's Fight Against Global Warming."" Her paper, ""Naming the Problem,"" blames environmental groups for legislative inaction on climate change because they have not found the arguments to persuade Republicans and members of the Tea Party movement to act. She suggests that without the support of conservatives, the chance of getting carbon solutions through Congress will be doomed.\A bit harsh, but I think she's right. Can we get unstuck? To do that, we need to name the problem and have a national conversation. It will take concerned citizens from each of their congressional districts to get the ball rolling by writing to their delegates. They can start discussions on the likes of a carbon tax or fee and dividend legislation. The representatives will listen. Minnesota can lead the way and get its Republican delegation on board.\K. BRIAN NOWAK, MAPLE PLAIN\amendments\Require supermajority of voters as well\It was with great pleasure that I read the Jan. 16 editorial on the effort to make the state's constitutional-amendment process more reflective of the purpose of the Constitution (""Constitution needs partisanship shield""). I would ask that any new process also require a two-thirds majority of all voters once an amendment has been brought forth.\Constitutional amendments should not be taken lightly, and this additional hurdle will help assure that any changes to the state Constitution will truly reflect the will of most, if not all, Minnesotans.\DAVID ABRAMS, MINNETONKA\Lance Armstrong\Performance-enhancing\drugs: Rules are rules\The Jan. 16 Letter of the Day (""Put performance-enhancing drugs in historical perspective"") neglected one important point -- the rules.\Lifting weights or specializing in one sport to increase performance is perfectly legal. Taking a legal stimulant to extend studying time is also legal. But using illegal drugs in violation of a sport's rules and laws is breaking those rules. There is a difference.\ROBERT OWEN, BLOOMINGTON\Michele Bachmann\She continues to\neglect her district\Michele Bachmann, the congresswoman from my district, has introduced a bill to end the Affordable Care Act, or, as she calls it, ""Obamacare."" She has yet to find a cosponsor for her bill. It seems that our representative once again won't be active or responsive to her constituents in the Sixth District. We are lacking representation because of her Tea Party leadership and support, so it will be another quiet and unresponsive two years for businesses and individuals in the district.\DON KERR, BLAINE\Adoption\Russia's actions may\bring needed scrutiny\While many are distressed by Russia's abrupt termination of international adoptions, a silver lining is that such adoptions are coming under increased scrutiny. For too long, babies have been treated as commodities by adoption agencies, their rights as eventual adults abridged without the consent of impartial, uncoerced advocates, their best interests trumped by entitlement (wealthy/white couples ""deserve"" babies) and cultural bigotry (a child is ""always"" better off growing up in a heterosexual/wealthy/married/religious/American/white home).\Adoption agencies join with churches and desperate childless parents to suppress the rights of adults who were adopted as children, making it easier for agencies to engage in shady practices such as stolen infants. As a result, adult adoptees (like me) and our children face greater risks from inherited disease due to a lack of medical background.\To protect children, governmental oversight and complete transparency must be insisted upon. And adults who were adopted as children ought to have all rights to their backgrounds, for they can't be bound by a third-party contract signed when they were infants.\Russia's abrupt actions are a symptom: The illness is shady dealings in the international adoption trade, such as those following the Haiti earthquake, and French abuses in Chad.\Full disclosure: I am one of the founders of Bastard Nation (www.bastards.org), one of the nation's largest and oldest adoption-rights organizations.\ROBERT ALBERTI, MINNEAPOLIS"
91,"The 1970s are remembered as the dismal decade. Times were tough, all right. The average teenager didn't have a credit card, and a lot of families made do with one car. On the other hand, college was affordable, and people of every age and political stripe celebrated Earth Day on the assumption that fossil fuels were on their way out. We would adapt. It would be tough but not impossible. And besides, wouldn't everyone trade plentiful gas for clean air and a safer world?\Not everyone, it turns out. Americans drank the supply-side Kool-Aid that said we could have it both ways. The pendulum swing from a conservative attitude toward environmental protection to a vastly more liberal one bought the energy and agribusiness cartels the time they needed to mess up the environment permanently. It took just four decades.\Exxon Mobil, the same company that has spent millions debunking global warming, is now denying its own denial. CEO Rex Tillerson calmly informed the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Wednesday that climate change is real. Always has been. Anyone noticed the crazy weather we've been having?\It is not, however, the real peril, he added. Nor is the real threat the normal knee-jerk Republican whipping boys such as government restrictions on deep-water drilling, or a carbon tax to depress sales of petroleum products, or an end to the subsidies for corn and soybean producers and Big Oil. Tillerson explained that because oil is priced globally, even drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge won't lower prices at U.S. pumps -- especially not when you have speculators (whose existence he also admitted for the first time), supervised by the likes of Goldman Sachs, taking a 30 to 40 percent cut from every barrel sold.\Climate change apparently isn't dangerous at all. What's truly reckless and job-killing, Tillerson warned through his wire-rimmed bifocals, is ""bad science.""\He was referring, I think, to the science that he is also now denying he ever denied. Good science sees climate change as ""an engineering problem [that] has an engineering solution."" This solution Tillerson describes as a series of ""adaptations."" What exactly are those? According to an engineer who admits to being skeptical about this strategy and who has a relative employed at one of Exxon Mobil's U.S. plants, the energy giant is conducting ""back-room experiments"" with biodiesel and algae farming and possibly even geo-engineering as part of its ""long-range business plan.""\In other words, we're working on the problem, and we'll let you know when our innovative line of green products is available at your local Exxon Mobil station. Until then, consider yourself clueless and impotent -- oh, and also a pain in the ass if you express the slightest concern about that tree that fell on your house or the ozone in the air you are not supposed to breathe in too deeply lest your lungs suffer respiratory sunburn.\""So I guess you're betting that the geeks will pull a rabbit out of their collective test tubes,"" I said to a guy I ran into at a holiday party who works in the food industry. We'd been chatting about the Tillerson turnaround on climate.\""If government gets out of the way and lets the innovators innovate, we'll come up with something. We always do.""\Actually, we usually don't, Noah and his ark notwithstanding. Human history is rife with tragic episodes illustrating our species' tendency to deny reality and go for the quick fix. ""The Three Little Pigs"" is a cautionary tale about this tendency. Everyone knows which pig got it right by building his house out of bricks instead of sticks or straw.\""Look, Exxon is fueling the world. My employer is feeding it.""\Both industries are also growing markets, which is why they insist the planet could easily handle twice its current population. This business model ignores the inconvenient truth that more mouths to feed means more human suffering caused by climate-related floods and famine, pesticides, contaminated water, wars over scarce resources, and crimes of desperation. This is the bargain inherent in the house-of-straw ideology promulgated by those whose own houses (and this is the richest irony of all) are made of sturdy brick and protected by armed guards.\I think solutions will emerge, not through big corporations or big government but through small-scale, community-based initiatives. Here in Minneapolis, the Center for Energy and Environment partners with Xcel Energy and other companies to help lower energy use. Farmers markets and food co-ops are feeding more and more people healthful food. These efforts are catching on. ""Think global, act local"" used to be just another bumper sticker to me. Now it is religion.\Bonnie Blodgett is a St. Paul writer. She blogs about gardening, politics and life at bonnieblodgett.com.\Credit: BONNIE BLODGETT"
92,"In the 1967 classic ""Cool Hand Luke,"" the Paul Newman character spends most of the movie trying to ""get his mind right."" Elections like last Tuesday's are a little like that.\Those of us who write (and read) about urban-design issues know that the election result, no matter how momentous, didn't change the basic challenges of the day. Our addiction to oil and other carbon fuels still holds the nation's energy and foreign policies hostage. Our atmosphere continues to overheat with potentially dreadful consequences for future generations, no matter what the deniers say. Our inefficient growth patterns and transportation habits cannot be environmentally or fiscally sustained. Our economy cannot deliver the high-value jobs that Americans need so badly. The income gap between rich and poor continues to grow in ways that damage both the society and the economy.\What has changed over the last several days is that a new conservative tide offers a different set of solutions. ""Getting your mind right"" around those solutions is the hard part.\Perhaps it's in the nature of designers to favor technical fixes. President Obama took office in 2009 with a clear mandate, a congressional majority and a menu of technically appealing, Washington-based answers: Burning too much carbon? Tax its consumption and provide incentives for alternate forms of energy and transportation. Got a problem with housing and jobs? Keep the banks solvent, provide mortgage relief, extend unemployment benefits and ramp up job training.\It was a menu that, without a relentless marketing effort, was open to attack, especially as the recovery faltered, the deficit soared, and the administration seemed off on an errand to fix something (health care) that didn't seem directly related to the nation's overwhelming need: jobs. And so, last Tuesday's ""shellacking,"" as Obama put it, was largely self-inflicted. But that's beside the point now. The point now is to try to grasp just how the new conservative agenda proposes to meet the challenges mentioned above.\The Republican manifesto\The centerpiece seems to be deficit reduction, which would be accomplished by slashing government's discretionary spending and reforming entitlements as a way to offset tax cuts for the wealthy and a further relaxation of regulations on business. (Liberals point out that that the Bush administration's formula of low taxes and lax Wall Street regulation got us into the current mess, but that argument has been lost.) The hope, then, is that the wealthy, newly freed from their tax burdens, will begin to invest not just in yachts but in job creation, preferably in the United States. That, in turn, will trigger a series of other events: Main Street will revive; the economy will snap out of its doldrums; the deficit will begin to fall; a chastened government sector will revert to its minimalist purpose (mainly defense), and the private sector will step in to address the great challenges of the day, including those listed above.\It becomes an article of faith, then, that private enterprise will solve the carbon problem with nuclear power and natural gas; that big oil will step aside to celebrate new fleets of electric cars running on privately funded toll roads, and that private enterprise will, on its own, engage in the kind of research and development and education reform required to create high-value jobs; and that the availability of those jobs will inspire the poor to try harder and join a once-again expanding middle class. It's an appealing narrative.\Most of this is set out in the Republican manifesto, ""A Pledge to America,"" which offers inspiring rhetoric about ""ending the attack on free enterprise,"" ""reining in the red tape factory in Washington, D.C.,"" and ""repealing the government takeover of health care."" It sketches the outlines of a far slimmer federal government, one that, if you add specific suggestions from Rep. Paul Ryan for trimming Social Security and Medicare benefits for future recipients, begins to ""restore sanity"" to the nation's capital. Cutting military spending is not contemplated because ""we will never apologize for advancing the cause of freedom and democracy around the world.""\More ideology in a pragmatic world?\What strikes me most about this manifesto, or perhaps any manifesto from the right or left, is that it is highly ideological in what is quickly becoming a post-ideological world; that it is profoundly idealistic in a world moving rapidly toward pragmatism. The right, especially, seems nostalgic for an America that no longer exists -- although it may be correct in its critique of centralized power. There may no longer be, for example, a national economy in the way we once thought about it, but rather a series of metro economies that compete with similar metro economies across the nation and world.\Those highly diverse metro economies rise and fall depending upon how well they compete. The analogy is that of an ecosystem or, perhaps, the Internet. Everything is connected to everything else. In that sense, the local environment is important not just because it's nice to have clean water and big trees but because it offers an attractive platform for investment, wealth creation and broader prosperity. If there's a problem standing in the way -- say, a rigid federal system or a hopelessly nostalgic mindset -- you find ways to move around it.\There are no universally correct formulas. A metro region's strength may be drawn from both left and right -- a greater sense of entrepreneurship, for example, coupled with targeted pubic investments to maximize strengths and shore up weaknesses.\This column has spent time recently with Thomas Fisher, dean of the University of Minnesota's College of Design, and Bruce Katz, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, as well as with new books from Joel Kotkin and Richard Florida about the future of cities.\Recovering to what?\A common theme has been how, after a brutal recession, to retool metro economies to meet the challenges surrounding energy, environment, prosperity and equity listed in this piece's second paragraph. A common answer is that we cannot go back to an economy based primarily on financial speculation. ""The economy that got us into this recession is not the economy to which we need to recover,"" Katz said.\The answer probably lies in ""making things again,"" he said, particularly ideas, some of which get turned into high-value manufactured goods for export. Metro areas, Katz said, should become laboratories of pragmatism, fueled not by ideology but by ""what works."" State governments, even though they face an unprecedented $125 billion shortfall, must be careful not to cut spending not just for the sake of cuts, but also to carefully target public investments for greatest probable return.\""We cannot just cut our way to growth,"" he said. A state with a large research university, for example, would be foolish to starve its best ticket to discovery, innovation and new business activity. The Twin Cities' greatest weakness, he told me, is its failure to commercialize ideas in the way that, say, San Diego and Austin have created local wealth around their university campuses.\MSP metro needs a strategy to compete\It's important for metro economies to know ""who they are in the global market,"" and ""not to get lost in the ideological noise"" of Washington politics, Katz said. Some states and metro regions will succeed at this, and some will not. The Midwestern ""auto zone"" and parts of the Sun Belt hit hardest by the real estate crisis will have a difficult time crawling out of their holes, he said. What about the Twin Cities? Katz left the question hanging.\The people upon whom I rely to generate this column think we have a good shot at recovering and competing, largely because we know our strengths: A strong work ethic, a productive work force, a solid research university, a lively cultural scene, easy access to nature and a relatively high quality of life. And we know our weaknesses, too: a harsh climate, relatively high taxes, an inadequate transportation system, an inefficient development pattern, a huge racial gap on income and achievement, an inability to commercialize ideas, and a propensity to talk rather than act.\Last Tuesday's election shifted the balance of political power in both Washington and St. Paul at a critical time. New approaches are on the way, but the challenges are unchanged. This column's mission, as before, is to discuss how best to improve the urban design of this cold, remote place, not to advance any ideology but to help Minneapolis-St. Paul to remain a metro area worthy of recovery, reinvestment, competitiveness and prosperity.\More reading:\Bruce Katz on the ""Pragmatic Caucus""\Alan Berube on education and jobs in metro America\Katz et al. on export growth\Katz et al. on innovation clusters\Thomas Fisher on design thinking\Credit: Steve Berg"
93,"PIPELINE PROTESTS It was with great dismay that I read the Washington Post editorial (reprinted in the Star Tribune Nov. 8) claiming that the Standing Rock protests against an oil pipeline on their land are ""misplaced"" and that any change should be a result of ""orderly and predictable"" actions. What would have happened if our founding fathers (and mothers) or Elizabeth Cady Stanton or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. or Vietnam War protesters (to name but a few) had kept only to ""orderly and predictable"" actions? All of these activists brought their grievances first to their local communities. But their actions and devotion to their causes eventually rippled through their states and the nation and change, though hard-won and long-fought, began to happen. We must take a hard look at, heed and spread the larger story the Standing Rock protesters are trying to tell us. Then we can all take action and effect change.CYNTHIA WETZELL, MINNEAPOLIS- - - I find it hard to believe that anyone from the Post was anywhere near Standing Rock or has any idea of what is really going on there. The editorial called it ""anti-pipeline activism,"" stating ""piecemeal activism accomplishes little."" I beg to differ! First of all, piecemeal is how the pipeline has escaped more scrutiny, forcing those along each section to act accordingly. However, Standing Rock is not just about the pipeline and oil, it's about a stand for the well-being of a nation and care of our Earth. I could not believe that the suggested solution for the North American indigenous gathering was to ""adopt fuel efficiency standards to cut gasoline demand"" and ""enacting a carbon tax that would make alternatives to coal and oil steadily more competitive."" Really? The unaddressed part was why are we ""sucking it from underground shale formations and transporting it"" anyway. We are all ready for an alternative! The oil industry is not.Patricia Jakobsen, Delano- - - Much thanks to Toni Easterson for the defense of people at Standing Rock and her own once-hidden indigenous heritage (""Standoff is about so much more than a pipeline; it's about us all,"" Nov. 5). It's long past time to acknowledge the dignity and rights inherent in 19th-century treaties so long ignored by states and the federal government, as well as that all of us Europeans are colonial invaders, not natives.Lou Schoen, St. Louis ParkLINGERING ELECTION THOUGHTSTeacher properly teaches students how to think, not whatThe essay ""My election take? Not telling my students"" by Katie Vagnino (Variety, Nov. 8) exemplified, in my view, the highest-quality education that one could hope to see an educator implement. Vagnino outlined an objective, fact-based curriculum that models the best of problem-solving instruction. It is not her job, nor is it any teacher's job, to influence her students to her personal viewpoint. As she pointed out, it is her job to train critical thinkers who are capable of analyzing information to better understand the complex issues of our times. Kudos from a former teacher/school administrator.Constance L. Finnern, Edina- - - By far the best part of voting on Tuesday was seeing all the children. Whole families stopped on their way to work and school so that children could witness what their parents did and could witness, too, the pride with which they did it.As we left, a young mother posed outside by the polling-place sign with her three small children. All four wore ""I Voted"" stickers -- not evidence of voter fraud, but evidence for a day in the future that on this day she had voted for her entire family. It was evidence also that, at least in this place and for these people, cynicism had not penetrated.John Schmit, St. Paul- - - As of Wednesday, the country will be united. We will all be shedding tears of some sort.Tracey Noyes, St. Anthony- - - I hope to long recall the sun on my back and the colorful leaf-carpets of maple, oak, aspen, gingko, and birch in the bright days leading up to this election. Am I naive to think that spell can last? Whatever the outcome, we will be in a mood on Wednesday. How do we collectively move through the next four years, and the next? Will lingering suspicions of one another follow the rancor? Can we mend ourselves? Will I put my trust in you? Will you believe in me?Marie Ward, West St Paul- - - I thank you, Donald Trump, for running for president.You were successful at inspiring millions of Americans to get involved with the political process. You were successful at getting people to pay attention to the serious issues before our country. You were successful at getting millions of people energized, excited and passionate, both good and bad, about the presidential race this time around. You were successful at getting millions of people to buy into your simple message of wanting to make America great again. And you did not need any Hollywood celebrity, singer, corporate bigshot or GOP politician to help to sell your vision, just you.And I thank you for putting a small dent in the political-correctness madness in our country. But don't worry -- I am still planning on saying ""Merry Christmas"" this year.Neil F. Anderson, RichfieldINCLUSIVITYThat includes making the effort to say names correctlyEvery student deserves to feel culturally affirmed by his or her school (""What's in a student's name? Family, culture, identity, stories,"" Nov. 4). As a teacher in Minneapolis public schools, I'm privileged to work with some incredibly astute students who understand how names are tied so closely to identity. In fact, it was a group of students who alerted me when a substitute teacher refused to pronounce a Somali girl's name correctly even after repeated reminders.So I was disappointed to hear Katherine Kersten from the Center of the American Experiment speak so flippantly about correct pronunciation of students' names. (""You are encouraging them to think of themselves as victims, as people who are being wronged, and therefore, people who should be angry, she was quoted as saying.) I admit that learning names from so many cultural heritages and languages can be a challenge, but it's worth it to create the climate our students deserve. If a teacher doesn't make the effort to say a student's name correctly, will that student feel comfortable advocating for religious accommodations?Casting these students as playing the victim, rather than acknowledging the marginalization they feel when their cultural differences are ignored, is incredibly irresponsible. Our students deserve better. Positive and affirmative school environments are foundational to improving student achievement for all our students.Casey Metcalfe, MinneapolisROAD CONSTRUCTIONThanks for improved Hwy. 100. One thing I'm curious about ...From time to time I have been heard to say that the reason the beltway is named Hwy. 100 is because it has been under construction for that many years. But now that the section I travel most days between Golden Valley and St. Louis Park is finished, I have to say hats off and thank you to the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the many people who had a hand in the reconstruction. It is very much appreciated.My one other question is: Where do all the orange traffic cones live in the winter?Patricia Hoyt, Golden Valley"
94,"It has become fashionable on social media and in certain publications to argue that capitalism is killing the planet. Even renowned investor Jeremy Grantham, hardly a radical, made that assertion last year. The basic idea is that the profit motive drives the private sector to spew carbon into the air with reckless abandon.\Though many economists and some climate activists believe that the problem is best addressed by modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, many activists believe that the problem can't be addressed without rebuilding the economy along centrally planned lines.\The climate threat is certainly dire, and carbon taxes are unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. But eco-socialism is probably not going to be an effective method of addressing that threat. Dismantling an entire economic system is never easy, and probably would touch off armed conflict and major political upheaval.\In the scramble to win those battles, even the socialists would almost certainly abandon their limitation on fossil-fuel use -- either to support military efforts, or to keep the population from turning against them. The precedent here is the Soviet Union, whose multidecade effort to reshape its economy by force amid confrontation with the West led to profound environmental degradation. The world's climate does not have several decades to spare.\Even without international conflict, there's little guarantee that moving away from capitalism would mitigate our impact on the environment. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power in Bolivia, living standards have improved substantially for the average Bolivian, which is great. But this has come at the cost of higher emissions. Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S. managed to decrease its per capita emissions a bit during this same period.\In other words, in terms of economic growth and carbon emissions, Bolivia looks similar to more capitalist developing countries. That suggests that faced with a choice of enriching their people or helping to save the climate, even socialist leaders will often choose the former. And that same political calculus will probably hold in China and the U.S., the world's top carbon emitters -- leaders who demand draconian cuts in living standards in pursuit of environmental goals will have trouble staying in power.\The best hope for the climate therefore lies in reducing the trade-off between material prosperity and carbon emissions. That requires technology -- solar, wind and nuclear power, energy storage, electric cars and other vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The best climate policy plans all involve technological improvement as a key feature.\The rapid advance of solar technology, for example, is a huge victory in the struggle against climate change, because it will allow people all over the world to have electricity without cooking the planet.\And how was this victory achieved? A combination of smart government policy and private industry. Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers Goksin Kavlak, James McNerney and Jessika Trancik in a recent paper evaluated the factors behind the solar-price decline from 1980 to 2012. They concluded that from 1980 to 2001, government-funded research and development was the main factor in bringing down costs, but from 2001 to 2012, the biggest factor was economies of scale. These economies of scale were driven by private industry increasing output, but with government subsidies helping to increase the incentive to ramp up production.\It's apparent, therefore, that both government and profit-seeking enterprises have their roles to play. Instead of eco-socialism, it's eco-industrialism. If there's any system that can beat climate change, this looks like it.\Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

95,"A long-simmering dispute between North Dakota and Minnesota appears to be coming to a head. North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem is saying he very likely will sue Minnesota over its so-called ""carbon tax"" on emissions, calling it an illegal attempt to regulate another state's industry.\""We simply feel that we've been forced into this posture,"" Stenehjem said in an interview this week. ""We have attempted everything we can think of to work with officials in Minnesota.""\Stenehjem declined to put a timeframe on the lawsuit or say in which court it was likely to be filed, but he said his group is calculating the economic damage to North Dakota.\The interstate showdown comes as Congress works on national legislation to curb emissions of carbon dioxide -- a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming -- via various schemes, including a cap-and-trade system that sets a limit on emissions and creates a market for ""permits to pollute.""\But with health care dominating the agenda, it's not clear when carbon legislation will get passed. International climate talks in Copenhagen before Christmas resulted in a nonbinding agreement for countries to cut emissions, but it didn't get specific.\Minnesota gets much of its electricity from North Dakota. North Dakota generates most of it by burning coal, which spews carbon dioxide. Coal is a $2.8 billion industry in North Dakota and lawmakers approved a litigation war chest of $500,000 for the dispute with Minnesota. There's $400,000 left, Stenehjem said.\The Bismarck Tribune on Dec. 29 reported Stenehjem's intentions to sue. That was about 10 days after the Industrial Commission of North Dakota held a closed-door meeting to discuss potential litigation. The commission consists of North Dakota's governor, agriculture commissioner and attorney general.\The outcome of such a lawsuit could potentially affect the ability of states to implement environmental regulation of one of the most important greenhouse gases, said Frederick Weston, a former utilities regulator at the Vermont-based Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit working on environmental issues.\""I would imagine federal and state policymakers will follow this case with interest,"" Weston said.\The carbon fracas goes back to the Next Generation Energy Act that Minnesota passed in 2007. The law instructed Minnesota's utility regulators to include the cost of the carbon dioxide emissions into the cost of electricity from coal-fired power plants to price the power more accurately. Minnesota is one of a number of states that use some method to account for the cost of carbon emissions from the power sector in their planning.\The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) now estimates that carbon emissions cost $9 to $34 per ton. That's not a tax or surcharge but is an analytical tool for evaluating purchases of electricity or the construction of new power plants. It goes into effect in 2012.\North Dakota argues the adjustment amounts to a tax on its power. The new planning mechanism will make North Dakota's coal-fired electricity prohibitively expensive, Stenehjem argues, and have a chilling effect on its industry.\Stenehjem said Minnesota exempted at least one Minnesota facility from the carbon policy.\Stenehjem said North Dakota has ""done more than any other state in carbon capture and regulation"" and invested millions of dollars in research addressing carbon. He said he invited Minnesota lawmakers last May to tour carbon-capture projects in North Dakota and got no response.\""We haven't even had a courtesy of a response to our letter,"" he said. ""Minnesota is doing nothing except passing these laws,"" Stenehjem said. ""We're actually doing something."" Stenehjem said Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Glenn Wilson called him after Christmas about the potential litigation. The Commerce Department declined to comment.\State Sen. Ellen Anderson, DFL-St. Paul, said North Dakota doesn't have a legal argument. Minnesota's new carbon policy applies to Minnesota, too, she said, so it isn't penalizing any state.\""It's not about North Dakota. It's about coal,"" said Anderson, who chairs the Environment, Energy and Natural Resources Budget Division. Anderson said she didn't recall getting an invitation from North Dakota.\Anderson said she anticipates a federal cap on carbon in 2010 and feels it's ""ridiculous"" for neighboring states to be discussing suing each other over the issue. They should sit down and talk, she said.\Jennifer Bjorhus - 612-673-4683\Credit: JENNIFER BJORHUS; STAFF WRITER"
96,"Monday's announcement that the giant Big Stone II plant won't be built as planned near Minnesota's western border makes it unlikely that another coal-fired power plant will be built in the Upper Midwest anytime soon, if ever.\Major changes in the economics of producing electricity together with concern over carbon's role in climate change have relegated coal, the fuel that powered the industrial revolution and helped modernize Western civilization, to undesirable status.\The new fuel of choice for large base-load plants is natural gas, which less than three years ago was considered in serious decline but has gained important attention with announcements that new technology will free gas trapped in over thousands of square miles of shale rock in the south, Midwest, and northeastern United States.\But after nearly five years of expensive wrangling over the wisdom of erecting a $1.8 billion, 550-megawatt coal burner near Milbank, S.D., Big Stone II was clicked off by the very utilities that pushed it hard in three states and Washington, D.C.\Financial claims evaporated\In the end, claims by a five-utility consortium backing Big Stone II that coal was the least-cost alternative evaporated just as the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA) said all along that they would.\""This project didn't make financial sense,"" said Beth Goodpaster, MCEA's lead intervening attorney. She said anticipated construction costs and forecasts for future cost of carbon taxes were both too low, adding up to a high financial risk for shareholders.\According to the utilities themselves, the risk has grown with a decline in demand resulting from the economic recession coupled with uncertainty over climate change legislation in Congress.\In an outstanding article in today's St. Paul Pioneer Press by Leslie Brooks Susukamo, Bob Schulte of the Central Minnesota Municipal Power Agency, a partner in Big Stone II, is quoted as saying: ""When you're asking the bank for $2 billion, they want to make sure about the costs of the project; there's a lot of uncertainty out there for long-term energy projects.""\Signs of trouble two years ago\First signs of trouble for Big Stone II came two years ago when Great River Energy of Maple Grove abruptly withdrew as a partner in the project, citing lowering energy demand.\However, Big Stone II backers, led by Otter Tail Power of Fergus Falls, Minn., and Montana-Dakota Power of Bismark, N.D., pushed ahead and won approvals from the North Dakota Public Service Commission, the South Dakota Board of Minerals and Environment, and earlier this year from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) for transmission lines to carry nearly half the power into Minnesota.\The PUC's action was curious, with all five commissioners voting to approve the lines even though two administrative law judges and the Minnesota Department of Energy Security recommended against. Even a consultant hired by the PUC raised major doubts about cost assumptions for Big Stone II advanced by the utilities.\Big Stone II was further crippled earlier this year when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was revoking air quality permits issued by South Dakota.\Otter Tail's withdrawal\But a stake was driven into the project's heart in September when Otter Tail Power surprisingly withdrew from the project, citing lowered electrical demand and the uncertainty of climate and energy legislation in Congress. Otter Tail was to take a third or more of the power from Big Stone II, but it was also the project's lead backer and it even owned the land where the new plant would be built -- next to Otter Tail's existing plant, Big Stone I.\Without doubt, the uncertainties of soft electrical demand and the prospect of some kind of carbon tax on coal together with the forever-rising construction costs left the utilities with banks and shareholders chary about financial risk of big coal projects.\But the utilities insist that demand for power hasn't gone away.\Mark Hanson of Montana-Dakota Power in Bismarck said his company is looking into options; Cris Kling of Otter Tail Power said the same thing.\The options? Here's where the utilities are beginning to sound like environmental and energy advocates who've long warned about the folly of relying on coal for power generation.\Looking to natural gas\For reliable base-load power to serve the broad power demand by consumers, utilities are looking to natural gas. At least for the near term, supplies are expected to be plentiful due to a new technology to free gas from tight bubbles in shale rock.\But it would be a mistake to over-rely on natural gas, said Michael Nobel of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy.\(The challenges of natural gas production, along with a splendid overview of energy production, appeared last August in TIME magazine.)\Noble said the wise course would be to turn to natural gas, which is significantly cleaner than coal or oil, for perhaps 20 or 30 percent of future demand, and address the remainder with renewables like wind and solar, and also with energy conservation and improved efficiency.\And that is exactly what utilities are doing. All are looking to wind power (North Dakota is rated one of the nation's highest sources for wind generation), and energy efficiency is being pushed through national and state regulation, and even by developers of new buildings or retrofitting older buildings to reduce energy consumption.\What it adds up to is that the days of King Coal to fuel power plants are over for now, at least until technology is developed to capture carbon and keep it from the atmosphere, where it promotes climate change.\Credit: Ron Way"
97,"MINNESOTA'S RIVERS The three-part series ""Danger Downstream"" (Oct. 2-4) is prophetic. Minnesotans/Americans need to be made aware of the immediate danger to not only our rivers and lakes but our drinking water. Phosphorus/nitrates are choking our water. The comments in the articles like ""We are going downhill"" and ""it's like a big gun barrel ... we are on the other end"" are spot-on. I have a cabin that is being choked to death, and there are many, many other lakes and rivers in Minnesota that are impaired. Any person who lives, works or plays on the water needs to be involved. We need to ask ourselves, politicians, farmers, corporations like Cargill (with headquarters in Minnesota) and universities to be invested in making change through conservation and research.Bill White, EaganALLINA NURSES' STRIKEIn whose interest is their resistance? Theirs? Everyone's?I am all for organized labor, collective bargaining, the right to strike, etc., but have found myself struggling to empathize with the union representing Allina nurses after reading Tuesday's front-page article (""Allina nurses reject contract with 'resounding' no, stay on strike"").If I understand correctly, the primary sticking point in the negotiations is health insurance, and the union's desire to protect its no- or low-deductible health plans instead of joining the standard corporate health plan that the rest of the company has.From my perspective, the days of gold-plated health insurance are long gone. The majority of Minnesotans, me included, have been dealing with high-deductible health insurance plans for over a decade now.Health insurance costs continue to spiral out of control, and as a result the vast majority of working Minnesotans have seen their premiums and deductibles rise in tandem, year over year. It's a painful reality and a byproduct of the unsustainable rise of health care costs.The article states that the latest offer to the union included provisions to leave two of the current plans untouched through 2019, and then cap them after that at 7 percent over a three-year period. On paper, that sounds like a reasonable offer to me. I think the majority of us would jump at such an opportunity in our current health insurance environment.And so I'm having a hard time empathizing with the union. To think a select few should continue to enjoy the gold-plated health insurance of years gone by is unrealistic at best, and at worst unfair to the rest of us who continue to shoulder the higher premiums and deductibles required to support the current system.Brad McFaul, Rosemount- - - Martin Shkreli bought a drug company and raised the U.S. price of a pill for parasitic infection from $14 to $750. He cannot make that huge price increase in Japan, Germany and most other industrialized countries, but in the U.S. he can do it because of our obsession with avoiding regulation. Japan is strongly capitalistic (it has few natural resources), but its Health Ministry sets all the prices, and the drug companies must accept them. Germany requires all of its 240 ""sickness funds"" (insurers) to collectively negotiate the prices with the drug companies. The Germans have learned there is strength in collective bargaining.My wife (a nurse on strike) wants to keep her collectively bargained union health insurance, and she voted accordingly on Monday. If she is forced by Allina to give that up, her out-of-pocket maximum, which is now $500 in the union plan, will increase to $4,500 in Allina's core plan in the year in which the change occurs. As her husband, the same numbers apply to me, so together we could incur an $8,000 increase. Too much!Nurses, demand to keep your union health plan, and continue advocating to achieve affordable health care for all Americans.Mark Nelson, AftonMINNEAPOLIS CRIMENew approach to gangs seems like little more than a showSo Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and Police Chief Janee Harteau are going to spend $250,000 to solve the gang problem (""Shootings spark pledge for gang reform efforts,"" Oct. 4). Let's look at the dynamics. Hire a program administrator for, say, $75,000, an assistant, a press representative; staff the offices with cellphones, car allowances, rent, paid interns to do the work, a holistic consultant, coffee and doughnuts for the ""gang summit,"" and some T-shirts with a novel theme. A grand opening gala, balloons and Kool-Aid. Meanwhile, a whole generation of people will be ignored, forgotten, continued to be buried while the politicians continue to pat themselves on the back. Gun buybacks, hire a grant writer to reapply for the grant next year, a party for the businesses that are suffering downtown property damage and a contingency fund for the next public uprising ...What is left? Surely nothing for the kids.David Bordwell, MinneapolisVOTINGTurnout numbers matter in an election and referendumIn the referendum held in Hungary (""Hungary: Anti-quotas vote invalidated,"" Oct. 3), 98.8 percent of respondents rejected the idea of mandatory European Union quotas for accepting asylum seekers and migrants. An astonishing number. Forty-four percent of eligible voters cast a ballot. To validate the vote, the current government a few years ago raised the bar from 25 percent participation (undemocratic) to 50 percent (democratic). By the latter criterion, the vote is invalid.On the same day, Colombians voted to accept or reject the peace treaty negotiated between the government and the FARC rebels. The voters by a razor-thin margin (50.25 vs. 49.75 percent) rejected the treaty (""Colombia votes no on peace accord,"" Oct. 3). The Star Tribune called the result ""stunning."" The voter turnout was 40 percent.In the U.S., about 52 percent of voters turn out to vote in a presidential election year and between 40 to 45 percent in a nonpresidential election year.Geza Simon, MinneapolisCLIMATE CHANGECanada sets an example for the U.S. to emulateCongratulations to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for announcing that his government will impose a nationwide tax on fossil fuels (""Canada plans to implement carbon tax,"" Oct. 4). As Trudeau said, ""the effects of climate change itself cannot be denied. There is no hiding from climate change. It is real, and it is everywhere.""Like Canada, every community in Minnesota is subject to the risks of climate change: frequent floods, droughts and wildfires. Just last month, another record-setting rainfall damaged Waseca and other communities in the southern part of the state.The Minnesota Department of Health has identified the climate hazards that can sicken and kill us: increased air pollution, extreme heat, flood, drought, insect-borne diseases and harmful algal blooms in our lakes. We feel these hazards in both our bodies and our pocketbooks.Congress can emulate Canada and put a tax on carbon-emitting fossil fuels, return 100 percent of the revenue to U.S. households, and both promote renewable energy and reduce the greenhouse gases. This market-based approach can satisfy both conservatives and liberals. We can protect U.S. producers and farmers by putting a border tariff on imported goods from counties that don't tax carbon (though even China is experimenting with cap-and-trade policies) and thus encourage international action on climate.We can cheer on elected leaders who acknowledge the reality of climate change and are willing to take meaningful action to halt it. Let's remember them when we vote in November.Claudia Egelhoff, West St. Paul"
98,"ELECTRIC CARS\Holy car exhaust!\Monday's opinion piece by Ashley Nunes about the liberal/Democrat love of electric vehicles was an example of obfuscation and misdirection regarding the reasons governments and green-minded individuals are touting electric vehicles (""Combustion engines are still the future""). The reason to move to EVs is because internal combustion cars and trucks are a major cause of the earth's warming to dangerous levels. Global warming is an insidious crisis. It's here, it will worsen, and we have to try to limit the damage. We need to use all tools available to do this, even imperfect ones. I would hope a research fellow at Harvard Law School would understand this. I think his opinion piece is dangerous propaganda.\Nobody with a brain would suggest EVs represent a nirvana of low-cost, zero-emission travel -- there is no such thing. However, internal combustion engines fall far short. The writer states that internal combustion technology has reduced air pollutants by 99%, but this is a misdirection. Although fuel mileage is much improved, further improvements will cost more than switching to electric. Why else are essentially all car companies going to EVs?\Vehicle range and charging infrastructure will improve the convenience of EVs. We will eventually have to have a carbon tax that will increase the cost of running internal combustion engine vehicles to reflect the true damage to the environment, and people will flock to EVs. We eventually will anyway, because it is a better technology in terms of performance and maintenance.\I applaud the people and governments buying and encouraging the use of EVs. There will be applications for internal combustion engine vehicles into the future, but they are not the future, any more than the horse and buggy were 100 years ago.\David Brockway, Hopkins\• • •\Once again we have an electric vehicle naysayer weigh in with a myopic view of the future of EVs, this time advocating increased government incentives for improving the gasoline engine. Nunes acknowledges there have been improvements over the 100-plus years of the internal combustion engine's existence but somehow thinks throwing more money in that direction will somehow overcome the inherent engineering, financial and, yes, environmental advantages of electric vehicles. Meanwhile, Daimler, Porsche, Audi, Hyundai, Samsung, Nissan, LG, Siemens and Ford have begun pouring billions into making the affordable, practical EV a reality within the next 10 years. Some have correspondingly shut down their internal combustion development entirely. Why? Because they see the reasons why the internal combustion engine is a dead man walking.\EV technology development today is moving fast, just as internal combustion engine technology did in its early days.\Both Nunes' children and my grandchildren will be driving electric vehicles. The only question is if any of them will be American made.\Gary Box, Golden Valley\FUTURE OF FARMING\Support farms -- the good kind\I have great respect for any people choosing farming as a career, and even more for those who chose it as a way of life. Nonetheless, it seems to me that the Daley family in the Feb. 22 article ""For dairies, is big bad?"" not only wants to purchase 3,000 more cows but has bought into the Big Agriculture narrative, ""Get out or get big,"" and claims efficiency as a very high-ranking value of farming today and into the future.\No matter who owns the farm, a corporation or a first- or sixth-generation family, a factory farm is one that, among many things: confines thousands of animals in a concentrated area, injects these animals with large amounts of antibiotics and feeds them grain grown with pesticides to keep them alive and productive, and produces massive amounts of manure that can cause great environmental impact on air, soil and water quality, thus harming the health of animals and humans, both locally and beyond.\As Ben Daley seems to suggest, I am not one of those people who has ""that American Gothic picture in mind"" of a farmer, ""the wife right there."" Rather, what I picture and support by my actions and buying power are people who farm sustainably for themselves, their local communities, their state and nation and the next generations. I encourage readers to research the factory farming movement and then decide if this is the type of farming that a nation, state or local community should pursue.\Mary M. Kiemen, Roseville\• • •\My heart breaks reading about the dilemma the Winona community and the Daley family face as they consider the pros and cons of expansion of the Daleys' dairy operation.\I'm a strong supporter of the sustainability model the Land Stewardship Project advocates. The groundwater issues of runoff and manure pits and the methane gas created from large scale operations like the proposed Daley expansion are concerning and legitimate as our scientific knowledge of the environmental impacts become public knowledge.\Yet I feel deeply for the dilemma this family faces as they struggle to hold to a family livelihood they've practiced for generations, not to grow wealthy but to provide a means to assure a dignified retirement for the older generation they're replacing.\I grew up on a dairy farm in upstate New York and saw firsthand the futile struggles our neighbors and friends waged to hold on to the land. Our family chose to grow a larger operation and ultimately left the no-longer-profitable dairy business for the hay and grain business.\There are no villains here, only good people, some trying to preserve their heritage and others to protect our waters.\Blanche Hawkins, Dellwood\NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS\Release all or none, Bloomberg\Mike Bloomberg offered on Friday to allow three women under nondisclosure agreements with his company to speak (""Bloomberg to release 3 women from NDAs,"" Feb. 22). Just three out of I don't know how many -- but a lot. Do we really want a guy as president who isn't perceptive enough to see that allowing only three of the group to speak is worse than allowing none? Every person reading about this sudden ""openness"" is thinking: ""These must be the women who were just offended by his speech. How about the others?"" If he allows no one to speak, then he is defending the sanctity of the NDA -- bogus, but at least a defense. If he opens three but not the others, he is waving a flag that says, ""The real nasty stuff has to do with these other women."" If he doesn't get that, he is not bright enough to do this job -- certainly no smarter than President Donald Trump. Goodbye, Mike.\Robert Veitch, Richfield\• • •\NDAs that result from sexual harassment primarily protect the people who harass -- not the victims. So kudos to Sen. Elizabeth Warren for challenging Bloomberg to release these victims who have signed NDAs with his company. But why stop with Bloomberg? Any entity that receives federal support should be required to review NDAs and release victims of on-the-job sexual harassment from them -- the public has a right to hear their accounts.\It is common practice for institutions to pay victims but end their employment. At the same time, these institutions often allow the employees who have been credibly accused of sexual harassment to stay on the job. Indeed, they even promote and further empower these individuals, essentially investing in predatory behavior. Taxpayers should not have to subsidize this action in any way.\Julie Risser, Edina\We want to hear from you. Send us your thoughts here."
99,"THE U.S. ECONOMY |\Last week a letter writer compared the U.S. economy to a game of ""Monopoly"" and bemoaned the fact that at the end of the game, the winner had all of the money and everyone else was broke. He obviously included himself in the group of poor and middle-class citizens who would be left penniless after the winners (the very rich) ""progressively capture most of the available wealth."" He implied that every dollar earned by someone wealthier than himself is a dollar less that is available to others. That might be true if the amount of available money were finite, as in a ""Monopoly"" game. Of course, in our economy the supply of money and wealth is not limited. This ruse has long been used by progressives who argue for income redistribution, but it does not hold water. It doesn't take a degree in economics to understand the fallacy of the ""Monopoly"" theory.\Peter Boyum, Stillwater\GOV. MARK DAYTON\Coercive budgeting is a dubious tactic\Gov. Mark Dayton, in his budget proposal, promoted support and funding for higher education. An increase of $32 million for operations, $32 million to freeze tuition and $30 million to increase the ""prestige"" of the Medical School were all allocated to the University of Minnesota. Noticeably absent were increases to the Minnesota State Universities and Colleges system.\Dayton has continuously chosen to hold MnSCU hostage to the Charting the Future planning process that had failed to force budget cuts, personnel rearrangements and other McDonaldizing methods that would decrease the quality of education for the state's largest provider of higher education.\The governor and the state rely on MnSCU to provide both community college and university graduates. MnSCU is ranked 38th out of the 50 states and District of Columbia in administrative spending per full-year-equivalent student. Member institutions struggle to meet the needs of students and have low rankings due to lack of state support. Instead of worrying about the prestige of the Medical School and the 500 students it serves, the focus should be on the 450,000 students that MnSCU serves each year.\Andrew Andrusko, Ramsey\- - - \""Gov.

Rick Perry, R-Texas, took similar steps in his state, he was indicted on a charge of abuse of power.\What do you think, Minnesotans?\David Paton, Mendota Heights\- - - \As a lifelong conservative, I rarely find myself in agreement with Dayton's policies and positions. His $11 billion transportation package, however, is right on the mark, and years overdue. What could be simpler than a direct user fee? No new state bureaucracy to administer the program. The folks who use our roads and bridges get to pay to keep them in good repair. Those who use them the most get to pay the most. (We can worry about the handful of electric vehicles not paying their fair share at a later date.) There is absolutely no excuse for Minnesota not to have the finest transportation infrastructure in the country. The only question now is why didn't the governor propose this new package when his party controlled both the House and Senate, and the bill had a realistic chance of getting approved?\Chuck Millberg, Plymouth\THE CLIMATE\Liberals want to scare you into submission\The Jan. 27 editorial ""As the Midwest warms, economy will suffer"" is the 2015 version of a sky-is-falling progressive scare. We have seen it all before. In the 1970s, it was the ""population bomb,"" then the coming of a new ice age -- both wrong. The next iteration was Al Gore's ""Inconvenient Truth,"" complete with a dramatic hockey-stick graph of temperature rise. Undaunted by being totally wrong, progressives revised the global-warming mantra using the meaningless term ""climate change."" Since climate changes from day to day, week to week, month to month and year to year, this latest scare tactic to save Minnesota, the United States and the world is guaranteed to require more government with higher taxes to support a big new bureaucracy with big new programs. The inconvenient truth is that this is but another boondoggle in a long his\tory of progressive, tax-and-spend, save-the-world ideas.\David Teicher, Plymouth\- - - \Two Jan. 28 articles left me frustrated at President Obama's inconsistency regarding climate change. He came out strongly in his State of the Union message in terms of protecting the environment and dealing with climate change, and the New York Times editorial excerpted in the editorial page's Short Takes feature rightly praises Obama's decision to designate 12 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as permanent wilderness, but a few pages ahead, the article ""Obama proposes Atlantic drilling"" outlines his plan to open up a ""broad swath"" of the Atlantic Coast to drilling.\We just can't afford ""all of the above"" anymore. Statistics show that greenhouse-gas emissions increased last year, both in the United States and worldwide, so we need to do better. We must substantially reduce our use of fossil fuels, and that will require more than individual efforts.\Most people I know are already doing a lot to reduce their carbon footprints. We need strong legislative and executive action, such as by enacting a carbon tax that will force fossil-fuel producers to be responsible for the true costs of the harm they are doing and result in a shift to alternative energy sources. Although I am pessimistic about Congress acting, our only hope is to raise our voices loud enough that they can't be ignored by congressional leaders, and we also need to hold President Obama to consistent positive actions on climate change, as he pledged in his State of the Union speech.\Eleanor Wagner, Edina\VACCINATION\Editorial cartoon was on the mark\Thank you, Steve Sack, for your Jan. 28 editorial cartoon. It was fabulous! Ignorance and arrogance are two words that come to mind when I think about the decisionmaking process that parents use in choosing not to vaccinate their children. Disregard and disrespect of the science and history of preventable disease actions and behaviors is beyond my comprehension. I have utmost respect for the public health and medical communities who continue respectfully to provide education and care to these parents and their children -- who really are the unfortunate victims of vaccine-preventable disease.\Susan M. Carolan, Blaine"
100,"Greenhouse gases are trapping heat in our atmosphere and warming the planet at an alarming rate. Climate scientists believe if we don't respond appropriately in the next decade or so, global warming will cause oceans to rise, disease to spread, droughts to prolong, storms and wildfires to intensify, and scores of species to go extinct.\The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, however, foresees a different apocalyptic vision: a future in which American businesses are forced to do their part to help avert the crisis.\The Chamber has turned up the heat on itself in recent months by making a series of statements aimed at killing a bipartisan effort to pass climate-change legislation in Congress. And the Chamber's extreme position is drawing criticism by its members, from such global giants as Nike and Apple to a few local Minnesota firms that spoke out at a media event earlier this week.\The comment that ignited the firestorm came in August from the Chamber's vice president for environmental regulation, who called for a sort of ""Scopes monkey trial"" for global warming science. (The Chamber later tried to take back the comment.) As the Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times and others have reported, the Chamber has called greenhouse-gas regulation ""a job killer"" that would ""completely shut the country down"" and ""virtually destroy the United States.""\Arguing that a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program would ""destroy"" or ""shut the country down"" is no less off-base than the recent claims about health reform resulting in government-run death panels. It assumes Americans have zero ability to innovate or adapt, and it ignores the costs of doing nothing. (And, by the way, that public trial? It already happened. It's called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and you can read its latest report here.)\The Chamber's attacks have cost it high-profile members and raised questions about how broadly the organization actually represents the views of businesses. Apple, Levi Strauss and the nation's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, have dropped their memberships. Nike resigned its seat from the board of directors, and other firms, including Microsoft, Toyota and Johnson & Johnson have publicly stated their disagreement.\On Wednesday, Clean Water Action attempted to show similar dissent among Minnesota business leaders. The environmental group organized a teleconference for reporters featuring three past or present local chamber members who favor federal climate-change legislation, though none packed the star power of a Nike or Apple. They were Doug Pierce, a senior architect with Perkins and Will in Minneapolis; Dave Danielsen of Conservation Technologies in Duluth; and Tom Gegax, an investor and business consultant who co-founded Tires Plus in 1978.\""Clinging to the status quo kills economies,"" Pierce said. Energy-efficient buildings are a key part of Perkins and Will's business, and Pierce said clean-energy legislation can help advance Minnesota's economy and position the United States as a leader.\But if there's a serious rift on climate change among Minnesota chamber members, however, it hasn't reached Bill Blazar's office. ""What we're hearing from our members is pretty simple: We want to reduce emissions without costing the state jobs,"" said Blazar, the group's public affairs and business development director.\Climate change isn't a top-three priority among members, he said, and those who do rank it as a priority don't see regulation as the best solution. The answer, in their view: building new nuclear power plants in Minnesota and finding ways to award and assist companies that voluntarily reduce emissions.\He wouldn't answer a question about whether the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce accepts that global warming is real and human-caused. Instead, he said members accept that they should find ways to voluntarily reduce emissions. He cited the Chamber's Waste Wise and Energy Smart programs.\""Those are two pretty significant initiatives that are well under way and didn't require anyone to pass a law,"" Blazar said. ""We don't need any more mandates or laws telling people to do it.""\What climate-change legislation would the Minnesota Chamber support? Blazar said they support repealing the state's ban on nuclear power plant construction and changing the state's definition of renewable energy to include large-scale hydro-power projects.\The Minnesota Chamber is an independent member of the U.S. Chamber. The national organization doesn't necessarily speak for the local organizations, but Blazar praised the U.S. Chamber's approach on climate change, saying that cap-and-trade regulation needs to include China and India.\""Let's lower our emissions, but let's do it in a way that actually reduces emissions and does not hurt the economy and maybe even makes it better off,"" Blazar said. ""We're going to pursue that path and hope that the federal government doesn't get in the way.""\Getting in the way, however, doesn't necessarily mean grinding the country's economy to a halt. Sweden is the best example of this. The country has taxed fossil fuels to encourage the use of cleaner, renewable fuels. Between 1990 and 2006, the country's emissions fell almost 9 percent while its economy grew 44 percent. Will Steger, speaking at a green business conference Thursday at the Mall of America, noted that many of the new jobs in Sweden have come in renewable industries, such as bioenergy.\Jenna Garland, a climate-change campaign organizer with Clean Water Action, says the Chamber doesn't represent all businesses. ""Clearly, these businesses leaving the Chamber or stating publicly that they support climate legislation indicates that the Chamber's position is not representative of its membership,"" Garland said.\Aveda, the eco-conscious salon and beauty-supply brand based in Blaine, was invited but unable to participate in the teleconference this week. In an interview, Chuck Bennett, Aveda's vice president of earth and community care, said the brand, a subsidiary of Estee Lauder, hasn't taken any official stance on the Chamber's statements.\However, Aveda's support for the 2007 renewable-energy standard passed by the Minnesota Legislature can be seen as reflective of the company's values, Bennett said. Aveda supports aggressive action on climate change, he said, but its efforts are typically more focused on business practices than legislation.\Gegax is a past Chamber member who served as chairman and chief executive of Tires Plus for 24 years before selling the company in 2000. His split with the Chamber came shortly after that, when he resigned from the Minnesota Chamber's environmental policy committee after serving just a few months. He hasn't been a member since.\""I called it the anti-environmental policy committee,"" Gegax said.\He quit after clashing with other members who were more interested in blocking environmental measures, he said, though he couldn't recall specific examples of disagreements. ""I had many people come up to me and say, 'I feel the way you do, but I can't risk [speaking out].' There's a lot of peer pressure,"" he said.\Now, as then, he believes the Chamber's official positions do not reflect the views of business owners as a whole.\""Typically, it's: 'Let's not bother our economic engine for things that could be positive for the environment,' and I disagree with that.""\Credit: Dan Haugen"
101,"
Dan Juhl, founder of Juhl Wind and a pioneer in Minnesota's wind industry, needed to vent.
\
His industry, which enjoyed record growth last year, is in danger of becoming becalmed due to Congressional inaction.
\
Efforts to advance a major climate and energy bill through the U.S. Senate collapsed earlier this summer. The bill included policies aimed at delivering the wind industry from decades of development that moved in fits and starts, like a car stuck in first gear.
\
It doesn't mean things have stalled. Minnesota's policy that calls for utilities to derive 25 percent of their electricity from renewable resources like wind by 2025 is keeping the turbine blades turning.
\
But a lack of a national energy policy will slow wind development nationwide, and that hinders the creation of manufacturing and jobs, renewable energy advocates say.
\
'Nobody understands why we can't get an energy policy in this country,' Juhl fumed over the phone from the office of his wind development company in Woodstock, Minn., 200 miles southwest of the Twin Cities. 'And not just for the wind industry but for all renewables.'
\
For the moment, Juhl's company is busy. This summer, it is working on a 1.5-megawatt project in Winona and a 10-megawatt project near Chandler, and in the fall, the company begins a pair of 20-megawatt projects in Meeker County in west central Minnesota.
\
But wind developers are watching the calendar. There's a growing season for wind developers, just as there is for the farmers Juhl works alongside, and for wind, the season ends in 2012.
\
That's the year federal production tax credits for wind energy projects expire.
\
Projects must be producing power or ""spinning,"" to use the industry's parlance, by the end of the year or investors lose the tax write-off.
\
A BOOM-BUST CYCLE
\
Congress does tend to renew the credits, but usually late in the year and only a year at a time. That triggers a boom-bust cycle as developers race the clock.
\
""It's hard for project developers and the industry to have concrete plans when the status of incentives is uncertain,"" said Kevin Johnson, an environmental and energy attorney at Stoel Rives in Minneapolis.
\
Beth Soholt, executive director of Wind on the Wires, a nonprofit wind energy advocacy group in St. Paul, said a national renewable energy standard like the one in the energy bill would not have forced Minnesota utilities to develop more wind energy for Minnesota.
\
But it could have given utilities an incentive to develop excess wind energy to sell to states without the Upper Midwest's rich resource, she said.
\
Advocates also argue that a national renewable energy standard similar to Minnesota's could spur job creation in the nation's bleeding manufacturing sector.
\
The wind industry supported 85,000 jobs across the country last year, and there were 39 new, expanded or announced turbine component facilities in 2009.
\
Compared with the nation's 11.7 million manufacturing jobs, that's modest. But more component manufacturers would establish U.S. plants if the country had long-term renewable energy policies that will create a steady market, according to the American Wind Energy Association.
\
""If you're going to make a multi-million-dollar investment in a manufacturing facility, you need visibility five years out. We've never had visibility five years out,"" said Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis for AWEA.
\
WESTERN EUROPE, CHINA GET BUSY
\
Without the energy legislation, the association fears that manufacturing investment will migrate to Europe and China, which have stepped up capacity, too.
\
Last, week, Reuters quoted a Deutsche Bank official saying U.S. alternative energy investment opportunities shrank after the Senate deadlock over the energy and climate bill.
\
""You just throw your hands up and say ... we're going to take our money elsewhere,"" Kevin Parker told the news agency. Parker is head of a $700 billion fund that devotes $6 billion to $7 billion to climate change products, and he said the Frankfurt-based bank will focus more ""green"" investment money in China and Western Europe.
\
China last year was No. 1 in new energy capacity with 13,750 megawatts, followed by the United States in with 9,994 megawatts, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's recently released 2009 Wind Technologies Market Report.
\
The 10 gigawatts of new installed wind capacity was a U.S. record, the Department of Energy reported, drawing nearly $21 billion in project investments.
\
Investments will peter out if new wind capacity begins to stall, renewable energy advocates say.
\
""It's a lost opportunity in job expansion,"" argued Michael Noble, executive director for Fresh Energy, a nonprofit in St. Paul that believes renewable energy is the path to a cleaner environment.
\
Noble points out that Minnesota's standard created an opportunity for the region. ""But a national renewable energy opportunity is much, much, much bigger,"" he said.
\
Minnesota has little in the way of wind energy manufacturing outside of the turbine blades fabricated at the three-year-old Suzlon Rotor Inc. plant in Pipestone, Minn.
\
But Minnesota does have dominant wind-farm construction companies, including Golden Valley-based Mortenson Construction, better known as the builder of the Minnesota Twins Target Field and the University of Minnesota's TCF Bank football stadium.
\
Mortenson employs 250 people in its renewable energy division and accounts for about one-quarter of all the wind projects in the United States. A national renewable energy standard could be a big boost to the renewable energy business, said Tim Maag, vice president and general manager.
\
The company has three sizeable projects this year in Minnesota, including the 201-megawatt Nobles Wind Farm in Nobles County. It anticipates no drop in activity through 2012. ""It's beyond 2012 that it becomes a major concern,"" Maag said.
\
EnXco, a French wind developer that hired Mortenson to build the Nobles Wind Project, is glimpsing the edge of the future already. Steve Peluso, enXco vice president of development for the Midwest region, said he's seeing a drop in requests for proposals from utilities nationwide to bid on wind energy projects.
\
Minnesota utilities don't appear eager to accelerate adoption of wind energy.
\
Great River Energy, a cooperative based in Maple Grove, already purchases 469 megawatts of wind energy, and will buy another 100 megawatts from developers next year, officials said.
\
At that point, Great River will have enough clean energy under contract to meet its Minnesota renewable energy milestones until 2022, said Bob Ambrose, director of Great River's government affairs.
\
Unlike the renewable energy advocates, Minnesota utilities appear ambivalent about a federal energy bill.
\
""Although an appropriate federal policy would help support our strategy, it is not dependent upon federal law,"" Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy said in a written statement.
\
Xcel had more wind energy capacity than any other utility in the country last year, pushed by its need to meet a special state standard. Unlike other Minnesota utilities, Xcel must derive 30 percent of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020.
\
Although renewable energy advocates believe the energy bill could have opened new markets for Minnesota utilities to sell wind energy, Ambrose said he doubted that.
\
Even though the Upper Midwest often is called ""the Saudi Arabia of wind,"" a bottleneck in electrical transmission capacity will prevent it from leaving the region, he and others said.
\
Leon Steinberg, CEO of National Wind LLC, a wind developer based in Minneapolis, said he wanted to see energy legislation create a national transmission siting authority that could override state opposition to high-voltage interstate transmission lines. He compared it to the way the Eisenhower Administration paved the way for the nation's Interstate freeways.
\
The most controversial part of the shelved energy bill would have put a price on carbon dioxide emissions tied to global warming.
\
PRICE OF ENERGY
\
Environmentalists believe raising the price of energy from fossil fuels such as coal would better reflect its damage to the environment and speed adoption of clean resources such as wind.
\
Ambrose disagreed. Great River's 1,200-megawatt coal-fired power plant, Coal Creek, which is fed directly from North Dakota's coalfields, would continue to operate.
\
""It's still in fine shape, and we expect it to run for another 30 to 40 years,"" he said.
\
Renewable advocates expect Congress to revive an energy bill after the elections, but its content and fate are by no means certain.
\
This kind of legislation requires a 30-year perspective, ""and that's a big step for Congress, where they're always scrambling around for the next election,"" said Douglas Tiffany, an assistant professor of applied economics at the University of Minnesota who studies energy issues.
\
Bill Glahn, director of the Minnesota Office of Energy Security, said the ultimate question will be whether local wind power can compete on its own once utilities achieve their renewable energy standard in 2025.
\
Glahn said the industry needs a better driving force than its fleeting federal tax credits, but he doesn't believe a national clean energy standard is the key, despite what it's done in Minnesota.
\
Juhl, meanwhile, continues to plow on.
\
""I've been in this business for 33 years,"" he said, ""and I've weathered many a storm.""

"
102,"When James Howard accepted the job of chief executive of Northern States Power Co. 3 1/2 years ago, one of his goals was to help the utility operate successfully in the competitive environment of deregulation.\ As he had learned in his long career with the Bell telephone system, deregulated utilities have to adjust to running with lower costs and more attention to their customers and must make decisions more swiftly than the ponderous pace most had been used to.\ To do that, Howard has led efforts to cut staff and expenses and to spread decision making authority down through the ranks. Under his direction, the Minneapolis-based company is putting more emphasis on its nonregulated subsidiaries, where much of the company's growth in the next decade is expected to occur, and has established programs to broaden the focus of its managers and employees out of their narrowly defined business segments.\ Ironically, the company's biggest challenge during Howard's tenure has come not from deregulation, but from the regulatory denial this month of its request for a $121 million rate increase.\ While trying to convince the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to reverse its decision, NSP has imposed a hiring freeze and is planning how to make budget cuts without hurting service or safety or further upsetting investors.\ On Aug. 7, the day after the regulatory decision was announced, NSP lost about $165 million of its market value, a 7 percent decline, as the company's stock dropped $2.62 1/2 cents to $31.75. It closed Friday at $31.25, a 52-week low. The company's stellar credit rating has been lowered by some agencies and is being watched by others, which would make borrowing more expensive, said Jim Doudiet, chief financial officer. The quarterly dividend is not in imminent danger, company officials said.\ ""We have, unfortunately, surprised our investors,"" he said, noting that utilities investors place a high value on stability. ""When they're surprised, it's hard to get that confidence back.""\ NSP has been collecting an interim annual rate increase of about $81 million since January, and could be forced to refund a substantial amount if it loses its appeals. Through June 30, the most recent figures reported, it had collected $34.8 million that is subject to refund if its request is rejected.\ The PUC's decision is particularly troubling to NSP officials, Doudiet said, because it indicates a serious breakdown in communications between NSP and its regulators. The commissioners did not consider whether NSP was entitled to an increase or how much it should get; they ruled that the company's budgeting process was so flawed that it did not provide accurate, measurable forecasts of its expenses that could be used to prove its need for higher rates. Despite an opinion from an administrative law judge that NSP ought to get $84 million of its request, the PUC dismissed the case on a 4-1 vote.\ Joan Peterson, lead attorney for the state Department of Public Service, which along with other organizations recommended the dismissal, said there was no intent to imply that NSP was dishonest or incompetent in preparing its forecasts, only that its internal budgets were inappropriate for rate-making purposes. She said the department's investigation showed that the company was overestimating the cost of its capital projects and that its accounting system lacked controls to assure that noneligible expenses weren't included in its rate budgets.\ NSP officials vigorously dispute the department's conclusions, noting that the administrative law judge had supported the company's position that its budget was appropriate. The company plans to ask the PUC to reconsider its decision, and failing that, to take the issue to court.\ ""We hope we don't have to go to court, but that's one of the alternatives,"" said Ed Theisen, who was promoted to president and chief operating officer in a management reorganization this summer. ""But we have to establish a healthy relationship with the PUC, so when we need increases in the future we'll be able to get them.""\ In an interview the week before the PUC decision, Howard didn't envision a dismissal of the case, but said that an unfavorable ruling would sap the company's strength ""like a low-grade infection.""\ ""It's not that the lights are going to go out tomorrow, but over time we couldn't do the kinds of things we've done in the past to ensure that this area does have a low-cost supply of energy that's environmentally sound,"" he said. ""What it does is force you into making short-term kinds of decisions"" in an industry with extremely long-term planning horizons.\ Craig Blair, recently named executive vice president in charge of NSP's power plants, said the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission expressed concerns about the rate order's effects on operation of NSP's nuclear power plants. He said he assured commission officials that ""we're not going to do anything that's going to hurt our nuclear program.""\ Theisen said NSP's priority ""is surviving during this year,"" and that the company is looking at curtailing the use of consultants, part-time employees and contract workers. ""We're trying to pull through this year without jeopardizing the safety of our crews and the public . . . and trying to avoid cutting areas that impact customer service,"" he said.\ Despite problems caused by the rate-case decision, industry observers long have considered NSP a well-run, efficient operation that has provided good returns to its shareholders.\ It has kept that reputation under Howard, who was brought in from Ameritech, a Bell operating company, where he was president and chief operating officer, to run NSP in January 1987 after three of the utility's top managers retired or resigned after an influence-peddling scandal.\ ""This is still a company that has an excellent operating record and a pretty strong financial record,"" said Sally Anderson, an analyst who follows NSP for Dain Bosworth Inc. ""They've treated their investors and customers well over the years.""\ Dan Hagen, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Hopwood, cited NSP's high marks from federal regulators for safe and efficient operation of its nuclear plants and its historical top-tier ranking within the industry in terms of stock-price appreciation and dividends paid to shareholders.\ Howard, who said that many of the changes instituted at NSP in the past few years were instigated by his predecessors, said the company has worked hard to improve service while squeezing costs.\ That's important in an environment where large customers such as the University of Minnesota have a choice of energy suppliers, he said. The school has put its total energy package up for bids, and NSP is competing not only against the local natural gas company, Minnegasco, but pipeline and construction companies from across the country.\ Among NSP's cost-cutting efforts were its 1988 voluntary early retirement offer, which cut 422 people from its management ranks, and its quality-circle program, where suggestions from union workers and first-level employees in 1989 saved the company $4 million, Howard said.\ Demand-side management is another important part of the company's cost-control measures, he said, even though convincing customers to use more efficient lights and appliances means that NSP will sell less electricity in the short run. ""It costs us less to have (customers) do that than it costs us to build new power plants"" to handle higher peak demand, he said.\ During the 1980s NSP's electric sales grew at an average rate of about 4.5 percent a year, about twice the national average. But that growth is expected to slow to about 2 percent or a little higher in the 1990s, barring a major recession, because of changes in demographics that will mean the formation of fewer households. Howard said.\ To keep the company growing, NSP intensified its attention to its nonregulated subsidiaries, which offer greater growth potential while avoiding the regulatory limits on profitability, he said.\ Those companies recently were consolidated into NSP Enterprises, composed of Norenco, which sells steam to Waldorf Paper Co., Andersen Windows and the Oak Park prison; NRG Energy, which is bidding to build power plants for other companies as an independent power producer; Graystone, NSP's joint-venture uranium enrichment plant to be built in Louisiana, and its refuse-derived fuel processing business, which handles about 3,000 tons of waste each day at plants in Elk River and Newport. These ventures contribute less than 10 percent of NSP's total revenues.\ Howard, who regularly holds informal discussion sessions with small groups of union and lower-level supervisors, has been fostering programs to change NSP's top-down, departmentalized culture, according to several of his top-line executives.\ In particular, NSP is promoting ""empowerment"" among it's first-line supervisors, said Hazel O'Leary, vice president of human resources and public and environmental affairs.\ ""The goal is to find ways people can get their jobs done while the supervisor gets out of the way and is no longer a cop,"" she said. ""This has been a very authoritarian industry, where people have to go up and up the ladder to get anything done. If we're going to be competitive, we have to be able to make decisions quickly.""\ Howard also is working to break down barriers between managers of NSP's highly segmented businesses, which include electric distribution, power plants, the gas utility, its Wisconsin unit and the nonregulated subsidiaries.\ The biggest move in that direction was a recent reorganization that shuffled top leaders in those areas to new departments, a radical tactic in a company where employees and managers tended to spend their careers within the same business segment.\ In addition to bringing fresh ideas to the departments, the reorganization also is expected to help the company plan for an orderly management succession by broadening the executives' experience and giving them a chance to succeed in new areas.\ Although there has been speculation that Theisen's appointment might mean that Howard, who remained chairman and chief executive, would have less involvement with NSP and could be preparing to leave, Howard emphatically said that is not his intention.\ ""I thought this move out pretty carefully before I came here,"" he said. ""It may upset a lot of people to hear that, but they may as well take their medicine,"" he added with a chuckle. ""I plan to stay the course."""
103,"Gov. Rudy Perpich said Thursday he'll sign the bills dedicating state lottery funds and increasing the state gas tax by 3 cents a gallon.\The Legislature passed the bills just before it went home for a four-day recess.\The lottery bill assigns proceeds to the Greater Minnesota Corporation and a new environmental trust fund through state law, not the constitution as he wanted, but the governor was philosophical yesterday about his defeat.\Perpich also had threatened to veto any bill that took money from the corporation. The lottery bill sent to his desk transfers $80.5 million from the economic development agency to the state's general fund, to pay for other spending bills passed this session.\The governor has no say over two proposed constitutional amendments in the bill. They go directly to the general-election ballot in November. One asks voters if there shall be a lottery operated by the state. The other asks if there shall be an environmental trust fund.\""It has things that will be worked out for a long, long time,"" Perpich said at an impromptu press conference yesterday. He referred to the bill's provisions for the environmental fund and the building of a trust fund for the Greater Minnesota Corporation.\The corporation is the centerpiece of Perpich's efforts to stimulate the economy in rural Minnesota.\""This is a give-and-take process,"" the governor said of his defeat on the fund dedication question.\Perpich wanted the language about where lottery funds would go in the constitution so future legislators wouldn't have access to them, as they will if the money is governed by state law.\If the Legislature doesn't keep the commitment that will be in state law to build those trust funds with lottery profits, Perpich said, ""You can always go to the public"" and try again for a constitutional guarantee.\Perpich said he won't campaign this fall for passage of the constitutional amendment asking voters if they want a state lottery.\But he will campaign for the second amendment creating an environmental trust fund, he said.\The governor compared his setback on the lottery bill to his 1978 election defeat, which he has said was the best thing that ever happened to him.\After that defeat, Perpich went to work for Control Data in Europe, an experience that he said gave him a new outlook and stood him in good stead when he returned to the governor's office.\""Who knows, it might be a blessing,"" he said yesterday of the drubbing he took from the Legislature.\Wednesday, Perpich hinted that he might run for another term if he didn't get what he wanted from the 1988 Legislature. Yesterday, he indicated that comment might have been a strategy to achieve his legislative goals.\""In this business you put all the pressures you can, and do everything. It's all a part of this process, trying to get the best you can out of that legislative process,"" he said.\The governor said, ""My objectives haven't changed. Certain things have to be accomplished.""\He said he pushed the programs he did because he considered them necessary to assure the state a good environment and a good economy.\He's gone a long way toward achieving his long-term agenda, Perpich said. He said that includes:\# Getting Minnesota out of the top-10 lists in personal and corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, unemployment and workers' compensation costs, and commercial and industrial property taxes. ""We're getting there, very close to it,"" he said.\# Making Minnesota a ""brainpower state,"" not only in the schools but in spending priority and in cultural environment. ""We have come a long way in that area,"" the governor said. ""I think you also have to give them the tools that are necessary (for) . . . a good educational system.""\# Promoting applied research and research-related industries to make Minnesota a ""one-economy state"" again.\The governor has referred to Minnesota as a two-economy state or even a three-economy state, with economically depressed farm and mineral areas, high unemployment in the center cities, and a booming economy in the rest of the Twin Cities area.\Perpich said he intends to concentrate on problems of the inner cities in preparing his 1989 legislative agenda.\Asked if all that means he might run for another term, Perpich said, ""Time will only tell.

104,"As Democrats take over the Houses in both Washington and Minnesota, with Republicans controlling both Senates, what should they do about fixing climate change, for which there is a national clamor, given the resolute opposition of the Republican Party top to bottom to engage with the issue?\Here are two suggestions:\On the federal level, where President Donald Trump's hostility to positive climate action is breathtaking, there may be a magic bullet. For years, the nonpartisan Citizens' Climate Lobby has proposed a three-part strategy to address the climate crisis: a fee on the carbon pollution content of products; that fee rebated 100 percent to American families; and a border adjustment, aka a tariff, requiring similar carbon fees in other countries. The first two steps will not happen, or even be discussed, in the coal-fired Mitch McConnell-led Senate and the Russian-oil-inspired Trump White House. But the border adjustment just might sell.\First, the ugly background. The industrialized West inadvertently made a very bad deal in the free-trade era, essentially offshoring our pollution to unregulated developing countries. China is desperately trying to undo that catastrophic legacy now, and it will succeed, but the ecological wreckage is epic, just as it was in America after the rapid industrialization of World War II left coal ash and toxins falling like dark rain over America's cities. We fixed that beginning in the 1960s with increasingly effective and detailed regulations, including slowly cleaning up so-called Superfund sites that remain a legacy of that rapid Wild West industrialization.\Today, Trump ""loves"" tariffs. The problem is the random nature of his tariff blunderbuss. The better solution is a universal tariff at the U.S. border on products produced without pollution protections commensurate to those within the border. This would have the effect of quietly forcing other countries to clean up their environmental acts, as we did ours, if they want to sell to us. Then, when Trump and McConnell retire and the Senate passes a carbon fee and dividend, adding carbon to that tariff will reduce global carbon pollution without firing a shot.\As the world's largest market, the U.S. can control the environmental destiny of other countries while protecting our farmers and industries who have invested heavily in pollution control. Who can argue with that?\On the state level, now is the perfect time to increase the gas tax, with the current price per gallon remarkably low. Gov. Tim Walz's proposed 25-cent tax would take the current price of around $2.10 per gallon to $2.35, still a relative bargain.\The key is what to do with the money. It was notable how well-received has been the demonstration proposal in the federal farm bill to assist farmers toward practices that increase soil health. Why not spread that program around the state like fertilizer with a healthy chunk of that gas-tax money? Farmers well understand that better soils increase yields, retain moisture and lower fossil-fuel inputs. Meanwhile, the climate benefits as more carbon is stored in the soils.\Although no policy no matter how sensible will be easy with divided legislatures in Washington and St. Paul, these two steps fit the agendas of rural and urban constituencies alike. Walz clearly cares about both. No one knows what Trump cares about, but let's find out.\James P.

105,"The three DFL candidates for U.S. Senate who want to oust GOP incumbent Norm Coleman participated in their initial debate Friday night, providing a first, brief glimpse at how they might seek to differentiate themselves. \Trial lawyer Mike Ciresi, who led the state's fight against Big Tobacco, hammered on the theme of leadership, saying that for 35 years he's been fighting for Minnesotans through his legal work. \""What you want is leadership,"" Ciresi said. ""I want to go to Washington to shake things up."" \Al Franken, a comedian and author known for playing the self-esteem challenged Stuart Smalley on ""Saturday Night Live,"" took aim at Coleman himself, attacking what he said was the senator's allegiance to the divisive politics of the Bush administration. \""Minnesotans want change,"" Franken said. \Franken talked of his 3,000 volunteers and endorsements from labor. ""What we need to win is a grassroots, people-powered campaign."" \Jim Cohen, a longtime environmental activist and the least known of the three, said he's the best choice to oppose Coleman because of a long-term commitment to public service, the environment and his ability to bridge the ideological divide. \""What is really required is someone who has been fighting on these issues for average people for years and years,"" Cohen said. \. \Discussed a mix of issues \The three men took to the couch on Twin Cities Public Television's weekly public affairs show ""Almanac"" for only 22 minutes in a relatively relaxed chat session, moderated by hosts Eric Eskola and Cathy Wurzer. \The debate touched on style, a gas tax increase, withdrawal from Iraq, gay marriage and the environment, but didn't reveal any striking policy differences. \Eskola asked Ciresi and Franken to answer their critics. The former has battled the notion that he's a ""money-grubbing trial lawyer"" and the latter has been called ""divisive and mean-spirited."" \Ciresi said, ""When you're a leader, people take shots at you."" He went on to say that his Minneapolis-based law firm, Robins, Kaplan, Miller and Ciresi has put more than $20 million into the state through charitable giving. \""I've been getting results for Minnesotans and middle-class Minnesotans for over 20 years,"" he said. \Franken said, ""I've been writing about the right-wing scare machine for years, and they don't like me."" \Franken said that as a senator, he would work to ""bring folks together"" by fighting for universal health care and education. ""We actually had the world behind us on 9/12,"" Franken said, adding that Bush squandered that goodwill. \When the Franken criticism came up, Ciresi interjected, ""I like Al."" \. \No name-calling \Although the candidates each sought to score, the general tone was pleasant. \Ciresi said that ""name-calling has no place in politics"" and that he wants to focus on health care, education and the environment. ""I'm not going to call Norm Coleman names; I will attack his policies,"" Ciresi said. \On the question of whether to raise the gas tax a nickel over each of the next three years, Franken said he would ""keep it on the table."" Cohen said it makes sense to pay now and save later. \Ciresi said the gas tax is one way to finance infrastructure improvements. ""Policy has consequences,"" he said. ""We're living off our grandparents' investment."" \All three now oppose the war in Iraq. Cohen said he wants all the troops out by April 2008. Ciresi said he wants them out by May 31. \Franken said he initially felt torn leading up to the war. ""I really didn't believe that an administration would mislead us into the war. When that became clear, I became a very vocal critic against it,"" he said. \On gay marriage, only Franken said an outright yes to legalization. \Cohen said he favors civil unions. Ciresi said he favors civil unions and doesn't want to ""impose on religions they have to marry gay people."" \On global warming, Ciresi said there are all kinds of ways to fight it, and his firm had just purchased wind energy. He suggested investing in new technology. \Cohen called for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent over the next 30 to 40 years by using more renewable fuels rather than oil and gas. \Franken cited former Vice President Al Gore who has said there isn't a silver bullet to end global warming, but there is silver buckshot. ""It's wind,"" Franken said. ""This is a windy state."" \. \Rochelle Olson - 612-673-1747"
106,"On Friday, one day after it was announced the state could expect a $2.3 billion budget surplus, a House subcommittee voted to raise the gas tax by a nickel a gallon.\It was the first movement this year of any bill aimed at funding transit and highway operations in Minnesota, and it raised the larger question of whether taxes - any taxes - can be increased during a time of unprecedented public prosperity.\""It's virtually, politically impossible to increase any taxes at a time when there's a surplus that exceeds $2 billion,"" said Sen. Doug Johnson, DFL-Tower, chairman of the Senate Tax Committee. ""That would take almost a magical act.""\While the state luxuriates on the softest of financial cushions, the gas tax would cost motorists an additional $138 million a year. There also are proposals to increase the cigarette tax by a dime per pack - $34 million annually to build a baseball stadium for the Twins and proposals to increase state park admission stickers and fishing licenses, all of which have the blessing of Gov. Arne Carlson.\The House Transportation Finance subcommittee approved the complex gas tax bill, sending it to the full House Transportation and Transit Committee.\The increase is tied to a proposed constitutional amendment regarding transit and highway funding and would not take effect unless voters approved it next year.\Before the vote, Rep. William Kuisle, R-Rochester, noted the dilemma, saying he hesitated to vote for the tax increase, ""especially when there's a $2 billion surplus.""\Gas tax earmarked\The gas tax, of course, is dedicated by the constitution to highway purposes. It is the pot of money that builds roads and highways and fills potholes. Highway interests contend there is an increasing need for additional money to maintain the aging system of roads, highways and to reconstruct bridges.\The $2.3 billion surplus expected over the next two fiscal years is in the general fund, another pot of money for schools, higher education, welfare and other operations.\That is a distinction lost on many voters, Johnson said.\Carlson, who announced the $2.3 billion surplus Thursday with great fanfare, even a cake, is willing to test the distinction.\The governor will accept a gas tax increase provided it has bipartisan support and doesn't put Minnesota out of line with neighboring states, Bill Schreiber, a Department of Transportation lobbyist and former state legislator, told the subcommittee Friday.\Carlson also has endorsed the dime-a-pack cigarette tax. Nine cents would go to build a $300 million stadium. The remaining penny would go to antismoking programs.\But some legislators, including Johnson, are doubtful the gas or cigarette tax can be increased, given the size of the surplus.\""All the talk is about cutting taxes, not raising taxes,"" Johnson said.\Eyeing the surplus\Sen. Carol Flynn, DFL-Minneapolis, chairwoman of the Senate Transportation Committee, said the way to provide more money for transportation and get around the taxing dilemma might be to shift some costs now borne by the gas tax and annual license fees to the general fund with its anticipated abundance.\The general fund surplus, she suggested, could be used to pay for State Patrol operations, now funded by the trunk highway fund, the pot filled by the gas tax and license fees. That would free up about $40 million a year.\Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson of Willmar, usually the loudest Republican voice for a gas tax increase, said the Legislature should consider tapping the surplus for a one-time transfer of $100 million to supplement the gas tax fund for roads and transit.\Rep. Bernie Lieder, DFL-Crookston, chairman of the subcommittee that passed the gas tax increase Friday, acknowledged that getting a transportation funding package passed that includes a tax increase will be difficult.\Sen. Steve Morse, DFL-Dakota, chairman of the Environment and Agriculture Budget subcommittee, said he would like to use some of the surplus for park and game and fish projects.\The governor's budget would raise the annual state park fee to $23, up from $20. ""We just raised it last year from $18,"" Morse said.\Adult fishing licenses would go to $16, from $13, under the governor's plan, he said.\Rather than increase fees, Morse said, administrative costs now borne by game and fish licenses could be switched to the the surplus-bulging general fund.\""I think the general fund could do more,"" he said."
107,"Gov. Mark Dayton on Thursday created a task force to find new revenue to close a yawning gap in funding for roads and transit.\Dayton said he wants the panel to ""look all over the country and ... all over the world"" for big ideas.\""I'm not interested in nickel-and- dime modifications to our status quo because our status quo is getting worse,"" he said.\The panel will come up with ideas that can be considered in the 2013 legislative session.\The Minnesota Department of Transportation has been studying a tax on miles driven by motorists. But at a news conference at Dayton's announcement, MnDOT Commissioner Tom Sorel said more study is needed before determining whether it would be fair and worth doing.\""People want fairness on the way they're taxed on their roadway system,"" Sorel said. ""There's a debate whether that's a fair way or not.""\New sources of revenue are being considered because the gasoline tax is expected to provide a declining share of transportation funding as vehicles become more efficient in their use of fossil fuels or switch to alternatives like electricity.\Dayton said the task force study was inspired by his travels around the state and ""experiencing the deterioration of Minnesota's highway system.""\He noted that forecasts have shown state transportation funding falling behind by as much as $50 billion over the next 20 years.\""Minnesota has chosen by default and without really much public debate a path of declining transportation investments and therefore declining ... quality,"" Dayton said.\The governor said Minnesota has fallen behind other states in transportation and that the task force would report on the costs of maintaining the current transportation system or improving it.\Transportation funding has been a contentious issue in the Legislature over the years, with DFLers and Republicans quarreling over increases in the gasoline tax.\But one GOP legislator involved in transportation issues offered a cautious endorsement of the task force plan.\""I'm encouraged by it,"" said Sen. Joe Gimse, R-Willmar, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. ""We have talked with MnDOT for quite a while about innovative finance. We'll see if they come up with something.""\Gimse said he'd want to take a close look at a miles-based tax, which could add to costs for rural motorists who drive long distances.\Sorel said early returns on the MnDOT study on the miles tax shows the technology exists for the state to keep track of miles driven.\Last month the agency said preliminary findings of an earlier task force concluded that a miles tax is largely unfamiliar to the public and policymakers and many questions remain unanswered. Full-scale implementation of a miles tax was not recommended until concerns are satisfactorily addressed.\The earlier task force concluded that mileage fees should be sufficient to fund adequate roadway transportation, and the funds should be dedicated to that use.\Miles tax rates should reflect the cost and benefit that different vehicles and motorists have on the roadway transportation system and the environment. Fee levels should take into account other fees on road users.\Any miles-based fee should be designed in a way that protects user privacy, the earlier task force said. Some critics of the system worry that the tracking devices could allow government to interfere with the privacy of drivers.\Pat Doyle - 612-673-4504\Credit: PAT DOYLE; STAFF WRITER"
108," A move to cut the portion of state gasoline taxes devoted to off- road trails and obstacle courses got bogged down in a Senate committee Friday.\ Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, contended that up to $2 million in gasoline taxes collected from all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and four- wheel-drive-truck owners should be redirected to highway accounts because few of the recreationists use the facilities paid for with those funds.\ ""Do Minnesotans who are dodging potholes and sitting in traffic congestion really want nearly $900,000 of gas tax money diverted to pay for 4-by-4-truck playgrounds that erode land and damage our forests?"" Marty asked.\ The answer from Chairman Marty's own Environment and Natural Resources Committee was a resounding yes. The panel, dominated by northern DFLers and exurban Republicans, defeated his bill, SF 3462, on a lopsided voice vote, probably killing it for this session.\ At stake, in addition to $870,000 a year for 4-by-4 courses, is an increase in ATV trail annual funds from $800,000 to $1.4 million recommended by Gov. Tim Pawlenty. By Marty's calculations - based on figures that only 6 percent of 4-by-4 owners use publicly funded obstacle courses and that 15 percent of ATV riding is done on public trails - both diversions from highway accounts should total no more than $260,000 a year.\ Some critics complained that Marty's move could lead to similar assaults on gasoline tax accounts for snowmobilers and boaters. Sen. Michael Jungbauer, R-East Bethel, said the bill is based on ""an extremely flawed theory.""\ He added: ""I have two ATVs in my garage that I can't ride in my city, because it's against the law. We're waiting for trails to ride on. We don't use trails because they're not available."""
109," Jim Oberstar wants a partner. The new chairman of the House Transportation Committee (a title that makes Oberstar the nation's most powerful figure when it comes to planes, trains and automobiles) wants badly to give his home state the full benefit of his influence - and the ample federal dollars that flow with it - if only Minnesota will clasp his hand.\ But it will not. At least not so far. Gov. Tim Pawlenty has made plain his disinterest in putting up the money needed to leverage federal dollars to begin solving Minnesota's long-brewing transportation crisis. Why? Because, as Oberstar pointed out to an overflow crowd at a joint transportation committee session in St. Paul last week, it would require raising the state's user fee on gasoline, a user fee that the governor prefers to spell ""t-a-x."" Thus, the discussion is ended and the partnership precluded.\ Other states will be happy to take Minnesota's money, Oberstar said. Forty-five of them have raised their gasoline taxes since Minnesota last raised its in 1988, and many have committed local matches for building transit systems, making them more reliable partners than Minnesota. It's a point that business should especially understand: A partner who won't ante up isn't much of a partner. Asked if he had a message for the governor, Oberstar paused, then said politely: ""Face up to the reality.""\ Indeed, Pawlenty's reluctance makes him look out-of-date considering the investments other Republican governors have made on several fronts in recent years. His no-new-taxes song has fallen to golden oldie status as attention shifts to the obvious need for basic investment, in this case, in transportation. Drive through almost any state and you'll ride on better roads. Visit any comparable metro area and you'll find a better and rapidly expanding transit system. Minnesota looks threadbare. It has been slow to grasp the economic peril of falling behind competitors, slow to feel the tragedy of unsafe rural roads, and slow to understand that the right kind of transportation investments are essential to meeting the challenges of climate change and energy independence. This is not just about metro traffic congestion.\ On power plants, Pawlenty's shift toward renewable energy is laudable. But on transportation, he keeps pushing the problem to the future with more borrowing and more dreamy talk of a ""mileage tax,"" all the while reciting the old line about people not wanting a gas tax hike. Well, no one wants a gas tax hike except when it's clear that that's the only way to get better roads. And now, thanks to Oberstar, it should be crystal clear. ""Minnesota must step up,"" he said.\ Raising the gas tax a nickel would yield $160 million a year and, with the federal match, leverage a total of $806 million more for highways. Applying an additional, similar-sized sales tax to gasoline would solve the transit problem. Asked about the declining value of the gas tax as drivers shift to more efficient cars, Oberstar offered the most sensible solution: raise the tax. Indeed, the best mileage tax is the gas tax because it encourages conservation, helps the environment, reduces foreign oil dependency and lays the foundation for a sustainable transportation system.\ The Senate has the votes to override Pawlenty's promised veto of a meaningful transportation bill. House members of both parties must now find the courage to do likewise.\ .\ IT'S UP TO US\ ""We can make Minnesota a transportation-friendly state. We just have to step up to make the decisions. Using the highway user fee is the proven, most effective way to do it.""\ Rep. Jim Oberstar, urging the Minnesota Legislature to raise the state's gas tax."
110,"Six months after the Interstate 35W bridge collapse, state legislators are headed for a political showdown starting Thursday that will determine whether Minnesota makes a major shift in transportation funding, including the first gasoline tax hike in 20 years. \DFL architects of a $7.8 billion plan that includes tax increases to fund transit, roads and bridges are exhibiting a renewed swagger regarding their chances, but also apprehension that success may again elude them. On Monday, the bill's authors dropped a divisive component known as indexing - which would tie the gas tax to inflation increases - to try to gain enough Republican votes to override a likely governor's veto. \GOP leaders, meanwhile, said the bill was politically doomed, and Gov. Tim Pawlenty said DFLers were trying to sidestep him because they ""believe I'm irrelevant to the discussion."" \Whatever the outcome, the drama has the potential to shape the three-month legislative session. DFLers, who control both Houses but probably will need Republican votes to adopt the bill, warn that there will only be one chance to pass the bill when floor debate starts Thursday in both the House and Senate. \Former DFL House Speaker Robert Vanasek, who presided when Minnesota passed its last gas tax increase in the late 1980s, predicts that not nearly enough Republicans will oppose the plan to keep it from ultimately passing. Vanasek, now a lobbyist, warned, however, that should the bill fail, that ""kind of poisons the whole rest of the session."" \. \What the bill does \As it now stands, the transportation plan would raise the gas tax by 5 cents a gallon by mid-September and add as much as another 3.5 cents until the costs of issuing bonds for transportation projects are paid. \In another key provision, license tab fees on many cars and trucks, particularly luxury vehicles, would increase. \The proposal also would levy a half-cent sales tax in the seven-county Twin Cities metro area, with most of the money going toward transit, roads and bridges. The move would not require a referendum. Counties outside the immediate metro area could also join in levying the tax, but they could later opt out. \The metro sales tax would be apart from a proposed three-eights-cent increase in the state sales tax to fund outdoors, the environment and the arts. That proposal will be put before voters in November. \""Who's keeping track of [all] the sales tax, sales tax, sales tax, sales tax increases?"" asked House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall. \One indication of the DFL's renewed confidence came last week, when Senate Transportation Chairman Steve Murphy was asked about the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce's balking at the size of the plan's half-cent metro sales tax hike. The chamber, one of the state's most influential business organizations, has indicated it would be agreeable to a smaller levy. \""They're Johnny-come-latelys,"" said Murphy, DFL-Red Wing. ""They've protected the governor on this a long, long time."" \. \Overplayed their hand? \Rep. Dean Simpson, R-Perham, an assistant House minority leader, said the confrontation will show that the DFL has overplayed its hand. ""It's destined for a veto, [and then] I think it's destined to die a very non-pretty death"" by failing to gain enough votes for an override. \With or without the backing of some of the biggest lobbying groups - and with or without Pawlenty - House and Senate DFLers and their supporters believe a major overhaul of transportation spending is at hand. \And though the 35W bridge collapse is rarely mentioned, it looms over the discussions as proponents try to convince legislators that the timing is right after years of impasse. \Supporters said the transportation plan would create 33,000 jobs a year - a figure Republicans say is inflated - and issue enough bonds to provide $600 million in the first two years to repair or replace the state's worst bridges. \The proposal also would provide money to hire 40 state troopers, give $18.1 million to the Minnesota Department of Transportation to fix its headquarters and stop requiring Hennepin County to help pay the operating costs of the Hiawatha Corridor, the state's first light rail line. \Privately, some lobbyists say that DFLers have packed the proposal with too many wish-list items. But others point to the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which said it will support a quarter-cent hike to the metro sales tax, as an example of how some of Minnesota's more conservative institutions now recognize the need for a big step regarding transportation spending. \""We do need to make some progress on transportation,"" said Erin Sexton, the group's director of transportation policy. A chamber report acknowledges that ""growing congestion in the Twin Cities"" and the ""declining transportation system"" is hurting business. \. \Momentum may swing \Despite Pawlenty's opposition, DFLers and even some Republicans said momentum at the Capitol may be swinging the other way, even as polls show voters resistant to tax increases. ""We know the governor's put himself in a box,"" said Sen. Tarryl Clark, DFL-St. Cloud, the assistant majority leader, who said DFLers have requested to talk to Pawlenty before the floor votes. \Rep. Ron Erhardt, R-Edina, said House Republicans will be divided between remaining loyal to Republican leaders and answering voters, who want more money for transportation. ""I'm sure there are people - legislators - that are under great pressure from their communities,"" he said. ""Does the governor win, or do the constituents win?"" \. \Override may be a win-win \One scenario that may be gaining credence, he said, is a situation where the Legislature would override a governor's veto of the transportation bill, allowing Pawlenty to keep his no-new-taxes pledge and yet have transportation funding increase. ""Everybody gets what they want,"" he said. \""We need a billion [dollars] a year, so it's not outlandish,"" he said of the DFL transportation bill. \. \mkaszuba@startribune.com and kduchschere@startribune.com"
111,"Gov. Mark Dayton and Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, in their first public appearance since a major blowup over commissioner salaries, smiled broadly and threw arms around each other in a show of unity Thursday as they advocated for a transportation package that would raise gas taxes to pay for roads, bridges and transit. ""I want to hire him,"" Dayton said of Bakk. ""Let's get a photo op for all of you,"" said Bakk, wrapping his significant paw around Dayton's shoulder as the two normally stone-faced men smiled while cameras rat-tat-tatted. Dayton and Bakk have long been the best of frenemies, joined by political necessity but often divided in outlook and temperament. The DFL veterans come from different wings of the party -- Dayton a wealthy metro progressive, Bakk an Iron Range union stalwart -- and despite some shared policy goals this legislative session, their differences exploded into public view in a fracas last month over steep pay raises that Dayton gave to his commissioners. Thursday's joint appearance was designed to signal a united front against House Republicans, who have said they will not consider the wholesale gas tax increase that underpins Dayton's multiyear proposal to rebuild roads and bridges statewide. But beneath the show of comity, all signs point to more division between Bakk and Dayton in the weeks leading up to mid-May's adjournment. During that time, the two men will need to find a way to cut a deal with House Republicans on the state's two-year budget, a $1.9 billion projected surplus, transportation funding, education and other divisive issues. On several key items, Dayton and Bakk stand on opposite sides of a chasm, often involving one of them protecting the prerogatives of his respective branch of government. Bakk said Monday that he supports the idea of a ""Legislative Budget Office"" that would provide an alternative to the cost estimates of proposed legislation, currently produced by Dayton's Minnesota Management and Budget. This seemingly arcane proposal would give legislators, including Bakk, more sovereignty in the face of this and any future governor's powerful budget office. Dayton bristled earlier this week, calling the proposal ""duplicative"" and ""unproductive"" and an attack on state workers. ""To impugn the integrity of these individuals, I think, is very, very unfair and totally unwarranted,"" he said. Bakk also recently said he expects the Senate to pass a bill he supports to bar the sale of lottery tickets from ATMs, gas pumps and Internet sites. Dayton vetoed a similar bill last year, but legislators contend that the State Lottery overstepped its bounds with these new sales. Dayton has promised another veto and says the legislation is a gift to gambling interests that view the lottery as a competitor and who write big checks to political campaigns. Finally, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing bills that would weaken Dayton's agencies and give the Legislature more say in regulation, which could be especially important in environmental issues such as wild rice sulfate standards and other water quality rules. Bakk is known to keep his views private to strengthen his negotiating hand, so it's not clear whether he would support these measures, but his Range and other rural DFL allies are supportive. Bakk is not close to the state's environmental movement, having previously supported a repeal of the cap on carbon emissions, among other things. Dayton, meanwhile, vetoed a 2012 bill that would have inserted the Legislature more directly into the regulatory process, and another showdown seems likely on this front. On Thursday, however, Dayton and Bakk looked happy to stand against House Speaker Kurt Daudt, R-Crown -- at least on the transportation issue. Dayton and Bakk said a viable plan requires new, dedicated revenue. Bakk said he would not allow a dime of the general fund surplus to be used for transportation because of the risk of a recession that could reduce revenue, forcing transportation to compete with education and other priorities in leaner budget times. Daudt released a statement after the Dayton-Bakk event, saying Democrats had ""doubled down on their unpopular plan to raise the gas tax and take more money out of the pockets of hardworking Minnesotans.""

112," Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who relishes his role as business advocate, opened his speech at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce's annual legislative dinner Wednesday night with an acknowledgement that he and the chamber have been politely at odds for a while over whether to raise the state gasoline tax.\ But other than that initiative, Pawlenty challenged the notion that he's estranged from business, and he asked anyone in the crowd of 1,500 at the Minneapolis Hilton to ""stand up if you'd like your taxes raised."" He got a hearty roar of laughter, only a few standers - and lots of applause through the rest of his speech.\ Nevertheless, there's been a bit more tension than usual, entering yet another money-starved legislative session, between Pawlenty and at least some business leaders, including the chamber, by far the state's largest, most diverse and arguably most powerful business association.\ Republican governors are accustomed to fighting off spending demands from teachers unions and social-service providers.\ But Pawlenty finds his hands full this year dealing with an assortment of business pressure for more spending, which can lead to more taxing.\ For almost two years, his unyielding resolve to not raise taxes has put him at odds with one of the chamber's top priorities: a commitment to ""long-term funding"" for transportation, and specifically, a 5-cents-per-gallon increase in the gas tax.\ On other fronts, established associations such as the chamber have been joined by ad hoc business groups in calling for dramatic increases in investment - a term used often by DFLers in lieu of ""government spending"" - in transportation, early childhood care, and even environmental protection.\ One of these new coalitions is the Itasca Group, which called for a whopping increase of $750 million per year in transportation funding over 15 years, although the group did not specify how that revenue should be raised.\ A new group called Clean Water Legacy, to which the chamber also belongs, was formed to push for a major spending increase to clean up Minnesota's ""impaired waters."" It has called for $80 million a year to improve federally designated contaminated lakes and rivers, and it proposes to finance it with a $36-per-year added charge on property taxes or water bills for most property owners.\ These business demands for spending have not been missed by DFLers. Senate Majority Leader Dean Johnson, who also participated in a forum at the dinner, said that business leaders' demands are reasonable but that Pawlenty ""with his no-new-taxes bumper sticker has backed himself in a corner and removed his ability to manage. ...You need flexibility and every CEO in the room knows that.""\ Pawlenty's press secretary, Brian McClung, said DFLers like Johnson are being disingenuous and have yet to come forward with specific tax-increase proposals. ""What's interesting is that there seems to be a consensus even among DFLers that we have enough revenue in the system,"" he said.\ But he acknowledged that ""there seems to be some kind of disconnect,"" even among business groups, in demands for more public services while resisting taxes.\ Many business leaders see no serious gulf developing between business and Pawlenty's decidedly conservative fiscal policy - which has drawn criticism from at least three previous Republican governors.\ ""This governor's priorities mirror those of the business community, on everything from the challenges of globalization to the bioscience initiatives,"" said Charlie Weaver, executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership, composed of the state's 100 largest businesses. Weaver, a former chief of staff for Pawlenty, says Pawlenty ""articulates better than any governor why Minnesota needs to remain competitive.""\ .\ Raising the gas tax\ David Olson, the chamber's president, agrees that there is no widening rift. On a host of issues, ranging from the need for reduced regulation to opposition to general tax increases, they are united.\ In fact, in recognition of Pawlenty's firmness against signing a bill that directly raises state taxes, the chamber backed off a short-lived proposal for raising the gas tax by 10 cents. And the chamber recently modified its gas-tax plan further, calling for a constitutional amendment giving voters the choice on a gas tax and detailing specific projects. Pawlenty has said he would approve of that route, which would bypass his office.\ At the same time, Olson said 2,600 chamber members are dead serious about their needs on transportation and the environment. And he acknowledged that he can't recall that former Republican Gov. Arne Carlson ever disagreed with the chamber on one of its top priorities.\ ""Congestion is absolutely driving our folks nuts,"" Olson said. ""They've done the math, what it costs to have their trucks sit in traffic and the tax costs them."" And unless the state addresses the water pollution problem, federal mandates will severely restrict business expansion in large areas of the state, he added.\ Pawlenty jokingly referred to his differences with the chamber in describing a meeting with Olson. Pawlenty said he made the point at the time that gas prices were a few cents away from $2 a gallon and he asked Olson whether he wanted to be known forever as ""Two Buck Dave.""\ .\ Dane Smith is at rdsmith@startribune.com."
113,"Sen. Bob Lessard, DFL-International Falls, chairs the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee. A 20-year veteran of the Senate, Lessard has been a powerful ally of hunters and anglers, and often has worked cooperatively with the Department of Natural Resources to further conservation legislation.\But recently, Lessard and other key legislators have squared off with the DNR on whether to feed deer, whether to increase hunting and fishing license fees and whether to pass a constitutional amendment to guarantee Minnesotans the right to hunt and fish.\In the interview below with Dennis Anderson, Lessard says he is ""fed up"" with the DNR and ""considers them the enemy."" He also says the DNR's effort to increase hunting and fishing license fees has no chance of passing this session.\And, says Lessard, the DNR will feed deer this winter.\Q: Why are you so adamantly in favor of deer feeding?\A: Why shouldn't I be, if the vast majority of deer hunters support paying for it themselves? More importantly, why is the DNR going to such extraordinary lengths to oppose it?\I've heard all the arguments about why we shouldn't feed, including that deer feeding will take money away from habitat development, and other, more important management efforts. The fact of the matter is, as far as deer hunting is concerned, there's more habitat done by loggers and corn growers accidentally than the DNR could ever do, or ever will attempt to do.\Q: But you concede that DNR employees who will feed deer if a bill passes the Legislature would otherwise be doing something with their time. That something, whatever it is, must have some value.\A: OK, let's say the DNR is right on deer feeding, or even half-right - though we say they're wrong. Our argument is this: What is wrong, as a hunter who wants to participate in nature in a broad sense, of going into the woods or the fields in winter and trying to be part of something productive?\Look at the bigger picture. When you try to sell the value of hunting and fishing to people, particularly young people, you're not talking only about hunting the animals. You're also talking about being part of nature, of seeing the birds, listening to loons, and so forth. Here, then, is a chance for deer hunters to go out in middle of winter, in deep snow, and be part of the bigger picture.\If hunters and others are willing to do this, and they are, it is, again, beyond my comprehension that the DNR has gone to the wall on this one.\Let me also say that regardless of what the Star Tribune's editorial writers apparently believe, it would be a public relations disaster not to do anything for deer this winter. They're in that much trouble.\Q: How do you rate the chances a deer feeding bill will pass the Legislature?\A: We should have the bill on the Senate floor next week, and it will pass. Who knows what the House is going to do. But obviously we have to fast-track it. The big snowfall month - March - is yet to come.\Q: You've been testy this session with DNR officials who have appeared before your committee. Why?\A: I'm fed up with them. It's everything we do with them. And by the way, it's not just coming from me. They have built a climate of animosity against them, in the Legislature and throughout the state. In my 20 years in the Senate, I've never seen so much animosity. And that's a fact. It was never this way under former DNR Commissioner Joe Alexander.\Q: Is there anyone in the upper echelon of the DNR whom you like or respect? Given the exchanges you've have had with some of the department's leaders recently, it would almost seem not.\A: Not very many. Some people up there I used to work with closely. When Steve Thorne and Joe Alexander were there, we would have our differences, but we would sit down in advance of the session and discuss funding and how we can do things.\Now, it's hopeless. I don't even deal with them anymore. I never thought I would ever say this, but I perceive them as the enemy. They're not the same group. Instead of coming to us and seeking our help, they come in and tell us what they're going to do. They should come in and say, ""Bob, we want a license increase, what can we do?"" Instead, they come in and say, ""We want a license increase, this is what we're going to do.""\There's a big difference between the two. And the public won't accept it. As one manifestation of that, the DNR has no more chance to pass a license increase this session than I do of becoming head of the Sierra Club.\Q: But there hasn't been a license increase since 1991.\A: The sportsmen and {sports}women of this state are not averse to raising hunting and fishing license fees if they know where the money is going. But until we convince these user groups that we have a handle on where the money is going, and that they have a say on where new money goes, it's politically impossible to increase hunting and fishing license costs.\Q: You're saying the game and fish fund is sufficiently funded to carry out the DNR's programs?\A: Regarding the game and fish fund, the state has to make a determination if something it wants to do to improve the environment benefits hunting and fishing primarily - or the environment in general. If it's the environment in general, it should be funded as good public policy out of the general fund. If it is for fishing and hunting primarily, it should come out of the game and fish fund.\That's why we're using our fiscal analysts and researchers, together with the input of user groups, to get a handle on what should be funded by the game and fish fund. Everything else should be funded by the ordinary legislative process.\Q: But the DNR is already moving toward ""ecosystem management,"" which, by its nature, requires a blending of funding sources. As you know, ecosystem management requires that broad landscapes be managed for their general health, and that of species that inhabit these landscapes. This is different than the DNR's traditional species-by-species management.\A: If the DNR wants ecosystem management, it shouldn't be at the expense of the game and fish fund.\Which brings up another issue. As a state, which direction are we going to go? When various species come into conflict, which direction do we take? The perception among hunters and anglers is that their interests increasingly are secondary to the so-called long-term goals of ecosystem management.\Q: Is there a chance that license-fee increases will be passed this session?\A: No. And if you ask me right now, I'd say I wouldn't give a bill asking for increases a hearing in my committee.\Q: The question then becomes: Can you make the DNR better by starving it to death?\A: No. But the DNR has to start representing who they represent.\Q: Who, in your opinion, is at fault at the DNR for these perceived errors, commissioner Rod Sando?\A: I think it does start at the top. And some guys under Sando are not the same people they used to be. Disagree with them, and it makes no difference. They work around you.\Q: About 34 positions have gone unfilled in DNR wildlife and fisheries in recent years due to a lack of funds. Are you saying these positions should remain unfilled?\A: Well, we believe the DNR should look at its St. Paul headquarters. We think they have too many people there.\Q: So the DNR's structure is in need of fixing?\a: Yes.\Q: And the people at the top, in your opinion, are ineffective.\A: Yes, these things together are why I believe we have to go back to the drawing board. I'm optimistic that things can improve. But maybe they have to get worse before they can get better. I know this: changes have to be made. The DNR has to get back to what it used to be, when they would work with us.\The DNR's image is so bad right now, even when the agency is correct on an issue, they can't get support, not in the Legislature, anyway.\Q: Who's going to fix the problem?\A: I don't think it can be repaired in the time we have left in the race for the next governor. The lines have been drawn in the sand.\Q: You do admit, though, that it is great politics to bash the DNR in this state. No legislator has lost favor doing it.\A: That may be true. But if you're saying Bob Lessard has a vendetta against the DNR, that's not true. I don't think there's been anyone in this Legislature more devoted to hunting and fishing.\But I saw last session that there was no hope for the agency. When they fought the constitutional right to hunt and fish - a bill that passed the Senate with 52 votes! - I came to the conclusion there was no hope. It is not the DNR I used to know.\Q: Aside from deer feeding, what are your primary legislative goals for the session?\A: My primary goal this session, as it was last session, is to pass the constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to hunt and fish. It's another thing the DNR is opposing, and further evidence, I believe - and I think the public is increasingly agreeing with me - that the DNR is not the DNR we used to know.\Q: Last year the right-to-hunt-and-fish bill died in the House. Will it pass the Senate again?\A: Yes. But again, I'm unsure what will happen in the House. I will say, however, that we've got some aces in the hole this year. There's some other legislation around this place that is very important to some people. There are some major policy decisions regarding the environment that some people want to address this year. And they will need to get a hearing in my committee.\For that to happen, I'm going to need some help on the constitutional amendment. This is very important to me, and is the reason I ran for re-election this past year.\It's important that hunters and anglers know that, as we get closer to the years 2010 and beyond, with the demographics of the state shifting to more and more urban - with more and more single-parent families - you're going to find that even though in this state we will have a large percentage of people who hunt and fish, when you look at the legislative makeup of the Senate and House in the future, we will not have the clout to protect these interests, and those of wildlife.\That's why it's so important to me personally to have the constitutional right to hunt and fish in place before these significant demographic changes come. That way, people who don't have the interests of sportsmen and sportswomen in mind, and the interests of wildlife, will have to change the constitution to significantly alter these activities.\Q: Will a snowmobile trail funding package pass this session?\A: The package we want raises the fees on snowmobiles $5 a year, which raises about $1.2 million a year. And currently, the gas tax that goes into the snowmobile trails account is based on a snowmobile traveling 450 miles a year. We want to increase that to about 1,500 miles. That will raise almost $1 million.\But we will not support raising the snowmobile fees unless we get $1 million from the general revenue fund. We figure we contribute to the general revenue fund in the multi-, multi-millions of dollars in tax receipts. And all we're asking is $1 million back.\With the $3 million in funding, we could improve grooming of trails, add double trails for increased safety and in general improve the sport."
114,"Note: NORTH ONLY\Drop the gas tax, and make oil industry pay \I agree that we should drop the federal gas tax for the summer driving season. After all, on 20 gallons of gas, that will save us about $3.68 per week. \We should have big oil make up the difference and pay the gas tax to the highway trust fund.

Why was it pornography? I just read about a cult in Texas that married off 15-year-old girls to older men. I also read about a video game riddled with violence and sex that was the rage. People stood in line to buy it. Go to any beach and see women with little or nothing on. Go to a movie and watch sex being performed on the screen right before your eyes. \People make money on things that sell. Who is to blame? We are.

Other than work, there is no reason anyone that age needs to be driving after midnight. However, with respect to limiting the number of passengers, I do have a concern. Most of my daughter's friends carpool to school. With gas at almost $4 a gallon and already too many cars on the roads, it doesn't make sense to put even more teenage drivers on the road trying to get to school. \Carpooling is good for our environment, it saves money and it would eliminate the additional cars being driven by new drivers.

115,"Rep. Michele Bachmann's political foes should never underestimate her.\She is more than the congresswoman of social conservatives. More than a friend of the NRA. More than the woman who fawned, with a school-girl grin on her face, over a now-unpopular president shortly after she arrived in Washington as the rookie Republican representative from Minnesota's 6th Congressional District.\She can be a sharply focused, money-raising suburban populist, as she's been this year in campaigning throughout the sprawling district. She faces El Tinklenberg, a moderate DFLer, and Bob Anderson, the Independence Party primary winner even though Tinklenberg earlier won the party's endorsement.\""She can make your head spin,'' said Tinklenberg in talking about the difficulty of first pinning down and then debating Bachmann.\Suddenly, Democrats taking Tinklenberg seriously\But Tinklenberg has a few heads spinning, too. In recent months, the former Methodist minister, former mayor of Blaine and former transportation commissioner under Gov. Jesse Ventura suddenly is being taken seriously by his own party, which until recently had all but conceded the 6th to Bachmann.\When Tinklenberg announced that his campaign had raised $469,000 in the past three months -- almost double what it had raised in the first two quarters combined -- the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee finally took notice. It announced Tuesday that it was adding Tinklenberg to its Red to Blue program, a move that means the national party will come to Tinklenberg's aid with money and other resources.\""He has a chance to win,'' the DCCC said in announcing the party's support.\A chance to win. That's a substantial upgrade from what most thought up until only a few weeks ago.\He has a chance because the economy's in a mess, and though Bachman still has a loyal base of support among fundamentalist Christians and pro-lifers, she has managed to create hard feelings among many, including moderate Republicans in a district that runs from Stillwater to St. Cloud.\Bachmann's earmarks opposition hits home\Consider, for example, how Bachmann's opposition to congressional earmarks has played out in the 6th District.\In March, MnDOT closed the Highway 23 Desoto Bridge that crosses the Mississippi River in the heart of St. Cloud. Most members of Congress would have tried to bring federal money -- via an earmark -- to the rescue.\Bachmann is not like most members. As a matter of principle, she refused to reach for the earmark money, adding that Minnesotans could build the bridge.\In fact, in part because of the gas-tax increase, state money for the bridge is being used, without delaying other state highway projects.\But remember, that state money is available only because six Republicans in the Minnesota House last session supported a DFL override of Gov. Tim Pawlenty's veto of the gas-tax increase. Bachmann roasted those six Republicans, including six-term state Rep. Kathy Tingelstad, who is from Andover, a 6th District community.\Following her vote to override, Tingelstad attended her endorsing convention. She figured there'd be some anger, but she didn't think it would be stoked by a congresswoman.\""She (Bachmann) spoke for more than a half hour at that convention,'' recalled Tingelstad. ""She never used my name, but it was clear who she was talking about. She was personally recruiting conservatives to replace people she considered too moderate. It's very unusual for a member of the Congress to get involved in a state legislative race. It showed a lack of maturity on her part.''\Those at the convention delayed endorsing anyone. Tingelstad decided that she wasn't interested in begging for endorsement and announced that she would not seek a seventh term.\Tingelstad does not come right out and say she supports Tinklenberg in this race. But it's clear she has little regard for Bachmann.\Things such as Bachmann's refusal to seek earmark funding for worthy projects, such as the St. Cloud bridge, baffle Tingelstad.\""It used to be that policymakers, in part, were judged by what they could do for their district,'' said Tingelstad. ""Part of that was making sure that some of those dollars we send from Minnesota to Washington come back to Minnesota, instead of going to some other state.''\Her North Star opposition irks moderate public officials\The bridge isn't the only transportation issue where Bachmann and more moderate public officials differ.\The North Star commuter line, for example, may be one of the few unifying elements in a sprawling, traffic-congested district.\Bachmann opposed the projected as a state senator and has never help bring federal dollars into the project as a member of Congress.\""I think most people in the district are excited about the North Star Corridor,'' said St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis, who is quick to add, ""I don't get involved in congressional races.'' Kleis hasn't been so reticient to speak up on presidential politics. He's a longtime, public supporter of Sen. John McCain.\Independents, often a strong force in the 6th, also have problems with Bachmann, according to IP nominee Bob Anderson.\Anderson, whose single issue is health care, says the reason he didn't get the endorsement of the Independence Party turns out to be Bachmann.\""I was told (by IP officials) that they were endorsing El because they wanted to do anything possible to beat her,'' said Anderson. ""I understand that. She's got divisive stands on so many issues, and she's done embarrassing things.''\Anderson became the IP candidate by running in the primary. He was unopposed and, therefore, will be on the ballot as the Independence candidate even though the party endorsed Tinklenberg.\Anderson running to build Independence Party\Anderson is running a zero-budget campaign. (""No financial influence from anyone,'' is the positive spin he puts on his budget.) He has sat in on the handful of debates among the three candidates and he says that at least some Independents have said they'll support him because the ""only way to build up the party is to have candidates.''\The independent vote could matter in a close race. From the beginning of his underdog campaign, Tinklenberg has noted that in the 2006 race, the vote totals gathered by DFLer Patty Wetterling (42 percent) and IPer John Binkowski (7.8 percent) nearly matched Bachmann's.\Tinklenberg's big problem -- besides Bachmann's solid conservative base -- is getting his message out.\It's hugely expensive to purchase ads on Twin Cities television stations -- and much of any metro-wide television advertising expenditure is wasted on people who can't vote in the 6th. To date, Bachmann has run only a few TV ads, although more are expected as the election nears. Tinklenberg has run none so far, although that might change with the late-inning help he's receiving from the national party.\""I've seen more ads on the Paulsen-Madia race than I've seen on this race,'' said St. Cloud's Kleis of this below-the-radar race.\What does that low ad count mean? As recently as August, Tinklenberg had only 50 percent name recognition in the district, while Bachmann's stands at 95 percent.\But, if he ever can get the message out, Tinklenberg is convinced he's a better fit for the profile of the district than Bachmann.\""It's a conservative district, but it's not necessarily Republican,'' said Tinklenberg, who is pro-life and gets an ""A"" rating for his stands on gun issues from the National Rifle Association, even though the NRA has endorsed Bachmann.\""I'll tell you this,'' Tinklenberg continued, ""I'm from a small town, and people in small towns don't like to be embarrassed. I think a lot of people in this district find some of the things she's done embarrassing, extreme and out of the mainstream.''\The two have major policy differences. On energy, for example, Bachmann is from the ""drill, baby, drill'' school of thought. Early in the campaign, she predicted that if bans were lifted on Alaska and off-shore sites, gasoline would quickly drop to $2 a gallon.\Tinklenberg is frustrated by such talk. Drill yes, he says, ""but we can not drill our way out of our energy problems.''\On health care, Bachmann wants to keep government out. Tinklenberg believe there's a role for the feds to play. On the state of the economy, Bachmann has raised hackles by saying that federal regulations forced banks to give loans to those who couldn't afford them. (""She blames the poor for bringing down the Lords of Wall Street,'' says 5th District Congressman Keith Ellison, contemptuously.) Tinklenberg says lack of regulation led to recklessness that caused the crisis.\Bachmann stands drawing support, too\But understand, in most campaign environments, Bachmann does NOT sound like an extremist.\On Tuesday, for example, she met in Monticello with four small-businessmen, all of whom are tied to real estate or financial management.\They clearly approved of her views on keeping government out of health care.\""Minnesota's health insurance is so expensive because there are so many mandates,'' she told the men. ""There should be more competition. Health insurance should be like car insurance.''\If there were more competition, she said, there'd be ""companies like Geico'' involved in health insurance.\She also had little problem justifying her no votes on the bailout package.\""I asked (Treasury Ssecretary Henry) Paulsen, 'What's going to happen if what you're proposing doesn't work?' '' she told the men. ""I didn't like his answer, and I don't like what's happening. And do you know who's going to end up paying?''\She paused, then, pointed to each man.\""It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you,'' she said.\They nodded somberly and thank her for stopping by.\One other thing about Bachmann: She may seem inflexible on many of her positions, but, as Tinklenberg said, ""she can make your head spin.''\Example: Her relationship with President Bush.\There is, of course, the famous footage of the congresswoman grasping onto President Bush following his 2007 State of the Union address.\Not surprisingly, video of those 30 squirm-inducing seconds of Bachmann fawning over the president has made it into this year's campaign. An organization called the Alliance for Better Minnesota, has purchased anti-Bachmann television ad time in the Twin Cities market, featuring those Bachmann-Bush moments.\""We work with progressive organizations,'' said Denise Cardinal, executive director of the Alliance, ""and those organizations are outraged by her record in Washington. What better way to show her record?''\But these days, Bachmann no longer embraces the president, who helped raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for her. She not only voted against the $700 billion bailout but taken to calling the bailout ""the Democrat-Bush bailout plan.''\Doug Grow writes about public affairs, state politics and other topics.

116,"Minnesota House Republicans released an updated budget Thursday that would keep state spending at current levels so they can use a projected $900 million surplus on tax cuts and roads and bridges.\But the wide gulf between Republicans and DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and the DFL-controlled Senate on spending for infrastructure, curbing racial disparities and expanding rural broadband access makes political stalemate a possibility in a year when the Legislature can keep the machinery of state government moving without taking any action whatsoever.\The policy debate of new spending vs. tax cuts during the remaining six weeks of the legislative session will take place against a backdrop of the November election, when voters will get to choose House and Senate members in each of the state's 201 legislative districts.\""We've made a commitment to do some significant, meaningful tax relief and to invest some of that money in our road and bridge infrastructure, and we hope that Democrats will listen to the public like we have and join us in those efforts,"" House Speaker Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said at a news conference.\No such cooperation is forthcoming, said House Minority Leader Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, who said the Republican budget is a ""recipe for gridlock"" because it does not do enough for college debt, pre-K, local government aid, outstate wastewater treatment plants, oil train safety and a list of other DFL priorities.\Although Thissen said his caucus believes that doing what is best for Minnesota will translate into electoral success in the fall -- the DFL needs to flip seven seats to get back in the majority -- a political stalemate likely would work to the advantage of the House DFL, which could argue that House Republicans did not deliver on promises of tax cuts and road improvements.\Most problematic for a major deal is the bonding bill, a long-used form of borrowing for statewide building projects that requires a supermajority to pass and therefore votes from both parties.\Thissen said the Republican plan for a $600 million bonding bill would get no DFL votes. Dayton has proposed a $1.4 billion bonding package, and Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said in an interview Thursday that the Senate plan would be similar in funding if not identical in composition.\Rep. Jim Knoblach, R-St. Cloud, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans were right to limit new bonding because debt service is the fastest area of new state spending and should be curtailed.\Daudt cut down the Dayton plan with sharp language: ""At some point, somebody needs to say, 'Governor, do you know how to do simple math? And, can we use the resources for what people would expect us to use them for?' ""\Given the shrinking surplus, House Republicans will be forced to scale back plans they pushed last year for $2 billion in tax cuts and a 10-year, $7 billion road plan that would fix 15,500 lane miles of road and 330 bridges statewide without raising the gas tax, unlike a DFL gas tax proposal that passed the Senate and had Dayton's support.\Daudt offered hints Thursday about his tax-cutting priorities, mentioning reductions for Social Security recipients and military retirees and property tax cuts for farmers -- all loyal Republican constituencies.\The DFL criticized the House GOP's spending on outstate broadband high-speed Internet access as insufficient, but Republicans said their two-year, $35 million plan is more than what the DFL passed when it controlled all levers of government two years ago.\To help pay for that new spending, House Republicans proposed an unspecified $9 million reduction in government operations, which they said is doable after a significant increase last year.\Bakk, a Capitol veteran, said he was not surprised by the House GOP plan. His comments signaled the possibility of a session in which ultimately no significant measures are passed. ""There isn't the kind of urgency that we have in budget years, so it's a much different environment,"" he said.\He dismissed the GOP proposal, at times sounding like a fighter taunting his opponent before a match.\""There's some significant risk to House Republicans if they're willing to just go home and go to the campaign trail without investing in the public infrastructure,"" he said, before adding free -- and unsolicited -- advice to his House GOP counterparts: ""I think they as a caucus gotta to start to think that through.""\Staff writer Ricardo Lopez contributed to this report.\J.

117,"
At the Forest Lake rest stop on Interstate 35 one sunny morning last month, drivers were chatting about the conditions of Minnesota's roads and what it would cost to fix them.
\
Most agreed with truck driver Joe Gilbert of Two Harbors, Minn., that many highways need repairs or upgrading. ""They're not in real good shape,"" he said.
\
Kathleen Tahja of Floodwood, Minn., concurred. She would be willing to pay a little more to improve the roads, she said, but she doesn't trust politicians to spend tax increases on the transportation projects the state needs.
\
""Taxes don't do what they're supposed to do,"" Tahja said. ""I'd like to see a readout on where the money goes. How much goes for actual work on roads?""
\
That's a question for Charlie Zelle, Minnesota's relatively new state transportation commissioner.
\
Zelle, the former president and CEO of Jefferson Lines, must not only show motorists that their transportation tax dollars are being well spent but also tackle an even bigger assignment from his boss, Gov. Mark Dayton. He's been charged with calculating how much Minnesota needs to spend on roads, bridges and transit systems over the next 20 years and figuring out how to pay for it.
\
In other words, Dayton wants Zelle to think big.
\
""I'm here not necessarily to make it a world-class transportation system,"" the commissioner, who started his state job in January, said in a recent interview. ""It's about becoming a world-class state and having a system that meets that aspiration.""
\
Minnesota has a long way to go to hit that target. The state has a vast and aging highway system -- the fifth-largest in the nation, with more than 140,000 miles of city, county, township and state roads -- and its transportation revenue is flat while its costs escalate.
\
Combined, local governments and the Minnesota Department of Transportation spend about $5 billion a year -- an average of about $1,000 per resident -- on roads, bridges, bus and rail transit, airports and the like.
\
MnDOT will need more revenue just to preserve and maintain the state's existing highways and bridges, Zelle said.
\
""Fifty percent of our pavements are over 50 years old, and 40 percent of our bridges are over 40 years old,"" he said. ""We think they're in good shape. We maintain them and rebuild them.
\
""But at some point, you have to replace them, and when you do that, it's really expensive.""
\
Moreover, he said, to keep Minnesota economically competitive, the state must upgrade its roads, bridges and transit systems to move workers to jobs and businesses' and farmers' products to markets.
\
The Metropolitan Council has a good plan for improving transit in the seven-county Twin Cities area, Zelle said, and while MnDOT has detailed plans for specific highway corridors, it lacks a comprehensive statewide plan to ""show how it all fits together.""
\
""Our challenge and our opportunity is to tell that story more succinctly,"" he said.
\
Before his appointed as commissioner last year, Zelle served on Dayton's Transportation Finance Advisory Committee, which called for higher gas taxes and other fees to raise at least $50 billion for roads and transit over the next 20 years.
\
It recommended, among other steps, a gas-tax increase of 10 cents per gallon in the first year, followed by 1.5 cent increases in each of the next 19 years, resulting in about a 40-cent boost. The gas tax currently is 28.5 cents per gallon.
\
That proposal was dead on arrival. At a time of soaring gas prices, Dayton said the public wasn't ready for a huge tax increase on drivers, and most legislators agreed.
\
Nonetheless, Zelle said, the committee's recommendations are a ""good starting point to engage stakeholders"" in a discussion about the state's long-range transportation plans.
\
""We should have an honest, forthright conversation with citizens,"" he said. Zelle is traveling around the state to discuss transportation needs with city and county officials, business leaders, civic groups and other interested parties.
\
Part of his job is explaining how Minnesota pays to get around.
\
State highway construction costs -- that is, the price of materials for building highways -- increased by 257 percent from 1987 to 2012, according to a MnDOT analysis. Driving those increases are the prices of asphalt, concrete and steel. Prices also are rising for rights of way, labor and fuel for equipment.
\
Kandiyohi County Commissioner Harlan Madsen of Lake Lillian, a member of Dayton's transportation panel, knows firsthand about rising costs.
\
""When I first took office in 1995, asphalt bids were $18 a ton, and the first bid on a snowplow was $125,000,"" Madsen said. ""Our latest bid on asphalt was $60 a ton, and a snowplow cost $250,000.""
\
With revenue flat and the price of asphalt, concrete, steel and other road-building materials inflating by about 5 percent a year, MnDOT's buying power is expected to drop over the next 20 years.
\
The last time lawmakers substantially increased funding for roads and bridges was in 2008, after the Interstate 35W Bridge collapse in Minneapolis. That tragedy sparked a sense of urgency that led to phasing in an 8.5-cents-per-gallon gas tax increase.
\
MnDOT used much of the new tax revenue, plus a large infusion of federal cash, to bond for major road and bridge construction projects. That meant committing future revenue from that gas tax increase to pay off the bonds.
\
The department's spending for new construction peaked at $1.1 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30. It's projected to drop off sharply to $529 million in three years, as tax revenue is directed to pay off the bond debt.
\
""There is a transportation fiscal cliff awaiting us,"" warned Rep. Frank Hornstein, DFL-Minneapolis, chair of the House Transportation Finance Committee. ""If we aren't able to put new revenue on the table by 2016 at the latest, there will be significant problems in funding new projects.""
\
Hornstein and Senate Transportation Committee Chair Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis, proposed a 7.5 cent gas tax increase during this year's legislative session, but it did not pass.
\
With DFL lawmakers focusing on more funding and tax increases for education, property tax relief and other priorities, Dibble said, the gas tax ""couldn't quite get the oxygen that it needed.""
\
He and Hornstein plan to propose another gas tax increase during the 2014 legislative session.
\
""The gas tax is still the workhorse of the transportation finance system,"" Hornstein said. ""There really aren't any short-term alternatives to it that I think are viable.""
\
But people are driving less, and cars are using less gas, so the gas tax -- which provides just over one-third of the state's highway funding now -- is expected to generate less revenue in the future.
\
Zelle said Dayton wants a longer-term solution, such as indexing the gas tax so that it increases with the cost of living.
\
Rep. Michael Beard of Shakopee, the ranking Republican on the House transportation panel, said he could support a modest gas tax increase.
\
""I'm convinced that we need to put more money into roads and bridges,"" Beard said. ""Not massive amounts, like the $1 billion a year that some special-interest groups are asking for. But putting another $100 million a year into the system would certainly help us catch up on routine maintenance and improvements that make our roads safer and more functional.""
\
He suggested that a gas tax increase of a penny a year for six years or 2 cents a year for four years would be reasonable.
\
But Sen. David Senjem of Rochester, the senior Republican on the Senate Transportation Committee, said he opposes increasing the gas tax. He cited a recent study that showed states with the highest-rated highway systems often have relatively low gas taxes.
\
""There's a whole lot more to good highways than higher gas taxes,"" Senjem said. ""It would have to be proven to me that a gas tax increase is absolutely necessary.""
\
Zelle said the administration would be open to a wide range of financing options, including possibly increasing the other two mainstays of highway funding: license tab fees and the motor vehicle sales tax.
\
The gas tax, vehicle sales taxes and tab fees are dedicated to transportation in the state constitution, so the money can't be spent on other things.
\
In addition, the state gets one-fourth of its highway funding from federal aid. Together, those sources provided $2.4 billion for state highway and bridge maintenance and construction last year.
\
Those projects are expensive. Highway construction costs range from $1.6 million per mile for adding a lane to an existing rural highway to $19.5 million per lane mile for a new four-lane divided highway in a city, according to Federal Highway Administration estimates.
\
Bridges can cost anywhere from a couple hundred thousand dollars for replacing a two-lane span over a small creek to $363 million for Minnesota's share of the nearly $700 million St. Croix River crossing near Stillwater.
\
The state's other revenue-raising possibilities include expanding toll-charging MnPASS express highway lanes, creating new toll lanes, creating public-private partnerships to finance specific projects and capturing some of the increased tax value of property along transit lines.
\
For metro transit, Dayton last winter proposed a half-cent sales tax in the seven-county metro area that would raise about $235 million a year in new revenue. At the time, Met Council Chair Susan Haigh said the plan would raise enough to ""enable construction of a world-class transit system.""
\
What does that mean? The governor's transportation panel defined ""world-class"" transit as a ""globally competitive, technologically innovative system that provides the foundation for a sound economic environment and a high quality of life.""
\
Zelle and DFL legislative leaders said the metro sales tax proposal will be back on the table in the next legislative session. Dibble said expanding transit is essential to the region's economic growth.
\
""Right now, we're not even in the transit ballpark with emerging, dynamic cities like Denver, Salt Lake City, Portland and Charlotte,"" he said.
\
The governor's advisory group found that the Twin Cities' transit system is ""undersized and needs to expand to make the region's projected economic growth a reality.""
\
It noted that regions with more robust transit systems, such as those Dibble cited, ""are choice destinations for employers and employees because business has wider access to labor and employees enjoy a higher quality of life.""
\
For the first time, Zelle said, ""MnDOT and the Met Council are joined at the hip"" on developing integrated plans for improving highways, bridges and intersections to better accommodate bus and rail transit services.
\
His goal for next year is to work with legislative leaders to develop a comprehensive transportation financing plan that can pass. Before then, he hopes to work with other ""stakeholders"" to drum up public support for such a plan.
\
As for Tahja's question about how much money goes for work on roads, there's no simple answer, but here's one indicator: MnDOT awarded $926 million in contracts for highway construction last year.

118,"The green cars are coming. The green cars are coming. And when they get here, Minnesota's highway and road system will be in for some bumpy rides, the way Rep. Bernie Lieder sees it.\The green cars are hybrids, vehicles with two power plants: a gasoline engine and an electric motor.\They are low polluters, an environmentalist's dream, and they are fuel-efficient, a motorist's dream.\Green cars already are driven in Japan and are scheduled to arrive in some Minnesota Honda dealerships as soon as next month. They are capable of getting more than 800 miles on a tank of gas, primarily because a good portion of the car is powered by electricity.\That super efficiency is the problem for people charged with keeping Minnesota highways and roads in shape. Gas-tax revenues, the prime source of highway funding, are based on gallons sold and may sag as green cars proliferate.\So Lieder, a DFLer from Crookston who sits on the House Transportation Finance subcommittee, wants to scrap the gas tax as a major revenue source for highways and replace it with another user fee: a mileage tax.\With a mileage levy, motorists would pay a tax for each mile driven instead of for each gallon of gas bought.\While green cars aren't an immediate threat to the current trend toward larger, gas-guzzling vehicles, Lieder said the mileage tax is worth considering now because the highway-financing system already needs fixing. It has been losing its purchasing power for years.\The state gets the bulk of its funds to build and maintain roads from two sources: the 20-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax and annual vehicle-registration fees (license tabs).\Miles traveled by all vehicles in Minnesota have more than doubled since 1970. But the gas-tax revenue per vehicle mile, when adjusted to 1967 dollars, has dropped, from 0.52 of a cent in 1970 to 0.28 of a cent in 1997.\When gas-tax revenue and license-tab revenue are combined and adjusted to 1967 dollars, the total revenue dedicated to highways per vehicle mile has dropped dramatically, from 0.77 of a cent in 1970 to 0.49 of a cent in 1997.\So while the roads are taking a greater pounding, the revenue to fix them is not keeping pace.\Lieder and others see this trend continuing and even intensifying as the green cars arrive and fuel efficiency increases in other vehicles.\""They all recognize the declining revenue source with gasoline,"" he said.\So Lieder wants to switch the system, figuring that distance traveled is a better measure of usage than gallons purchased (the gas tax) and the value of the vehicle (on which license-tab fees are based).\Lieder has no immediate plans to introduce a bill to move to the new system, but hopes to generate discussion about the issue.\Measuring distance\Here's how the system would work. When you gas up, a computer chip in the pump would measure how much gas you get. A computer chip in the gas tank, connected to the electric odometer, would determine how many miles were traveled since the last fill.\The miles traveled then would be multiplied by the tax rate, and the tax would be automatically added to your gas purchase, just as it is today.\While this system isn't being used anywhere right now, Lieder, a retired civil engineer for Polk County, says that the technology exists and that it could take as little as a year to develop and manufacture the actual equipment.\The system would be phased in. Cars already on the road could have the computer chips installed - possibly with government subsidies. Or owners of unequipped cars could continue to pay the gas tax. The state also could work with car manufacturers to have the chips factory-installed in cars destined for Minnesota dealerships.\Lieder figures the mileage tax would permit a major reduction in the cost of license tabs. And it would insert a new element of fairness into the funding system.\""The people who don't drive much now are getting clipped because they pay so much for their license [tabs],"" he said.\Lieder said Minnesota could go it alone with a mileage tax. Nonresidents gassing up in Minnesota would continue to pay the state gas tax of 20 cents a gallon.\Lieder is hardly alone in looking for new ways to fund road construction and maintenance.\Experts' views\""There has been a long-standing feeling among people who study transportation [and] transportation economics that we ought to move to a user-fee basis,"" said Prof. Gerard McCullough, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Transportation Studies.\""The gasoline [tax] is related to your use of the road, and that's why it's been so successful, but most feel that a mileage [tax is more accurate].""\McCullough said that he is not familiar with the particulars of Lieder's plan, but that some variation of it is feasible.\The university's Center for Transportation Studies and the University of Iowa are beginning to look at the technology of charging on a use basis.\While transportation experts such as McCullough give the nod to a distance-related funding mechanism, it also is getting high marks from some tax experts.\Dan Salomone, executive director of the Minnesota Taxpayers Association, while not passing judgment on Lieder's plan, said the concept makes eminent sense.\""Tax experts have long recognized the problem with gas taxes based on gallons as opposed to some measure of highway usage,"" said Salomone.\Salomone said his organization is not ""anti-tax"" and doesn't have a position of whether more should be spent on highways.\""Intuitively, it seems, we're not getting the job done,"" he said. ""I think we have to find a way to address this problem, the problem of providing adequate transportation infrastructure. . . . . Ordinary inflation, increases in miles [driven] and growth in fuel efficiency have eroded the purchasing power of revenues coming into the highway user distribution fund.""\Gasoline tax and green cars\Good gas mileage is good for the environment and your pocketbook, but not necessarily for the state gas-tax coffers. Money from the per- gallon gasoline tax is used to build roads and repair highways, and that supply could sag as new cars become more and more fuel efficient.\Hybrid cars\60-70 mpg\- The Honda Insight uses both electric and gasoline power to achieve highway mileage as high as 70 miles per gallon.\- Toyota has a similar vehicle, the Prius, for sale in Japan.\Electric cars\Uses no gasoline\- The Toyota RAV-4 EV is completely electric. Top speed is 75 miles per hour.\- Honda canceled production of its prototype EV-plus last April.\Gasoline-only cars\50 mpg\- The European Smart Car by Diemler-Benz and Swatch, gets 50 miles per gallon from an all-gasoline engine. The car is very small and seats two.\Revenue and the roads more traveled While miles traveled by vehicles in Minnesota and gasoline consumption have risen dramatically since 1970, the increase in state gas-tax revenue hasn't kept pace, when adjusted for inflation. A 1967 baseline is used.\1970 1980 1990 1997 Miles traveled by all vehicles in Minnesota: 22.3 billion 28.3 billion 39.4 billion 47 billion Revenue from state gas tax plus motor vehicle license tax, in\million Revenue from state gasoline tax only: $116.8 million $97.2 million $134.3 million $131.2 million Revenue per vehicle mile from gasoline tax plus motor vehicle license tax: (See microfilm for chart.)\Sources: Minnesota Taxpayers Association, citing: Minnesota Department of Revenue, Minnesota Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, state budgets."
119,"ST. PAUL - The Minnesota Legislature has given up on adequately funding wildlife habitat, clean water and the arts in Minnesota.\That's the only conclusion I can draw from a bill that would put it to the voters to increase the state's sales tax another three-eighths of a cent to pay for these things.\Now, we can certainly talk about whether doing something is better than doing nothing. We can talk about whether this is different than last year's vote to dedicate the state's motor vehicle sales tax to transportation.\We can talk about whether state lottery and license plate money is or isn't enough to protect the environment.\No celebration\But the fact that this bill might make it to Gov. Tim Pawlenty's desk this year should be no cause for celebration.\It highlights just how weak the lobby for these causes has become in Minnesota, compared with education, health care, business and even transportation.\Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller's bill in committee would dedicate one-third of the new money to the state's Game, Fish and Wildlife Account.\Most of the rest would go to paying for Minnesota's Clean Water Legacy program, which still has no dedicated funding to test and clean up Minnesota's waters, two years after lawmakers passed a bill saying the state needed to do so immediately.\Part of the money would go to fund regional parks and trails.\This resonates in Central Minnesota, where area lawmakers have for years met stiff resistance from Twin Cities lawmakers who send millions to the Metropolitan Council for metro parks and trails each year.\We've got the state parks, after all.\About a quarter of the new money would go to the Minnesota Arts Board, which funds the Central Minnesota Arts Board, which gives out grants to local artists.\Also on the table\A bill from House Majority Leader Tony Sertich, DFL-Chisholm, also in committee, would divide the money up differently, giving more to water quality and some to a discretionary fund.\But both have this in common: They pass the buck to you, the voter, to raise your own taxes.\Maybe you'd rather get a chance to decide for yourself. Me, I elect my representatives to make the tough decisions and stand by them.\When Pawlenty proposes putting a gas tax hike on the ballot, DFLers scoff and talk about a lack of leadership from the ""man in the corner office.""\Have we neglected Minnesota's roads any more or less than Minnesota's environment?\Would it be fair, then, to call this a lack of leadership from the folks who run the rest of the building?\This is the opinion of Times Capitol reporter Lawrence Schumacher. Contact him at 651-224-4937 or lschumacher@stcloudtimes.com."
120,"Gov. Mark Dayton's political winning streak faces a tough test in the final weeks of the legislative session, as ambitious education and transportation spending proposals collide with the radically different priorities of the House Republican majority. Still fresh off a decisive re-election victory last fall and as popular as ever according to opinion polls, Dayton crafted a 2015 legislative agenda that would build on a hefty list of first-term accomplishments. But with just six weeks until legislators adjourn, those plans face uncertain prospects at the Capitol. The DFL governor's call to plow most of a $2 billion budget projected surplus into government programs, the majority of it for schools, is miles apart from the House Republicans' goal of hefty tax cuts. Dayton has won none of the GOP support needed to pass the wholesale gas tax increase that was to have been the funding centerpiece of his $11 billion transportation proposal, despite bipartisan proclamations about the importance of rebuilding roads and bridges. His signature priority -- a $343 million spending boost to provide a preschool option at every public school statewide -- has not won universal backing even from members of the Senate's DFL majority. ""I don't expect to get everything I proposed,"" Dayton said in a recent interview. But, previewing a theme he promised to elaborate on in his annual State of the State speech Thursday, he said the projected surplus vindicates decisions made in his first term. ""The fact we have a $2 billion surplus is not because we raised taxes,"" Dayton said. ""It's because Minnesota's economy is expanding. I think we're on the right track, and I think we need to continue and take advantage of the situation we find ourselves in now."" Preschool in jeopardy Dayton wants three-quarters of the surplus, about $1.5 billion, to be spent on education in the next two years. Public schools would get a per-student aid hike and the money for preschool; and the University of Minnesota and Minnesota State Colleges and Universities systems could extend a two-year tuition freeze for two more. Dayton wants to build on his successful 2013 effort to fund all-day kindergarten statewide. But House Republicans are not on board with what would be an expansion of the K-12 school system to accommodate 4-year-olds. When Senate DFLers set parameters for education spending in their budget blueprint, they chose not to fully fund Dayton's preschool plan. ""It's just the economic reality, that it's got to be trimmed back,"" said Sen. Chuck Wiger, DFL-Maplewood, who chairs the committee that sets the Senate's education budget. Senate Assistant Majority Leader Katie Sieben, DFL-Newport, supports Dayton's preschool initiative, but she said many senators, including herself, represent school districts that already face budget deficits this year. Dayton has proposed 1-percent increases in the per-pupil aid formula in each of the next two years. Some districts already offer preschool, which has led some House Republicans to suggest means-testing. Sieben said Senate DFLers might try to phase in preschool funding over several years. GOP rejects Dayton agenda If Dayton has work to do in selling fellow DFLers on his preschool initiative, the hill is that much higher with Republicans on nearly every major proposal. Leaders of the new House majority have rejected most aspects of Dayton's 2015 agenda: his call to spend most of the surplus; his gas-tax-fueled transportation proposal; his $330 million initiative to upgrade rail safety; and his plan to require 50-foot buffer strips around the state's lakes, rivers and streams to protect water quality in the face of agricultural runoff. In fact, Dayton may have to play defense against GOP plans to cut or reduce state spending in: health care assistance, state employee head counts, and state programs aimed at protecting the environment and boosting economic development. While specific details of House Republicans' budget are yet to emerge -- a fact Dayton harps on continually -- their budget outline calls for more than $2 billion in unspecified tax cuts, considerably lower spending increases for public schools and colleges, and the aforementioned program cuts. A massive gulf ""The number of full-time state employees has grown exponentially"" under Dayton, said Rep. Sarah Anderson, R-Plymouth, chairwoman of the House State Government Finance Committee. ""There's a whole host of areas that are ripe for right-sizing. I think that's what our charge is, putting state government in perspective with our true priorities."" There is a massive gulf -- about $1.5 billion -- between Dayton and House Republicans over how much to spend on health and human services programs. The GOP is tinkering with a proposal to eliminate MinnesotaCare, the state's subsidized insurance program for workers without other affordable health care options. Rep. Matt Dean, chairman of the House Health and Human Services Finance Committee, said releasing those individuals into the state's health insurance exchange could serve to make the latter program more viable because it would have more participants paying premiums. ""We're spending $1 billion over two years for 50,000 family policies,"" Dean, R-Dellwood, said of the MinnesotaCare subsidy. ""We absolutely can't afford it as it is currently, and we need to find a sustainable way for lower-income Minnesotans to afford private health insurance long-term."" Dayton said that eliminating MinnesotaCare ""is not going to happen"" on his watch. ""I'm not going to let Minnesota's health care policies, which have received nationwide acclaim, be dismantled without some thought,"" Dayton said. Then there's Dayton's $11 billion transportation proposal, unveiled to much fanfare at the beginning of the session. House Republicans have called transportation a top priority, but their $7 billion proposal includes none of the transportation tax or fee increases included in Dayton's plan or a similar proposal from the Senate DFL. Instead the Republican proposal depends on money diverted from the general fund, along with accrual of bonding debt. House Speaker Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, blasted Dayton's gas-tax proposal after the projected budget surplus grew to $2 billion, saying its sheer sizes make any tax hikes unnecessary. Dayton has not abandoned his transportation proposal. But there are signs it's become less of an emphasis. Asked in the interview his bottom line for what would make a successful session, Dayton -- after noting he won't get everything he wants -- ran through his early-learning initiative; tuition freezes at public colleges; and nearly $200 million in tax cuts he's seeking tied to child care expenses, for working families and for education expenses. He did not mention his transportation plan. Patrick Condon - 651-925-5049\Credit: PATRICK CONDON; STAFF WRITER"
121,"State government may be divided, but my sloppy survey of its professional observers indicates that they are united on this point: House Speaker Kurt Daudt was the big political winner of the 2015 session.\In only his third term, the 41-year-old former car salesman and Isanti County commissioner looked confident in the speaker's chair. He wielded his gavel, made from wood harvested on his grandparents' farm, without a high-profile goof. He delivered his Republican majority's talking points clearly with remarkably little snark, rancor or disrespect for the other side.\Daudt kept his new majority caucus together on the year's major battles. That could not be said of his Senate counterpart, DFL Majority Leader Tom Bakk, whose bad day at the June 12 special session turned into a worse night during the wee hours of June 13. Critics in his caucus reportedly took him to the woodshed for the ag/environment bill's contents (which, in the end, he voted against) and other perceived missteps.\And Daudt delivered -- what?\Well, he was a big backer of the new and improved nursing home funding formula ... and, uh ... (checking my notes from the May 20 post-session news conference here) ... he blocked DFL plans to raise the gas tax!\That day in May, Daudt and Co. bragged about the heft of an education bill that was about to be vetoed for being too small. It was a strange boast about a bill that on that day was already $200 million larger than the one these same House leaders sent to conference committee.\Daudt and Majority Leader Joyce Peppin said the House GOP caucus had reined in spending, producing the third-slowest rate of biennium-over-biennium expenditure growth since 1960. But they did it via spending shifts in the current fiscal year and the next biennium of more than $730 million, by state finance officials' tally.\Factor those gimmicks in, and spending growth in fiscal years 2016-17 is sixth-lowest in modern times -- not bad, but not head-turning, either.\As for the oft-mentioned gas-tax increase that didn't happen: It's a discouraging sign of Minnesota's political times that blocking the other party's priorities and passing no bill can suffice as a bragging point.\State government control has been shared by two or more political parties in 23 of the past 25 years. During those years, the competing lawmaking teams have become adept at playing defense. They know well how to foil the opposition's plans and make 'em look bad to boot.\The two parties' skills on legislative offense -- on actually doing what they say they want to do for Minnesota -- aren't nearly as sharp. But an electorate that is itself divided into mistrustful partisan camps seems satisfied with a good blocking game and continuation of the status quo. For now, voters don't seem to be clamoring for much more.\This year, none of the three major political players in St. Paul delivered the top item on their wish list. Senate DFLers wanted a transportation fix robust enough to stabilize roads and upgrade transit over the next 10 years. A gas-tax increase was one of several funding sources they proposed to do it.\The House GOP wanted a $2 billion tax cut. Senate DFLers made any general-fund tax cut contingent on House approval of a gas-tax increase, dedicated to highways. When given the choice ""both or neither,"" Daudt's caucus picked ""neither."" Evidently -- and maybe accurately -- it was deemed more politically acceptable than any version of ""both"" would be, even though ""neither"" won't fix state roads anytime soon.\Gov. Mark Dayton's top priority was universal preschool, delivered via public schools. That aim was blocked in both the House and the Senate. But Dayton didn't come away empty-handed. The E-12 bill he signed into law last weekend was the prize of the 2015 session. It included $100 million for various early ed efforts, much more than any previous Legislature directed to little learners.\Dayton deserves a lot of the credit for that boost. Yet the DFL governor may also be chary about compomise. He could have done a victory lap around the state last week to boast that the E-12 bill he signed finally deserved its ""E,"" for early education. Instead, his schedule was unusually devoid of public appearances -- leaving Minnesotans to remember his losses more than his wins in the lawmaking arena.\Daudt was better than either DFLer at putting a shiny veneer on modest accomplishment and keeping peace within his political tribe. That's sufficient to land a legislative leader in the winner's circle -- unless and until Minnesotans demand more of state government.\- - - \Permit a word of clarification about a reference in last Sunday's column to legislative language exempting nonferrous mining from solid-waste rules, a much-contested provision in the special session's agriculture/environment funding bill.\I wrote that it had never been introduced ""as a bill,"" meaning in a standalone version, or ""heard in any legislative committee before its appearance on May 18."" But it was ""in a bill."" Actually, at various times, it was in both the House and Senate omnibus ag/enviro omnibus bills. In the Senate, it showed up in the omnibus bill as it left a finance committee division, but was removed soon thereafter by the full finance committee. In the House, it went into the omnibus bill as a floor amendment.\It was never the subject of its own committee hearing --though it's a fair guess that it was the topic of full-throated conversation in closed Senate DFL caucus meetings between May 18 and June 13.\Thanks to Wayne Brandt of Minnesota Forest Industries, Steve Morse of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership and Allison Wolf of the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy for helping me trace this little nonferrous nugget's legislative trail. To any citizen who tries to do so without a guide -- good luck.

123,"The legislative session got off to its advertised fast start Tuesday, with big plans that could boost Minnesotans' taxes while fixing their roads and funding popular programs. \Majority DFLers introduced two bills proposing tax increases. One of the measures would fund a multi-billion-dollar roads and transit package and seems destined to produce another showdown with Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty. \But there may be quick movement on the other proposal, which would ask voters in November whether the state sales tax should be increased to provide money for the outdoors, the environment and the arts. Floor votes on the bill are expected Thursday.

House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher, DFL-Minneapolis, said Tuesday that she expects the figure to be closer to $800 million when the state's economic forecast is released later this month. \. \Transportation bill debate \Much of Tuesday's deliberations, however, were spent on the DFL transportation initiative, which would represent an $8.4 billion investment over a decade. \The proposal brought cheers from the labor and construction industry and criticism from some Republicans. \Last summer's collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis was barely mentioned Tuesday. \But DFLers and supporters of the legislation repeatedly characterized the state's transportation infrastructure as being plagued by congestion, potholes and deteriorating bridges. \""We are in a transportation crisis in this state,"" Eliot Seide, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 5, told the Senate Transportation panel. ""It cannot wait until tomorrow."" \The bill would raise money by increasing license-tab fees, particular on luxury vehicles; usher in the first state gas tax increases in two decades, and levy a half-cent sales tax in the Twin Cities area for transit, roads and bridges. Sen. Steve Murphy, DFL-Red Wing, the Transportation Committee chairman, said the proposal ""puts political courage above political ambition."" \Under the bill, a 2-cent gas tax increase, to 22 cents a gallon, would take effect within a month of passage, followed by another 3-cent rise in September. Those increases would generate $158.7 million a year by 2010. Another increase of up to 2 1/2 cents would be added later and phased out as bonds connected to the transportation package are retired. \DFLers said the gas tax increases would amount to a little more than $40 annually for typical drivers, with lower-income drivers getting up to a $25 tax credit. \House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall, said the transportation proposal would be ""just take more money coming out of people's pockets."" Pawlenty vetoed a similar, smaller transportation bill last year, and Seifert and DFLers agreed that House Republicans, who have 49 seats to the DFL's 85, might hold the key to whether another veto could be overridden. \Sen. Dick Day, R-Owatonna, scolded DFLers and labor leaders for not working with the governor and for minimizing the state's transportation achievements under Pawlenty. ""Everybody just slam-dunks the governor, so the governor isn't involved in this package,"" said Day. \Day also said DFL claims that the proposal would create 33,000 jobs a year were inflated, and disputed testimony by construction industry officials supporting the plan that their members were hurting financially. ""I can't believe that everybody in the construction industry is down and out. We're building stadiums"" for the Minnesota Twins and University of Minnesota, he said. \. \Amity on outdoors, arts \The outdoors, environment and arts proposal, meanwhile, was approved by a conference committee and sent to the floor without debate. It will be heard on the House floor Thursday morning and, if it passes, will be sent to the Senate. \Almost a decade in the crafting, it would ask voters whether the state Constitution should be amended to raise the sales tax by [unk215c] of 1 percent, with the money dedicated to funding clean water, the arts and natural resources. \If the amendment is approved, the increase would begin in June 2009 and extend until June 2034. If would generate about $276 million a year. The addition to the sales tax would equal about 37 1/2 cents on every $100 purchase. \Rep. Tom Hackbarth, R-Cedar, a supporter of earlier versions of the outdoors bill but now a critic, said he fears that the size of the sales tax increase and the addition of the other requests will prove too burdensome for voters who may be economically strapped. \""They [DFL leadership] are going to jam this down our throats. It's a huge sales tax increase and I don't see the voters approving it,"" he said. ""Then all the work will be lost."" \Brian McClung, Pawlenty's spokesman, said the governor was an early supporter of the original outdoor amendment but is resistant to constitutional amendments that dedicate additional sales tax funding. Because the proposal is for a constitutional amendment, however, Pawlenty would have little say because a governor cannot veto such a measure. \. \Staff Writer Patricia Lopez contributed to this article. \Mike Kaszuba - 612-673-4388"
124,"
After two years of mulling over the state of the state's transportation system, Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, urban and rural leaders alike agree there's a gap between how much revenue Minnesota raises and how much it needs to preserve and improve its highways, bridges and transit services over the coming decade.
\
There's bipartisan awareness across the state that transportation is a cornerstone of ""what Minnesota cares most about: our economy, our environment and our quality of life,"" state Transportation Commissioner Charlie Zelle said.
\
Gov. Mark Dayton plans to make highway and transit funding a ""huge"" priority during the legislative session that starts Tuesday.
\
He said last week that he's putting the finishing touches on a $6 billion transportation improvement plan that could add 12 cents in new taxes to the cost of a gallon of gasoline and a nickel more for every $10 of taxable purchases in the seven-county metro area to fund bus and rail transit.
\
""Our transportation systems are getting worse, and they'll continue to get worse unless we spend more to improve them,"" the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party governor said.
\
Incoming Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt agrees the state must spend more on roads and bridges, but he doesn't believe a tax increase is needed.
\
""There are other ways of solving this without going back to the cash register of taxpayers,"" he said.
\
Daudt thinks lawmakers can find the money needed for roads and bridges by making it a higher priority in the state budget and presumably cutting spending elsewhere.
\
Dayton dismissed that idea. ""To think we can do it by reordering priorities is ludicrous,"" he said.
\
So the state's top leaders agree on the need but strongly disagree about how to pay for it.
\
BIG CHALLENGES
\
Minnesota has the fifth-largest highway system in the nation, with more than 140,000 miles of state, county, city and township roads and 20,000-plus bridges.
\
The Minnesota Department of Transportation and local governments spend more than $5 billion a year -- about $1,000 per capita -- on those roads and mass transit systems.
\
Those systems are aging, and with a harsh climate and heavy use, they are expensive to maintain. Here's why:
\
-- Half the state highway pavements are more than 50 years old and long past their life expectancy.
\
-- The state's pavements rank 38th in the nation, and about 7 percent are in poor condition.
\
-- One-third of state bridges are more than 50 years old; almost 9 percent of them are ""structurally deficient.""
\
-- After borrowing heavily to finance an aggressive bridge repair and replacement program over the past six years, the state is fast approaching its debt limit for highway projects.
\
-- MnDOT is losing buying power. Construction costs for asphalt, concrete, labor, equipment and land acquisition are increasing by 5 percent a year, while the agency's revenue is growing at a 2 percent rate.
\
-- Transit ridership is growing, and system operators need reliable funding sources to upgrade bus fleets, continue building out metro bus and rail services to deliver workers to jobs and provide transit options for aging outstate populations.
\
The demand for other transportation improvements also is increasing. Minnesota's population is expected to grow by nearly 1 million in the next 15 years, and truck freight is projected to increase by 30 percent.
\
With cars and trucks becoming more fuel-efficient and an aging population and a younger generation that drive less, state gas tax collections are declining.
\
DFL leaders long have supported additional funding for transportation. Two years ago, Dayton proposed a sales tax increase for Twin Cities transit, and the Senate approved it plus a 5-cent gas tax increase. The bill died in the House.
\
In the end, all lawmakers could muster was enough money to patch potholes and improve a few outstate highways.
\
This year, the state's largest business lobby and conservative groups that typically oppose more spending are on board for boosting transportation spending.
\
""The present methods and level of funding fall short of maintaining our existing system, let alone allowing for expansion,"" the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce said in its list of 2015 legislative priorities.
\
Even the Center of the American Experiment, a Minneapolis-based conservative think tank, has called for more revenue for roads, bridges and buses.
\
FIND THE MONEY
\
Zelle estimated it would take an additional $6 billion over the next 10 years just for state roads and bridges -- $4 billion to preserve what we've got and $2 billion more to improve traffic flow on existing highways and add MNpass toll lanes on metro freeways, more lanes on outstate regional corridors, passing lanes on rural highways and safer railroad crossings throughout the state.
\
That $6 billion figure doesn't take into account the demand for more bus and rail transit services. ""Investing in transit to provide more people access to more jobs"" is essential to the Twin Cities' economic development, said Metropolitan Council Chair Susan Haigh.
\
""Don't forget about local roads,"" admonished St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman, the co-leader of the newly formed ""84 percent coalition"" of about 20 urban, suburban and outstate mayors who want more state funding for their decaying streets. (Eighty-four percent refers to the share of local road costs that are funded with property taxes and other local revenue sources.)
\
City streets are deteriorating as fast as state highways, Coleman said, and homeowners can't afford higher property taxes to pay for them.
\
Dayton said his plan would fund both state highways and local roads, plus transit.
\
He will call for a 6.5 percent sales tax on gas at the wholesale level, in addition to the current 28.5 cents per gallon tax at the pump. That would cost drivers about 12 cents more on a $2 gallon of gas. The tax bill would rise with fuel prices.
\
""If you had said to somebody who was making out a family budget a year ago, 'How do you feel about paying $2.12 for a gallon of gasoline?' I think most people would be quite happy,"" Dayton said.
\
The new gas tax would raise an estimated $5.9 billion over the next 10 years, with $3.8 billion earmarked for state roads and bridges and most of the remaining revenue split among cities and counties.
\
The governor also will propose a half-cent sales tax increase in the seven-county metro area that would raise about $235 million a year for bus and rail transit improvements.
\
In addition, he said he will seek a small, as yet undetermined increase in the motor vehicle registration tax, known as ""tab fees,"" and he plans to increase funding for transit in greater Minnesota by $120 million over 10 years.
\
Senate Transportation and Public Safety Committee Chairman Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis, predicted the DFL-controlled Senate will pass some form of a gas tax increase and a metro sales tax increase for transit.
\
He's also optimistic that lawmakers will boost transportation funding this year, but he said it depends on ""what the hopes and aspirations of the new House (Republican) majority are. ... I don't envision us (DFL senators) accepting anything shy of a meaningful package.""
\
New House Transportation Committee Chairman Tim Kelly, R-Red Wing, said Republican lawmakers will take a methodical approach.
\
First, he said, they will try to reach agreement on what the needs are and decide ""what that number is"" to pay for it. Then, they'll try to find ways to reach that number without raising taxes.
\
Minnesota dedicates three sources -- taxes on motor fuels, vehicle registrations and motor vehicle sales -- for use solely for roads and bridges. Only a tiny fraction of transportation spending comes from the state's general fund.
\
Lawmakers should consider ""prioritizing transportation"" over other programs financed from the general fund, Kelly said. They also should look for ""efficiencies"" in transportation spending and consider issuing more bonds to finance road and bridge projects.
\
""I think there are better alternatives (to a tax increase) at this point,"" he said.
\
The Chamber of Commerce agrees. It has called for a 10-year transportation plan ""funded by efficient use of current resources, general fund appropriations and value-capture user fee mechanisms."" It opposes any new taxes.
\
Chamber lobbyist Bentley Graves noted 33 other states use general fund money to supplement state roads and bridges, while Minnesota doesn't.
\
The Center of the American Experiment called for a ""timeout"" on funding for light-rail transit expansions to free up money for roads, bridges and bus rapid transit, said Kim Crocket, the center's executive vice president.
\
Zelle said MnDOT has agreed to generate 15 percent of the new revenue it needs by making its operations more efficient. Dayton said he will propose issuing highway bonds and paying the debt service with new gas tax revenue.
\
But he said it's ""really irresponsible"" to suggest lawmakers can meet the state's transportation needs by cutting other programs.
\
Meanwhile, there's growing public support for raising additional revenue for transportation, said Margaret Donahoe, co-chair of Move MN, a coalition that has grown from about 20 member groups to more than 200 construction firms, labor unions, small businesses, transit and environmental organizations and local officials. They will propose a large, long-term funding package this month, she said.
\
BEYOND TAXES
\
Dayton appears to have picked an opportune time to propose a gas tax increase. Falling gas prices are tempting other states to jack up their fuel taxes.
\
""With infrastructure crumbling across the country, even some tax-averse Republicans are considering raising gas taxes,"" Elaine Povich wrote in a recent Stateline.org report. ""Cheap gasoline makes such levies more politically palatable.""
\
At least 20 states will consider increasing gas taxes or vehicle fees this year, according to the Council of State Governments. They include three neighboring states with Republican governors: Iowa, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
\
Minnesota's 28.5 cents per gallon gas tax is lower than Wisconsin's 32.9 cents but higher than South Dakota's 24 cents, North Dakota's 23 cents and Iowa's 22 cents.
\
Linking gas taxes to the price of fuel, as Dayton plans to propose, is an increasingly popular idea around the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
\
Sixteen states index gas taxes for inflation, including five of the six states that raised gas taxes in 2013.
\
But critics warn that indexing gas taxes undermines political accountability. They argue that elected officials should have to make a case for higher taxes when they are needed.
\
Among other funding options, five states levy fees or taxes on electric cars and hybrids, which pay little or no fuel taxes. But Zelle said there are too few of those cars in Minnesota to generate significant revenue, and the owners of those vehicles already pay more in sales taxes and tab fees because their cars are more expensive to buy than gas-powered vehicles.
\
Oregon is launching a pilot program to test a mileage-based user fee that could eventually replace its gas tax. Minnesota is a member of a consortium of states that are studying user fees, but Zelle said a politically acceptable version is probably several years away.
\
Other alternatives include toll roads (which Minnesotans traditionally have opposed), more MNpass toll lanes on freeways and public-private partnerships to pay for construction projects. But Dibble said those options would raise only a fraction of what the state needs.
\
""Gas taxes and sales taxes will continue to be the two major engines of support for transportation,"" he predicted.

126," A MARINE'S SUICIDE\ VA let him down\ I was appalled and deeply saddened by Jan. 27 story on the suicide of Marine Jonathan Schulze of New Prague.\ To have a soldier with symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome and suicidal thoughts and be turned away from two Minnesota VA hospitals is unconscionable.\ Of course, the Department of Veterans Affairs is overwhelmed with dealing with the painful casualties of this war. But once our brave soldiers reach the safety of our shores, our government has a moral obligation to treat both their physical and psychological wounds.\ This event was probably preventable and is absolutely unacceptable and calls for immediate legislative investigation and resolution.\ Is it not the obligation of service providers at VA facilities, when psychiatric beds are unavailable, to arrange for services in the public or private sector for patients who are potentially dangerous to themselves and others?\ The government should not spend another dime on sending more troops to Iraq until we know that the VA and other medical care systems have sufficient resources and appropriate policies to deliver excellent and efficient care to our returning soldiers. They should not have to beg for help after the sacrifice they have made.\ Lionel Blatchley, Edina;\ .\ LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST\ Fix the problem\ That a young soldier could return from Iraq, try to check himself into a hospital with suicidal thoughts and be told to take a number and sent home is simply unconscionable.\ There should be a new law that says citizens who manage to get themselves to a Minnesota health care facility with suicidal (or homicidal) thoughts must be admitted - even if they have to put a bed in the cafeteria.\ I would also name that law in honor of the memory of Jonathan Schulze.\ Steve Aldrich, St. Louis Park\ .\ STATEWIDE SMOKING BAN\ A few questions\ It seems to me that the statewide smoking ban debate should not be about secondhand smoke and its effects. To me the real questions are these:\ - Should the state or federal government be permitted to ban the use of a legal product in a private business?\ - Where is the funding to enforce this going to come from?\ - Will it come from the tax revenue the state collects from the cigarette tax?\ Michael Hesse, Plymouth\ .\ A safety issue\ I would like to see people understand the purpose of the smoking ban - it's about creating safe workplace environments.\ The smoking ban is not about making it more difficult to find a place to smoke or telling people how to run their businesses.\ This is about the health and safety of their workers. Not everyone is privileged to work in an office or other already-smoke- free environment.\ Look at the big picture: We all deserve to have a safe and healthy work environment - and, if sometimes that means offending others or altering some aspect of their behavior, so be it!\ Barb Carlson, Shoreview\ .\ BACHMANN BASHERS\ They look foolish\ The liberal Michele Bachmann-haters who write letters to the editor are a real hoot. I especially enjoyed the Monday letter calling her a ""frightening reactionary"" and another that said this petite woman ""manhandled"" the president.\ The transparency of these hollow attacks is not lost on people, and it's getting old. These liberals think they see an opportunity to embarrass Bachmann. The fact is they're just embarrassing themselves.\ To everyone else, her grabbing and kissing of President Bush at the State of the Union was a news oddity for a day, and we've already moved on.\ John Jordan, Brooklyn Park\ .\ FIXING TRANSPORTATION\ Fire Molnau\ A Jan. 28 Lori Sturdevant column (""Allies on the road to a gas tax"") addressed our state's transportation mess. What I didn't read was a call for a change in leadership at the top, specifically Transportation Commissioner (and Lt. Gov.) Carol Molnau.\ When Gov. Tim Pawlenty appointed her a few years ago, I didn't understand why or how Molnau was qualified for the commissioner's job. Now State Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Steve Murphy says he won't hold a confirmation hearing for her because she probably would be rejected. It would only exacerbate deep divisions over transportation policy, he says, and ""even if we threw her out, it's not going to do any good.""\ Sturdevant called on clever and courageous lawmaking from Sen. Murphy and Rep. Ron Erhardt to pass a transportation bill that gets traffic moving (and transit projects, I would add).\ However, Sturdevant didn't mention Molnau or the agency she heads. It seems as if it's way past time for the governor and legislative leaders to take a hard look at a leadership change in the Department of Transportation. Minnesota citizens, taxpayers, and highway and transit users deserve better.\ Tom Balcom, Minneapolis\ .\ AFTER PRISON\ Net can aid adjustment\ Regarding Andy Luger's Jan. 26 commentary (""After the prison doors swing open / Violent ex-cons who take part in intensive reentry programs are less likely to reoffend.""): As a volunteer at the Women's Correctional Facility in Shakopee, I find it almost criminal that women in transition (being released with six months) do not have access to the Internet.\ I understand why it's not available to the general population (although debatable - with tracking, filtering and security software available), but to allow these women to hit the streets without the ability to search for jobs, housing, contacts and other opportunities before they leave is not logical.\ The incremental cost, since the Internet is available within the facility, would be minimal.\ Richard Perry, Eden Prairie;\ corrections volunteer\ .\ LETTERS OF THE DAY\ Antiwar protest deserved better coverage\ No wonder we keep burying the dead from the Iraq war: The Star Tribune keeps burying the live protests against the war.\ On Sunday, the paper buried inside the A section the news that tens of thousands of citizens converged on Washington to protest the war. Americans' opposition to this war deserves front-page coverage if we are ever to see an end to the carnage.\ Elaine Tyler May, Minneapolis"
127,"The first thing that one notices crossing the border into Iowa on Minnesota Hwy. 60 is how nice the road becomes.\It goes from a dilapidated Minnesota two-lane to a new, four-lane divided highway all the way down to Sioux City. Where does Iowa get the money to build such a nice road?\Around here, we've been asking the state to build a new four-lane highway from Mankato to New Ulm for 25 years, but the funds aren't available. We finally got funding for a tiny, two-mile stretch just west of Mankato. At this pace, it won't reach New Ulm for 250 years.\How do Iowans do it? Their gas tax must be much higher than ours, right? No! Their state gas tax is more than 7 cents per gallon less than ours. When I was in Council Bluffs at a riverboat casino, I cashed out a winning ticket from a slot machine, and the back of the ticket noted: ""Iowa's sixteen casinos pay over $280 million in taxes for Infrastructure, Environment, and Education.""\If you go to the website www.iowagaming.org, you will see that in 2010, Iowa received $306.5 million in gaming revenue. Of that, $125.6 million went toward roads and infrastructure. If Minnesota's tribal casinos want to continue their monopoly over casino gambling, they ought to pay a percentage of their gaming revenues to the state in exchange for an agreement to continue that monopoly. Otherwise, its high time for the Minnesota to allow other casinos and racinos to open that would contribute their fair share of tax revenue to the state.\JAMIE MILBRETT, NEW ULM MINN."
128,"With the new year upon us, MinnPost asked several writers to weigh in on the people, topics and ideas they expect to be a big part of the news in 2016:\Local government\The relationship between elected officials and their police departments -- and in turn, the relationship between cops and community -- will continue to dominate local public affairs in 2016.\Minneapolis remains in the midst of the response to the shooting of Jamar Clark by a Minneapolis police officer on Nov. 15. Investigations by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the U.S. Department of Justice are ongoing, protests of the shooting that began with an encampment at the 4th Precinct continue and the Minneapolis council and Mayor Betsy Hodges will revisit funding for repairs and renovations at the precinct.\In St. Paul, Mayor Chris Coleman continues his search for a new police chief to replace retiring Tom Smith. He has appointed a committee of community members to aide in the search which, based on Coleman's appointments, will include conversations about race and policing.\And both cities will advance plans to place body cameras on all police officers after each received $600,000 federal grants to help pay for the equipment. -- Peter Callaghan, local government reporter\State government\Last year, Minnesota lawmakers managed to do very little outside setting a two-year, $42 billion budget. Republicans in control of the state House and Democrats in the Senate clashed over whether a budget surplus should be spent on tax cuts or if lawmakers should pass a gas tax increase to improve transportation systems across the state. When no agreement could be reached, legislators left both priorities behind in an effort to finish on time.\In 2016, with a $1.2 billion projected budget surplus, the political debate is shaping up to be quite similar. There is one major difference, though: 2016 is the final year of the biennium, meaning legislators can't push off a deal any longer. It's also an election year, meaning a resolution could be harder to come by. -- Briana Bierschbach, state politics reporter\Congressional politics\As the 2016 election season fires up in earnest, Minnesota will have two congressional races worth watching: the wild, open-seat race to replace John Kline in the 2nd District, and the rematch between Rep. Rick Nolan and Stewart Mills III in the 8th.\There's also the matter of the presidential election and how its politics affect congressional members' re-election campaigns and day-to-day business in Washington. Congress famously gets even less done in presidential years, so even the smallest spats and rhetorical bursts have the potential to boil over into something big. Arguably, this has already started to happen (see: rebel flag, Trump Muslim plan.) Come the Iowa caucuses, expect the so-called ""silly season"" to go on steroids. -- Sam Brodey, Washington correspondent\Arts & Culture\We're already looking forward to more arts events than we can possibly attend and dreading having to choose.

129,"ST. PAUL - By now you've heard that state parks will shut down, the unemployed won't be able to use the state to find a job, new drivers won't get their licenses and\15,000 state employees will be laid off if the Legislature doesn't create a budget deal this week.\Even if they can't solve the tug-of-war concerning taxes, health care and K-12 education spending, none of those things has to happen.\The state would keep its parks, Job Services and the Department of Motor Vehicles open and avoid laying off most of the vulnerable state employees if legislators passed two bills that have nothing much to do with the main budget deadlock this year.\An agriculture, environment and economic development budget agreement could be worked out tomorrow.\Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they're only inches apart on the spending for that budget and could easily get it passed.\That would keep the Department of Natural Resources managing the state's parks for visitors to enjoy this July Fourth. It would keep the Department of Employment and Economic Development working to find jobs for unemployed Minnesotans.\A transportation bill could be harder to do, since the Legislature already sent one to Gov. Tim Pawlenty and he vetoed it because of a 10 cent-a-gallon gas tax increase, among other things. But a ""lights-on"" bill would keep the DMV working at full speed.\Together, those bills pay for about 10,000 of the 15,000 state employees who stand to be laid off. Yet most people at the Capitol say neither will be passed without a wider agreement on the overall state budget.\Why? Disagreements about reforming the Legislative Commission on Natural Resources are holding up the so-called hogs, frogs and jobs bill. Pawlenty wants citizens involved in handing out the money for environmental projects the commission oversees, and the Legislature would rather keep that job.\And, with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and DFL-controlled Senate behind a gas tax increase, getting a transportation bill Pawlenty will sign could be tricky.\But the most common reason why neither budget bill will get done without an overall agreement is that those services and those jobs are being held hostage, to be used as leverage or bargaining chips for a better agreement.\So the next time someone on either side of this morass tells you the gridlock that threatens to cancel your trip to the state park is a fundamental but principled disagreement about the future direction of the state, be assured you're not getting the whole story.\This column is the opinion\of Times Capitol reporter Lawrence Schumacher.

130,"THE NEW BRIDGE \Make it soar ... \The tragedy of the Interstate 35W bridge collapse presents a unique opportunity to enhance our cityscape and claim a new architectural icon. We now have the chance to build not just a utilitarian slab of steel and concrete across the Mississippi, but something that adds to daily life and our community as a whole. \In the rush to fix the serious transportation issue, and following the lead of Gov. Pinch-Penny, we are liable to settle for something depressingly and merely practical. Why not seize this chance to build something iconic, inspiring and daring so that people's view of the city, the river and their own commute is enlivened instead of simply facilitated? \Mark Stahura, St. Paul \. \... and make it last \The Romans 2,000 years ago built bridges and aqueducts all over Europe, including one in France at Pont du Gard near Nimes. This bridge dating from this time period is still standing intact and is used for highway traffic today. The aqueduct is still in good shape too. \Can't our engineers figure out how to factor permanence into bridge construction, and can't our governor, who is ultimately responsible, sign legislation (i.e. gas tax), to fund Minnesota's roads and bridges? These projects are not glamorous, but they are necessary for the state's well-being. Gov. Tim Pawlenty and his ""no new taxes"" friends should be sent to the principal's office for resisting measures to fund transportation proposals. \Odell Bjerkness, Edina \. \Gas tax increase \It should be substantial \Rep. Jim Oberstar may have gotten an aerial view of the 35W bridge, but his head is clearly still in the clouds if he thinks a nickel increase in the federal gas tax is going to do anything beneficial. I hoped our leadership would look to the future, past this immediate problem, and propose an increase to the gas tax of 15 or 20 cents. Only this kind of revenue generation will catch us up on our infrastructure problems. \Chuck Grothaus, Maple Grove \. \Why is it a given? \I would like to say I am surprised, but Minnesota's answer to every problem is always to raise more taxes. However, it would be nice if someone suggested a change in spending priorities instead. \I have thought for a while that Gov. Tim Pawlenty was leaning toward a change in party affiliation, but it just dawned on me that every politician in this state is a ""DFLR"" (Democrat Farm Labor Republican). Especially in light of the apparent change of heart among even the House Republicans. \Alan Williams, Elko \. \MINNESOTA'S CAUCUSES \Get rid of them \Regarding Phyllis Kahn's Aug. 6 column, ""We should caucus when it counts"": If we are going to mess around with our current system, why not do away with the caucus entirely and go to instant runoff voting? \At the very least, we should move to a primary system. I've participated in the caucus system twice. I will never do it again. It took a tremendous amount of idealism to get me there the second time. In the end, I felt that the caucus system was being manipulated to provide a voice for party leaders, not to find a candidate that party members wanted. \The caucus system is antiquated. Minnesota should lead the nation, not follow it by 75 years. \Isaac Hopkins, St. Paul \. \NUISANCE PROPERTIES \Not limited to renters \Regarding your Aug. 7 editorial ""Cracking down on nuisance properties"": Rental housing is a vital part of the housing stock in our communities, providing nearly 25 percent of the homes in the state. Rental communities are the housing of choice for doctors and schoolteachers, young children and grandparents, families and singles, people of all races and ethnicities - and they represent the entire socioeconomic spectrum. \The nearly 2,100 members of the Minnesota Multi Housing Association take pride in providing quality rental housing that nearly 1 million Minnesotans call home. Our members abide by a code of ethics, attend training seminars and set themselves apart by meeting the highest professional standards. \While the vast majority of rental housing is well-managed, properly maintained and a safe place to live, we agree that some problems do exist. No one knows better than we that a small number of problem properties and/or problem renters can wreak havoc on a community and on the image of the entire industry. We are taking steps to address these concerns, including educating renters and owners on their rights and responsibilities. Our members follow best management practices and actively partner with police, neighborhood organizations and city councils to find solutions that work. \Bad behavior, crime and nuisance properties exist in all neighborhoods and in all types of housing. These issues are neither caused by nor limited to rental housing; they are indicative of broader societal issues. While we recognize the solution isn't simple, we will continue to do our part and be active participants in the process. \Mary Rippe, president, Minnesota \Multi Housing Association, Bloomington \. \EATING LOCALLY \It's usually best \Thanks to James E. McWilliams for his column (""Does eating locally really help the environment?"" Aug. 9) pointing out many of the advantages of eating locally - ""freshness, purity, taste, community cohesion and preserving open space."" \Thanks also for his reminder that the distance food travels is a critically important factor in determining environmental impact, but that it is not the only one. Most locavores I know pay close attention to the way in which the food has been grown (e.g., sustainably or not) as well as location. \If McWilliams' arguments make us think more carefully about the environmental impact of the food we eat, that is all to the good. My bet is that in the overwhelming number of instances, the answer to the question, ""Does eating locally really help the environment?"" will be a resounding YES! \Brett Smith, Minneapolis \. \LETTER OF THE DAY \On Barry Bonds: Sometimes, cheaters win \Ricky Henderson made baseball history by stealing the most bases.

131,"Congress should apply a patch, then get busy on reform.\Any member of the U.S. House expecting applause for the vote last week to temporarily rescue the Highway Trust Fund from insolvency must be stung by the bad reviews the move received. The New York Times called the bipartisan measure a ""sad excuse for a highway funding bill."" The Boston Globe described it as a ""rash scheme."" The Spokane Spokesman-Review said it was ""incredibly irresponsible, even for this Congress.""\Inaction would allow the fund to be depleted to the point of inoperability. An immediate 28 percent reduction in federal outlays to state and local highway projects would ensue next month, followed by an eventual slowdown or stoppage of an estimated 100,000 projects, and the loss of 700,000 jobs.\In Minnesota, the impact on state projects would likely not be felt until next year, said Department of Transportation (MnDOT) spokesman Kevin Gutknecht. Federal funds are paid as reimbursement for state outlays, lagging the state's spending by several months. MnDOT's cash position today is strong enough to finish this construction season, although some local projects likely would feel an earlier squeeze, Gutknecht said.\But the potential for havoc with highway and transit projects in 2015 and beyond is real. That risk must be what inspired a rare show of unity on a funding bill by the Minnesota delegation on July 15. All three Republicans and five Democrats voted with the House's 367-55 majority to employ $10.8 billion in budget maneuvers to keep the fund functional through the end of May.\Action to pull the fund back from the brink was necessary. But this rescue isn't one to brag about. It's far from the long-term plan the nation needs to modernize its aging transportation infrastructure. The Highway Trust Fund is filled largely by the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gas tax, which has not been increased since 1993. Inflation has cost the tax 39 percent of its buying power since it was enacted.\A minimally responsible quick fix would boost that tax back to its 1993 strength. A better one would combine a short-term gas-tax hike with a phased transition to a new funding formula that moves away from per-gallon taxation. With driving declining and vehicle fuel efficiency climbing, the traditional gas tax can't keep up with the nation's needs to move goods as well as people. Better would be a formula based on miles driven, vehicle weights and/or carbon emissions, thereby accounting for the toll driving takes on roads and the environment.\The House bill does neither of those things. Instead, it would extend the period in which companies can apply a higher interest rate on pension plans, thus reducing their minimum payments and increasing their taxable income. By the House's bookkeeping, 10 years of increased corporate taxes would be applied to 10 months of additional funding for transportation.\Unlike other critics of the House bill, we see merit in relieving companies of the pension strain many are facing in this era of low interest rates. Our regret is that the fix does not provide a longer-term solution.\That's like vacuuming the nation's sofas to cover a major household expense. And the cost of managing a transportation network on the cheap can be very high. A report by the National Economic Council and the President's Council of Economic Advisers says that unsafe road conditions contributed to as many as a third of last year's 33,000 U.S. traffic deaths. That's not to mention the economic toll caused by potholes, traffic congestion and carbon emissions.\Democrats must share blame with tax-averse Republicans for allowing a basic government function to fall into this sorry state. Even when Democrats last controlled both houses of Congress, in 2009-10, then-House transportation chairman James Oberstar of Minnesota seethed in frustration about his own party's unwillingness to raise and reform transportation funding. Oberstar lost his seat in 2010 and died earlier this year. If we could have spoken with him this week about the latest House bill, we suspect he would have said much the same thing he said to us in 2009: Delay in investing in infrastructure is ""madness. Just madness. It's shortsightedness of the worst kind. ... We can't afford time. The public can't afford time.""\The Senate should pass the House bill. Then voters should give all of them an earful about infrastructure in coming months, so that in May -- when the trust fund's fuel gauge again approaches E -- chances improve for a more lasting fix.\Federal share\About 60 percent of Minnesota's 2014 highway construction budget of $770 million is paid by the federal government, primarily via the Highway Trust Fund. Those funds arrive as reimbursement for state funds already spent. About 30 percent of MnDOT's total $3.1 billion 2014 budget comes from federal sources.\Source: Minnesota Department of Transportation"
132,"This week's question: Should toll lanes be added to roads?\a\Plan isn't fair to all people\It was a bad idea for education, and it is a bad idea for transportation. The FAST legislation proposed by Rep. Mark Kennedy is a bad idea because it would create separate and unequal transportation lanes accessible only to those well off enough to pay extra to use them.\When America had segregated schools, the Supreme Court said ""separate but equal"" education for blacks was unequal. Things have eroded since then to a situation where that same court now says vouchers for certain students are acceptable, and the public schools could be left with only the poorest and hardest to educate.\Kennedy's proposal would change our ""free""way system into one with ""pay""way lanes! This is separate and unequal transportation.\For the first 18 years of their lives, we teach our young people that the United States is based on equality, and then for the rest of their lives our political system teaches them all the lessons of the inequality we actually practice in this country. Equality is for those with money, not for the poor, the minority, the immigrant!\Just what is the difference between a fee and a tax? Neither one is a four-letter word! Both fees and taxes come out of the same pocket - yours and mine, as long as we can afford the fee.\The beauty of the tax supported public entity, whatever it may be, is that we all pay for it proportionate to our ability to do so. We all get the benefits of our road system, no matter the condition of our pocketbook or our vehicle.\We have got to stop portraying tax as a four-letter word and get back to the concept that taxes are levied to enable us, as the government, to provide benefits for the common good.\Ellen Mork\St. Cloud\Proposal would help only the rich\Let's expand Rep. Mark Kennedy's plan to add toll lanes by adding four extra lanes - two for the very rich and two for the just barely rich.\The Very Rich lanes would get the best maintenance as they would be the most expensive. The Just Barely Rich lanes would get OK maintenance and the rest of the Average Persons lanes, which would be free, would get just so-so maintenance.\Oh, and while we're at it, let's let the Very Rich lanes drive as fast as they want, with slower speeds for the Just Barely Rich lanes and slower again for the Average Persons lanes. As long as we're into coddling the wealthy, we might as well give them something extra.\Let's give each group a separate rest stop facility, keeping the Very Rich rest stop immaculate, the Just Barely Rich rest stop kind of of clean and the Average Persons rest stop - well, let's just clean it when we have time.\People seem to think toll roads are an answer. Just like in Illinois, whose toll roads are paid for, they don't stop taxing you for them once they are paid for.\If you need increased user fees, increase the gas tax and motor vehicle licenses. Toll roads are a very bad idea!\Gene Nelson\St Cloud\Tolls won't lower existing roads tax\No. While the toll roads would be paid for by the users, it would not lower the taxes for existing roads. Why not continue to use the roads we are already paying for?\Dan Brady\Richmond\User fees for tolls is good plan\We enthusiastically support Rep. Mark Kennedy's plan for toll lanes paid through user fees. But we suggest tolls be dropped when the cost is covered.\Duke and Marguerite Hewitt\St. Joseph\FAST Act has ripple effects on roads statewide\By Rep. Mark Kennedy\6th Congressional District\We are spending too much time stuck in traffic, away from our families.\Federal transportation statistics put numbers to some of the more tangible costs of our congestion crisis. Traffic congestion costs the United States more than $67 billion annually. We waste almost 6 billion gallons of fuel and 3.6 billion hours idling while polluting the environment in traffic jams. For the average person, this means $1,160 and 62 hours wasted by congestion.\The latest 10-year plan out of the Minnesota Department of Transportation does not offer much room for hope that we will be able to wake-up from our traffic jam nightmare. Approved road construction will not come anywhere near meeting demand.\This is not to criticize MnDOT. They are doing as much as they can with what they have. The problem is one of resources. There is simply not enough money available to build the roads we need. Even the most ambitious calls for a gas tax increase will not provide the money we need. We need new ideas.\That's why I introduced the bipartisan Freeing Alternatives to Speedy Transportation - FAST - Act (H.R. 1767) in the House of Representatives. It will help relieve congestion on the nation's interstate highway system. The FAST Act allows for the construction of new lanes, a voluntary option where users pay to use the new lanes if they decide it is worth it to them to get where they are going FASTer.\The legislation includes three important conditions to promote fiscal responsibility and driver confidence. First, fees will only be collected using noncash electronic technology. No tolls and no toll booths. Second, the voluntary fee is for new lanes only, and are dedicated only to those new FAST lanes. This leads to the third point, when the revenues collected from FAST lane users have repaid the costs of the FAST lanes, the fees go away.\If we are able to pass this legislation, it could mean adding FAST lanes to Interstate 94. Monticello will again be known for more than where traffic backs up during the morning commute.\Every driver will benefit when FAST lanes are constructed. FAST lane users will have new lanes to use, and those who choose not to use the FAST lanes will benefit from having fewer cars in the existing lanes.\The FAST Act empowers states to solve their own problems so that Minnesota does not have to come to Washington every time it needs to build a road. Projects get completed FASTer using FAST lanes; and when roads get built quicker, they cost less and get people moving sooner.\FAST lanes also will free up critical dollars for other state priorities, such as Third Street, 10th Street and Minnesota Highway 23, so that high-dollar projects on congested metropolitan roads do not absorb all of the resources of our state.\I was gratified that Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Lt. Gov./MnDOT Commissioner Carol Molnau recognized the benefits of FAST and heartily endorsed this legislation. Likewise, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, the Minnesota Associated General Contractors, Minnesota Taxpayers League and the Minnesota Transportation Alliance also support the bill. It is time to get Minnesota moving FAST again.\Kennedy can be reached at Mark.Kennedy@mail.house.gov."
133,"lschumacher@stcloudtimes.com\Steve Gottwalt and Diana Murphy-Podawiltz both support dedicating the state's motor vehicle sales tax to road and transit improvements. And they both back a statewide smoking ban.\But that's about it for common ground.\Points of agreement at a debate Thursday evening at St. Cloud State University were few and far between as the two candidates for an open Minnesota House 15A seat presented a stark contrast to voters.\Where Gottwalt, the Republican candidate and a St. Cloud City Council member, saw a state on more or less the right track, Murphy-Podawiltz, a community volunteer and former business owner, described a need for fundamental change.\Where Murphy-Podawiltz believes the state should provide more education funding and universal health care coverage, as well as raise the gas tax to pay for better roads, Gottwalt touted the state's strong ranking in the number of insured residents and supported calls for more state-mandated accountability for school districts and options for getting more road funding from voluntary toll lanes.\For the 60 people who attended the debate -- sponsored by Debate Minnesota, a multipartisan, nonprofit group -- the polite but spirited exchange could leave no doubt about the choice they face Nov. 7.\""He wants to cut, cut, cut. I want to invest in the state's future,"" Murphy-Podawiltz said of Gottwalt during an exchange about taxes. ""We haven't been investing in education. We're going backwards in a lot of ways.""\""Saying 'invest' is just another way of saying 'raise your taxes,' "" Gottwalt responded. ""I'm not talking about cutting. I'm talking about being very careful about getting the return we want for our money.""\House District 15A includes western and southern St. Cloud, Rockville, St. Augusta and Waite Park.\The seat is vacant due to the retirement of Rep. Jim Knoblach, R-St. Cloud.\Murphy-Podawiltz\Murphy-Podawiltz argued that in many ways, Minnesota has not maintained the high levels of government services the state constructed in earlier decades.\At one point she said she ""didn't see any areas (of state spending) that we can possibly cut.""\In addition to a 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase, she suggested looking at income tax increases for the state's top earners as a possible means of helping meet transportation, education and health care needs.\""When we raise taxes, we invest in our future,"" she said. ""Raising taxes can improve our economy.""\Murphy-Podawiltz said she opposes putting an amendment to ban gay marriage or civil unions on the ballot, saying religion, not the state, should define marriage.\Gottwalt\Gottwalt spoke in favor of putting the gay marriage ban up to a popular vote, though he maintained that he supports equal rights for everyone under the law. He opposed any gas tax or income tax increase but said he was willing to look into future fee increases if the state needs more money.\The state's takeover of school district funding from local government and income tax reform at the beginning of the decade -- a move co-engineered by Gov. Tim Pawlenty when he was the House majority leader -- was a mistake that should not be repeated, Gottwalt said.\Pawlenty's idea to require 70 percent of school district spending to be dedicated to the classroom, however, is a good idea, he said.\Statistics show not only that Minnesota is the most well-insured state, but that college tuition affordability is near the top, Gottwalt said.\""We need market-based solutions,"" he said. ""We need to create an environment in Minnesota that creates success."""
134,"OTSEGO -- Time and again, Tom Emmer found his calling on the front lines of combat.\It was true when Emmer played hockey in college, pressed his case as a trial attorney or took on fellow lawmakers in the Minnesota House.\Now, as he runs for U.S. House in Minnesota's 6th Congressional District, Emmer's most daunting opponent may not even be another candidate. It may be the public portrait of Emmer that surfaced during his failed bid for governor.\Emmer's fiery oratory and fearless style struck supporters as proof of his conviction. Critics, who included DFLers and a few Republicans, saw him as bellicose -- a blustering bully who scorned compromise.\Few would dispute that Emmer's readiness to engage makes him a natural at retail politics.\On a Thursday morning earlier this month at his campaign office, Emmer ticked off his itinerary. He had marched in parades, mingled with voters at county fairs and sat down with countless local officials. Later that day, he was set to meet with campaign donors.\""There's a lot of people in politics that want to talk about what's wrong,"" Emmer said. ""People in the 6th District are positive about what's right.""\On this day, Emmer's outlook seemed similarly sunny. He has been the consensus frontrunner in the 6th District race since announcing his candidacy more than a year ago.\Emmer and Anoka County Board chairwoman Rhonda Sivarajah face off in an Aug. 12 primary to choose the Republican nominee in the district.\Emmer disappointed many in his own party the last time he ran for office. Despite historic Republican gains in other races, Emmer lost to DFLer Mark Dayton by less than 9,000 votes in the 2010 Minnesota governor's race.\DFLers and their allied groups during that campaign painted Emmer, one of the most conservative members of the Minnesota House from 2005 to 2010, as an angry hardliner. They also made hay of his two arrests on drunken-driving-related charges.\Emmer and those who know him say lessons learned from the 2010 governor's race, as well as his experiences since, have left their mark. Depending on who you talk to, Emmer is more nuanced, more in control of his emotions or more cognizant of what it takes to run a high-level campaign.\Unsurprisingly, Emmer rejects his critics' portrait of him. He says he's determined to take charge of his public image during this campaign.\""I think they really made the definition that, 'This guy's going to come in, kick your door down. He's going to cut everything. He's going to lay devastation and waste behind him,'"" Emmer said. ""No. That's not who I am.\""I can get along with anybody that I've ever sat down with.""\A bone to pick\Emmer began his political career with a bone to pick.\A resident of Independence, Emmer says the city assessed him more than $30,000 for a nearby road and sewer he didn't want or need. He showed up to a council meeting, hoping to discuss the matter. Instead, he says he was met with condescension from council members.\""I just remember feeling like I was being patronized and patted on the head and told, 'Hey, this is good for you,'"" Emmer said. ""I ended up running for the City Council because of that.""\Born in South Bend, Indiana, Emmer grew up in Edina and played college hockey at Boston College and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He later returned to the Twin Cities, working construction during the day and attending law school at night.\Emmer married his now-longtime wife, Jacquie. The couple had seven children, several of whom have helped with Emmer's congressional campaign.\After a stint on the Independence council, Emmer served on the City Council in his next -- and current -- hometown of Delano. He was elected to the state House in 2004 and wasted little time making a splash, introducing a bill to chemically castrate certain sex offenders.\Emmer's work ethic and hard-charging approach quickly impressed his House colleagues, said Rep. Mary Liz Holberg, R-Lakeville, who served with him. House Republicans named Emmer deputy minority leader after he'd served just one term.\A GOP colleague at that time, former state Rep. Neil Peterson, dubbed Emmer ""the enforcer"" and likened him to a hockey defenseman for the way he pressured Republican colleagues to toe the line on certain votes, according to a Politics in Minnesota report.\GOP Rep. Jim Abeler of Anoka was another lawmaker with whom Emmer clashed. In 2008, Abeler incurred the wrath of many Republicans by being one of six House GOPers to vote to override Gov. Tim Pawlenty's veto of a gas-tax increase.\Emmer took the unusual step of attending the local GOP convention in Abeler's district shortly after the vote and -- without mentioning Abeler by name -- implicitly calling him out for it, according to Abeler. Abeler lost his party's endorsement at that convention, though he went on to win a primary election and retain his House seat.\Abeler says he doubts Emmer would approach the situation the same way today.\""He's learned to control his emotions a bit,"" Abeler said. ""He used to speak twice and think once. Now he thinks twice and speaks once.""\Lobbying criticism\Emmer's willingness to mix it up isn't limited to the Minnesota House Chamber. Over the years, he engaged in personal legal fights with a former office manager, a tree farmer, a law partner and a Minnesota county, according to a Star Tribune report.\One of Emmer's jobs after his governor campaign drew fire from critics, including Sivarajah. It centers on Emmer's state lobbying work for Minneapolis Radiation Oncology Physicians, a cancer treatment group.\The group supported extending a moratorium on construction of new cancer radiation-treatment clinics not attached to hospitals in the Twin Cities and surrounding counties.\As a lawmaker, Emmer spoke passionately about his opposition to the moratorium, according to a Star Tribune report.\Emmer vehemently rejects the suggestion that his lobbying gig showed his principles were for sale.\""They can characterize whatever they want. My integrity will speak for itself,"" Emmer said.\Emmer says he initially opposed the moratorium because his conservative principles made him wary of government interference in health care. But he says he changed his position during his 2010 run for governor. He says he didn't speak publicly about his shift at the time.\""Forgive me if I have an open mind and if I'm willing to learn,"" Emmer said. ""I finally had the epiphany ... we don't have a free market system in health care to start with. That's the problem.""\Emmer terminated his lobbyist registration in 2013 shortly after announcing his bid for Congress.\Emmer stayed in the public eye after his governor campaign by co-hosting a Twin Cities morning radio talk show from 2011 to 2013. At times, the show courted controversy.\Yet Emmer says manning a talk-radio mic helped him gain empathy.\""The impact it had on me is it reinforced the fact that listening is the No. 1 thing you have to do,"" Emmer said. ""Everybody has an emotional and an intellectual attachment to whatever position they have.\""In order for you to reach a solution, you've got to understand what that is.""\The team concept\Emmer proudly wore the outsider label during the 2010 governor's race. His insurgent bid for the GOP nomination came with support from tea party activists fed up with the establishment.\This time around, Emmer touts the value of experience. He says his work among 134 state House members has readied him for Congress. Serving on a county board of seven offers less tutelage in the dynamics of a large legislative body, he says.\""I think there's experience that I have that's going to matter in this job,"" Emmer said.\Outside politics, coaching youth hockey is one of Emmer's longtime passions. He coached his sons' youth teams but started coaching earlier than that, shortly after he moved back to the Twin Cities in the 1980s. One of the players he coached was former Minnesota Wild center Darby Hendrickson. The team framework that Emmer learned on a hockey rink also became a framework for how he came to view the political realm.\""I've gained an understanding of how that team concept works within this environment,"" Emmer said. ""I guess you could say that yes, I've learned and I've improved, perhaps.\""But it was based on that team concept that I've always worked in -- I've worked in my whole life.""\Holberg, who's retiring from the state House after this year, says she counted Emmer among her favorite teammates during her eight terms in the House.\Holberg recalls Emmer as a tireless worker who, as deputy minority leader, read each bill as it was introduced and hatched plans for his caucus to deal with them. Emmer also didn't take himself too seriously, Holberg said -- a trait she found especially endearing.\Holberg says the lessons Emmer learned four years ago will help his congressional campaign show voters the real Tom Emmer this time around.\""I think he'll try and do a better job of letting people know who he is, and not letting others define him,"" Holberg said. ""There's far more to him than a DUI 20-some years ago.\""When people meet him, they'll really like him.""\Follow Mark Sommerhauser on Twitter @msommerhauser.\Read about fellow GOP\candidate Rhonda Sivarajah on Wednesday in the Times"

He opposed a statewide ban on smoking in public places.\LeMieur, who opposed the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Little Falls while on the City Council, is running on a conservative, anti-tax platform that emphasizes local control and the free market.\Legislators make $31,140 per year, plus per diem and other reimbursements.\Al Doty\Party: DFL.\Occupation: State representative, retired senior advocate and educator.\Education: Bachelor of arts from University of Minnesota, graduate work at University of Manitoba.\Government experience: House of Representatives, 2006-present.\Residence: Royalton.\Family: Wife, Donna.\Age: Did not respond.\Contact: aldoty@mywdo.com; www.aldoty.com.\What is your vision for Minnesota's transportation system and how will you pay for it?\I don't think it would be wise for any rural legislators to want to adjust transportation funding right now. With the present bill, none of our gas tax money goes to metro transit, but metro transit tax dollars come here to help us. Also, around $14 million that would have had to come from property taxes will come into Morrison County from that bill. That's more than we'll pay in new tax.\It took 20 years and 40 groups, from unions to the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, cooperating and compromising to get the bill passed. I can't see any adjustments coming soon.\What should the Legislature do to eliminate the next state budget's projected $1 billion-$2 billion deficit?\I voted to increase the tax rate on incomes over $225,000 ($400,000 per couple). That would have provided around $500 million, but it was vetoed. We need to revisit that.\I'm a supporter of single-group, single-payer health care (not government-owned, however). That has the potential to save everyone one-quarter to one-third of their bill, including the state. Since one-quarter of the state budget goes to health care, that's a huge savings.\I would also put the state into the casino business. Those three sources are easy enough to take care of a deficit of that size with no tax increases.\Is quality health care a universal right, and if so, what should the state do to ensure it?\Right now we're rationing affordable, good health care to only the wealthy or fortunate. The costs are driving more and more small businesses away from being able to offer that benefit to employees. A single-payer system with one group for the entire state (similar to Medicare), where private insurance companies would bid for the contract would let us reach what I feel is a right - affordable, quality health care for everyone.\Does the state's education system need tweaking or an overhaul, and what would that entail?\The entire education E-12 funding system is outdated and needs replacing. Current law is far too complicated and unfair to many districts. Instead of just dumping more money into outdated formulas, I think we should base funding on the current needs of each child so the money goes where it's needed. The state needs to fulfill its constitutional mandate to educate our children and stop dumping the bill onto our property taxpayers. I also want more funding on early childhood education. A good start is cheaper than fixing problems later.\Mike LeMieur\Party: Republican.\Occupation: HVAC; Home Furnace Co.

City Council president, 2006-present.\Residence: Little Falls.\Age: 40.\Family: Wife, Julie, and three sons, Elijah, 10, Isaac, 7, and Nicholas, 7.\Contact: lemein@charter.net.\What is your vision for Minnesota's transportation system, and how will you pay for it?\There is no doubt that our transportation system needs some help. But I don't believe raising taxes on the hardworking citizens of Minnesota when the economy is in an economic downturn is the way to do it. I believe we should remove nonessential projects from the bonding bill (arenas, parks, gorilla cages, sheet music museums, etc.) and put that money toward roads and bridges. This would provide the state with a long-term fix without raising taxes. Prioritizing spending.\What should the Legislature do to eliminate the next state budget's projected $1 billion-$2 billion deficit?\Reduce the size of government, reduce wasteful spending, prioritize spending and create jobs and economic development.\The key to growing the economy is to create a favorable tax climate that allows businesses to succeed, creating good-paying jobs with benefits.\We cannot afford to lose businesses to other states as well as miss out on bringing new businesses with new jobs into our state.\Is quality health care a universal right, and if so, what should the state do to ensure it?\Minnesota is one of the healthiest states in the nation and is home to some of the best medical facilities and doctors in the world.\There is no question we have to make affordable health insurance available to all the people of Minnesota.\But I don't believe in a government-controlled and government-managed health care system.\Such a system would decrease the quality of health care and lead to health care rationing.\I believe a health care system that provides tax credits on all medical expenses would greatly reduce costs to residents for health care.\In addition, bringing competition into the health insurance industry will improve the quality and reduce the costs to the consumers.\Does the state's education system need tweaking or an overhaul, and what would that entail?\We can always do better and we should continually strive to do better.\A quality education system will need to recognize the importance of family in the education process.\Parents have an obligation and a right to be a part of this process and by doing so will benefit the child, the teacher and the school system.\Parents, teachers and local school boards can best make decisions about our children's education and to do this we must reduce the federal and state bureaucracies' control on Minnesota's education system.\We need to provide challenging coursework to prepare our children for the global economy, and we need to put more emphasis on our talented and gifted students.\We must tweak and overhaul the funding formula that unfairly gives our rural schools thousands of dollars less in per student funding compared to the metro schools."
136,"From his no-new-taxes pledge to his potential Arctic trek to highlight global warming, Gov. Tim Pawlenty has long been a master of the grand political gesture. \His knack for reaping rewards from bold strokes while seldom paying a price for taking risks has helped lift Pawlenty onto a short list of rising Republican stars. \But behind the scenes there is grumbling from DFLers and even some in his own party that Pawlenty is more adroit at the splashy idea than the steady follow-through. Concerns have flared anew with Pawlenty's newly energized campaign against climate change - including his recent teamup with explorer Will Steger - and the release of the state's budget forecast, which suggests that additional money for big initiatives will be scarce in 2008. \When Pawlenty helped engineer an accord this fall to reduce the Midwest's future greenhouse gas emissions, state Sen. Michael Jungbauer, R-East Bethel, called it ""feel-good politics"" that ""did nothing for the environment."" \Others point to examples where Pawlenty's ambitions have been larger than his ability to deliver: a ""Cover All Kids"" proposal to extend health care that withered as the price tag grew, a fleeting flexibility on a gas-tax increase after the Interstate 35W bridge fell, a high-profile crusade against costly prescription drugs that yielded little more than a website. \""Like a lot of crafty politicians who lack money and votes and face a hostile Legislature, he goes to the symbolically popular,"" said Steven Schier, political science professor at Carleton College. ""And if he's thinking about the national stage, he needs to make himself visible in a positive way that will get good press attention."" \Former Gov. Arne Carlson said that he has seen repeated pitches from Pawlenty for big change at some point in the future, but little so far that requires immediate sacrifice or compromise. \""It reminds me of that one saint who prayed, 'Oh Lord, make me pure - but not yet,' "" said Carlson, a Republican. ""Environmental changes that you want to make in 2020 don't count as much as doing something in the here and now."" \Brian McClung, Pawlenty's communications director, said that while Pawlenty ""certainly hasn't gotten everything he wanted ... this governor has been remarkably successful in achieving the vast majority of initiatives he's proposed."" \As part of the response to criticisms voiced during preparation of this article, Pawlenty's office drew up an 83-point checklist of accomplishments, along with a 23-page ""Legacy of Reform"" that McClung said staffers have been compiling for some time. Listed as achievements: Closing a $4.5-billion 2003-04 budget deficit without tax increases and establishing a ""State Achievement Ribbon."" \McClung said that gains in areas such as renewable energy and transit required persistence and came only at considerable political risk. \DFLers say that both issues demonstrate Pawlenty's skill at ""suddenly leading the parade,"" as Sen. Ellen Anderson, DFL-St. Paul, puts it. \Anderson, a longtime environmental advocate, said Pawlenty worked behind the scenes for years to water down renewable-energy standards and became a cheerleader only when he saw that the 2006 election gave House DFLers the upper hand on the issue. \""She's entitled to her opinion,"" McClung said. ""The fact is, the governor proposed [renewable energy standards] in 2006 and in 2007."" \. \Instant prominence \Those around him have grown accustomed to Pawlenty's policy bursts. In the space of several days in mid-November, for example, he announced a multi-point plan to aid veterans, to assist homeowners facing foreclosure, and he helped engineer a Midwestern greenhouse-gas accord. \Longtime allies such as former chief of staff Charlie Weaver defend Pawlenty's idea-a-minute style. \Weaver, who now leads the Minnesota Business Partnership, points to Pawlenty's recent 35-point plan to help veterans. ""Let's say five of those pass,"" he said. ""Do you complain because he didn't get the other 30 through?"" \Sen. Linda Berglin, DFL-Minneapolis, a leading figure on health care, acknowledges some progress on Pawlenty's pay-for-performance health-care reform initiatives. \""But there are still times when he is not paying enough attention to follow-through and details,"" she added. ""It's just a headline for today and he's hoping nobody remembers it next month or next year."" \Pawlenty's attention can bring instant prominence to an issue but can vanish just as quickly. \In 2005, Pawlenty proposed extracting casino revenues from the state's most successful Indian tribes as a way of balancing the state's spreadsheet. The idea fizzled but Pawlenty still scored points in some quarters for taking on wealthy tribes. \A similarly brief attempt to reinstate the death penalty in the wake of college student Dru Sjodin's murder was cheered by law-and-order advocates even though Pawlenty dropped the idea in the face of opposition. \. \At war with himself? \Another view of Pawlenty is that he is not so much a headline-grabber as an instinctive innovator trapped in his own small-government, low-tax ideology. \""What we're seeing here is Tim Pawlenty at war with himself,"" said Larry Jacobs, director of the Humphrey Institute's Center for the Study of Politics and Governance. ""He's taken strong, bold positions that the political marketplace has a hard time digesting. Then he retreats."" \""It's happened enough that I'm now distrustful of anything he says he wants to do,"" said Rep. Mindy Greiling, DFL-Roseville. On education, she said, ""he wants to have bold strokes. Last year he wanted high school reform. Great. We heard a lot about that. It seemed very genuine. Then suddenly, it was gone. The fact that he wants to do new things but doesn't have the money really brings him up short."" \Transportation advocates swooned last summer when Pawlenty briefly appeared to reverse course and support a gas-tax increase in the wake of the I-35W bridge collapse. \But conservatives pushed back and soon a gas tax was off the table again. \An early political mentor of Pawlenty's, former U.S. Sen. David Durenberger, said Pawlenty's special contribution is a talent for defining policy problems. \""While I may have wished he did more with one or two issues ... he's just never going to be that kind of guy,"" Durenberger said. ""He doesn't care about being recognized as a single-issue governor. \Instead, Durenberger said, Pawlenty has an uncanny ability to ""identify the serious problems as a nation and state that we have to deal with and call attention to them."" \House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall, says Pawlenty's accomplishments for conservative principles have been substantial. \Pawlenty, he said, ""stuck to his guns"" on taxes, abolished the Profiles of Learning that conservatives despised, and has been a forceful spokesman on abortion, same-sex marriage and illegal immigration. \. \Deeds vs. words \Uncertainty about Pawlenty's staying power has fueled doubts on both sides in response to his new drumbeat on climate change. \While Jungbauer, the GOP state senator, detects ""feel-good politics,"" environmentalists are uneasy too, welcoming his interest but wondering whether Pawlenty will push for hard decisions on lifestyle changes that could make a real difference but prove inconvenient. \""We need strong speeches and good leadership, but ultimately we need the policies that will require emissions reductions,"" said J. Drake Hamilton, science policy director for Fresh Energy, the region's leading clean-energy group and a member of Pawlenty's advisory cabinet on climate change. \""We're waiting to see how well his deeds match his words,"" Hamilton said. \. \Patricia Lopez - 651-222-1288 \. \PAWLENTY'S BIG IDEAS: A SAMPLER \2002-03 \Big idea: Took no-new taxes pledge, promising not to raise state levies. \Result: Pledge made a powerful campaign theme, and Pawlenty pushed through a belt-tightening budget in his first year, balancing a record shortfall without state tax hikes. \2003 \Big idea: Proposed restoring Minnesota's death penalty in the wake of the Dru Sjodin murder. \Result: Lack of legislative support quickly killed the plan. \2004 \Big idea: Declares war on high prescription drug prices; crosses FDA by launching state website for Canadian drug purchases; attempts to pressure drug giant Pfizer through state pension fund stock holdings. \Result: Website gets only light traffic; Pfizer policies unchanged. \2004-05 \Big idea: Demands Indian tribes share casino profits with state, suggests Mall of America casino deal with northern tribes if they don't. \Result: No change in state gambling policy. \2005 \Big idea: Proposes health impact ""fee"" on tobacco to break budget deadlock, insisting it does not break his no-new taxes pledge. \Result: Revenue from fee breaks budget stalemate; fee upheld in court. \2005-06 \Big idea: Proposes broad action to deny services to illegal immigrants. \Result: No significant change in state policy. \2006-07 \Big idea: Announces plan to provide health insurance for all children in Minnesota. \Result: Only a minor expansion of coverage is enacted. \2007 \Big idea: In wake of bridge collapse, reverses course and says he would consider signing a gas-tax hike. \Result: Nothing so far."
137,"In 2006, DFLers swept back into the majority in the Minnesota House, electing 29 new members.\It was a stunning electoral performance by the DFL, giving the party a majority for the first time in eight years. It also marked the biggest one-night loss of seats by a party dating to 1978, when DFLers lost 32 seats in what became known as the Minnesota Massacre.\The mini-massacre of 2006 is something those new legislators still remind their DFL elders of on occasion.\When committees meet, for example, a member of the Class of '06 might say, ""We're the majority-makers -- remember who made you the chairman,"" said Rep. Jeremy Kalin, adding quickly, ""We say that in jest.''\But it also is fact.\Now, however, two of those young ""majority-makers"" -- Kalin, 35, from North Branch, and Rep. Karla Bigham, just 31, from Cottage Grove -- have announced they are giving up their seats at the close of the session.\Sutton's optimistic 'reading of the tea leaves'\Tony Sutton, chairman of the state Republican Party, says he believes those two, along with a couple of veteran DFL senators, are leaving because ""they can read the tea leaves.""\""I'm very confident that we'll take control of the House and maybe even the Senate,"" Sutton said. ""I think some of these DFLers have figured it out and don't want to have to get into a battle that they're likely going to lose.""\Both Kalin and Bigham, however, laugh at the notion they're leaving out of fear of a great Republican resurgence.\""I announced before I even had an opponent,"" said Bigham. ""When I was elected, I knew I never expected to make this a career.""\""Not going to happen,"" said Kalin of any grand Republican comeback.\The Republicans, they say, are offering ""cookie-cutter candidates"" who will follow the dictates of party leaders.\They won, they both said, because they paid attention to local issues. In his case, Kalin said he won in a conservative-leaning district by a percentage point because his opponent, incumbent Pete Nelson, voted to support Gov. Tim Pawlenty's veto of the gas-tax bill, ignoring the desperate highway and bridge needs of the district.\""I talked about that vote over and over again,"" said Kalin.\Bigham said she won because voters in her district understood that the dwindling Local Government Aid under Pawlenty was creating property tax increases.\""I don't think there are many ideologues in our class,"" said Kalin.\""As a whole,"" said Bigham, ""I think we're fiscal realists who make our home districts our priority.""\Kalin, Bigham cite personal reasons for decision\Both young pols insist they are leaving because of their personal circumstances, not out of any sense of disillusionment and certainly not fear.\Bigham, a paralegal with the Hennepin County district attorney's office, is entering law school. There is not enough time, she said, for a single woman like her to hold a job, go to law school and be a legislator.\Kalin, too, is coming to one of those crossroads of the young. He's taking his bar exam this summer, and his spouse is an ob-gyn, working in Minneapolis. The two were married during his first year in the Legislature. Together, they decided they wanted to spend more time together.\""There is a sense of sadness,"" said Kalin of leaving. ""You always have that sense when it's not clear-cut. I understand I'll be losing that ability, for now, of making a difference on the inside. I won't be able to author legislation.""\""There are a lot of benefits to this job,"" said Bigham. ""But the thing I'll miss most is those warm fuzzies you get when you can help someone in your district and they call to say thank you.""\They said there are other ways to do public service, and both expect to stay involved and have not ruled out the possibility of again running for office.\Both came into the Legislature on the run, Kalin even gaining national attention for his work on sustainable energy issues.\Although young legislators often have little meaningful power in a seniority-laden system, both say they never felt powerless.\""Youthful exuberance has been an asset,"" said Kalin. ""There is a certain, slow, byzantine way things get done around here. Sometimes, relentless enthusiasm is needed.""\While many of us sit on the outside, taking potshots at all that doesn't seem to get done in state government, the two quickly rattled off a list of what they consider meaningful accomplishments in their two terms: beneficial health care reform, substantial investments in transportation, and investments in science and technology projects. They also cite a long list of sustainable energy programs and environmental projects they believe will have lasting impact on the state even though they didn't make big headlines.\""We did the things we [the Class of 2006] were elected to do,"" Bigham said. ""It was getting back to basics. Jobs, health care, environment and paying attention to district needs.""\GOP folks 'sense a win'\Now, they're headed out the door and the Republicans are filled with optimism.\""The last couple of cycles it was sometimes hard to even find people to put on the ballot,"" said the GOP's Sutton. ""We'd end up calling a district chairman, 'You've got to go out there and take one for the team.' We've got good candidates everywhere now. Even in Minneapolis and St. Paul, there's enthusiasm. Our people sense a win. That 17B seat [Kalin's], we've got four good candidates running for endorsement.""\Kalin disagreed with Sutton's assessment of the four Republicans seeking his seat. ""Karla's not going to like this,""said Kalin, ""but I would have been willing to support a good, moderate Republican who was looking out for the district.""\Indeed, Bigham didn't like Kalin's comment. Her eyebrows went up.\""But all four people running are cookie cutters,"" said Kalin, who has been wooing a potential candidate he believes would be a strong DFL replacement for him.\""You have to understand the needs of your district, not just do what the party bosses want,"" said Bigham.\Doug Grow writes about public affairs, state politics and other topics.

138,"TOM EMMER\He's on the money regarding tip credit\Critics of gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer's proposed tip credit need to square their rhetoric with the facts (""Emmer: Lower wages for tipped workers,"" July 6).\Despite claims that a tip credit could harm working families, Census Bureau data shows that the vast majority of the tipped workforce are not single parents or single earners supporting children. In fact, more than half are young adults between the ages of 16 and 24, some of whom are completing school and value the schedule flexibility that a tipped job affords.\It's also intellectually dishonest to claim a higher minimum rate is needed for employees already earning far above it.\Nationally, tipped workers earn an average $11.65 an hour, with tips included. This is 60 percent more than the federal minimum of $7.25, and 30 percent more than the living wage for a single adult residing in Minneapolis or St. Paul.\A tip credit represents a sensible compromise: Minnesota's tipped workforce will continue to earn a wage far above the federal minimum, and businesses running on razor-thin margins won't be forced to offset higher state-mandated labor costs by raising menu prices or hiring fewer staff.\MICHAEL SALTSMAN, research fellow, Employment Policies Institute, Washington, D.C.\- - -\I used to work as a cook in various restaurants, and every night servers would easily take home double what I made, if not significantly more, due to their high base wage and the addition of tips. The servers were routinely taking home $20 or more per hour waiting on tables, which resulted in a wage comparable to a person with a bachelor's degree in a science or business field.\I have no problem with Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer wanting to cut the base wage of servers for this very reason. North Dakota pays servers less, and there is never any shortage of willing, pleasant servers in any of the restaurants I have been to there.\Besides, who is forcing anyone to work for a tip? If current servers do not like the prospect of relying more on the tips earned from their work, perhaps they need to find a job where they do not receive tips.\JORDAN KIEMELE, Rochester, Minn.\- - -\So the Star Tribune seems to think Tom Emmer is feisty (""Emmer's feisty spirit fuels legal fights,"" June 22).\Gosh, what could make him that way?\He didn't inherit a fortune from the hard work of his ancestors. His family doesn't have millions of dollars in the bank because of his wife's success in her career. He and his wife don't rely on government as the only source of their income. He doesn't believe that making Minnesota great again means taking more of hardworking people's money to fund every single whimsical idea running through liberal legislators' minds. He actually thinks that parents, not the government, should raise and impart values to their children. And he actually believes that there is a limit to what government can do and what problems it can solve.\Gosh, are there any other feisty people running for high office? I want to support them, too.\BRUCE ANDERSON, EAGAN\Mark Dayton\He'll chase money with 'tax the rich' proposals\On July 8, the Star Tribune editorialized: ""Tip to Emmer: Drop gratuity idea.""\How about a tip for DFL gubernatorial candidate Mark Dayton, who would like to rid the state of snowbirds by taxing them?\He fails to understand that snowbirds would take with them their real-estate taxes, sales taxes, spending, charitable contributions and positive involvement in our communities.\BILL HALLING, Edina\- - -\""Tax the rich,"" says Mark Dayton.\But who are the rich?\Those who earn much (income taxes), those who spend much (sales taxes) or those who own much (property taxes)?\THOMAS HOFFMAN, EDINA\Off-road vehicles\Gas tax expenditures for DNR trails rational\I have never owned an ATV, snowmobile or any other off-road recreational vehicle. And I do care about how those who do own such vehicles treat the environment. But the expenditure of $350 million of gas tax revenues in nearly 50 years to keep up trails and enforce laws does not seem in any way excessive (""DNR drives millions in gas tax off road,'' July 7). That amount over that period of time would have been negligible if devoted only to roads anyway.\Indeed, where would those vehicles be treading (literally) if there were no trails? Perhaps over the lake-cabin properties of the very critics of the spent money? I suspect they'd really be complaining then.\The source of the money, gas tax revenues, is logical and fitting. Despite the specious argument that nonusers are paying for users, some of those same nonusers might not have children in school, but they still help pay for public education and other government services they may not use but which are nevertheless needed. Besides, off-roaders use gas to run their vehicles, so their gas taxes help roads and bridges, too.\KEVIN DRISCOLL, ST. Paul\- - -\Yes some gas tax dollars are spent, but $350 million since the early 1960s is less than $4 million per year. How many tax dollars have those who drive off-road vehicles brought into this state since then?\Maybe Minnesotans for Responsible Recreation would prefer that tourism advertising show multibillion-dollar light-rail systems rather than the great white north.

139,"
Standing in the foyer of his Tudor-style St. Paul residence a week ago Friday, his tired staff and commissioners around him, Gov. Mark Dayton waited to hear from the legislative leaders who had thwarted him all year.
\
Dayton, Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk had spent five days ensconced in the mansion trying to agree on how to spend $42 billion.
\
Unable to reach a deal, with only 90 hours left in the year's session, Bakk and Daudt decided to go it alone.
\
""I haven't had a chance to pursue with them why they felt the need to do that. But they did,"" Dayton said that Friday night. He was barefoot and in sweatpants, his arms crossed, resolute that the lawmakers' plan did not spend enough on education.
\
That night set the tone for the rushed closing days of the session. The Dayton administration and Minnesota House leaders, in particular, worked through Monday night to reach agreement on the $17 billion education plans. They failed. Dayton vetoed their education budget bill and two other budget measures, and a special session looms ahead.
\
""We were fairly close,"" Daudt said of education. Only $25 million apart, Dayton admitted.
\
The turmoil under the Capitol's dome is a tale of the state's attempt at bipartisan rule. It features a governor with nothing to lose but his legacy, a Senate leader experienced at cutting deals and an ambitious young speaker trying to get along with everyone.
\
The tumultuous end of the session - with the education bill veto, no tax cuts and no comprehensive transportation investment - came as a surprise.
\
With a $1.9 billion surplus, a state economy humming along and promises of cooperation blooming, Capitol powers thought fixing the budget to satisfy the needs would be, if not easy, at least achievable. The reality was far more complicated.
\
At 68, Dayton won his second term with 50 percent of the vote. He was the first governor in decades to win an outright majority and has sworn he will never run again. Without any concern for his own election fate, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor governor has shown he is willing to fly solo to do what he thinks right.
\
In advance of blistering criticism from both DFLers and Republicans, Dayton hiked the pay for his commissioners. After Bakk moved the Senate to curtail those raises, Dayton lashed out. But the Legislature was overwhelmingly against the pay boosts and Dayton capitulated, clipping his own power to set pay.
\
Dayton was at odds with the Legislature again over the online lottery his lottery director instituted. Last year, the governor vetoed a measure to ban the sales of lottery tickets online and at gas pumps. The Legislature tried again this year - on a 122-6 vote in the House and 56-8 vote in the Senate. That's enough force to override a veto, if it came.
\
The governor relented.
\
""I have decided that I do not wish to sign this bill into law,"" he wrote last week, ""With the understanding that it will become law without my signature.""
\
The will of the bipartisan Legislature forced him to accept something he had pledged not to. Lawmakers hoped they could do it a third time, with their budget plans.
\
'THE SPEAKER AND I'
\
A few hours before the governor stood in his entryway waiting for Bakk or Daudt to reply to his education funding demands, the 41-year-old Daudt of conservative Crown and 60-year-old Bakk of the DFL-strong Iron Range, stood on the well-manicured lawn of the Governor's Residence.
\
Bakk told the horde of waiting media: ""The speaker and I have agreed"" on a deal.
\
Dayton's lack of concurrence was barely mentioned.
\
Bakk said negotiations had ""absolutely stalled,"" and time was pressing.
\
""I had to make a deal with the House that the governor doesn't support,"" Bakk said later.
\
Daudt, on his first tour leading the House, said he, too, had the Monday midnight deadline weighing on him. For days, he, Bakk, the governor and their staff had been locked in cordial but unproductive debate over the budget, all three parties admit.
\
""We spent about five hours today and we adopted nothing,"" Bakk said late that Friday night. Spacing out each word, he added: ""We ran out of time.""
\
They had gotten bogged down on details without hitting on any sweeping agreements.
\
""The pivotal movement was that Friday afternoon where we, and I, said: 'We've got to do it now or it's not going to happen,' "" Daudt later said.
\
With that attitude, the leaders and Dayton stopped their meeting in the mansion's grand piano room, which had been the site of hours of talks, so lawmakers could speak without the governor.
\
They then worked out what turned into the budget the Legislature approved.
\
""It came together within the course of two hours,"" Daudt said.
\
Daudt and Bakk told Dayton of their plans in a gracious conversation and set off for a television appearance.
\
Meanwhile, Dayton and Lt. Gov. Tina Smith and Education Commissioner Brenda Cassellius picked over the portion of the budget lawmakers set aside for preschool through high school funding.
\
The money - $400 million in new spending against the backdrop of a $1.9 billion surplus - was not adequate, they decided. After all, the current budget, created while the state was struggling with deficits, had a $600 million increase for schools.
\
""I won't accept anything less than $550 (million),"" Dayton pledged that Friday night.
\
Smith said of the Legislature: ""In my mind, they cast the dice.""
\
They bargained for a deal, without the governor, which is their prerogative, both Smith and Dayton said. The governor has the prerogative to sign or veto their results.
\
BACK AT THE CAPITOL
\
Despite their triumphant announcement on the residence lawn May 15, the leaders knew they still had only the bones of a budget.
\
Daudt quickly told the House Republicans about the deal. He won applause - although the plans had the state spending $2 billion more than many wanted, there would be no gas tax increase and they would finish on time.
\
The legislative leaders then huddled in Minnesota's State Office Building until midnight. On the fourth floor, Daudt, Majority Leader Joyce Peppin, R-Rogers, and Republican House executive director Ben Golnik turned their work spaces into musical offices to share with DFLers, their staff and committee leads from both parties.
\
As health care committee chairs were inside, transportation committee chairs waited their turn.
\
""It was kind of a rush at that point to get it done on time,"" Daudt said. ""There were a lot of little things to get figured out.""
\
IMAGINE: NO TAX BILL
\
As others poked in and out of those small group meetings, House Taxes Chairman Greg Davids, R-Preston, was down the hall.
\
""Imagine there's no tax bill,"" he sang, ""It's easy if you try.""
\
Davids had crafted House plans for $2.2 billion in tax cuts. The bill passed the GOP-controlled House and Davids was fully prepared to slice it down to get it passed in the Senate and sent to Dayton.
\
""I was stunned when I got the news that they cut the deal on the finance bills, but they hadn't agreed on a tax bill or a transportation bill,"" Davids said later.
\
Outside the fourth floor offices, Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis, was similarly mournful but resolved. He had worked for years to get the state to spend more on roads, bridges and transit. This was supposed to be his year.
\
Instead, he waited for a long stretch to be told what Bakk had been publicly saying for weeks - the House had to give up its tax-cut plans and the Senate would give up their transportation plans.
\
Dibble said later: ""Even then I thought, there's still a lot of time till Monday. ... I've seen bigger deals come together in shorter times.""
\
It did not happen. Dibble's job for the next 72 hours became working with House Transportation Chair Tim Kelly, R-Red Wing, to put together a measure to keep the transportation ""lights on.""
\
While Dibble was disappointed, Bakk was surprised.
\
A man who loves the art of the deal and plans months in advance for any eventuality, Bakk believed the state would usher in a gas tax increase this year.
\
""I underestimated their resolve on the gas tax,"" Bakk said, the day after the session adjourned Monday.
\
He said he had long prepared to exchange tax cuts for transportation increases.
\
""I could have done a $660 million tax bill in exchange for a gas tax,"" Bakk said. ""I really thought that deal was there. ...The business community would have gotten huge tax relief out of this session.""
\
Transportation was his top priority. Cutting taxes was Daudt's. Now, they were both gone.
\
Funding for schools, particularly universal preschool, was the governor's priority.
\
""The governor seems to still want to stay and fight,"" Bakk said.
\
SAVING EDUCATION INCREASE?
\
On Monday, the final day of the Legislative session, the Dayton administration and education experts were on a salvage mission.
\
With a few hours left in the session, a tired Sen. Charles Wiger, DFL-Maplewood, stepped off the Senate floor into his dimly lit office. Wiger suggested there was a deal in the making to satisfy Dayton and House Republicans who were firmly against universal preschool. He was ""optimistic and very hopeful.""
\
Outside the House chamber, state Rep. Jenifer Loon, R-Eden Prairie, chatted quietly with someone while an education lobbyist waited to hand her a letter of thanks.
\
A compromise was close. ""There might be a path forward, if we can get everyone to agree,"" Loon said.
\
House leaders and the Dayton administration had started talking again Monday afternoon. First with a phone call, then with a meeting in Daudt's office and messages flying back and forth, and then a final face-to-face just off the House floor.
\
They came aching close.
\
The House agreed to add another $100 million to education spending, increasing the education budget by $500 million for the biennium.
\
The Dayton administration agreed to drop its universal preschool plan in exchange for funding other programs, reduce its ask by $25 million and give a pledge that the rest of the budget become law. In the end, with Daudt still busy putting out brushfires on other issues, they were stuck $25 million apart.
\
""When you are that close, it is hard to imagine that you wouldn't come to a conclusion, if you had the time,"" Smith said afterward. But she added: ""Deals get made in a specific time and place.""
\
DEALS WERE CUT
\
While trying to negotiate an education compromise, Daudt and Bakk were also saving other measures. House and Senate specialists on state government funding, environment funding and jobs budgets were stymied.
\
Leadership stepped in.
\
""We just helped them get to conclusion for the most part. We didn't order them: 'You have to do this or you have to that,' "" Daudt said.
\
Deals were cut. Among the provisions slipped into bills:
\
A requirement that the Office of the Legislative Auditor audit the state auditor, a constitutional office elected in its own right, and that counties be allowed to privatize their audits. Dayton
\
signed that measure into law Saturday but said he hopes lawmakers will fix the language related to the state auditor.
\
Abolishing the 48-year-old Citizens' Board of the Pollution Control Agency. Dayton vetoed that budget bill Saturday, saying it would destroy environmental protections.
\
Including $4 million in funding for aircraft maker Cirrus to build out its facility in DFL-friendly Duluth in a jobs budget bill designed to mitigate DFLers irate at the environment measure. Dayton vetoed that measure for other reasons Saturday.
\
Lawmakers also crafted a much larger proposal in the final hours - a plan to borrow $100 million for capital projects around the state.
\
The chairmen of the Senate and House capital investment committees, Sen. LeRoy Stumpf, DFL-Plummer, and Rep. Paul Torkelson, R-Hanska, exchanged ideas on what could be included and consulted with minority leaders because they needed a supermajority to pass a bonding bill.
\
The Senate passed its $107 million bonding bill on a bipartisan 54-10 vote just before Monday's midnight deadline. Bakk had inserted a provision providing funding for a $7.2 million underground 30-stall parking ramp at the northwest corner of the Capitol grounds.
\
Bakk later said the measure, which did not become law, would have allowed the state to build the ramp if needed and if cheaper options were not suitable. House DFLers and Republicans said they would never approve the ramp money.
\
Meanwhile, Daudt told DFLers he planned to put a $100 million plan drafted by House Republicans to a vote on the floor.
\
Torkelson said he received the final version of the bill between 11:15 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. Monday. As it was being handed out, a few members glanced at it; one tossed it immediately in the trash.
\
The ranking DFLer on the House bonding committee, Rep. Alice Hausman of St. Paul, said: ""I didn't expect it to get any DFL votes.""
\
Knowing that message, Daudt decided not to try to get the measure passed.
\
NEXT
\
Dayton plans to ask lawmakers to return to St. Paul in the coming weeks to complete a budget he can sign. Addressing the vetoed education bill - almost 40 percent of the entire budget - will be a key.
\
Daudt will meet again with Dayton on Tuesday. He wants to start from the end point - only $25 million apart and no universal preschool.
\
""We were fairly close, so I hope that we can just pick up where we left off,"" Daudt said.
\
Dayton has signaled he wants to start fresh. On Saturday, he said he would like lawmakers to approve $650 million for schools, $250 million more than the Legislature approved, and a voluntary preschool program.
\
Meanwhile, several legislators are hoping to address other unfinished business during the extra session.
\
Both Torkelson and Hausman said they hope they can pass a bonding bill during the special session. Also left on the table was a Legacy bill dishing out some $400 million in cash to Minnesota outdoors and cultural projects. Dayton said Saturday that he hopes both measures will be on a special session agenda.
\
But nothing has come easy this session. Even figuring out where to hold the special session has caused problems.
\
Dayton said his staff would help find a location - the Capitol is torn up for its renovation - but Daudt said there is no need.
\
""We, in the House and the Senate, are responsible for looking for our space,"" Daudt said. ""We certainly can do that on our own.""

"
140," Next time you pull into the corner gas station and notice that prices still hover near $3 a gallon, consider this question: Are high gasoline prices good or bad?\ Bad is the most obvious answer, with fuel now taking a bigger bite of your income and threatening to drive prices higher for everything else. Indeed, high energy prices can't be good for the general condition of the economy in the short term.\ But higher prices have a way of changing behavior, and, for the longer-term health of the nation, better behavior is not a bad thing. Americans need to curb their excessive gasoline consumption for a bunch of reasons, ranging from air pollution and global warming to suburban sprawl and obesity, to an unhealthy dependence on foreign oil and the attendant risks of war and terrorism.\ Even before hurricanes pushed prices higher, Americans were responding to the rising cost of gasoline. Demand is running nearly 3 percent behind last year. Sales of SUVs and pickups are down 30 percent. Transit ridership is up nationwide - and about 13 percent higher in the Twin Cities, where light rail drew a record 838,000 riders in August, 83 percent above projections. Southwest Metro's express buses also set records. Even bicycle sales were brisk, running 5.3 percent ahead of last year's pace nationwide. And high demand for close-in housing continues.\ Those are all good trends that need further encouragement from policymakers. In preparing to slice pork from the recently passed $286 billion transportation act to help pay for hurricane relief, Congress should protect projects that conserve fuel and promote energy independence. Yes, there's considerable fat. But to label non- auto projects as ""frivolous"" and ""low-priority,"" as some critics have done, leads Congress down the wrong path. The crux of the nation's energy problem is excessive driving alone. To encourage more of that is akin to offering more fried chicken to a fat man.\ Among responsible steps are higher fuel-efficiency standards, new engine technologies, some forms of road pricing and higher - not lower - fuel taxes.\ Even at $3 per gallon, the cost of gasoline (including taxes) fails to reflect the true cost of driving. Federal and state gasoline taxes would have to increase 2 1/2 times (from about 40 cents to more than a dollar per gallon) to begin to cover the costs of congestion, pollution and accidents, according to economists Ian Parry and Kenneth Small. Military and foreign policy costs would push the tax far higher. A gas tax hike of that magnitude would be politically impossible and economically foolish, yet the nation needs a major commitment - perhaps even, as New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman suggests, a new Manhattan Project on energy independence - to begin moving slowly, steadily and inexorably away from its current fuel addiction.\ Rather than President Bush's push to frame a fearful us-them clash of civilizations with radical Islam, imagine a leader who would really muster all of America's imagination and innovative spirit to, on our own terms, wean ourselves from habits that risk our environment and our safety. Terrorists don't hate our freedoms as much as our appetites. Next time you pull up to the pump, consider both the bad and good of higher gas prices.\ .\ European taxes reflect driving's truer cost\ Europeans use high gasoline taxes to dicourage excessive driving and to promote alternatives.\ .\ Regular automobile gas price on Aug. 8\ Belgium: $4.82\ France: $4.96\ Italy: $5.36\ Austria: $4.66\ United Kingdom: $6.40\ *United States: $2.33\ (See microfilm for complete chart.)\ .\ NOTE: Prices reflect exchange rates Aug. 26\ * Average national cost of regular gas.\ Sources: European Commission; AAA"
141," Bills aimed at tightening Minnesota's outdoor air quality standards, improving enforcement and rewarding energy efficiencies were announced Tuesday by DFL legislators in collaboration with the Sierra Club.\ But at least one Republican said the measures were responses to exaggerated environmental threats.\ Rep. Betty Folliard, DFL-Hopkins, has introduced a bill that would require that concentrations of key air contaminants be reduced to or below 2000 benchmark levels by 2007. A 1999 study by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) indicated that air concentrations of 10 toxic chemicals across parts of Minnesota exceeded health guidelines and increased cancer risks. Most of the chemicals were produced by vehicles.\ Sen. Ellen Anderson, DFL-St. Paul, said she will introduce a bill providing rebates and other incentives for energy-efficient appliances and vehicles, and another measure to reduce the gas tax on energy-efficient fuels.\ Folliard will introduce a bill increasing funding for the MPCA, which is projecting an $8 million budget shortage for the next two years, forcing layoffs.\ They announced their efforts at a news conference as part of the Sierra Club's Minnesota Air Toxics Campaign, a cleaner-air enforcement and educational program that also involves the American Lung Association, the Women's Cancer Resource Center and other environmental and conservation groups.\ Sen. Dan Stevens, R-Mora, noted other studies showing that other air pollutants have decreased in Minnesota, and said air quality efforts should be directed indoors, where Minnesotans spend most of their time.\ ""If they want to throw millions at this problem, the people of Minnesota need to know how extremely minimal the results will be,"" Stevens said.\ - Bill McAuliffe\ Group to examine kids,\ environmental effects\ House and Senate leaders are forming a task force to look at environmental health concerns for children.\ ""It's an emerging issue on the national level,"" said Sen. Jane Krentz, DFL-May Township.\ Several issues are likely to be discussed, including the toxic chemicals used in methamphetamine labs, food poisoning, indoor air quality, lead poisoning, asthma and pesticides.\ Those were some of the top environmental risks for children cited by Health Department officials during a joint House/Senate meeting of environment and natural resources committees.\ The working group - made up of 10 legislators - won't craft bills. Instead, it will study the issue in depth and report back to the committees that would pass legislation.\ - Associated Press\ Ventura transportation\ plan finds support\ Gov. Jesse Ventura should not give up on a transportation plan he unsuccessfully pushed last session, members of the Senate Transportation Committee told a top transportation official.\ ""If you strike out, you don't sit down at the plate and pout because you didn't get a home run,"" Sen. Mark Ourada, R-Buffalo, told Assistant Transportation Department Commissioner Doug Weiszhaar.\ ""Take the opportunity because it may not come this way again,"" agreed Sen. Dean Johnson, a Willmar DFLer. Johnson said legislators are virtually united in their interest in spending more on transportation this year.\ The members were responding to a statement by Weiszhaar, who told them not to expect the department to play the role of a lobbyist, pushing specific issues, this session. Last year, Ventura said he was ""tremendously disappointed"" with a transportation bill, which he said was shortsighted because it didn't set up a long-term funding stream for road, bridge and transit projects.\ - Associated Press\ Panel narrows list of candidates\ for `U' regent spots to 25\ An advisory panel has boiled down its list of potential University of Minnesota regents to 25 people who will vie for five spots.\ The Regent Candidate Advisory Council whittled down the list from 134 applications for the board that sets policies for the four- campus university. The Legislature will make its final picks this spring.\ A third of the 12 regent slots are open every two years. There is one regent from each of the eight congressional districts and four from the state at large. One of the at-large regents must be a student at the time of selection.\ This year, legislators will award unpaid six-year terms to one student, two other at-large regents and one Fifth Congressional District regent. Another at-large regent will be selected to replace William Peterson, who died this fall and whose term was to expire in 2005.\ Three regents are seeking reappointment: board chairwoman Patricia Spence, Michael O'Keefe and Warren Larson.\ After interviews later this month, the advisory panel will forward to the Legislature the names of two to four candidates for each opening. The House and Senate meet in a joint session to pick regents.\ - Associated Press"
142,"-RSEC-\ Unable to reach agreement on their major conflicts, Minnesota House and Senate leaders acknowledged Tuesday that they will miss a self-imposed deadline of adjournment by Easter and instead will meet this morning to plot an exit strategy for early April.\ Three months into the legislative session, the two bodies remain far apart on most issues. The Senate, for instance, seeks an $884 million tax increase over four years to help balance the budget; the House, zero.\ The House would reduce spending by nearly $350 million over the same period, with heavy cuts in human services. Aside from bonding, virtually the only new spending it backs is $22 million for homeland security.\ The Senate's cuts are minimal: a $100,000 nick at state agencies. At the same time, it would fund $613 million in new spending, with a third of that devoted to K-12 schools.\ Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, DFL-Erskine, and House Speaker Steve Sviggum, R-Kenyon, emerged from an impromptu meeting in Moe's office Tuesday to announce that the ""global"" agreement on budget and tax matters they had hoped to reach today will take longer.\ Today's meeting will include nearly 30 House and Senate members - sponsors of all the major budget bills and key minority members.\ ""We're trying to establish some parameters to begin this discussion, to see how all the pieces are interlinked and interlocked,"" Moe said.\ While end-of-session negotiations are nearly always difficult, this one is rife not only with major budget differences, but organizational complexities.\ The Senate deals with budget balancing in a single budget reconciliation bill, while the House has pieces of its budget plan in 11 different bills. The House funds anti-terrorism efforts through its bonding bill; the Senate does not.\ After today's organizational summit, Moe said, ""we will have an understanding of where everything's at so we can start to pull all of the pieces together and hope that we can work toward some resolution of this by early next week.""\ Sviggum said the biggest differences are on four major issues: homeland security bills, bonding, highway and transit spending, and bills to balance the remaining $439 million budget shortfall projected for 2002-03.\ After today, legislators are scheduled to head home for a five- day break, returning Tuesday. Moe and Sviggum said they are committed to reaching agreement soon, perhaps by early next week.\ Pressure is on\ Personal and political factors are adding to the pressure for adjournment.\ A recently released redistricting map changes the boundaries of virtually every district - some dramatically. As a result, most legislators have new voters in their districts and are eager to get to work sooner than usual on reelection campaigns.\ Moreover, Moe and Republican House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty, R-Eagan, as well as Sen. Becky Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, are running for governor and have tough endorsement fights on their hands.\ Nevertheless, Moe signaled Tuesday that he is willing to fight hard - and long, if necessary - to pass a sizable transportation and transit package, as opposed to the modest measure approved by the House on Tuesday.\ ""I'm willing to stay a long time to get a transportation package,"" said Moe, who called it a ""paramount issue"" for the state.\ Major differences\ The differences between the House and Senate are profound.\ The biggest of these is the 60-cent-per-pack cigarette tax increase, which the Senate uses to restore $500 million to the budget reserve. The House says it will not support a tax increase to resolve the state's budget problem.\ The Senate also has a 6-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase, which it uses to fund $5 billion in transportation and transit projects over 10 years. The House's $750 million transportation package relies on the sale of trunk highway bonds.\ Although Sviggum has said throughout the session that a gas tax increase dedicated to road and bridge projects was a possibility, much of his caucus remains opposed to such an increase. Despite Sviggum's assertion Tuesday that he would not rule out such an increase, the chances of agreement between the House and Senate on any tax increase appear uncertain.\ In addition to its budget cuts, the House also would go into the state's tobacco endowment funds, transferring $347 million to the revenue-starved general fund. The Senate would reserve use of the endowment fund only for cash-flow purposes, with the money to be repaid.\ The Senate's approach also relies on $349 million in education and human services accounting shifts, which on paper allow the state to count revenue earlier. It is a method that is financially painless, but it is considered a less than optimal accounting practice. The House does not use similar shifts in its plan.\ Sviggum said that despite the differences, common ground exists.\ ""The common ground is that we're going to solve the budget without reducing any commitments to education, without reducing any commitment to nursing homes,"" he said.\ ""We both have a transportation package and homeland security packages. That is the common ground. We should be able to work out the differences.""\ - Patricia Lopez is at plopez@startribune.com. . How far apart?

143,"It's that point in the Minnesota legislative session when the debate has come down to a very unglamorous subject: math.\Republicans, who control the state House, recently offered up a budget plan that essentially leaves spending on most state programs flat, reserving a projected $900 million surplus this year open to spend on tax cuts and transportation. DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and the Democrats who control the state Senate want to spend much of that money on things like education and racial equity.\Republicans have criticized Democrats' ability to do ""simple math,"" saying Minnesotans expect government to take care of its most basic functions first. Likewise, Democrats criticized Republicans for their budget math, which does not yet include the price of their tax cuts. Democrats expect the Republicans' proposed tax cuts to cost far more than $900 million surplus available.\As committees work through the budget numbers, taking a swipe at the other side's math is a wonky -- if boring -- tradition in St. Paul. Yet the underlying numbers illustrate a serious issue going forward: at the halfway point of a historically short 10-week session, Minnesota lawmakers are still miles apart on just about every key issue in front of the Legislature this year. To name a few:\* Democrats want to spend $85-$100 million on increasing broadband infrastructure in rural Minnesota; Republicans are proposing to spend around $40 million, some of that in a future budgeting year.\* Democrats want to spend $91-$100 million to address racial inequalities in the state; Republicans have proposed spending no money on the issue.\* Democrats in the Senate and governor's office have proposed an approximately $1.4 billion bonding bill for construction projects this year; Republicans want a $600 million bonding bill.\* Democrats want to increase the state's gas tax to pay for billions of dollars in transportation projects over the next decade; Republicans say that can be done with money the state already has.\There are other factors that complicate getting any deals done. Technically, it's not a budgeting year in Minnesota, so nothing has to be done with the surplus money right now, which takes some pressure off legislators to reach agreement. What's more, all 201 legislative seats are on the ballot in the fall, turning the Capitol into a sort of pre-election staging ground where campaign themes are born. Both sides are already suggesting the other party wants a ""do-nothing"" session in order to use it as a campaign issue this fall.\""I'd like to see a successful session. Minnesotans expect that, they have a right to it,"" Dayton, who is not up for re-election, told reporters Monday. ""But it's very difficult when you have a divided government and people with very different ideas and ideologies.""\Surplus spending plans compared\Gov.

Back then, Republicans wanted to pass more than $2 billion in tax cuts; Democrats wanted to increase gas taxes to pay for road and bridge projects for the next decade. When the two sides couldn't find agreement on either, those issues were pushed aside in order to pass a budget without going into a government shutdown.\Those issues are back on the table again, basically back where they left off last year. And many still see transportation, taxes and now a third issue -- bonding -- as inextricably tied together. For example, Republicans want to include significant money for road and bridge infrastructure in their bonding bill, while Democrats include a tax increase in their transportation bill.\""There won't be a bonding bill if there's not a tax bill and a transportation bill,"" said Rep. Greg Davids, R-Preston, chair of the House Taxes Committee. ""I've been saying that for months and months. People say, 'Oh are you linking them?' I said, 'Yeah, they're linked.'""\Even if the proposals are linked, Davids said he's optimistic. He named his tax bill after the Journey song, ""Don't Stop Believin',"" -- a sentiment Davids says he still holds about the legislation. ""I think my tax bill was aptly named back in 2015, even though I had no clue it would be going this long,"" he said. ""I believe we can get something done.""\But part of the problem goes back to, yes, the math. On taxes, Dayton has proposed a $117 million package with a credit for child care and education expenses, Senate Democrats want a $300 million proposal with property tax relief and credits for veterans; Davids is still waiting on a final tax budget target from House leadership. The House bill passed last year was worth more than $2 billion in tax cuts, but that was spread out over two years, and projections for tax collections have changed since then. Davids is hoping for a final bill somewhere in the $400-$600 million range.\Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk said the House tax numbers are ""woefully inaccurate.""\""They continue to talk about all the things they are going to do in the tax area, [well] show me the money,"" Bakk said. ""Because it just isn't there.""\Tough math on bonding bill\In his spare time, Bakk has also been doing another kind of math: Vote counting. He closely watched the House's vote earlier this session to extend unemployment benefits to miners on the Iron Range, an industry that's in the midst of a severe downturn. In all, 17 Republicans voted against granting the unemployment benefits extensions.\To Bakk, that means those are going to be tough votes to get for things like spending bills and the the bonding bill. ""That tells me they're not willing to spend on anything,"" he said. ""Nothing.""\By Bakk's calculations, that could be a particular problem for the bonding bill, which requires a three-fifths majority to pass. That means the parties in control of each chamber need help from the opposing side to pass a bill. If there's more than a dozen Republicans who won't vote for a bonding bill, Bakk said, it means Daudt has to get even more votes from House Democrats.\That won't happen without them moving their $600 million bonding target closer to the $1 billion-plus proposal Bakk and Dayton want, he said. ""They are going to come our direction. They are going to come a long ways our direction.""\Transportation stuck in the middle\And still bouncing between the bonding, budget and tax debate is transportation. Republicans are still rejecting the idea of a gas tax increase and promoting the transportation budget bill they passed last year, which proposes spending $7 billion over 10 years through bonding and a transfer of $300 million in sales taxes on auto parts and repairs into road and bridge accounts.\After Senate Democrats released their budget plan, Daudt criticized them for not including more spending in their budget targets for transportation. ""With a $900 million surplus, I cannot believe Democrats are spending almost nothing on roads and bridges,"" he said.\But House Republicans have yet to redo their math on the transportation bill to figure out how much it will cost in the new year. House Ways and Means Chairman Jim Knoblach, R-St. Cloud, said he's waiting on word from leadership to hear what their total target will be this session.\""Now we are at the point where the proverbial rubber meets the road, I guess that's a good metaphor for transportation, right?"" Knoblach said. ""I think there's a lot of discussion going on early. I don't think anyone wants to get down to the last days like we did last year. I certainly don't want to.""\But with the state's revised budget forecast in February, which cut the projected surplus from $1.2 billion down to $900 million, Bakk said he's worried about the state's fiscal integrity in years to come. He doesn't want to commit to much money in ""the tails,"" a legislative term for future budgets. So instead of linking the taxes and transportation bill, Bakk wants Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt to pick which one he wants more.\""He is going to have to figure out which bill he wants, the transportation bill or the tax bill,"" Bakk said. ""Because there's not enough money for both.""\Credit: Briana Bierschbach"
144," One more log got kicked out of the state budget logjam Monday, but it's still a serious jam and time is running out.\ The countdown to an adjournment deadline for the Minnesota Legislature slipped to less than one week as top elected leaders met in private negotiations on nine major appropriations and tax bills necessary to provide a state budget for the next two years.\ Agreement on a bottom-line spending target was reached on just one, the bill funding higher-education.\ The leaders - Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty, DFL Senate Majority Leader Dean Johnson, and Republican House Speaker Steve Sviggum - conducted an informal rolling negotiating session with committee leaders and cabinet officials coming and going all afternoon and evening.\ ""We are pleased that we were able to work together tonight diligently,"" Pawlenty said. ""We do have substantial work completed, or at least underway.""\ ""There was very positive movement today,"" Sviggum said, but he acknowledged that the much bigger disputes over the total level of spending and how to get more revenue for additional spending sought by both sides are still not being addressed.\ ""Everything seems to be coming down to resources, and we don't seem to be having that discussion,"" he said.\ The higher-education agreement calls for total funding of $2.761 billion for the state's colleges and universities. That's about a 10 percent increase over the current two-year budget period and enough to slow down tuition increases, said Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, chairwoman of the Higher Education Budget Division.\ ""At least we're not going backward,"" Pappas said, adding that annual tuition increases at the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities and the University of Minnesota systems are expected to be held next year to 4 to 7 percent.\ On the overall budget, the Senate and House are about $1.4 billion apart on how much they propose to spend over the next two years. The DFL-led Senate's bottom line is about $31.2 billion, compared with about $29.8 billion for the governor and the Republican-controlled House. ""We're continuing to make offers and counteroffers on environment and agriculture, and the state government spending bills,"" Johnson said Monday night.\ Far apart as the sides are, the mood was cordial in a joint press conference late Monday night assessing progress. Johnson joked that ""getting a couple bucks from these two (Pawlenty and Sviggum) is tougher than getting bucks from Lutherans on Sunday morning when you pass the plate."" Johnson is a Lutheran minister.\ Sviggum noted that even many House DFLers voted against the Senate's $1.3 billion in tax increases, and ""the (Senate) tax bill is just not going to be available.""\ On two bills that fund the most expensive functions of state government - the K-12 education system and health and human services - chasms yawn. Sviggum said DFLers are about $165 million higher on K-12 and about $500 million higher for health and human services.\ Moreover, a fundamental disagreement on tax policy divides the Senate from Pawlenty and the House. DFLers have called for higher income taxes on wage earners in the top 3 percent in income, raising some $800 million over two years. The House bill has a 10-cent-per- gallon increase in the gas tax earmarked for roads and highways, and less of a general fund revenue increase overall.\ Over the weekend, agreement was reached on a spending target for another major bill, for public safety. The bill contains about $1.65 billion, or a 16 percent increase in spending over the current budget period. It includes funding for tougher penalties on sex offenders and initiatives to combat the epidemic of methamphetamine abuse. Thus, two of 10 major bills have been agreed to.\ Agreement on targets for the spending bills is only the beginning as conference committees have to reconcile the House and Senate versions of bills.\ Because so little progress has been made, many lobbyists and observers have been predicting that an overall accord is not likely before the midnight May 23 deadline. That would necessitate a special session, which hasn't been so special or unusual in the past seven years, when different parties control the House and Senate.\ Pessimism about a timely end seemed to be growing Monday. Johnson said that the House's failure so far to even appoint conferees to the Taxes Conference Committee shows a ""lack of leadership and a bit of dej[unke0] vu, from last year"" when the Legislature sputtered to a historically unproductive deadlock.\ ""But we're still committed to a Monday adjournment,"" he said. ""As long as the music plays, the dance is still ongoing.""\ Sviggum said there is ""only a slight chance of being able to get done. We have the time, it's the issues and the personalities that are the most difficult to reconcile.""\ .\ Dane Smith is at rdsmith@startribune.com."
145," You choose. Either continue to pay $975 a year - the estimated, somewhat hidden annual cost that each Twin Cities driver pays in wasted time and wasted fuel while stuck in traffic - and get nothing for it except, perhaps, lots of aggravation and the knowledge that you're adding to the problems of climate change and foreign oil dependency. Or pay $250 more a year on gasoline and sales taxes and get far better freeways and a vastly expanded transit system that helps the environment, reduces your stress and saves on energy.\ We'll take the second choice. It's the choice that Minnesota's Senate and House transportation committees have laid out as a challenge, both to their legislative colleagues and to a governor who seems intent on avoiding the transportation subject. Tim Pawlenty's own meager plan excludes new taxes and raises less than one-fifth of the $1 billion a year that the transportation committees propose. The governor does it largely with borrowed money, leaving the bill for someone else to pay.\ Borrowing makes sense for the occasional capital project - a new interchange, a bridge replacement, etc. But that's not the nature of Minnesota's problem. The state, for more than 20 years, has neglected to build roads and transit to match its population growth. The result is a massive and systematic underinvestment. It will take years to catch up. What's required is not sporadic borrowing and a cowardly pushing of repayments to future generations, but a major infusion of courage. Only higher taxes can produce the steady, sustained revenue streams needed to restore Minnesota to the levels of safety and respectability that its residents deserve. No one likes higher taxes, but that's the price that must be paid for years of neglect. Minnesota is one of only five states that have not raised their gas tax in the last two decades. The declining value of that tax (actually a user fee) is responsible for the shabby condition of so many roads and the forced hikes of local property taxes to partially compensate.\ On transit, the state has stubbornly prevented the metropolitan counties from raising the half-cent sales tax that Denver, Dallas, San Diego, Phoenix and other peer regions have used to build extensive rail systems. These systems are especially important as the era of cheap gasoline draws to a close and as regions compete for talent and, by extension, for prosperity. In no other metro region has congestion grown so fast yet received so feeble a response as in the Twin Cities. Without significant progress on the transportation mess in this legislative session, both parties will have failed. Opponents, especially the governor, who has promised a veto, should have to explain why continuing to take baby steps on transportation is the best option.\ Voters helped last fall by approving a constitutional shift of auto sales tax revenues to transportation. That was a nice downpayment, but it filled only 20 percent of the hole. Much is left to do, especially with a million more people and a million more cars likely to arrive in the next two decades. Without a bold step, the Texas Transportation Institute's estimate of 43 hours wasted in Twin Cities traffic per year and the $975 price tag that goes with it can only rise to ever higher and more intolerable levels. Better to start the flow of investment now.\ .\ HOUSE, SENATE BILLS\ - Raise state gas tax by 10 cents per gallon to finance roads.\ - Allow metro counties to raise sales tax by a half cent to finance transit.\ - Raise wheelage taxes and license tab fees."
146,"Business leaders, worried about Minnesota's workforce shortage, taxes and health care costs, listened carefully Wednesday night as Gov. Tim Walz's administration and legislators set out their vision for the state's future.\In his first address to the business community since he was sworn in, Walz, a Democrat, said he understands worries about overtaxation and wants to make sure tax dollars are spent effectively. He also said his administration will listen to business owners' concerns about onerous regulations.\""We, as government, need to not see you as coming to us to try to get around something,"" Walz told the crowd at an annual Minnesota Chamber of Commerce event. ""You are bringing those things up because you feel that they're not effective, burdensome and costly to your business, without improving the lives of workers or the environment.""\While the state's major business groups largely supported Republican candidates this election season, members of the business community said they are optimistic about working with Walz, whom they described as pragmatic.\""He's a guy that, I think, will get in front of issues as opposed to coming in at the end, which I think will be a refreshing -- I'll just go ahead and say it -- change at the Legislature,"" Minnesota Chamber of Commerce President Doug Loon said.\Policy details were scant as four members of Walz's cabinet, the commissioners who oversee employment and economic development, commerce, transportation, and labor and industry answered questions on a panel Wednesday. But Loon said he was encouraged that so many commissioners participated on short notice, some of them appointed just last week.\Commerce Commissioner Steve Kelley talked about expanding rural broadband access and creating more jobs in the renewable energy sector. Department of Employment and Economic Development Commissioner Steve Grove, who is returning to Minnesota from Silicon Valley, where he was founding director of Google News Lab, said he wants to make Minnesota a friendlier place for startup businesses.\In her initial pitch to business leaders for an increased gas tax, Department of Transportation Commissioner Margaret Anderson Kelliher said that in the next six years, the state faces a transportation ""funding cliff.""\""This is about prosperity,"" she said. ""This is about connecting people. It's about connecting goods to people.""\Chamber airs priorities\The chamber also laid out its legislative session priorities Wednesday, many of which conflicted with Democrats' goals.\In addition to increasing the gas tax, a new Democratic majority in the Minnesota House and the Walz administration want to expand MinnesotaCare to allow anyone to buy in and expand paid family and medical leave requirements.\Meanwhile, the chamber's list of legislative priorities includes: ""Oppose 'one-size fits all' labor mandates that are unfeasible for the variety of workplaces across Minnesota."" And under a health care heading it states: ""Oppose destabilizing expansions of government programs.""\Like the Republican majority in the state Senate, the chamber suggested dedicating all of the auto parts sales tax to paying for transportation rather than a gas tax increase.\""The expansion of taxes is really what we're concerned about,"" said Tom Taylor, president of the Shippers Resource Center in Burnsville, who was watching to see what the governor would say about taxes at Wednesday night's event.\However, Taylor noted that he's not completely opposed to raising the gas tax slightly as long as it goes to paying for roads and bridges, not transit. He said Walz, a former congressman, seemed to take a middle-of-the-road approach in Washington, D.C., and he hopes that continues.\Other attendees at the chamber event said they hope legislators work on expanding workforce housing and child care, particularly in greater Minnesota. Some said they want clarity and continuity in environmental regulations, and yet others said the state needs to better align education with workforce needs, to channel people into jobs.\State House and Senate leaders echoed those concerns when they spoke at the chamber's event. The Republican and Democratic leaders agreed that child care, housing and health care are all important in determining whether Minnesota is an affordable place to live.\But they disagreed about how to keep costs down and how to improve education.\The chamber and the Minnesota Business Partnership both spent heavily to try to keep Republicans in power in the House. Charlie Weaver, who leads the Business Partnership, said that while his organization disagrees with Democrats on some issues, he has known House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn, for a long time and she comes from a small-business background -- her family owns a used auto parts business in Blaine.\He also said he has texted and talked with Walz a few times since he was sworn in, which he said is far more communication than he had with former Gov. Mark Dayton. He said four of Walz's commissioners reached out to him on the day they were appointed.\""I've been very impressed with the open communication of both the governor and his administration so far,"" he said.

According to media reports, it wasn't until four days after Katrina hit - as he was finally flying to the Gulf Coast to have a little look-see and tell ""Brownie"" (FEMA Director Michael Brown) what a ""heckuva job"" he was doing - that Bush watched a slapped-together DVD of the news.\ Goldberg and Bush get it.

Members of his own House Republican caucus helped propose one of those increases - a modest 10-cent gas tax increase dedicated to transportation. Apparently, Sviggum prefers that we build much-needed roads and transit with money borrowed from the contractors themselves (also Gov. Tim Pawlenty's solution). Then what?\ Minnesota has a proud tradition of AAA bond ratings, fine schools, a great university, sound infrastructure and a secure safety net for our most vulnerable citizens. We know that excellence requires an investment.\ Under Pawlenty and Sviggum, we have lost that bond rating, our schools are in distress while property taxes soar, University of Minnesota students have seen 80 percent tuition increases, our road congestion is strangling business, and every year we make cuts to those formerly covered by MinnesotaCare.\ Is this what Sviggum is so proud of? The Republican House and governor have masterminded a decaying fiscal structure, including higher borrowing costs, levying $1.2 billion in new ""fees,"" shifting costs from one year to the next, and selling off state assets. That's quite a legacy.\ In November let's remember at least this one thing: This traffic jam was brought to you by Gov.

That means a judge heard the FBI's petition and, based on the evidence, determined that a search warrant was justified.\ From reading the editorial, one would think this was a case of President Bush ordering the FBI to storm Jefferson's office.

148,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Rep. Jim Oberstar is heading toward a collision with the Obama administration as he begins revealing details today of a six-year, $500 billion transportation overhaul bill that the Minnesota Democrat wants signed into law before October.\Just yesterday, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that while the administration also wants critical reforms, it would like to put the brakes on Oberstar's massive revamp, essentially calling for an 18-month extension of the existing law.\But Oberstar, a senior House Democrat and powerful chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has remained undeterred by the administration, insistent that Congress must pass a new and transformative law before the current one expires on Sept. 31.\""Delay is unacceptable,"" Oberstar said Wednesday. ""Extension of time, extension of the current law is unacceptable. This is the moment to move.""\Simply put, the Surface Transportation Authorization Act would be the most ambitious revision of the nation's transportation system in over 50 years, since the national highway system was first created. For Oberstar, who began his four-decade career as a lead staffer on the Transportation Committee (then the Committee on Public Works), the legislation would represent a crowning achievement.\Oberstar's blueprint calls for an overarching National Transportation Strategic Plan that would highlight priority ""megaprojects"" around the country. For the first time, different modes of transportation -- highway, rail, air and water -- would be coordinated as one system in order to maximize efficiency. A new undersecretary would be appointed to oversee and organize the ""intermodal"" system and the different federal agencies that would be involved.\Big changes\The plan would also terminate more than 75 federal transportation programs, significantly boost funding for public transit, set aside roughly $50 billion for high-speed intercity rail, and impose annual reporting guidelines and project benchmarks on states.\""We get this passed... within two years we will make dramatic transformations in the way states manage their programs and the way funds are invested,"" said Oberstar, adding, ""the public will know what is happening with their dollars.""\In their blueprint (PDF), committee members argue that such a major change is required to fix a system that has not kept up with the country and now displays crippling and costly congestion, unnecessary carbon emissions and deteriorating highways and bridges that have led to many catastrophes, including the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge two years ago.\""Most observers agree that the current transportation program is broken and that wholesale change is needed,"" said Robert Puentes, director of the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative at the left-leaning Brookings Institution.\To get there before October, however, Oberstar not only faces a resistant administration but also an obstacle course of competing legislation in Congress, including financial sector regulation, climate change and healthcare reform.\""Congress doesn't even have the bandwidth to handle these issues let alone a transportation overhaul,"" said Joshua Schank, director of transportation research at the National Transportation Policy Project. ""Maybe we will be able to move something by next year, but even then it will be hard.""\------------\Oberstar's handwritten outline of transportation bill.\Click on graphics to enlarge\Click on graphics to enlarge\------------\If history serves as an example, Schank could be right. The last transportation authorization was extended 12 times in two years before it finally became law in 2005.\This time, the transportation committee is asking for about a 38 percent increase above current spending levels at a time when there is less money and even more on the legislative agenda.\""I think it is going to be a very rich discussion, but there are a lot of challenges,"" Puentes said. ""The 900-pound elephant in the room is that there is no money.""\Low on funds\Indeed, the stream of money that currently flows to transportation projects around the country is expected to run dry for the second year in a row this summer.\Most of that money comes from the federal gasoline tax and a tax on truck sales. But the gasoline tax, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised since 1993 and has lost about one-third of its purchasing power since then due to inflation.\Worsening returns further is the fact that Americans are driving less and opting for more fuel- efficient cars.\Just to keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent, the federal government will have to inject it with $5 billion to $7 billion this summer, only a year after providing it with $8 billion.\On Wednesday, the administration proposed infusing the fund with an estimated $13 billion to $17 billion over the next 18 months\LaHood said in a statement: ""...[W]ith the reality of our fiscal environment and the critical demand to address our infrastructure investments in a smarter, more focused approach, we should not rush legislation.""\But the administration's fiscal patch is only a temporary solution. No consensus has yet emerged on how to keep the fund solvent in the long term.\While Oberstar favors some form of a user fee, either through a possible increase of the gas tax or the implementation of a system that taxes how many miles a motorist travels, the task of writing the funding component for the legislation will ultimately fall to the House Ways and Means Committee.\Two congressionally mandated commissions have recommended increasing the gas tax. The most recent commission reported that a Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) tax system would be the best long-term solution.\""We are putting nothing off the table at this point,"" said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, who sits on the Transportation Committee and chairs the Highways, Transit and Pipelines Subcommittee.\At the same time, the administration has said that it does not currently support an increase in the gas tax.\""The administration opposes a gas tax increase during this challenging, recessionary period, which has hit consumers and businesses hard across our country,"" LaHood said.\Oberstar has also acknowledged that more research and development needs to be done before a VMT system can be implemented.\Anxiety in Minnesota\In Minnesota, the uncertainty is causing heartburn for those who rely on federal dollars to keep people employed and projects moving.\""It is anxiety inducing,"" said Serge Phillips, federal relations manager at the Minnesota Department of Transportation. ""If the fund runs out of money that will stop construction, people won't get paid, and it will happen at the busiest part of the construction season.""\While the administration is not likely to let the fund run dry, Oberstar and DeFazio warned that temporary extensions of cash can still do long-term damage to the country's transportation and infrastructure system.\For instance, DeFazio said that temporary extensions are likely ""to diminish construction activity and cost us tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of jobs"" because it will shift the emphasis from major new improvements to minor maintenance projects, which are already being done with stimulus dollars.\""You see a large drop-off in major projects with temporary extensions,"" said DeFazio. ""You can't plan a two-year construction project if you've got 12 months guaranteed project... This bill needs to have a major projects emphasis, and you lose that if you go with the temporary extension. It would be very detrimental to the production of jobs and toward building a 21st century system if we went with the temporary program.""\Cynthia Dizikes covers Minnesota's congressional delegation and reports on issues and developments in Washington, D.C.

After yet another special session, the two sides were forced to compromise on a host of divisive issues such as taxes, education and health care funding. Both sides sought things they didn't get.\WHAT LIVED\Health Provider Tax\House DFL: Sought to remove the sunset on the 2% tax on medical services, which was scheduled to expire at the end of the year.\Senate GOP: Wanted the tax to expire on schedule.\Result: The tax will continue, but at a reduced 1.8% rate.\Opioids\House DFL: Pushed to sharply increase fees on prescription drug manufacturers and distributors to fund a statewide response to the opioid epidemic.\Senate GOP: Also supported hiking fees, but with a sunset in case of large legal settlement against drug companies.\Result: Agreed to raise the fees for at least five years. The highest fees will drop if the state has raised $250 million for the fund, either through a settlement or the fees.\Elder care reform\House DFL: After Democrats and Republicans clashed over regulations in 2018, they reached a bipartisan agreement this session.\Senate Republicans: Passed regulations last year that advocates called insufficient, and were vetoed. A new agreement this session further protects seniors.\Result: Walz signed new licensing and consumer protections into law.\Hands-free driving\House DFL: Included exceptions for emergencies and allowed one-touch activation features on cellphones.\Senate GOP: Generally agreed and also allowed use of GPS navigation apps while driving.\Result: Each of those provisions was included in the final bill.\Sexual assault\House DFL: In response to a Star Tribune investigation that uncovered systemic failures by Minnesota law enforcement in handling sex assault cases, lawmakers backed a package of proposals, including a new task force to recommend reforms.\Senate GOP: Backed much of the same legislation making it easier to report sexual assault, but did not hold hearings on the task force.\Result: The task force survived in late negotiations. Lawmakers also approved a Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Task Force. The Legislature also approved a repeal of an antiquated marital rape defense.\Wage theft\House DFL: Sought legislation criminalizing wage theft, protecting workers who are denied earnings on the job.\Senate GOP: The biggest point of contention was Republicans' insistence that intent must be proven to secure a conviction for wage theft.\Result: The intent provision survived in the final compromise bill.\Election security\House DFL: Quickly moved to free up all of the $6.6 million in federal funds allotted to the state by Congress to bolster cybersecurity efforts.\Senate GOP: Republicans engaged in a months-long standoff with DFL Secretary of State Steve Simon after blocking until budget negotiations all but an initial $1.5 million Simon requested a year ago.\Result: Full funding was eventually included in the state's government and elections spending plan.\WHAT DIED\Gas tax hike\House DFL: Passed a bill imposing a 20-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase -- a 70% increase that would push the tax to 48.5 cents per gallon.\Senate GOP: Made stopping a gas tax increase the centerpiece of its legislative agenda.\Result: The DFL capitulated and the gas tax died.\Gun safety\House DFL: Sought measures expanding criminal background checks to private transfers and allowing authorities to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a threat to themselves or others.\Senate GOP: Neither proposal received a hearing in the Senate.\Result: Both proposals died in final budget negotiations.\Immigration\House DFL: Approved legislation allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. Democrats also pushed to give more state tuition grants to students in the U.S. illegally.\Senate GOP: Opposed both DFL immigration proposals.\Result: Both bills failed to make it into the final budget negotiations.\Paid family leave\House DFL: Proposed employers provide all Minnesota workers with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave to care for newborns, relatives or themselves.\Senate GOP: Opposed the plan on the grounds that it was too expensive and a burdensome mandate on employers.\Result: Ultimately failed to make it through end-of-session budget negotiations.\Legal marijuana\House DFL: Introduced legislation to legalize marijuana for adult recreational use.\Senate GOP: Allowed a committee hearing on a legalization bill but voted the measure down.\Result: Legal pot, along with other ""vice"" issues like sports gambling and a law requiring people buying tobacco to be at least 21 years old, will have to wait until next year.\Abortion, birth control\House DFL: Pledged to block any laws further restricting access to abortion. Proposed expanding access to free birth control and requiring comprehensive sexual education curricula as early as elementary school.\Senate GOP: Wanted to ban most abortions after 20 weeks, at which point some say evidence shows a fetus can feel pain.\Result: All three proposals failed amid opposition from the other chamber.\Tax credits for private school donations\Senate GOP: Advanced a proposal to provide tax deductions for people and businesses who donate to private school scholarships.\House DFL: Opposed the legislation over concerns that it would create a backdoor voucher program.\Result: The plan was included in a Senate budget bill but did not survive negotiations between the governor and both houses.

Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ My preference is for this to be dealt with on the local level. I believe municipalities and the free market will be much more successful at reaching an acceptable agreement to all parties than state government. Counties and cities are in the process of exploring plans to join together to implement such a ban. At this point it would be inappropriate for the state to interfere.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ A multi-modal approach to transportation would best serve varying lifestyles and schedules. This includes additional roads, bus routes and car pool lanes, personal rapid transit and commuter rail. The funding of transportation should also be multi-dimensional. The privatization of public transportation, using state bonds and implementing user fees are all viable options.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ The state funding of K-12 education has never been cut in Minnesota's history. Since 1990, while the state's population grew 14 percent, the K-12 expenditures rose 153 percent. Per-pupil funding has been frozen at various times, most recently in 2002; however, simultaneously the cap on levies was raised. I will continue to work toward completely eliminating the cap.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ While facing a $4.3 billion deficit in 2003, we balanced this budget and generated a $400 million surplus ending in 2005. By law, we will use that surplus to replenish the cash flow account of the state. In addition, revenues are 2.8 percent ahead of forecast. Clearly, the challenge is in the level of expected spending and in particular in the Health and Human Services area.\ .\ Sen.

Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ There is a demonstrated public health problem with secondhand smoke. I support a statewide smoking ban. It would eliminate competitive issues between communities. With a statewide ban, I would also want to make sure that we don't preempt local communities from taking stronger positions on this issue if they choose.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ I support increased funding to accelerate fixes to the Hwy. 100 bottleneck, and it's time to move forward on light rail transit on the southwest corridor. I agree with various business groups that we need to increase the gas tax, which hasn't happened since 1988. Its buying power has been reduced by one-third because of increased construction costs, etc.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ I vigorously support additional state funding for schools tied to improved accountability and reforms. I also support raising the cap on local levies that makes it hard for districts in the western suburbs to maintain their tradition of excellence in public education.\ 4.

What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ My energy will be directed toward Minnesota leading the way, testing and making possible the exciting new technology of personal rapid transit, an outgrowth of research at the University of Minnesota. This 21st century mode of transit is innovative, cost- effective and responsive to individual needs. It would be a great addition to our transit system throughout the metro area.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ I will support Gov. Pawlenty's efforts to increase per-pupil state funding. Eliminating caps on local levies would be an invitation for lawsuits charging inequity of funding of education based on disparities in property wealth between districts.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ I will support efforts to ease the pain that ""equity"" has inflicted on most of our west suburban school districts.\ .\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ Having ended the 2004-05 fiscal year with a $495 million surplus enabling full restoration of both the cash flow account and the budget reserve, the state's financial condition is strengthened for bond rating purposes. Also, tax collections for the 2006-07 biennium are projected to grow by 7.9 percent. We should make every effort to bring spending in line with revenue.\ .\ Sen. Julianne Ortman, R-Chanhassen\ Age: 42\ Occupation: Lawyer\ Years in office: Two\ Contact: 651-296-4837, or http://www.julianneortman.com\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ I support existing law which permits citizens to decide whether to prohibit smoking in bars and restaurants at the local level, through the ordinance process.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ Transportation has been one my top priorities. I believe that it is vitally important that we secure additional long-term funding for roads, but that this must be done within our budget. Hwy. 212 is already on its way - paid for entirely by bonding. This example shows that significant construction and transportation improvement can be done without raising taxes.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ When it comes to the budget, this year's session will be about setting priorities. I believe that providing an inflationary increase in the per-pupil funding formula should be the top budget spending priority, provided that this priority is achieved (as I believe it can be) without raising taxes. I will follow closely and thoughtfully consider any legislation related to levy caps.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ As a state legislator and a former county commissioner, I have always taken a strong stance for fiscal conservatism. This year we will be forced to reconcile a $700 million projected budget shortfall, which is the result not of lagging revenue to the state, but staggering - and unsustainable - growth in spending. I believe we must live within our means as we balance our state's books.\ .\ Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope\ District: 45, including Crystal, Robbinsdale, New Hope, northwest Golden Valley and northwest Plymouth\ Age: 62\ Occupation: Legislator, CPA\ Years in office: Four in the Senate, 16 in the House\ Contact: 651-296-2889\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ Yes, but I also support local ordinances that would be stricter than a state ban.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ I favor a multi-modal approach to transportation and transit. I favor a 10-cent increase in the gas tax.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ I favor increases in revenues for public schools and for higher education. I do not support eliminating state caps - local property taxes are not the answer to school funding needs.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ No, of course not. All revenue sources and all spending should be on the table to solve the budget deficit. What we need to avoid is accounting gimmicks.\ .\ Rep. Ron Abrams, R-Minnetonka\ District: 43B, which covers northern Minnetonka and southern Plymouth\ Age: 52\ Occupation: Lawyer\ Years in office: 16\ Contact: 651-296-9934 or rep.ron.abrams@house.mn\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ I believe that there should be uniformity in smoking bans throughout Minnesota. There is currently a patch-quilt of local ordinances passed by cities and counties, with no uniformity between them. The legislative process should be able to develop a set of standards that are uniform, easily understood and fair to all patrons.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ The Legislature enacted a major infusion of construction dollars for highways in 2003 which directly affects the western suburbs. I support financing additional projects by dedicating the entire sales tax on motor vehicles to transportation projects and issuing revenue bonds based upon that revenue stream. I also favor additional state resources for transit projects.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ I support raising the basic education formula by at least the rate of inflation for each of the two years of the next budget. Additionally, I support eliminating the excess operating levy caps so voters in a school district can determine their level of taxation and spending. Finally, I believe that the basic education formula should be changed to reflect the Twin Cities' higher cost of living.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ The state budget is projected to increase by close to $1.5 billion the next two years with no increase in taxes. The February budget forecast will show the final picture. I favor the Legislature looking first to program redesign, prioritization of programs and spending restraint to enact any budget. Additional increases in revenue should be a last resort, not a first resort.\ .\ Rep. Joe Hoppe, R-Chaska\ District: 34B, which covers Chanhassen and most of Chaska\ Age: 40\ Occupation: Sells health insurance to small businesses for Community Insurance Advisors of Chaska\ Years in office: Two\ Contact: 651-296-5066 and rep.joe.hoppe@house.mn\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ I don't support a statewide ban. I think that it infringes on property rights and is best left up to business owners or municipalities.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ Last session, Hwy. 212 was included in the transportation funding package. That was a major win for the area. Realistically, we aren't going to see more projects in this area in the near future. Having said that, we need to improve our roads and bridges all over the metro area, and I wouldn't be opposed to some type of reasonable gas tax increase, provided all the money went to our highways.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ I support increasing the per-pupil funding formula and giving local districts the ability to raise as much money as they want. Having said that, money isn't the total answer. We need to have some more accountability built into the system.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ Personally, I wouldn't rule out tax increases, but they would be a last resort and would have to be targeted. I think that the governor is right when he says that we have a spending problem, not a revenue problem.\ .\ Rep. Jeff Johnson, R-Plymouth\ District: 43A, which covers much of Plymouth\ Age: 38\ Occupation: Small business owner, lawyer\ Years in office: Four\ Contact: 651-296-5511, or rep.jeff.johnson@house.mn\ No. I believe this is an issue for the free market to address.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ I think we need to dedicate all of the funds going into the motor vehicle sales tax to roads and transit. My top priority is to continue widening west 494.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ I was chief author of the bill to eliminate the arbitrary levy caps on our school districts and will author that bill again. I also support an inflationary increase in per-pupil funding, although we will have to find the savings elsewhere in the budget.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ Yes.\ .\ Rep. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park\ District: 44B, which covers parts of St. Louis Park and Golden Valley\ Age: 41\ Occupation: Lawyer\ Years in office: Two\ Contact: 651-296-7026, or rep.ron.latz@house.mn\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ As the chief House author of this bill, I believe that it will reduce health care costs and improve the health of workers in all places of employment. Health care costs are part of the reason for the projected state budget deficit and are the top concern of businesses. It is time to once again lead the nation in ensuring clean air for all of us to breathe in indoor public places.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ We need to eliminate the bottleneck on Hwy. 100 in St. Louis Park. We should raise and reapportion the gas tax to pay for it and other transportation improvements, like expanded bus service, dedicated high- speed bus lanes, commuter rail and light rail in an integrated system.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ State per-pupil funding should be increased by at least the level of inflation this year. I would also raise the levy caps and give direct levy authority to school boards to make inflationary increases in the levy without the need for a referendum.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ No. We will need a combination of spending cuts and new revenues to avoid more severe cuts to health insurance for children, early childhood education and our K-12 classrooms. Seventy percent of last session's budget fix was one-time money and accounting shifts. We need to correct the structural imbalance in the budget with longer- term solutions this year.\ .\ Rep.-elect Joyce Peppin, R-Rogers\ District: 32A, which covers much of northwestern Hennepin County, including Greenfield and Corcoran\ Age: 34\ Occupation: Communications/public relations\ Years in office: Elected this year\ Contact: Capitol phone and e-mail not available until she takes office in January.\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ Although sympathetic to the clean-air concerns of non-smokers, I do not support a statewide smoking ban. Such a ban would be extremely hard on small, family-owned bars and restaurants in border communities, where customers can take their business across state lines. Market forces will continue to be the best way to address this issue.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ Completion of Hwy. 610 in Maple Grove and widening of Hwy. 55 in Corcoran and Greenfield are the top transportation priorities for residents in the northwest suburbs. These projects should be funded through the use of existing state and federal funds, bonding and/or a fuller dedication of motor vehicle taxes to transportation.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ The state's education funding formula must be changed to reflect the needs of growing districts in the northwest suburbs. There appears to be a bipartisan consensus to provide an inflationary increase for the general education funding formula. Gov. Pawlenty's education funding task force has made several recommendations that deserve scrutiny and analysis.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ The evidence is clear: Minnesotans are not undertaxed. Even with the economic slowdown, Minnesota's total revenues increased by nearly 7 percent in the last biennium. The growth in state expenditures, however, continues to exceed the revenues available. Lawmakers must make the tough decisions to prioritize state spending and balance budgets without increasing taxes.\ .\ Rep.-elect Maria Ruud, DFL-Minnetonka\ District: 42A, which covers southern Minnetonka and northern Eden Prairie\ Age: 43\ Occupation: Nurse practitioner\ Years in office: Elected this year\ Contact: Capitol phone and e-mail not available until she takes office in January.\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ Yes. As a nurse practitioner, I think it's important that everybody has the same safe working environment that I enjoy. The effects of second-hand smoking are a public health issue.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ We do have some projects ongoing in our district right now, so we will be looking for ways to keep them going. The governor has stated very strongly that he is opposed to tax increases. That poses a challenge to those of us who are going to seek to address congestion in our districts.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ I would look at ways to put more money in the formula and also lift the local levy caps so the school districts could have more local control. If the districts want to go to the voters [to ask for an increase in the property tax levy], they should have the option of doing that.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ I'm anxiously waiting to hear what the governor proposes. If he is going to continue to hold to the ""no new taxes"" pledge, I think we have to consider that when we are addressing the deficit.\ .\ Rep.-elect Steve Simon, DFL-St. Louis Park\ District: 44A, which includes St. Louis Park and Hopkins\ Age: 35\ Occupation: Lawyer\ Years in office: Elected this year\ Contact: Capitol phone and e-mail not available until he takes office in January.\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ I will support a statewide smoking ban in restaurants, but I'm open-minded about whether or not to extend a ban to all bars.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ Above all, I support diversification. We need both additional highway capacity and additional transit options. We can get what we need with a modest increase of the gas tax (which has remained flat since 1988) and by finding a dedicated source of funding for transit (such as the motor vehicle sales tax).\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ Our schools are at risk because of cutbacks. I will support a reasonable increase in state funding. I also believe that suburban school districts can best help themselves if they are free of the current state levy restrictions.\ 4. Would you rule out tax increases to help balance the states budget?\ No. I will support a balanced approach to the state budget, which includes consideration of both spending cuts and revenue increases.\ .\ Rep. Steve Smith, R-Mound\ District: 33A, which covers Medina, Independence, Mound, Minnetrista, Maple Plain, St. Bonifacius, Spring Park and part of Plymouth\ Age: 55\ Occupation: Lawyer\ Years in office: 14\ Contact: 651-296-9188, or rep.steve.smith@house.mn\ 1. Would you support a statewide smoking ban that would extend to bars and restaurants?\ No.\ 2. What's your top priority for improving transportation in the western suburbs, and how should it be funded?\ Continue to build better roads for quicker commutes. Pay for them by dedication of MVET [Motor Vehicle Excise Tax] to roads only.\ 3. With some school districts facing annual budget cuts, would you support increasing state funding per pupil for local schools, raising or eliminating state-imposed caps on local school tax levies, or keeping the current funding system?\ How money is allocated to school districts is just as important as how much money is allocated. We need to simplify the system and put more money into the per-pupil formula, which treats every child the same, and roll back the volumes of state mandates that the legislature has placed on our local schools and boards.\ 4.

151,"
Here are some of the 2015 legislative session's top moments:
\
Jan. 6: Lawmakers convene for the 89th session of the Minnesota Legislature, with a DFL-controlled Senate and a GOP-controlled House.
\
Jan. 26: Gov. Mark Dayton formally rolls out his transportation plan, which would raise billions of dollars over the next decade through increased taxes and fees on gasoline and motor vehicles. A day later, Dayton releases his budget proposal.
\
Feb. 4: Dayton informs legislators that he's raising the pay of all his commissioners, provoking a backlash from Republicans.
\
Feb. 12: Incensed by a bill temporarily stripping him of his ability to raise commissioner pay, Dayton publicly accuses Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk of having ""stabbed me in the back"" and says he won't be able to trust his fellow DFL leader.
\
Feb. 27: An updated budget forecast raises Minnesota's projected budget surplus from $1 billion to $1.9 billion.
\
March 10: The Minnesota Republican Party launches an ad campaign asking the Legislature to take the $1.9 billion surplus and ""send it all back"" to taxpayers.
\
March 17: Dayton's revised budget would spend the entire surplus on new programs. A week later, the House and Senate majorities roll out their own budgets, with the House proposing $2 billion in tax cuts and the Senate proposing a similar budget to Dayton's but with more money in the reserves.
\
March 23: House Republicans unveil their own transportation plan, which would raise several billion dollars over 10 years by shifting money from other areas. They refuse to increase the gas tax.
\
April 9: Dayton delivers his State of the State address, which urges lawmakers to pass a proposal establishing buffer zones around the state's waterways.
\
May 12: Before entering budget negotiations with Dayton, House Speaker Kurt Daudt says Dayton ""is not stupid enough"" to attend a pro-Hillary Clinton event that night. Dayton does go to the event, and upset by the jab, gets legislative leaders to agree to conduct negotiations in secret.
\
May 15: After a week of talks, Bakk and Daudt announce a budget deal. But Dayton, who wasn't included in the final deal, comes out in opposition to the education budget for lacking his top priority of universal preschool.
\
May 18: In a chaotic finish, lawmakers barely pass all necessary budgets by the midnight deadline, but run out of time for several other important bills. Construction crews immediately begin disassembling the House and Senate chambers for interim construction.
\
May 21: Dayton vetoes education budget, then two days later the economic development and agriculture/environment bills, forcing a special session.

152,"If you filled up your tank this week, you've noticed the price jumped from the new painful normal to HOLY MACKEREL WHAT THE BLEEP, and so you may have questions. Let's take them one at a time.\Q What? Huh? I just don't -- what? Four bucks? Really?\A Sometimes the price goes up because refineries are shifting to the ""summer blend,"" which contains trace amounts of gin and tonic. Sometimes OPEC looks at the calendar and says ""Been a while since we bled them pale, eh.""\But as you may have heard, two Midwestern refineries are closed for maintenance, and since we haven't built a refinery in the country since the Grover Cleveland administration, this reduces supply.\Q Oh, come on. They're gouging us for Memorial Day. Miserable greedy swine, right?\A No. Gas stations hate it when the price goes up, because you don't buy as much. When gas prices are low, and the pump asks if you'd like a car wash, you think: Tell me more, I'm intrigued. You press YES for the basic Bronze Wash. The screen says: Would you like the Silver Wash?\This means the machine goes back and forth two additional times while a panel lights up and says you're getting the carnauba wax, but actually it's just Pine-Sol. Seriously, they ran out of the wax in '87 but no one noticed. Would you like this?\Press YES to add $4 to the credit card bill you don't study in great detail because it's too depressing.\People are less inclined to push the button for that when gas is $4.25. Forget about the Platinum Wash, where a red light turns on because you're getting an undercoat of whale oil. When gas is expensive, people won't even pay for the Tin Wash, where a guy throws a pail of water on the car and walks around it twice with a blow drier.\This goes for the items inside the store as well. That's where the money is. Milk. Smokes. Aspirin so expensive you want to say, ""No, I didn't ask for black-market OxyContin."" Angus Beef Steer-Divots with a square of premium vinyl cheese. The ever-popular Thanksgiving Panic Butter, $47 per pound. It's not cheap, but it's convenient.\Gas stations make mere pennies on the gas; the state makes much much more on taxes.\Q How can I save?\A Well, you could join one of those programs that gives you a discount for buying groceries. You get a card! Because you don't have enough cards. The clerk swipes it when you check out, or would, if you hadn't lost it, but that's OK -- she can look up your 37-digit number in the system, which makes everyone behind you in the line ladle on the hate they reserve for the person who gets out the checkbook when the last bag's packed.\When you've spent enough money at the store you get a discount at the pump, which you get by inserting the card, but you lost it, remember? Was it in those pants you gave to the Salvation Army? Yes. So you claim the discount as a charitable contribution on your taxes. That's how you save.\Sure, you'd be audited, but hey! Join the crowd.\Q If gas is more expensive than milk, for heaven's sake, don't market forces demand new sources of energy?\A Yes. Scientists are already working on powering internal combustion engines with milk. Advantages: the ""Regular"" pump becomes fat-free; premium becomes 2%; ultra becomes the milk with all the fat. Diesel will be replaced with buttermilk. Ethanol will be phased out, but in order to keep farmers happy, milkoline will have to contain at least 15% soy milk. Milkoline should be on the market in 2025, once all the laws of physics have been repealed. (Bills are currently pending.)\Q I suppose I should figure out how to cut my gas bill by driving at a regular pace and avoiding jackrabbit starts at intersections when the light turns green?\A Yes. Please do. This means I will be able to pass you all the easier.\Q Will gas ever be $2 again?\A Sure! Oh, you mean per gallon? Not until they invent cheap fist-size fusion reactors that make the internal-combustion engine obsolete. Gasoline will be cheaper than milk but still really bad with Lucky Charms.\Even then, expect the cost of isotopes for your reactor to tick up in the summer, because California mandated the use of a particular quark to help the environment. There will also be a Neutron Tax that will generate the same revenue as the old discarded gas tax.\You'll buy the neutrons inside the store, by the way. All the pumps will have switched over to dispensing frozen yogurt.\Four dollars a cup? you'll say. Why so much?\jlileks@startribune.com - 612-673-7858\Credit: JAMES LILEKS; STAFF WRITER"
153,"Transportation forum examines tolls, sales tax to pay for improvements\By Lawrence Schumacher\lschumacher@stcloudtimes.com\Minnesota transportation funding is stuck in a rut and traditional sources of money will not reduce congestion or make roads safer, participants in a statewide transportation forum in St. Cloud said Friday.\New approaches that could see motorists paying electronic tolls to drive on uncrowded lanes on Interstate Highway 94 or approving local sales taxes for transportation improvements generated much discussion among federal, state and local officials gathered at the Kelly Inn for the second annual forum. The St. Cloud Area Planning Organization sponsored the event.\""We have a growing need for transportation improvements and a funding source in the gas tax that is not keeping up,"" said U.S. Rep. Mark Kennedy, R-Minn., the forum's honorary chairman and recently elected 6th District Congressional representative.\Gasoline taxes, a large source for federal and state transportation funding, would have to increase 87 cents a gallon to pay for the state's future needs - not a realistic proposal when a 5-cent gas tax increase is too politically unpopular, said Bill Hansen, executive director of the St. Cloud APO.\With the advent of hybrid and hydrogen-powered cars, gas taxes will become increasingly unreliable as a funding source, even as drivers travel more miles, he said.\Kennedy, a majority member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, will be closely involved this\From Page 1B\Roads\year in reauthorization of the six-year federal surface transportation funding bill, known as TEA-21. The bill authorizes spending for many local road, bridge and transit improvements.\But he and other speakers repeatedly said new approaches to transportation funding will be needed in the future.\Other alternatives\One way the city of Houston sped up a recent freeway expansion was to add two toll lanes on each side, which motorists could pay to use with an electronic pass, Kennedy said.\The idea could speed up improvement of the I-94 corridor between St. Cloud and Minneapolis, if state and local governments applied the same ideas here, he said.\""Doesn't it make sense and wouldn't we free up transportation dollars for other needed projects if we did something like that on I-94?"" he said.\National perspective\Despite President George W. Bush's proposal of $247 billion for transportation, a 19 percent increase from the current transportation bill, local projects must become smarter, more flexible and more streamlined, said Mary Peters, administrator of the Federal Highway Administration and the forum's keynote speaker.\Peters and Kennedy both touched on the need to shorten the review process for new road and bridge projects and reduce administrative costs.\""We want to make good decisions, we want to protect the environment, but we must get these road projects done at a quicker pace,"" Peters said. ""Why? Because they end up costing more the longer they take.""\In 46 states, local voters have approved additional taxes to pay for specific transportation improvements, often in the form of sales taxes, said James Corliss, a consultant for the Surface Transportation Policy Project.\A half-cent added to a sales tax can raise as much money for roads as a 10-cent gas tax increase, he said.\The key to gaining public approval is in building public trust, Corliss said.\""Any extra tax raised needs to be for a specific use and include citizen oversight,"" he said. ""There has to be a way to measure performance. You can't just say `trust us.' """
154,"A steady jog on Friday turned into a full sprint as DFLers ramped up passing their major state budget bills over the weekend in order to get done before the legislative session ends on Monday.\By Saturday afternoon, DFLers had finished up with four omnibus budget bills -- including the massive Health and Human Services compromise legislation -- that are now on the way to Gov. Mark Dayton's desk.\The other measures they have wrapped up are funding for jobs and economic development, the judiciary and higher education.\Democrats got into full swing with the budget Friday afternoon after facing criticism from Republicans that they were wasting time with such distractions as a failed effort to pass a bonding bill and action on a proposed constitutional amendment related to legislative pay.\Both the House and Senate are likely to work past midnight on other budget bills as they became available.\Many of the remaining conference committees -- including transportation and taxes -- are expected to come to an agreement Saturday evening, clearing a path for Democrats to finish their work with little time to spare.\Those two conference committee reports represent key and controversial measures, including roughly $2 billion in tax hikes -- the ""linchpin"" of the Democrats' budget deal -- and a potential gas tax at a time when fuel prices are at a record high in Minnesota.\On Saturday afternoon, the Senate approved the Health and Human Services omnibus bill, the second-largest budget bill lawmakers have to deal with. The measure, which cleared the House Friday evening, covers nearly one-third of Minnesota's state general fund budget.\Lawmakers in the Senate quickly moved to smaller policy bills while the House debated funding for state pension programs, which the Senate had passed on Friday.\The House and Senate were also working on a number of smaller bills as they waited for conference committee reports to become available.\House Majority Leader Erin Murphy said that lawmakers in her chamber would consider the E-12 education and agriculture and environment bills on Saturday in a push to hear as many budget bills as possible before taking up a controversial unionization measure covering many child-care providers and personal care attendants.\Republicans debated the unionization measure in the Senate for a record 17 hours, and GOP representatives had filed more than 100 amendments to the bill in the House, which points to an extremely lengthy debate.\""Can you tell me why this is such a priority right now before we take up budget bills?"" House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt asked, expressing similar concerns about the borrowing legislation.\Lacking Republican support, House DFLers fell short of the 60 percent vote required to pass an $800 million bonding bill.\Rep. Alice Hausman, the bonding bill's chief House sponsor, told her colleagues that the Friday vote was their only chance to pass a bonding bill this session and to keep renovation of the crumbling state Capitol on track.\She told reporters shortly after the measure failed that it was a ""tragic"" scenario, and it appeared that a full bonding bill would be nearly impossible to resurrect before the Monday adjournment deadline.\But Senate President Sandy Pappas told MinnPost on Saturday afternoon that the Senate was serious about pursuing a pared-down bonding bill that includes the Capitol renovations and a few other projects.\""We've got to do the Capitol,"" she said, standing outside of the Senate chambers as the floor session busily commenced. ""It's very serious.""\While Hausman had said there was no 'Plan B' before Friday's vote in the House, Pappas said, ""I think there was always a backup.""\Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk has been adamant that the Capitol renovations move forward this session, and he even included the restorations in the Senate's tax plan to lift the project above the bonding bill's political fray.\Hausman appeared surprised that a bonding bill, which must originate in the House, might again be on the table. The Democrat from St. Paul said she was unsure if she would be part of the process.\Bonding-oriented Republicans in the House and Senate also appeared skeptical that a borrowing bill would pass before Monday. Rep. Matt Dean, the lead capital investment Republican in the House, wouldn't clearly address if his caucus would support a smaller, Capitol-focused bill.\""It would depend on communication and negotiation, but our first priority is the budget obviously,"" he said.\Thissen said a bonding bill do-over was the subject of some thought but recognized tensions between the House and Senate.\""I think there's a difference of opinion about it,"" he said.\Credit: James Nord"
155,"lschumacher@stcloudtimes.com\ST. PAUL - Harmonious voices ushered in the 2008 Minnesota Legislature on Tuesday to the tune of ""Shines for All to See,"" the official song of Minnesota's 150th anniversary.\Given the task ahead, sustaining the harmony of the Legislature's first official day at work this year will be difficult.\DFLers in control of the Legislature laid out an aggressive agenda for the so-called bonding session, which must wrap up by May 19.\""We plan a jump-start to this year's legislative session unlike any seen before,"" House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher, DFL-Minneapolis, promised this week.\By week's end, they hope to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would raise the state's sales tax by 3/8ths of a percentage point. The new revenue would be dedicated to the environment and arts.\On Tuesday, DFLers unveiled a transportation funding bill that would raise the gas tax by 5 cents a gallon.\That money would be used for state and local roads and bridges.\The gas tax would be indexed to inflation for the future, in addition to a 2.5-cent surcharge to pay off transportation bonding.\The transportation bill also includes increased vehicle license tab fees, a half-cent Twin Cities metro-area sales tax for transit and $2.2 billion in transportation bonding, most of it to repair critical roads and bridges, as well as a tax credit for low-income families.\They hope to see that bill, and an anticipated $1 billion bonding bill, sent to Gov. Tim Pawlenty for his signature or veto by the time they recess for an Easter/Passover break next month.\If all that happens, they'll come back after the break to deal with a budget deficit that a Feb. 28 revenue forecast could peg at up to $1 billion for the remaining year of the state's two-year budget cycle.\Rocky road\But that assumes things go smoothly early on.\""Jump-starting the session apparently means attaching jumper cables to your wallet,"" Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung. ""Job one this session will be protecting Minnesota's taxpayers.""\Because it concerns a constitutional amendment, Pawlenty cannot veto the proposed sales tax increase for clean water, wildlife habitat and arts and culture funding, though he opposes it in its current form, McClung said.\There may be enough votes to pass it, but Rep. Steve Gottwalt, R-St. Cloud, said he likely won't be one of them.\""I don't like legislating by constitutional amendment,"" he said. ""This seems like something we should take care of as a Legislature, not passing the buck to the voters.""\A transportation bill that raises the gas tax more than a nickel a gallon and doesn't allow voters in the Twin Cities to determine if they want to raise their sales tax for transit doesn't stand much chance of getting Pawlenty's approval, said Rep. Dan Severson, R-Sauk Rapids. He also doubts there are enough House Republican votes to overturn a veto.\""I want to see additional funding for transportation this session,"" the House Transportation Finance Division member said. ""But we've got to stop burglarizing through taxes here.""\Pawlenty vetoed a similar bill last year. DFL lawmakers hope this one will earn either his signature or enough votes to overturn a veto.\""We're going to try really hard to avoid needing an override,"" said Rep. Al Doty, DFL-Royalton, another member of the House Transportation Finance Division. ""The important thing is to get some new money into the system as soon as possible.""\Tax fight\Facing a deficit that might be too large to ignore, DFL lawmakers are looking to end a corporate tax exemption for assets held overseas. That measure was contained in the tax bill vetoed last year.\But repassing that tax bill without the inflationary budget calculation Pawlenty objected to isn't likely, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said.\""The governor's made it clear he didn't like that bill, so we're moving on,"" he said.\Pogemiller and Kelliher made it clear they still want additional funds to deliver property tax relief through direct credits and additional state aid to local governments, but declined to lay out this week how they'd pay for it.\Similarly, Pawlenty has encouraged legislators to look for ways to trim spending to cut the deficit, but will not be offering specific recommendations until after the Feb. 28 revenue forecast, McClung said."
156,"Minnesota has some of the highest quality of life in the country thanks to the investments we make in our schools, in our environment and in the people of our great state.\Unfortunately, there's one big area we're falling behind: our infrastructure. Our roads are full of potholes, our bridges are deteriorating and something needs to be done. Luckily, our state has leadership with the courage and foresight to tackle this problem.\DFL Gov. Walz has put forward a budget that will make major and much-needed repairs to our roads and bridges, funded by an increase in the gas tax. This is a common-sense, fiscally responsible solution that actually fixes problems Minnesotans face, rather than kicking the can down the road or putting expensive repairs on our state's credit card.\Republicans would have you believe the choice is between an increased gas tax and no costs whatsoever, but that's a false choice.\We know that if our roads are not maintained, Minnesotans will pay the price. Anyone who has felt their car lurch as they hit a pothole and heard the horrible sound it makes knows they'll be paying to fix the damage done to their vehicle sooner or later. After hitting several in a row, most Minnesotans I know are ready to try and fill in those potholes themselves.\The choice here is clear: We can fund road repairs now or spend that money fixing our vehicles.\The DFL solution, repairing our roads and bridges, will actually solve this problem going forward, whereas the GOP solution, do nothing, only serves to delay needed action all while our roads continue to deteriorate and we continue to pay the price at the auto shop.\The options presented here by the DFL and the Republicans say a lot about our two parties. The Republican plan is the same ""you're on your own"" approach they've taken on issues like health care or our environment. If your vehicle is damaged by potholes, pay for it. If your local roads or bridges are unsafe, tough luck. Just keep your head down and hope that the price of our poor infrastructure falls on someone else.\To DFLers, that's unacceptable. We know that we have a duty to support one another, and we know that it's our government's job to ensure we tackle our common problems together. You can see that in our push to expand health care access, guarantee strong public schools, and now in Gov. Walz's push to fix our infrastructure.\This is a problem we can tackle together or face alone, so let's take care of it as One Minnesota.\This is the opinion of Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party.\CREDIT: Ken Martin"
157," Although Gov. Jesse Ventura has drawn a line on new spending and most legislators favor cutting some taxes, there is growing sentiment in the House and Senate to increase transportation funding.\ Last year, legislators pumped in more than $500 million in one- time additional spending for roads and bridges and found that voters didn't hold it against them. Indeed, spending to alleviate some of the road conditions that can lead to road rage is becoming politically popular.\ ""Clearly, traffic and traffic congestion and road and bridges are increasing in importance as a political issue [and] as a policy issue, and politicians respond to that,"" said House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty, R-Eagan.\ ""You go out in the suburbs and people are increasingly torqued.""\ Ventura has proposed adding $95 million to the $1 billion-plus budget for road and bridge maintenance and construction in the next two-year period.\ Pawlenty and other key legislators say additional spending for roads, bridges and transit is likely this session.\ The argument for new spending received additional fuel Wednesday with the findings of a study that asserts that Minnesota's highways, bridges and local roads could face nearly $8 billion in unfunded repair and replacement needs over the next decade.\ The study was commissioned by the Highway Construction Industry Council, a federation of more than 175 contractors, suppliers and other businesses interested in increasing funding for the state's road system. It says the state needs to provide about $785 million extra each year to properly maintain Minnesota's road and bridge system, and suggests a number of ways to raise money.\ The suggestions range from increasing the gasoline tax to imposing a sales tax on gas to shifting the tax on vehicle sales from the general fund to the highway trust fund.\ The expected surplus in the next two budget years provides possible means for additional funding. But there also appears to be more of a political will this year.\ ""This is a golden opportunity,"" said Sen. Dean Johnson, DFL- Willmar, a proponent of additional spending for transportation.\ ""The public is on our side for a better, more effective transit system and removal of bottlenecks in the metro area and a better road system throughout Minnesota, and you can't do that without more money.""\ Johnson is chairman of the Senate Transportation and Public Safety Budget Subcommittee, where any funding package for highways and transit will be fashioned.\ For more than a dozen years, the DFL-controlled Senate has been more disposed than the House to provide extra money for transportation. But this year, the House seems more inclined to put more money into highways and bridges.\ House Speaker Steve Sviggum, R-Kenyon, said his majority caucus will be looking at three options for additional funding:\ - A constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would transfer at least one-third of the sales tax on motor vehicles from the general fund to the highway fund. Bills have been introduced that would transfer 100 percent, amounting to more about $520 million a year.\ - Shifting some costs not directly related to highway construction and repairs to the general fund. For example, the State Patrol is funded by gas taxes and license tab revenue, the two primary sources for the highway trust fund. Tapping the general fund to cover the patrol would free about $54 million a year.\ - Issuing revenue bonds, possibly annually for 10 years. That would pump more money into construction and repair.\ The bonds would be repaid from the gasoline tax and license tab revenue.\ One fiscal conservative in the House, Tom Workman, R-Chanhassen, said he favors raising the gasoline tax, possibly by 2 cents a gallon, to repay the bonds. Workman chairs the Transportation Policy Committee.\ ""No, that's not going to happen,"" Pawlenty said of a gas tax increase. ""There's a surplus and we don't want to consider a tax increase in that environment.""\ The last increase in Minnesota's gas tax was in 1988. The state gas tax is currently 20 cents a gallon.\ Senate agrees\ Last Friday, Senate DFLers had a caucus retreat to discuss their agenda for the session. With shows of hands, there was general consensus that there should be tax cuts - a property tax cut was No. 1 - and new spending on education, transportation, prescription drugs and housing.\ Johnson said that some Republicans share his view on increasing permanent spending.\ ""I'm very optimistic, short-term, long-term, that transportation will be one of the top three issues that will be funded this legislative session,"" he said.\ Last year, Ventura proposed a $500 million increase in funding that would primarily have come from permanently shifting all of the sales tax on vehicle sales to roads and transit. But the Legislature rejected the initiative in favor of a one-time infusion of surplus money.\ This year, Ventura has pulled his offer off the table, telling legislators it's their turn to come up with a plan.\ Johnson said Wednesday that he has received signals from the governor's office that Ventura would be amenable to more funding for transportation.\ Robert Whereatt can be contacted at rwhereatt@startribune.com\ Minnesota roads and bridges\ The Highway Construction Industry Council reported Wednesday that the state and local governments need to provide about $785 million extra each year to properly maintain Minnesota's road and bridge system. The council, which includes road construction engineers, contractors and others involved in building or repairing roads, said it calculated that figure by drawing on public agency reports. The ""unmet need"" is defined as spending needed to preserve the existing system, to expand capacity when the benefits exceed the costs and to address social and environmental concerns. .\ Mileage (2000) Percent of traffic (1999) Unmet annual need# Trunk \Interstate Highways Source: Highway Construction Industry Council ."
158,"Gov. Tim Walz and top Democratic and GOP lawmakers arrived at a hard-fought spending deal Sunday without the controversial gas tax hike the governor wanted, but with schools gaining significantly more money than Republicans had sought.\The compromise, ending a weekslong impasse, boosts the general fund overall by 6%, but each side had to jettison priorities -- Walz is denied much of the new revenue he wanted for road improvements, while a health care tax that Republicans sought to end survives largely intact.\Walz agreed to slightly trim the 2% tax on health care services in Minnesota that was set to expire this year, one of the central sticking points in the negotiations. Under the deal, the tax will be extended at a rate of 1.8%.\""This is a budget that invests in education, health care and community prosperity in a fiscally responsible manner,"" Walz said. ""Today we prove that divided government can work for the betterment of the people we serve.""\The $48 billion plan still requires a special session to finish the work of writing key points into legislative language and passing them in the DFL-controlled House and the Republican-led Senate.\Facing an adjournment deadline of midnight Monday, House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said the work of this session will continue at a ""breakneck pace"" but acknowledged that a one-day special session will be needed this week.\House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said he anticipates the special session could take five days, adding that lingering GOP concerns about the 1.8% provider tax could drag out discussions.\""Minnesotans send us here to do what's right, not always what's easy,"" Daudt said. ""Sometimes compromise sounds good but half of a bad deal is still a bad deal.""\Despite some dissension, the three leaders who negotiated it lauded the compromise.\""I'm glad we're here saying we got it done,"" said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-Nisswa. ""Both sides, when you have divided government, want to win. Both sides don't want to lose. And sometimes instead of win or lose, it's a draw.""\Gazelka emphasized that the two sides agreed to an income-tax cut for some middle-income families starting in 2019. The GOP claimed victory on taxes by negotiating a 0.25% rate cut for people in a middle-income tax bracket that currently covers married couples filing jointly who make between $38,771 and $154,020. The leaders also reached a deal to make Minnesota taxes conform with the federal tax code, simplifying tax filings.\Lawmakers had said little about the hang-ups in the talks during the final week of negotiations, but ideological differences over taxes were clearly central to the issue. Walz and House Democrats pushed for extending the 2% tax on medical providers to help cover public health programs. Another priority was getting a 20-cent-a-gallon increase in the state gas tax, which Republicans rejected.\Senate Republicans have adamantly opposed increased taxes and argued the state should use its more than $1 billion budget surplus and reserves to pay for any spending increase.\Walz said he listened to the Republican argument on dipping into reserves, and the budget deal includes about $491 million from the reserve.\Minnesota Chamber of Commerce President Doug Loon called the agreement a ""wise use of state tax dollars -- funding key state priorities while protecting Minnesota taxpayers and Minnesota employers.""\Another priority for Republicans was an agreement to create a panel that will look for $100 million to cut from the Health and Human Services budget over the next two years.\The deal includes $540 million in school funding, with a 2% increase in per-pupil spending in each of the next two years. That is less than what Walz and House Democrats wanted, but significantly more than the 0.5% per year increase in the GOP plan.\The budget debates won't end now despite the overall spending plan.\Lawmakers on conference committees have been waiting on numbers from leadership so they can finalize budget bills in policy areas such as judiciary and public safety, and environment and natural resources. Once those committees complete their work, the Senate and House will vote on the separate budget plans before they head to the governor's desk.\On policy matters, legislative leaders said they would defer to the conference committee members to sort through differences but that the resulting bills would have to pass both chambers and get Walz's agreement.\Joe Davis, executive director of the Alliance for a Better Minnesota, which supports DFL candidates, bemoaned the lack of Democratic priorities in the deal.\""While Republicans blocked common-sense measures like gun violence prevention and paid family leave, Gov. Walz and DFL legislators fought for what matters to Minnesotans, including investing in public schools and expanding access to affordable health care,"" Davis said.\The wide gap in negotiating positions, and the ensuing standoff, raised the prospect of the first state government shutdown since 2011, a prospect neither Walz and Hortman nor Gazelka relished.\Sunday's announcement by the three leaders followed a week of intense negotiations out of public view, as leaders met in the governor's office to hash out details of the plan. In recent days, they largely refrained from comments on their talks.\The leaders said that while they strived for an open process allowing committees to hash out policy in public, some of the more sensitive elements of the deal required the confidentiality that only meetings behind closed doors can provide. Still, they said they want to work for changes that will promote more transparency.\Jessie Van Berkel • 651-925-5044 Torey Van Oot • 651-925-5049\TAXPAYER IMPACTS\Gas tax: No 20-cent-per-gallon increase, which Gov.

159,"DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and Democratic legislative leaders reached a budget agreement Sunday that calls for $2 billion in new taxes and boosts spending for schools and property tax relief.\The Democrats are relying on a tobacco tax hike and the governor's long-sought income tax increase on high earners to pay for the new spending. The budget outline scraps a proposed sales tax on clothing, but lawmakers continue to consider resurrecting at least part of a heavily criticized plan to tax businesses services.\""It's a budget that is going to work for Minnesota. It's going to put Minnesota to work,"" Dayton said Sunday afternoon. ""It's going to fulfill our promises to invest in education and infrastructure. We're going to see a better Minnesota as a result of this budget.""\Legislators now have the framework of a budget deal to guide the closing week of the legislative session and knock down a projected $627 million budget deficit. The plan includes a temporary income tax surcharge on the state's wealthiest residents to repay the $860 million owed to public schools. The budget outline also boosts education spending by $725 million and gives Minnesotans $400 million in property tax breaks.\The surprise Mother's Day budget agreement angered Republicans who had little say in the plan.\""Disappointing news out of the DFL that their gift for every\hardworking mother in the state of Minnesota is going to be more than a $2 billion tax increase,"" said House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown. ""This is bad news today for Minnesota's economy.""\This is the first budget outline since DFLers took control of the Legislature this year, giving them almost complete control to direct state spending and taxing as they see fit. The state has clawed its way out of the worst recession in decades, a downturn that forced state leaders to cut spending by more than $2 billion in recent years.\Breaking the deficit cycle\Dayton and Democratic leaders say now is the time to restructure the state budget for the long haul and break the cycle of back-to-back budget deficits.\Senate leaders continue pushing for sales tax reform and want to expand the tax to include some business services, like accounting and legal fees. Dayton included the business taxes as part of an earlier budget plan, but he hastily withdrew the blueprint amid intense criticism from business groups and leaders of the state's largest companies.\""What I said from the very beginning was, it's very bold and we're going to take a look at the whole menu of business-to-business services,"" said Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, a longtime advocate for retooling the sales tax. ""There are likely things in there that are worth doing that I don't believe would have any impact on Minnesota's economy.""\More details promised\Bakk said they will have more details in coming days on what business services would be subject to taxation. He insisted that any new revenue collected would go directly toward economic development and reducing other taxes.\Some additional tax hikes could still be in the works, such as an increase in the alcohol tax. A proposed salary increase for legislators, the governor and top commissioners remains in play, as well.\""It's just simply more overtaxing, overspending, overreaching,"" said Senate Minority Leader David Hann, R-Eden Prairie.\The governor and DFL legislators are also trying to reach an agreement on about $800 million in state-backed construction projects, including a massive restoration of the State Capitol and smaller projects around the state. State borrowing requires a larger majority of votes to pass and so far Republicans said they are not inclined to offer up the necessary votes. Hann said there is ""little appetite"" among Senate Republicans to boost state borrowing.\Democrats are seeking $50 million in reductions to Health and Human Services, a much smaller trim than earlier proposals. The cuts represent a tiny fraction of the agency's multibillion-dollar budget.\Other budget winners\The budget proposal also calls for modest new spending on the environment, public safety, job creation and housing.\Paying back the so-called school shift has emerged as one of the thorniest issues of the DFL negotiations.\Taxpayers already have repaid a giant share of the debt, which the state borrowed over several years to balance its budget. State law requires that any surplus revenue immediately go to repay schools. But House leaders campaigned on the promise that they would pay it back sooner.\The temporary income tax surcharge on those making more than $500,000 would certainly speed the repayment, but it would also rocket the state's income tax rate to among the highest in the nation.\Dayton and Bakk grudgingly agreed to the surcharge despite having complained that having a sky-high income tax rate -- even temporarily -- could be a blow to job-creation efforts.\But House Speaker Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, displayed rock-ribbed commitment to the plan.\The three leaders remain divided on a proposed nickel-a-gallon gas tax hike. Dayton has said the increase would generate far too little money and way too much blowback from angry consumers.\The Senate initially stripped it from their proposal, but one senator successfully kept it alive with a last-ditch political maneuver on the Senate\floor.\""That is one piece of this discussion that has not been resolved,"" said Thissen, who has not advocated for the gas tax hike.\Said Dayton: ""The Senate keeps putting it on the table, I keep putting it off.""\baird.hegelson@startribune.com\651-925-5044\jennifer.brooks@startribune.com\651-925-5049\Budget Plan Provisions\Gov.

160,"It was billed as a candidate forum on issues facing Dakota County. But Monday night's event felt more than a little hollow: No Republicans showed up.\And it wasn't the first time it has happened.\When the Dakota County Regional Chamber of Commerce held a similar event not long ago, not a single DFLer came.\""I had seven Democrats calling me one after another,"" said president Ruthe Batulis, ""to give me lame excuses as to why they wouldn't be there.""\When she placed placards in front of empty chairs to show she hadn't just invited the one side, she added, she got an angry call from a candidate accusing her of trying to make them look bad.\""I'm very disappointed,"" she said. ""Our chamber members are disappointed it became so partisan. I've never had candidates not show up. I've been here seven years and in Bloomington before that -- I've been in the business 10 years -- and never had all the candidates [of one party] refuse to show up. It's a sorry state of affairs.""\Has it gotten that bad? We're not even talking anymore?\Not totally, said Rep. Mike Obermueller, DFL-Eagan.\""I don't think it's a coordinated effort by either side. It's obviously a very busy time. We try to get to as many as we can, but the focus has to be on voters. Not many people go to these events,"" and even those who do will often not be voting in a given candidate's district.\""To give you an example, while I was driving out of my way to go to the Dakota County event in Hastings, I had the state Senate Republican candidate in my own precinct, door-knocking, and when I came back I saw several more signs in peoples' yards.""\Republican Senate candidate Dan Hall of Burnsville concurs. ""I personally think with all the other means of communication that are out there, it's almost like they're outdated,"" he said. ""A few are fine, but I don't think we need debates. People who watch debates have already made up their minds.""\None of which prevents candidates of either party from seeking to score political points over an opponent's no-show.\""Tonight I participated in the Dakota County Chamber of Commerce Candidate Forum during which we discussed how to best create a more pro-business environment to create jobs,"" Republican Senate candidate Ted Daley of Eagan declared on his Facebook page. ""Unfortunately, my opponent declined to participate in this election's most important discussion -- jobs and the economy.""\To be sure, some of these events seem more about extracting promises than truly having an open debate.\The Hastings forum, organized by the Dakota County Board and an association of like-minded counties, involved a series of questions about adequate funding for counties.\Much of it was so inside-baseball that lawmakers themselves conceded they didn't even know that much about some issues they were being questioned about. Others were more broadly based: Funding for transit and transportation for instance.\The DFL pitch was for adequate spending. ""There's a direct correlation between the quality of infrastructure and the businesses that will come to your area,"" said Rep. Sandra Masin, DFL-Eagan. ""It's life-and-death sometimes -- some roads, if they aren't fixed, will be the scene of accidents.""\The main dissent came from a Constitution Party candidate from Burnsville, Bruce Johnson, who did agree with others about the state not interfering in local tax-setting but questioned some human services spending and the cost-effectiveness of extending new rail lines outside the metro area.\The lines of thought within the parties are very clear this year, said Republican Hall. ""The Democrats have shown their hand. Raising taxes is their answer. That's killing our economy and killing jobs.""\Every once in a while at the Hastings event a DFLer did caution county board members and staff that now is hardly the time to be thinking about ambitious spending plans.\With the bulk of state spending going to local schools, counties and others, said Sen. Jim Carlson of Eagan, there aren't that many hides to take a $6 billion deficit out of. Asked later about adequate funding for public defenders, he added:\""We can't make hard-and-fast promises: That $6 billion deficit is a can we've been kicking down the road,"" delaying its impact from session to session, ""and we can't kick it any longer. We have to face it.""\Asked about a sentence-to-service program that costs money but is aimed at saving more by keeping people out of jail, DFL Sen. John Doll said: ""I'm not sure we can do that in the next biennium, but I'm wholeheartedly supportive of the idea.""\Lawmakers also reminded county officials that they haven't been doing that badly, money-wise: Many millions, for instance, have gone into the Bus Rapid Transit project along Cedar Avenue, and many lawmakers put their necks on the line for a gas-tax hike that cost some their seats.\In an interview later, Obermueller said the hyper-partisan angle is one that can be overplayed. ""We pass probably 85 percent of our bills with broad bipartisan support,"" he said.\As for debates: ""If the people of Eagan were demanding them, they would get them. But I think they want us to come around and see them personally.""\David Peterson - 952-882-9023\Credit: DAVID PETERSON; STAFF WRITER"
161,"The so-called ""yellow-vest"" protest that erupted in recent weeks in France was, at least initially, a protest from rural citizens over a significant fossil-fuel tax increase proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron to further combat climate change.\Macron's laudable goal was to reduce his country's dependence on fossil fuels while accelerating the conversion to nonpolluting fuels in line with the international Paris climate accords. The fiery backlash forced him to retrench -- tragic for the climate, good in the short term for rural citizens.\I can see a similar protest brewing in Minnesota if the new administration of Gov.-elect Tim Walz is not circumspect as it follows through on its campaign support for a long-overdue 25-cent-per-gallon increase in Minnesota's gasoline tax. Rural Republican legislators are already lining up against it. How to bridge that gap?\Make no mistake, the funds are needed, both to repair and maintain Minnesota's neglected road and bridge infrastructure because gas-tax revenue has not kept up with inflation, and to continue the state's attack on carbon pollution that is permanently altering the climate with already serious financial and environmental consequences.\But the fossil-fuel budget of rural citizens, especially farmers, can be substantial -- when you have to drive your pickup 40 miles to the feed store and truck crops to market, in contrast to metro residents with generally easy access to work and the things they need. This difference may explain much of the difference in response to climate change in urban vs. rural America, and now between rural and urban France.\What is the solution to this conundrum? I am sure the governor's cabinet and the Legislature are working hard on it, but here are a few modest suggestions about how to begin to place the burden -- and the opportunities -- of the new electric economy where they belong, on all of us:\First, the good news. Some rural areas are already benefiting from wind farms on properties, plus a growing number of solar farms. That is doubly beneficial, as renewable electricity is the cheapest fuel of the moment and the future, as Xcel demonstrated last week with its formal commitment to 100 percent renewable power by 2050. But how to further spread the costs and benefits to everyone, including rural areas?\Begin by devoting a portion of the budget surplus to subsidizing the rural sector's transition to renewable energy. The University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment and School of Agriculture, along with Xcel, Great River Energy, Minnesota Power and rural cooperatives, should cooperate to build a demonstration electric farm on the state fairgrounds. And subsidize animal waste systems that capture methane and produce electricity.\And, just as electric cars are simpler and more efficient than fossil-fueled cars, the same is true for tractors and pickups, the torque smooth and immense, maintenance minimal. Right now, there are electric conversion kits for smaller pickups and the Ford F150 and GMC Sierra, and a new all-electric pickup is on the horizon. And John Deere, among others, has developed an all-electric tractor, as powerful as a diesel, with good range and long-lasting, low-maintenance twin electric motors.\Feature these at the State Fair and subsidize early adopters. Although on-farm diesel use is not taxed, the state still has in interest in subsidizing that conversion.\Second, tax electric cars (like mine), which use roads but pay no gasoline tax. California's recent gas tax increase includes a $100 annual fee for electric cars, beginning in 2020. Why not add $25 per year for gas-electric hybrids? My wife's hybrid averages about 45 mile per gallon, a family bargain except for abstemious donations to road maintenance. We should pay our fair share of road and bridge upkeep.\The state must continue its farsighted leadership combating the disruptive physical and economic challenges of climate change by committing to a 100 percent renewable energy economy in the nearest possible future. But as it does so, taxes should not cast a disproportionate burden on rural families for whom distance is a necessity, not an inconvenience.\These are knotty problems that other states, red and blue, are trying to solve. Let Minnesota craft a solution that builds rural-urban energy equity. In the process help turn the red-blue divide all green.\James P.

162,"By the turn of the new century, it was obvious that America's transportation system was in deep trouble. Not only had roads, bridges, ports and transit systems fallen into shameful disrepair, but revenue streams were depleted and the system itself was not lined up to meet the new challenges of global competition, energy conservation and climate change. Worse yet, there was no solution in sight.\Then, in 2009, came a brief moment -- a flicker, really -- when it was possible to imagine a coming-to-grips with the problem.\Why couldn't the nation climb out of its deep recession with a massive rebuilding of its crumbling infrastructure? Millions could be put back to work and, in the end, the economy could recover and the nation could be left with a shiny new and competitive transport system.\And why couldn't the nation, fearful of terrorists and entangled in costly Middle Eastern wars, seize the moment by weaning itself off foreign oil? By raising fuel-efficiency standards and encouraging alternative-fuel cars, mass transit and denser land-use patterns, Americans could make themselves ""energy independent"" while modernizing transportation and improving the environment.\A new Democratic president, whose party held both houses of Congress, seemed poised to choose that very path. And Minnesota, with veteran congressman Jim Oberstar heading the House Transportation Committee, expected to have a front-row seat, and probably a leg up.\But the moment passed.\President Obama chose health care instead. The Democrats lost the House in 2010 (the recently deceased Oberstar going down with the ship). Obama inserted a burst of transportation projects in his too-small stimulus package and launched some innovative grant programs, but those efforts made barely a dent. Another of his ideas, a public/private infrastructure bank, was quickly shot down.\Republicans, meanwhile, proclaimed themselves nonbelievers in climate change. And the oil companies, as if by magic, began pumping vast supplies of domestic crude, nearly enough to transform the United States into an oil exporter while keeping American drivers hooked on dirty fossil fuels.\""We are still deeply disappointed that that moment came and went,"" said David Goldberg, spokesman for Transportation for America, a Washington advocacy group.\The upshot: Little progress on a transportation problem that continues to worsen while drawing almost no attention.\Blaming Republicans would be easy, but Democrats failed to pull the trigger when a solution was in their sights. Now, five years later, they're unable even to articulate a comprehensive way forward.\The Minnesota story runs parallel. With control of the governorship and both legislative houses, the Democrats decided to leave transportation on the back burner again this year, gambling that they'll still hold majorities next session. And, in an embarrassing sideshow, infighting among Democrats has raised the cost of -- and soon may kill -- a light-rail line, something Republicans have never accomplished.\As a vital link in the transit system, the Southwest extension of the Green Line should be built without delay. But the $1.68 billion project also demonstrates the foolishness of the state's present course. Minnesota has ignored the basic axiom of construction: Time is money.\Had the Legislature six years ago provided a sufficient revenue stream and embarked on a systematic, predictable transportation program, the Central and Southwest segments would be completed by now at a savings of hundreds of millions of dollars. Indeed, a 2013 Itasca Project report found that accelerating the metro's transit build-out by seven years would double the private return on a $5.3 billion public investment to as much as $20 billion.\A systematic approach on roads would have paid off in similar ways. But Congress and Obama refused once again to raise the federal gasoline tax, a tax that has not been raised since 1991, leaving the nation's primary source for road-building, the Highway Trust Fund, flat broke by the end of this summer.\For its part, Minnesota acted in 2008 to ratchet up its gas tax by 8.5 cents. But that was its only hike in a quarter-century and not nearly enough to deliver the roads and repairs that the state needs. Indeed, to keep roads at their current poor condition over the next 20 years would require raising the gasoline tax by another 14 cents per gallon -- or by 34 cents if we want decent roads. That's how far behind we are.\Negligence seems too tame a word to describe the behavior of elected leaders over the last two decades. They should be calling news conferences and launching investigations on their own backlogs. ""The longer we wait, the more expensive it gets,"" said Margaret Donahoe, director of the Minnesota Transportation Alliance.\By 2020, the nation will be $1.6 trillion behind on infrastructure investment (transport and waterworks), according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. In Minnesota, a governor's study commission concluded that the state must spend an extra $20 billion on transportation over the next 20 years just to stay even -- or an additional $50 billion if it wants to be competitive.\""The transportation system hasn't just run out of money; it has run out of logic,"" said Jim Erkel, transportation director at the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. What Erkel means is that neither the funding model nor the system itself meets the needs of a changing marketplace. People want cleaner, more efficient transportation, and some want choices beyond cars and long commutes. That means more transit and more streets designed for biking and walking. ""If we just patched up the old interstate system, it wouldn't fit the new reality,"" Erkel said.\Obsolete funding streams must also be fixed. The value of the per-gallon gasoline tax, the main ingredient in the complex stream of revenues that support road-building, has been severely eroded by fuel-efficient engines, fewer miles driven and anti-tax fervor. A new tax, based on vehicle weight and distance traveled, is the right answer if privacy concerns can be overcome. In the meantime, imposing a sales tax on fuel to pay for roads and bringing the metro sales tax for transit up to a level charged by comparable cities will be required. There's no other way.\Awarding priority to projects with the best return on investment would help, too. Contrary to professed belief among rural legislators, it's the metro area that gets shortchanged on road money. Figures from the nonpartisan House Research Department show that metro counties contribute $134.4 million more in taxes than they get back in road projects.\""Value capture"" is another intriguing idea. Had the interstate system captured even a tiny slice of the enormous real-estate value it generated (fast food, shopping malls, etc.), there would be no infrastructure crisis.\- - - \For most Minnesotans, of course, it seems hardly a crisis at all. As long as gas is cheap and potholes are patched, it's hard to see the problem. But beneath all the patching and layering, roadways and bridges, many of them built in the 1950s and '60s, are coming to the end of their life spans. More patching won't do. Neither will ignoring the evidence that quality roads and transit draw investment -- and that investment brings jobs and prosperity. A recent survey by the Urban Land Institute found that ""quality infrastructure"" outranked ""market demand"" as the top factor in private investment decisions.\Voters need their elected leaders to tell them these things. Specifically, they need Democrats to tell them. (Republicans won't be helping on this, because taxes are involved.) Just reading polls and shrugging shoulders isn't good enough. That's not leadership.\Gov. Mark Dayton and the DFL caucuses are doing Minnesota no favor by again pushing this issue into the cloudy future.\Steve Berg writes about urban design and transportation.\Credit: STEVE BERG"
163,"Editor's note: This letters were submitted in response the April 24 Times Our View ""Politics, not progress, again at Legislature,"" which asked for readers' top priorities for the rest of this session.\Highways should top Legislature's list\1. A sustainable source of funding for highway infrastructure. Minnesota is fifth in the nation for number of paved lane miles of roads -- and 20th in population. Current user fees are inadequate. Up the gas tax, put up toll gates, or come up with another source of funding other than stealing from the general fund, or borrowing.\2. Put one-third of the surplus in the rainy day fund.\3. Eliminate state income tax on Social Security benefits.\4. Bonding bill.\5. Broadband funding.\I could add to my list, but I have very low expectations for this session.\Jeffrey McIntyre\Annandale\Roads, broadband\are top priorities\My name is Karla Scapanski, and I'm running for the House District 15B seat as a DFL candidate. I'd like to share a few priorities that reflect the needs of greater Minnesota. (""Politics, not progress, again at Legislature,"" April 24)\At township meetings I've attended they are saying yes to roads, bridges and trains. They are saying yes to broadband for all. And they want more investment in education for our children.\What they are definitely not saying is give the surplus back. They know this money can be used to help everyone. We take care of each other -- those are our real values -- and we are tired of the false promises of those who won't.\The two things I'd do this session are provide funding for roads and bridges, and get broadband moving beyond the Twin Cities. Greater Minnesota needs the same efficient access to the Internet as the metro.\This issue is vitally important to small businesses and education. Ask anybody. Yet we're trying to succeed with our hands tied behind our backs. Why is this so difficult in such a progressive state like ours?\Our roads and bridges are in bad shape out here. Why? Because too many of our legislators wouldn't put money into maintenance when that was the most cost-efficient thing to do. Narrow political gamesmanship trumped common sense. And now it's so late we have to pay more to fix them. But we have to fix them.\It's tough not to talk about education. I understand we can't do everything -- but we must do the things that give Minnesota a solid future. It has been clear for sometime that we need representatives at the Capitol who can bring people together and work to solve problems rather than block solutions just to make a point.\Karla Scapanski\Sauk Rapids\Environment, education deserve attention\Upon receiving the DFL endorsement for Senate District 13, I went door-knocking to listen to my neighbors.\What I heard was how hard it is to live on a fixed income. I heard about high medical bills. I heard about how most people in my neighborhood are doing ""just fine"" and are apathetic to our political process. When we hear of our elected officials fighting and being hard headed it helps no one.\Politics is about improving people's lives. We need state leaders willing to work together and admit that sometimes the other side has good ideas too. We need leaders who believe in science and heed the advice of state engineers. Increase the gas tax. Invest in our roads, bridges and transit. Invest 100 million on broadband Internet to rural areas.\Here are my top two priorities. First; we need to work together to save our lakes, rivers, and environment here in Minnesota. Earth Day is every day! We simply do not have time to argue about the reality that is global warming. We need action. We must lead our nation in renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable farming practices.\Second, focus on improving education at every level to fuel innovation and job creation. We need to close the achievement gap in our state. In District 13 we have great schools and wonderful teachers but these often come with higher property taxes. (This speaks to the need for corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share!)\I challenge our community to engage in democracy, and to expand our circle of compassion to include helping all people.\Michael Willemsen\Sauk Rapids"
164,"GAS TAX\Anyone who drives realizes our roads need work. Not up for debate. Any senior citizens living on Social Security and, hopefully, some pension money also realize that a 20-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase would have a significant impact on their mobility. Not only would they see an increase in cost if they drive their own cars, but that cost would certainly be passed along in other forms of transportation such as cabs, Uber, buses, prescription deliveries, trash, recycling -- any private or public gas-dependent service. We regularly read about the isolation many seniors feel because they have difficulty getting around. Adding an additional cost burden will not help. It amazes me that the Legislature continues to tax Social Security for seniors yet does not factor in their (in many cases) limited income and the ramifications that all the tax increases have on senior lives with little in the way of programs and protections for those same seniors. State Sen. Jim Abeler's consideration of a 10-cent increase at least seems a bit more reasonable. Or, how about not taxing Social Security?\Janet Grieder, Maple Grove\• • •\I hope our elected representatives and senators from the GOP noticed that the price of gas went up 20 cents last week. Supposedly this is due to refinery issues and price of crude. Are we getting better roads from this increase? No. Are we getting safer bridges? No. Are local gas stations earning higher profits? No. Are oil companies reaping bigger profits to help pay for their executives and increase shareholder profits? Yes. Did anyone drive less because of the price increase? Most likely not.\Yes, we can probably fund road projects with the general budget, but only at the expense of education and health. A gas tax is a user fee. For the most part, the bigger the vehicle, the more wear it does to the road and the more gas it probably needs. Higher gas prices tend to move people to more fuel-efficient vehicles or alternate transportation, both of which are better for the environment, roads, and transit costs. Are we going to notice the increase due to a tax? Probably only for a day or two. We are going to pay more for gas anyway; we might as well get something for it.\Ken Meyer, Cedar\PUBLIC SAFETY\'This' but not 'that' appears to be the approach of Sen. Gazelka\We are ""One step closer to sanity on the roads"" (March 20) with a bill restricting the use of cellphones while driving. State Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka expects a vote on Monday with bipartisan support. So while we will, in theory if not in practice, be safer on the roads, our chances of being a victim of gun violence have not been lessened given the intent by the same Sen. Gazelka to block a Senate hearing of the common-sense gun laws passed by the House. So while we may more safely drive to our house of worship, the mall or a movie theater, the proliferation of guns and gun violence in this country may not allow us to make it safely home.\Phyllis Roden, Minneapolis\OIL TRAINS\Public safety is top job for the Legislature, so pass this bill\""Growing oil train traffic 'a big concern' "" (Feb. 10) reported many Minnesotans' concerns about crude-oil train safety. From the article: ""Oil trains typically have 100 tank cars, each carrying around 30,000 gallons."" In 2014, ""a BNSF oil train crashed and burned near Casselton, N.D., about 20 miles west of Fargo,"" and in June 2018, ""a BNSF train carrying Canadian [tar sands] oil derailed during a flood in northwest Iowa and spilled 160,000 gallons of crude.""\Minnesota is at the epicenter of a crude-by-rail web connecting the Bakken oil fields and Alberta tar sands with refineries and export facilities across the U.S. and Canada. In fact, the Bakken oil train that derailed and exploded in Lac-Mgantic, Quebec, in 2013 passed through Minneapolis on its way to Canada. Canada's Transportation Safety Board initially cited the train's one-person crew size as a cause of the disaster. Canada now mandates minimum two-person crews, which are essential for accident prevention and disaster response, especially with high-hazard freight. In the U.S., two-person crews are standard practice but not federally required.\In a recent hearing on HF 286/SF 263 in the Minnesota House Transportation Committee, railroad representatives opined that technology is improving train safety and that crew size should not be legislated but rather is a proper matter for labor negotiations. In these negotiations, however, the public has no voice. Two-person crews are already required in five other states, with legislation pend\ing in others. Minnesotans deserve to have this bill passed in the interest of public safety, which is government's ""job one.""\Amy Hummel, Robbinsdale\CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY\Also pass this bill pertaining to dangers of skin-lightening creams\Lighter skin is viewed as more beautiful to many people of color, and some women and men are buying harmful lightening creams to achieve the ""perfect"" fair complexion. If you knew these lightening creams contain mercury, would you still use them? Would you risk damaging your kidneys and your central nervous system just to achieve lighter skin?\There are hundreds of skin-lightening products that are brought to the U.S. and sold illegally online and in stores. People are buying these lightening creams and are unaware of the harmful effects. Some don't even know how to identify if a product contains mercury. This is why it is so important that HF 1898/SF 1920 get passed in the Minnesota Legislature. The bills state that the commissioner of health shall develop a grant program to create public awareness and education about the negative effects of skin-lightening creams that contain mercury. In a society where lighter skin is seen as beautiful, it's important that we create public awareness about what we are putting on our body.\Kang Thao, Maplewood\MINNESOTA FIREFIGHTERS\These heroes put it all on the line for us; support this bill to aid them\Etched into our memories is the picture of the firefighters raising the American flag following the terrorist attack on 9/11. They gave us hope in a time of national need, and today we need to remember not only those heroes, but also our Minnesota firefighters.\I find it shocking that Minnesota currently ranks 45th in the nation in per-capita fire service spending, despite being the 21st-most-populous state and 12th-largest in area. We can do better!\We are witnessing increased rates of cancer and heart disease related to exposure to toxic chemicals among our firefighters, as well as higher levels of emotional trauma issues unique to the fire service.\Knowing that these men and women willingly risk their lives to help others compels me to urge citizens throughout the state to contact their state legislators and ask them to support the bipartisan bills HF 1782/SF 2264 establishing a ""Hometown Heroes Assistance Program.""\This legislation would help our hometown firefighters deal with the occupational risks of cancer, heart disease and emotional trauma; and it would provide ways for firefighters to address occupation-related emotional trauma and to promote emotional wellness. It would include a needed critical-illness monetary support program. Moreover, it would create centers of excellence so that all firefighters in Minnesota have regional access to informed and trained medical professionals who can deal with the health and emotional issues facing them.\Let's pull together, regardless of party, and provide Minnesota's firefighters with the tools they need to prioritize and protect their health and thereby ours.\Thomas (Tom) Mortenson, Detroit Lakes, Minn."
165,"Nobody said it was going to be easy.\As the second-term chairman of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party in Minnesota, Ken Martin is tasked with promoting his party's candidates and politicians, and selling their accomplishments to voters. That's no easy feat these days, after a 2015 legislative session when -- despite a nearly $2 billion budget surplus and DFL control of both the Senate and governor's office -- divided government still left many of the party's priorities on the cutting room floor (see: transportation funding bill, universal pre-K).\What's more, after a chaotic one-day special session, disagreements between DFL Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, rank-and-file members and DFL Gov. Mark Dayton left the party in a sort of state of suspended animation, with leaders having little interest in touting what did -- or didn't -- happen.\What happens in session is entirely out of Martin's control, of course, even if he's still responsible for putting a positive face on the outcome.\""It was a session of missed opportunities,"" he said. ""We were able to ... squeeze more out of a pretty unproductive legislative session by vetoing several of the bills that the governor did. When you consider that the House Republicans in their initial education budget proposed $157 million in new spending, and the final number that we got to was about $525 million in new spending on education, that wouldn't have happened without the governor vetoing the education bill and fighting as hard as he did.""\In an interview with MinnPost last week, Martin offered his take on everything from the Bakk-Dayton relationship to House Republican Speaker Kurt Daudt to what to expect during the 2016 legislative session.\On the Bakk-Dayton relationship:\""I do think they were unified in one sense, which is that they had a shared outcome and shared agenda. ... I think there is disagreement among rank-and-file DFLers and others in the caucus on how we actually got there. There's no doubt that the discord between the governor and Senator Bakk didn't help things in the end. But as I like to say: We are one large family in the DFL, and in any family you are going to have fights and disagreements, the question is how do you deal with those. In the end I think it was very clear that the governor as a leader of our party was able to get members in the DFL Senate and the House together to say we have to one agenda.""\""As I've said to both of them, you don't have to like each other, but you do have to work with each other. You have a symbiotic relationship.""\""It should be no surprise to anyone that there is tension between legislative leaders and the governor. There's always been. Now, was it more public this legislative session than in years past? Sure, yes absolutely, and I'm not very happy about that. But it's not anything new.""\On the rural-versus-metro divide:\""There is a divide, not only in our party, but there certainly is a divide in Minnesota, both in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, which is: How do we balance the needs of folks who live in Greater Minnesota with those who live in the ever-growing metro and suburban communities?""\""People in Greater Minnesota, it doesn't matter who is in power, are naturally predisposed to this notion that they are being left behind. They don't feel like people in Washington or in St. Paul are fighting hard for their interests. When they hear all this discord in St. Paul and they see this toxicity and this polarization in politics and nothing happening to improve their communities it's sort of a pox on both houses.""\On Republican Party Chairman Keith Downey:\""When Keith Downey [came to the Legislature] and insisted that Republicans give all [the surplus] back in the form of tax breaks and incentives and giveaways, it was at that moment that you saw Republican legislators start to really turn and say that, 'No, we need to give back all of the surplus.' It created this really unhealthy dynamic in the Legislature.""\""My job as party chair is not to exact rigid purity out of our elected officials. It is really unseemly to me that any unelected official would feel like they have to be more responsive to their political party than to the people they are elected by.""\On Republican Speaker of the House Kurt Daudt:\""I think the biggest loser in this is Kurt Daudt. I know people think he is a winner in this legislative session, but think about what he promised the voters last year. He said, 'We are going to lower the size of government,' yet they voted for the largest state budget in our state's history. They said they are going to decrease taxes, yet they voted for an E-12 bill that has a tax increase. They said they were going to pass a transportation bill to help folks in Greater Minnesota; they punted that bill down the road. They said they were going to help Greater Minnesota ... the Republicans made a whole host of promises in the last legislative session that they didn't and can't say they delivered on to the voters with a straight face.""\"" 'We stopped the Democrats from spending all the surplus and getting a gas tax increase': That's their message. Listen to Kurt Daudt as he is traveling around the state. That's what they are talking about: It's not what we did, it's what we prevented.""\""There's an old saying in politics, that when your opponents are committing political suicide, you get out of the way. He got out of the way. I don't think Kurt did anything magnificent, but the one thing that I would give him credit for is: It's hard when you are first in leadership because you want to be the center of attention, and he just got out of the way. I will give him credit for that.""\On last-minute provisions in budget bills:\""The reality is some of the stuff that was agreed to in those final hours really flies in the face of our values as DFLers, particularly some of the agreements that were made on bad environment policy, some of the agreements made around the state auditor's office. Take the auditor's provision for a moment: Republicans have been trying for years to privatize that office. It's not necessarily just about the auditor's office itself; it's their attempt to privatize large swaths of state agency and state government work. I'm not sure why some Democrats in the state Senate agreed to that provision.""\""If you are going to make a deal, you should get something in return, and I would say there are a lot of Democrats who felt that some of the deals that we made in the final few hours were throwaways, that we didn't really get anything in return for some of the stuff that we gave up. There's a lot of stuff that we gave up that Republicans have been fighting for, for years. If you think about what they got, the Republicans got a lot more out of the deals than Democrats did.""\On tax cuts:\""I really believe strongly that we need to pass a tax bill: We need to do targeted tax relief in the form of property tax relief. But giving back any surplus in the way of rebates or checks is a gimmick, and it's not strategic or smart for the long-term of the state.""\On transportation funding bill:\""The Republicans drew a line in the sand right off the bat; they said there is just no way we are ever going to a transportation bill with a gas tax hike in it.""\""It's not probably realistic [to raise the gas tax] in an election year, but I'm hopeful that something will happen.""\On the 2016 session:\""For us, when we go into the next legislative session, it's making sure the Republicans don't give all that money back and squander an opportunity to make the investments we need to make our state strong.""\""This will be the choice for voters next year: Do you want a tax break, do you want $70 on average, or do you want to make investments in our schools and roads and bridges in the state? That's the choice. I like our odds in that fight.""\This interview has been edited and condensed for publication.\Credit: Briana Bierschbach"
166,"ATTACKS AND SHOOTINGS On an early date, at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, my husband turned to me and whispered, ""You know, four storm troopers with machine guns could take out most of this audience.""I gave him a look between a gasp and a glare. ""You don't think of things like that?"" he asked. ""No,"" I said. ""It's not normal?"" he asked. ""Nope,"" I said. ""It's that Second Generation Holocaust Survivor thing."" We'd been reading about children of Holocaust survivors and their inherited sense of panic. This fit to a tee.Recently, we went to the Orpheum in Minneapolis for the opening night of ""If/Then."" When we arrived, 20 minutes before curtain, the crowd huddled before the exterior doors, unmoving. It was past what should have been curtain time before we learned why: Inside, across the ornate entryway, were several metal detectors, the ones like giant, open-sided coffins standing on end. Polite and calm TSA workers (theater safety associates) told well-dressed theatergoers to empty their pockets of metal and to place phones and purses in small, plastic baskets. As we waited, I turned back to the crowd and said, ""Please put your liquids in small plastic bags,"" then realized by the horror on their faces that people didn't know I was joking.Finally, we walked through, but not before being wanded. It wasn't until we were inside that I thought of my husband's much earlier comments.In the shadow of the attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, in the shadow of near biweekly mass shootings in this country, we have entered a new era. Now we are all Holocaust survivors' children. I shudder at the thought.Sakki Selznick, St. PaulROAD USETentative push for lower speed limits isn't just a bicycling issueThe Bicycle Alliance of Minnesota explored the idea of lowering the minimum speed limit in Minnesota's communities. In our initial research, we found little consensus around how to do this. We're disappointed that the reasons for exploring the idea -- including livability of communities and the goal of no traffic fatalities for drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists -- have been lost in the media coverage, though it is not lost on our supporters across the state. Even the fact that this idea was never presented as a legislative proposal seems to be forgotten.I would also like to correct a quote I feel was taken out of context in the StarTribune.com post about the aforementioned issue. I mentioned to the reporter that polling has shown that bicyclists are regarded as lawbreakers by a significant portion of the general public. I followed up this reference by saying that because of current perception, cyclists are not who should be leading the speed-limit change campaign. There should be a group consisting of a wide range of stakeholders -- like the Complete Streets Coalition or Toward Zero Deaths -- to tackle this issue, which is not only a law change but also an information-gathering and education campaign.Dorian Grilley, MahtomediThe writer is executive director of BikeMN.- - - Regarding the March 9 story about whether Minneapolis has enough bike lanes, one might also consider asking: Does the city have enough vehicle lanes? As seen by our crumbling transportation infrastructure, current vehicle user fees and gas tax levels are not enough to sustain our network of car-oriented roads and bridges across the city and state. In an era in which government spending is so thoroughly questioned by politicians across the spectrum, why have road development costs been completely ignored as a place to question the scope of government presence? In this 21st-century economy -- where people are moving back to cities, density is increasing and climate change is a universally recognized reality -- it seems reasonable to consider government resources being directed toward smart, long-term investments in multimodal transportation that support the health of people and our environment while also saving governments money in the long run.Jason Tanzman, MinneapolisThe writer is executive director of Cycles for Change, a Twin Cities bicycle education and advocacy nonprofit.NORTHSTAR RAILLet's extend it to St. Cloud, a more-obvious terminusLet's hope our Legislature pays attention to the GRIP/ISAIAH faith-based social justice group's plea to extend the Northstar commuter-rail line to St. Cloud (""Transit activists lobby legislators for Northstar rail,"" March 11). The idea of ending the existing line at Big Lake made as much sense as if NASA had sent the Apollo astronauts halfway to the moon.St. Cloud has six times the population of Big Lake and many more organizations that would benefit from a speedy, all-weather rail connection to the Twin Cities. Air travelers would enjoy easier access to Minneapolis-St. Paul International airport, and St. Cloud residents in general could more easily attend Twins, Vikings or Gophers games, Orchestra Hall, the Guthrie Theater and many museums. Add the easy connection to St. Paul and state government centers via the light-rail Green Line, and it becomes obvious where increased Northstar ridership and revenues will come from.It's time for the Legislature to find a way to complete Northstar to St. Cloud so it can meet (and likely exceed) its full potential. The central region of Minnesota deserves nothing less.Bill Steinbicker, MinnetonkaMINNESOTA VIKINGSRename a small stretch of street? Big deal! (But then ...)I clicked the click-bait when I read ""Vikings object to stadium-area street named after rival"" on StarTribune.com. Could the football team really be asking for more and something so petty? Reading the article, you'd think the team was trying to strong-arm the city into renaming the entirety of Chicago Avenue all the way to the Crosstown. Reviewing the application, however, one quickly realizes that the Vikings are asking only for a one-block section north of the light-rail tracks to be renamed, and it doesn't seem like such an egregious request. The team and its billion-dollar stadium make for an easy villain, but this is the type of sensationalism I'd expect from a tabloid.

167,"Minnesota's controversial 4 p.m. waterfowl hunting closure time would be mostly eliminated for youths under a bill that passed the state Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee on Friday.\The 4 p.m. closing would stand for the first weekend of the waterfowl season, but thereafter youths under 18 - or one adult accompanied by a youth - would be allowed to hunt ducks to sunset. Other adult hunters still would be prohibited from hunting after 4 p.m. until later in the season.\The purpose of changing the law is to give youths the chance to hunt after school, which would help encourage a sport that has seen a decline in the number of young hunters. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Bob Lessard, DFL-International Falls, originally would have simply eliminated the 4 p.m. restriction, which is in effect for about the first three weeks of the waterfowl season.\The DNR implemented the 4 p.m. closing in 1973 to reduce hunting pressure in the afternoon. The goal was to encourage migrant ducks to linger in the state longer, taking some of the shooting pressure off the local duck population. DNR officials say the law has worked.\The amended bill will go to the Senate floor for a vote. A companion measure in the House remains in committee.\Snowmobile bill would add money for trails\Another bill passed in Lessard's committee Friday would raise an additional $3 million yearly for grooming and maintaining the grant-in-aid snowmobile trail system. The money would come from three sources: - Snowmobile registration fees would increase $15 to $45 for three years, which would bring in an additional $1.25 million. - The percentage of the state's gas tax that now goes into the special account would increase from the current three-quarters of 1 percent to 1 percent, which would bring in an additional $1.2 million yearly. - $1 million would be appropriated from the state's general fund.\Fishing regulations ad prompts response\An ad in the 1997 Minnesota Department of Natural Resources fishing regulations has generated quite a response, but not the kind the company had hoped for.\The ad for Marine Outlet, which sells boats in St. Cloud, Rochester and the Twin Cities, told readers that they could call an 800 number of the Minnesota Department of Boating for a free boat-buyer's guide. But there is no such state department; the number was to a department within Marine Outlet.\""This reference was misleading,"" said Gail Lewellan of the DNR commissioner's office. ""We've asked them to disconnect the 800 number, and we'll be blacking out that reference on copies of the regulations we have here,"" she said.\But the hundreds of thousands of copies of the regulations already distributed to outlets won't be altered, she said.

There's quite a good bird population in this area,"" said Mark Henry of Farmington, president of the newly formed chapter. ""We're going to key on food plots. The primary purpose is to get more birds.""\Henry said members will work in rural townships such as Empire, Castlerock and Eureka. ""The biggest problem we have is keeping birds through the winter,"" he said.

An action plan recently released by the St. Croix Zebra Mussel Task Force is aimed at keeping it that way.\New major elements of the plan include regulations by the National Park Service controlling the travel of boats that have been in infested waters into the federal zone of the St. Croix, and the enactment of a Wisconsin law (similar to Minnesota's) that requires removal and cleaning of boats found with attached zebra mussels in Wisconsin waters. Enforcement efforts to ensure that boats in the St. Croix River are clean of zebra mussels will be continued.\The Zebra Mussel Task Force coordinates actions among resource management agencies and others to prevent the spread of zebra mussels into the St. Croix River. The Task Force membership includes the Minnesota and Wisconsin departments of natural resources, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Minnesota-Wisconsin Boundary Area Commission.\""While last summer's discovery of three single zebra mussels attached to three of the 18,000 native mussels moved near Stillwater was disturbing, the St. Croix River still remains uninfested,"" said Gary Montz, Minnesota DNR zebra mussel biologist. ""With continued help from the recreational community, we hope to make sure that this exotic animal does not establish populations in the river.""\DNR management system topic\The controversial ecosystem-based management, a system under which the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources manages entire watersheds for the general improvement of resources within them instead of focusing on single sites, will be the topic April 1 at the annual meeting of the Ruffed Grouse Society Twin Cities' Chapter.

168," Selling out workers\ The Feb. 21 editorial against the looming transit strike (""Transit strike / It would be self-destructive"") was typically self- serving.\ All strikes reduce service to constituents. Not every strike would, however, tarnish the opening of your highly touted light- rail line. So what I am reading is the strike should be avoided because your cause will be interfered with, and the transit unions' fight for improved benefits be damned.\ In the long term, doing what is right should supersede what is expedient.\ Craig Johnson, Plymouth.\ .\ Run, Ralph, run\ Imagine the nerve of Ralph Nader offering an alternative to the Democrats and Republicans. I think we need a constitutional amendment to protect us from people like him.\ Donald Empson, Stillwater.\ .\ Before another Democratic strategist tells us Ralph Nader has betrayed them and will help George Bush get reelected, we need to step back and ask what our Democrat political leaders have done for Nader's supporters over the past three years.\ Have they promoted the use of instant runoff voting in presidential elections? Have they opposed Bush with their voting record in any meaningful way, such as the war with Iraq? Have they shielded themselves from special interest money?\ Maybe the reality is the Democrats did more to encourage Nader to run then they're willing to admit.\ Mike Grimes, Fridley.\ .\ Not again\ Ralph Nader enabled George W. Bush to wreck our environment, gut our economy, inhibit scientific inquiry, trick us into an illegal war and further cripple our already inadequate health care and educational systems.\ Nader's narcissistic megalomania will lead our country into another four years of destruction under Bush and his radical administration. He is hurting the causes he espouses. If he were a little more street smart, he would catch on to the fact that the strategy he is following is ""Unsafe at Any Speed.""\ Tom Donahue, Eagan.\ .\ Ralph Nader? For president? Oh, yeah, he is the guy who in 2000 gave us the pearl of wisdom that there is no difference between George Bush and the Democrats.\ Four years later, he still hasn't figured it out? Is that the kind of insightful leadership we need?\ Dean Johnston, Lake Elmo.\ .\ Ralph Nader's announcement that he is going to run as an independent candidate for president only reinforces my opinion of the man: His ego is about the size of President Bush's campaign war chest.\ Tony Compton, Eden Prairie.\ .\ Nader for president? Is this another one of those Republican dirty campaign tricks?\ Mike Kluznik, Mendota Heights.\ .\ According to Ralph Nader, it would be an ""offense"" to deny the public the ""opportunity"" to vote for him. Using this logic, I am immediately announcing my intent to run for president. It is for the good of America.\ For the record, my candidacy will offer America a choice. Unlike Nader, I am not a multimillionaire hypocrite who claims to live off of $5,000 while making $250,000 in speaking fees, investing millions in the stock market and regularly traveling in limousines and staying in first-class hotels.\ However, my candidacy will share one important characteristic with Nader's: Deep down, I know it is all about me.\ James Mogen, St. Paul.\ .\ Not liberal enough?\ Liberals amaze me. They have a likely Democratic presidential nominee in John Kerry who is to the left of Ted Kennedy, yet Ralph Nader's candidacy suggests at least a few of them believe Kerry isn't liberal enough.\ If they're looking to create a minority party, they're well on their way.\ Matthew Johnson, Richfield.\ .\ Toll roads no answer\ I hope toll-road proponents and the Minnesota Department of Transportation realize that using toll roads to finance new construction doesn't address how the state will maintain all these new miles of freeway.\ The tolls sunset ""once the road is paid off,"" but every new mile of freeway has to be plowed, patched, and resurfaced regularly.\ If we want better transportation, trains or lanes, we have to pay for it. Raise the gas tax, build diverse transit options and stop pretending we can get something for nothing.\ John Farrell, Minneapolis.\ .\ Close to home\ Your Feb. 20 editorial praises low-cost imports and the resulting higher incomes for third world citizens (""Outsourcing / In defense of Bush's economist"").

(p. 23.)\ ""They [legislative leaders] eliminated the above benchmark in the third draft and replaced it with the following requirement: Students will identify explorers and examine the effects of exploration as it relates to contact between societies with different religions, values and structures. (p. 23.)\ ""We have left the world of history and have entered the world of diversity training. (This is actually an old Profile of Learning standard.) Didn't the Legislature repeal the Profile last year? Why is it being resurrected behind closed doors?""\ EdWatch's testimony was given to the House committee and the press in writing. The public has the right to know what EdWatch actually said.\ Julie M. Quist, Chaska;\ vice president, EdWatch.\ .\ Family values\ So the Minnesota Family Council is ""supporting the traditional American family"" by pressuring Lutheran Social Services to stop allowing gay and lesbian couples to adopt (Star Tribune, Feb. 20).\ Ironically, on the same page, the Star Tribune reported on a man who fractured his infant son's skull after a beer bottle thrown at the baby's mother hit him instead.\ Any man and woman can produce a child, whether or not they want one, whether or not they are fit parents, and without any screening. But parents who make the decision to adopt a child and are willing and able to go through the extensive screening, no matter what their sexual orientation, are those who truly want a child and are the most likely to be wonderful parents.\ Thank you, LSS, for the work you do. Keep finding the best homes for our children, and don't give in to this kind of pressure.\ Brenda Grove, Minneapolis.\ .\ Hooray for 200 fanatical members of the Minnesota Family Council who were so bold as to harass a lesbian couple through e-mail and phone calls until the couple withdrew their names from a public adoption Web site.\ And the Minnesota Family Council issued a news release saying it was so proud.\ This is the same kind of heavy-handed religious fanaticism that fueled the Taliban, only this time in the misguided belief that it is serving Jesus Christ based on its own narrow interpretation of the scriptures.\ Jeremy Powers, Fridley."
169,"daeikens@stcloudtimes.com\Rep. Dan Severson spent much of his life in the Navy. His challenger, Barb Beniek, is a longtime educator and school board member.\Those life experiences have shaped each candidate's political priorities as they compete for a seat in the Legislature.\Severson has promoted a number of bills benefiting veterans. Beniek, an education instructor at St. Cloud State University, said if voters elect her, she will work on improving school funding.\The winner will represent House District 14A, which includes Sauk Rapids, Sartell, Rice and Holdingford. The district has been strongly Republican, backing President Bush twice and supporting Norm Coleman for U.S Senate and Tim Pawlenty for governor.\For the past four years, it has been represented by Severson, who touts his conservative credentials with opposition to tax increases, private-sector solutions to health care and as one of the leading proponents of a vote on placing a ban on gay marriage in the state constitution.\Military career\Severson, 52, is a retired Navy pilot who in 2002 won the Republican endorsement and general election for an open seat created in redistricting. He was re-elected in 2004. His Navy background has made him a leading advocate for legislation benefiting those who have served in the military.\In June, the United Veterans Legislative Council of Minnesota honored Severson, citing provisions that include tax credits for active personnel, college credit for military training, in-state tuition rates for veterans and additional money for the Minnesota Veterans Homes board.\He's also passed laws to allow veterans with a commercial driver's license to pass a test to get one in Minnesota, designated May as veterans month and created veterans liaisons on campuses.\Severson believes Minnesota has been unfriendly to veterans returning to Minnesota.\""One of my pushes has been, hey, let's take a look at the veterans,"" Severson said.\In the campaign, Severson touts a plan to provide tax incentives for veterans to start businesses in Minnesota.\Severson grew up in St. Cloud, graduating from Technical High School and St. Cloud State University.\In 1979, he joined the Navy, going to flight training and receiving his Navy wings in 1980 to fly jets.\He flew out of Japan and later flew F-18s out of Southern California. He retired in 2000 and returned to Minnesota.\In the campaign, he is sometimes pictured in uniform in fliers and borrowed a refurbished World War II truck with a machine gun to use in parades in Holdingford and Rice, symbolism that unnerved Beniek because it came shortly after Severson was quoted at a July fundraiser asking God ""to freeze up the war chest of the enemy.""\Severson said Tuesday he was referring to ""enemies of freedom,"" not Democrats. Beniek said she used the comment in a letter to raise more than $1,000.\Educator, advocate\Much the way Severson's Navy service has steered his political efforts, Beniek, 65, turned her interest in education into public service.\She grew up in Milwaukee, attending Catholic schools and an all-girls high school. She joined a Roman Catholic religious community, drawn by how it helped young people.\She attended Mundeleine College in Chicago and went on to be a teacher in private Catholic schools in Des Moines, Iowa, and Lincoln, Neb.\She started working toward her master's degree at the University of San Francisco and met Geno Beniek, a St. Cloud priest who was taking graduate classes at the school.\The couple decided not to wait for the church to allow priests to marry and moved on with their life together and were married in 1972.\The couple moved to Watab Township in 1976. Beniek became active in the Rice Parents, Teachers Association in 1982.\Later, she joined a community group concerned about the 1983 teachers strike in Sauk Rapids-Rice school district.\The group served as a board watchdog.\She turned that activism into a run for the school board in May 1983.\She lost but turned around and won the next year, starting her service in 1985. In 1990, the board asked district voters to approve a property tax increase to build a high school. The effort failed and all board members on the ballot, including Beniek, were thrown out.\But Beniek didn't stop going to meetings. She would sit in the front row and monitor the board. She came back and won a seat on the board in 1991 and has served since.

He was appointed to the Minnesota Commissioner for Midwest Interregional Passenger Rail Commission.\Economic development and jobs, education and veteran and military affairs issues.\If Minnesota voters decide this fall that the state's motor vehicle sales tax should go entirely to transportation, will that take care of our future needs, or are other steps necessary and if so, what would you support? What should do we do if voters decide not to dedicate that money to transportation?\Beniek said ...\No, it will not take care of our needs -- it is only a small portion of what is needed to meet the needs. However, I do not support the amendment because of its ambiguous wording -- all dollars could go to transportation and none to roads and bridges. Secondly, what will replace the $300 million taken from the general fund? I would propose a gas tax increase -- somewhere (from) 3 to 5 cents a gallon. This tax has not been increased since 1988 -- in comparison, Wisconsin has a 10.8 cents higher gas tax that is dedicated to roads and bridges. I think we have been neglectful in establishing and using a dedicated fund for transportation.\Severson said ...\Once the MVST is dedicated to transportation, we can see what the expected revenue per year is from state and federal sources and see what the projected need is. The importance of this provision is that if it is not passed, future Legislatures can continue take money out of MVST revenues to spend on other issues. That was never the intent when the provision was enacted in the 1980s. Once we have it dedicated, we can determine whether additional dollars are needed and if so, how much of a gas tax would fit the need. I am also supportive of a seven-county metro sales tax for development of light rail in the metro area. We spend $285 million a year on bus transit in the metro area and everyone from Virginia to Albert Lea pays that tax. Those are transportation dollars that are gone, and there is no long-term gain in infrastructure or capacity --g one.\State revenue collections so far this year suggest the state might have a tax revenue surplus when the Legislature returns next year, after several years of dealing with shortfalls. What would you propose to do with the excess revenue, through rebates, spending, aid to local governments or tax changes?\Beniek said ...\If there is a surplus, I would never support returning the dollars to the taxpayers.\I would suggest using the surplus for restoring cuts in the areas that have affected the most vulnerable of our population and increasing Local Government Aid so property taxes can be reduced.\I think we need to be vigilant in returning those dollars that continuing that funding is sustainable, too.\Severson said ...\The MVST is scheduled to be phased in over a four-year cycle. We will need some of that revenue to fill the hole that it makes in the general fund. We also can invest in cost-containment measures that will pay dividends in the future and reduce future tax liabilities. (We did this with Workman's Comp a few years ago.)\Rebates, if given, would be in the form of property tax relief to respond to the double-digit increases in local property taxes. We also need to get a handle on property valuation and local spending by removing some of the unfunded mandates passed down to counties and cities from the state. If it isn't funded, don't mandate it.\What proposals would you endorse to deal with the rising costs of health care and education, and what effect would those proposals have on the accessibility and quality of those services?\Beniek said ...\For health care, I would endorse a proposal that would bring health care providers to the table to develop a plan that would reduce health care costs and the cost of health insurance. The proposal needs to address the reasons and solutions that are viable to lower costs in both areas.\I would also endorse a proposal that would make health care available for ALL children in the state. I would also propose a return of all funding in the Health Care Access Fund to the Minnesota Care program. This Health Care Access fund is the result of a 2 percent tax on all health care providers specifically for providing low-cost health insurance to those who could not otherwise afford it.\In the area of education, the formula by which the state funds K-12 public schools needs to be revamped so that the dollars do indeed cover a basic and uniform education for ALL students.\A group called PS Minnesota has been studying the issue for several years and is ready to make a recommendation to the Legislature. I will study and consider this carefully.\We also need to return funding to Early Childhood education -- as research shows that this is critical if children are to be ready to learn when they get to school. I would also support fully funding all-day, everyday kindergarten.\In the area of higher education, we need to make a serious effort to stop the climb of tuition and give students more accessibility to earn a two- or four-year degree.\Severson said ...\Rising health care costs affect everyone. We need system reform to bring consumer involvement and cost transparency into the process. Health savings accounts and best practices are a couple of measures we have enacted and are now seeing the results of. Cost of health care increases, while still growing disproportionally to salary increases, are starting to level off. As we see more market penetration with HSAs and consumer involvement, I believe we will see a leveling of and even reduction of costs. Education is one of our most important investments we as a community make. We currently spend over 50 percent of our budget on education for K-12 and higher ed. Simply throwing more money at the issue is short-sighted and irresponsible.\We need systemwide reform in both K-12 and higher ed. Currently about 40 percent of the students going on to higher education need remedial classes to get up to speed for college. Though we are second in the nation for NAEP scores for fourth- and eighth-graders, we slide to eighth for those who graduate.\We have one of the best school systems in the country, but our country is falling behind in this global economy. We need to do much more to encourage students to pursue the hard sciences and math curriculum where the jobs of tomorrow will have their emphasis. More spending is not the only answer, and with education and health care taking up over 77 percent of the state budget, there remains little left for environment, public safety, agriculture or transportation.\These are topics worthy of open and honest debate, and I look forward to suggestions and an honest dialogue."
170,"No: Regulations shield nature from harm\Free-market business actions must not guide environment\By Dave Shuster\St. Cloud\Conservative interests recently have attacked federal legislation protecting the environment on several fronts.\Sponsored by Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Cal., and passed by the House, the deceptively labeled ""Threatened and Endangered Species Recovery Act"" substantially weakens the regulatory powers of existing legislation.\Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, sponsored the ""Gasoline for America's Security Act of 2005."" Passing by two votes, the bill diminishes regulation of oil refinery construction. Finally, the Supreme Court of new Chief Justice John Roberts has decided to hear cases that could jeopardize parts of the Clean Water Act.\Critics like to point out the original Endangered Species Act has led to full recovery of less than 1 percent of listed species. This poor success rate is regarded as inadequate justification for the costs incurred by private individuals and communities for complying with the bill's regulations.\However, one can also say 99 percent of protected species have been saved from extinction.\The importance of maintaining ecosystems and biodiversity cannot be accurately quantified in dollars.\The American bald eagle, the California condor and the Pacific salmon, species saved by the legislation, all have a value to our earth that far exceeds that of any human financial endeavor.\Pombo's plan\Pombo's bill tightens the requirements for establishing protected critical habitat for endangered species, opening up additional wilderness areas to unneeded development. Through the bill, a political appointee determines within a limited time what represents accurate scientific data to substantiate listing a species.\This eliminates the checks and balances of a committee approach and provides opponents an opportunity to exert undo influence on the listing process.\Finally, Pombo's legislation mandates compensation of property owners by the federal government if measures necessary to protect a species prevent land development and associated financial gain.\This represents the most insulting component of the ""Recovery Act,"" requiring taxpayers to subsidize developers for complying with federal law.\Barton's GAS Act eases the ability of the oil industry to obtain permits for building refineries and provides federal land for plant construction.\Closed military bases are offered as potential construction sites, but federal land also includes national forests and wildlife refuges.\Locations for refineries would be determined by the president, bypassing the wishes of those living near the proposed site. Amazingly, the GAS act fails to mandate higher fuel efficiency in automobiles.\Oil companies do not require government assistance for refinery construction.\Conservatives incessantly blame higher energy costs on environmental regulations that have impeded refinery development and fuel production.\However, the EPA has had only one proposal for refinery construction in 29 years, a request approved in nine months.\Conversely, 176 refineries were closed in the past 25 years. Reasons provided by the industry were inefficiency and lack of need.\The real motive may have been to reduce supply to escalate prices. Higher prices convince consumers to believe oil company arguments for the relaxation of environmental regulations.\Wetlands\The most notorious case to be heard by the Supreme Court involves wetlands protection.\John Rapanos, a Michigan farmer, filled in 54 acres of protected wetlands on his property with the intent of constructing a shopping center. Rapanos was repeatedly advised of the wetland's protected status, ignored instructions to acquire a permit, failed to head the advice of his consultant, and disregarded EPA orders to stop construction.\He was fined $185,000 and received a 10-month jail sentence. His lawyers argue the wetlands were not regulated by the Clean Water Act.\Government prosecutors offer the wetlands were part of the Lake Huron drainage system, thereby deserving protected status. Property rights activists have rallied for Rapanos.\Property rights do not provide justification for Rapanos' actions. Ponds and marshes serve as filtering systems to protect and purify larger bodies of water, trap silt and prevent erosion.\Of all plants and animals listed as threatened in the United States, 35 percent either live in wetlands or depend on them. In Minnesota, despite laws designed to achieve no net loss, a DNR study found a net loss of 5,000 acres since 1995.\Some hunters blame the loss for what appears to be a falling duck population.\The environment is not part of the free market. Failure to protect the health of our ecosystems will eventually extract a serious toll through human suffering.\Efforts to weaken environmental regulations must be stopped not only to preserve a seemingly obscure species of plant or animal, but to preserve ourselves.\This is the opinion of Dave Shuster, a St. Cloud resident who provides the liberal side of My Serve, published the first Sunday of the month.\AP photo\Two bald eagles perch on a big white pine north of Nisswa.\Yes: Ineffective restrictions place burdens on liberties\Several reforms required before protections are valid\By Kent Benson\St. Cloud\Conservatives are often stereotyped by their political opponents as narrow-minded and uncompromising.\Ironically, there is no one more narrow-minded and uncompromising than the environmental extremist. There is no restriction too burdensome, no bureaucracy too bloated or heavy-handed, no hindrance to economic development too great, and no human concession too extreme in the minds of those who place the comfort, liberty, and survival of animals above those of human beings.\I am a proponent of environmental protections. I'm well aware there are people in this world who are willing to disregard the impacts their actions may have on the environment and the danger they pose to animals and other people.\I have no problem with the government establishing laws to discourage such actions. It's when those protections are ineffective, needlessly burdensome and antagonistic to individual liberty that I see the need for reform.\Time for change\The Endangered Species Act has long been in need of reform. The ESA has been woefully ineffective in recovering threatened and endangered species.\According to Rep. Richard Pombo's Committee on Resources report, of the 1,304 listed species in the act's history only 30 percent are ""stable"" and only 9 percent are ""improving.""\The report further states, ""(N)umerous qualified studies assert that none of the species listed by the Fish and Wildlife Service to have been 'recovered' in the United States may reasonably be claimed to have recovered as a result of the ESA.""\A 1997 National Wilderness Institute report states, ""there is no (recovery) case which required the ESA to bring about the improvement of a species.""\Examples of the ESA's heavy-handed, inflexible bureaucracy are legion. Take the case of farm irrigation being prohibited in Oregon's Klamath Basin in deference to the endangered sucker fish.\After 1,200 farmers and ranchers experienced losses, the National Academy of Science determined that the prohibition had ""no sound scientific basis.""\The Arboga levee in California went without repair for fear of disturbing the habitat of the longhorn elderberry bark beetle. When the levee broke from a flood, three people were killed. About 500 homes, 9,000 acres of farmland and four large businesses were flooded, and 35,000 people were displaced.\The ESA's primary strategy of critical habitat designations is seriously flawed.\In 1999, Jamie Rappaport, the Fish and Wildlife Service director for President Clinton, testified that the ESA's critical habitat provision, ""provides little additional protection to most listed species, while it consumes significant amounts of scarce conservation resources.""\Oil, refuges\Contrary to my fellow writer's assertion, Rep. Joe Barton's Gasoline for America's Security Act of 2005 contains no proposal to build refineries in national forests and wildlife refuges.\There is no doubt the oil refining industry, like virtually every other industry the past 30 years, has undergone dramatic changes to become more efficient and seek more consistent earnings in what is a highly volatile industry. There were many years when oil refineries lost money.\Since when are efforts by a business to improve its long-term viability through improved productivity considered an evil conspiracy?\If we are concerned about the level of refining industry profits, we should be doubly concerned about gas taxes.\According to a Tax Foundation study, state and local gas tax collections exceed oil industry profits by a large margin. Since 1977, more than twice the profits of all major U.S. oil companies combined have been collected in gas taxes, or $1.34 trillion.\EPA approval is only one among about 800 permits required in order to open a refinery. The latest attempt to establish a refinery in Arizona has been in the works for six years at a cost of $30 million, with little to show for it. The proposed site faces an uphill battle. In addition to the red tape, lawsuits by activists create delays and further inflate costs.\According to the American Petroleum Institute, in the past 10 years the industry has invested $47 billion to comply with new environmental controls, as apposed to investing in new capacity.\The GAS Act is a reasonable effort by the government to incent the refining industry to invest in additional, desperately needed production capability.\The 17-year John Rapanos wetlands case is more about the abuse of federal government power than it is about the abuse of the environment. Rapanos' conviction has been overturned once by the Supreme Court. And, in a separate case the high court invalidated the mandatory sentencing guidelines originally applicable to his conviction.\According to Pacific Legal Foundation's principal attorney, Reed Hopper, ""Federal officials have been exploiting the Clean Water Act to bully and take land and money from property owners for far too long. We're asking the Supreme Court to rein in federal bureaucrats once and for all."" It sounds more like a meritorious case than a notorious one.\A wise first century Roman scholar once warned against the dangers of esteeming nature above the creator. He said we become fools professing to be wise when the beauty and grandeur of nature no longer compel us to worship its creator, but instead compel us to worship the creation.\The scholar's name was Saul of Tarsus, better know as Paul the apostle. It's time for his warning to be heeded and for the foolishness of environmental extremism to end.\This is the opinion of Kent Benson, a St. Cloud resident who provides the conservative side of My Serve, published the first Sunday of the month."

Every 10 minutes of commuting results in 10 percent fewer social connections, says Robert Putnam, Harvard professor and ""Bowling Alone"" author.\ - ""Road building doesn't help much,"" writes New Yorker author Nick Paumgarten. ""The more highway lanes you build, the more traffic you get."" Indeed, Star Tribune reporter Laurie Blake reported recently that Hwy. 100 is starting to jam up again during rush hour after third lanes were added.\ For years, the Twin Cities area has been approaching congestion primarily from the ""supply"" side of highways rather than trying to control the ""demand"" of traffic. But it seems unlikely that, by road or rail, we will build our way out of present congestion, let alone the million-resident wave that we are told we must welcome in the next few years.\ Yes, extra lanes on Hwys. 100, 494, 694 and 394 have helped a lot, but construction and maintenance costs are rising, the long- delayed 35W-Crosstown bottleneck fix is just getting started, work has been put off for the Hwy. 169 Devil's Triangle fix in Brooklyn Park and, even if the Legislature had passed a gas tax increase, it's doubtful that funds would be adequate for the long term.\ So let's look at what we can do about demand. Better yet, why shouldn't we put commuting and transportation into a Minnesota Livability Index, a broader consideration of quality of life that might also include the economy, education, the environment, health, cultural and sports amenities, affordable housing, poverty and crime? The Greater Twin Cities United Way has done some of this; perhaps someone could do it more broadly, developing extensive ""benchmarks,"" to use a word much in vogue these days.\ On transportation, for starters, we could:\ - Require major development proposals to coordinate with transportation, through review by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and counties, the governments responsible for building and maintaining highways. If sewers can be a factor in siting new developments, why can't roads?\ - Stop subsidizing growth in a congested urban area and shift subsidies to parts of Minnesota with unused infrastructure and dwindling populations.\ - Enact an ""infrastructure (or growth) tax"" to require new developments to help pay for the transportation and schools they require. We've already done that, to an extent, for parks and sewers.\ - Make more use of commuter rail to the extent that it's economically feasible. When I moved here from Philadelphia 45 years ago, I couldn't believe the miles of unused potential commuter track. I still can't.\ - Extend metro planning beyond the seven-county Twin Cities area. You'll see tremendous urban-induced growth as you drive beyond the Hennepin County line on Hwy. 12 and other highways, roads that of course are becoming more crowded.\ Effective metro planning involves a delicate balance of competing quality-of-life interests. Commuter transportation seems to be a part that is increasingly out of balance.\ .\ Medina resident Robert Franklin, a retired Star Tribune reporter, a senior adjunct faculty member at the University of St. Thomas and a former Medina City Council member, is pleased that he no longer has to commute daily."
172,"-RSEC-\ Fred Anderson isn't so much worried about funding an anti-missile system or bioterrorism preparedness as he is heating his north Minneapolis home .\ ""You know it gets cold up here,"" said Anderson, 77, who received $543 this year under the federal heating assistance program, one of the domestic programs that President Bush targeted for cuts in his budget proposal last week. ""Of course there are other considerations.""\ When Bush opted to pursue the largest military increase in a generation and a boost in homeland security, he also proposed cuts that could hit hard in Minnesota. The state may lose nearly $12 million under the fuel-assistance plan.\ Brian Dean, 56, a laid-off Northwest Airlines employee from New Brighton, fears he won't get the training he needs as Minnesota braces for a possible loss of $3.7 million in job-training funds.\ Mahnomen County Sheriff Richard Rooney is worried the funds that allowed him to hire two officers through the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program are about to dry up. Under Bush's proposal, about 80 percent of the funds would disappear, a cut of $574 million from last year, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\ John Kimball, vice president of St. Anthony Park Bank, says he won't be able to authorize as many Small Business Administration- backed loans: Minnesota could lose about half of the $234 million it received last year under one program for small-business loans.\ Minnesota's highways are also on the list of cuts: The president wants to cut $9 billion in highway programs nationally, costing Minnesota $99 million.\ In addition, Bush is proposing to stop funding for an urban revitalization program that has brought millions of dollars to Minneapolis. Hundreds of school and community programs are potential victims, as well, including at least six in Minnesota.\ All of this assures a big fight on Capitol Hill.\ Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., is vowing to filibuster some of the reductions, calling the cuts in heating aid ""mean-spirited.""\ Rep. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn., a member of the House Budget Committee, defended Bush's plan, saying Congress must sort out ""need versus want.""\ Out in the cold\ Anderson, a retired computer assemblyman who lives on a monthly Social Security check of $612, is one of 89,000 Minnesotans who have received help under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program this winter, according to the Minnesota Department of Commerce.\ Bush is proposing to cut $300 million from the program nationally, according to Wellstone's office.\ John Harvanko, director of the energy assistance program at the state commerce department, said the cuts would leave two choices. ""We could serve less households or reduce the benefits that we provide,"" he said.\ In an attempt to improve his job prospects, Dean, a former aviation trainer, has been attending job-training seminars through the state's Dislocated Worker Program. He said the interviewing advice, resume writing workshops and access to computers for job searches are helping him get back into the work force.\ Looking for work is ""a difficult process,"" he said. ""We're not trained how to get a job.""\ Paul Moe, head of the program, said it has served 14,500 workers in the first five months of this fiscal year, putting them on track to shatter last year's record of 18,000. With only about $3 million to last until July 1, Moe said a federal cut would be devastating.\ ""We're unable to serve the need now, under current funding,"" he said. ""It's very sobering, very serious. The numbers are staggering.""\ The program received $10.5 million in regular federal funding last year and a one-time grant of $8 million to help absorb airline- related layoffs.\ Rooney, the Mahnomen sheriff, said the more than $200,000 his department has received through the COPS program helped his force develop a good relationship with people in the area they serve.\ ""We were able to add additional officers, offer training, technology - some things we never had,"" he said. ""People are calling us now because they know us, because they trust us.""\ With the recession squeezing budgets around the state, Rooney said he will have to find new ways to pay for ""community awareness"" programs.\ In a recession, small businesses often have a difficult time getting loans. Kimball, of St. Anthony Park Bank, said to cut funding for the 7(a) loan program - in which the government guarantees a portion of the loan - would exacerbate the problem.\ ""At a time when small businesses historically create the largest amounts of job growth, my concern is that affected banks are being forced to tighten credit,"" he said.\ On the Hill\ As members of Congress began combing through Bush's proposal, battle lines were being drawn.\ The president and his supporters said that his budget, with a military spending increase and tax cuts, is the winning formula for the war on terrorism and a tonic for the sputtering economy.\ ""I think the way we get back to a surplus is to ultimately get this economy rolling again,"" said Rep. Mark Kennedy, R-Minn.\ Most Republicans are standing by the $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax cut approved last year. Many Democrats disagree, saying it's the main culprit in the return of deficit spending. As they look for ways to pay for domestic programs, some are calling for a freeze in parts of the tax cut.\ Sen. Mark Dayton, D-Minn, said that freezing income-tax reductions planned for individuals in the top tax bracket could save nearly $100 billion over 10 years.\ With Bush proposing more tax cuts for energy companies and other businesses that meet certain criteria, Wellstone said it's a case of ""distorted priorities.""\ ""In every coffee shop in Minnesota, people are going to say: 'What? Get your priorities straight,' "" said Wellstone.\ One thing is clear: There is bipartisan opposition to at least some of the cuts.\ Republican Kennedy and Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., the top-ranked Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, have announced that they want Congress to approve more money for roads.\ ""It's absolutely critical that at a time that our economy is sluggish that we do not reduce roads funding that is so critical to our economic health,"" said Kennedy.\ Said Oberstar, ""The budget process submitted to Congress is a starting point, not the end of the process.""\ - Washington Bureau Correspondent Rob Hotakainen contributed to this report.\ - Todd Milbourn is at tmilbourn@mcclatchydc.com.\ At a glance:\ Proposed cuts\ Federal funding for programs ranging from child development and highway construction to home heating assistance would be cut by more than $200 million in Minnesota under President Bush's proposed budget.\ - Heating assistance: Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program helps Minnesotans with winter heating bills. Funding nationwide would be reduced $300 million, including $11.9 million in Minnesota.\ - Job training: A number of job training programs would be eliminated. National funding would be cut $800 million, with $3.7 million cut in Minnesota.\ - Community policing: The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) was started to help communities hire additional police officers. Current funding would be reduced by $574 million, or 80 percent. Exact cut in Minnesota is uncertain. Since 1994, 1,371 officers have been hired or redeployed in the state with COPS funding.\ - Small business: The 7(a) loan guarantee program provides help to small businesses by guaranteeing private sector loans for growth and expansion. National funding would be cut $4.95 billion, including $117 million in Minnesota.\ - Highways: A projected drop in gas tax revenues would translate into lower spending on roads. National funding would drop $9 billion, with Minnesota losing $99 million in federal money.\ - Empowerment zones: A program that provides incentives for business and housing development in urban areas would be eliminated, with funding switched to block grants. Since 1999, Minneapolis has been allocated $21.9 million in grants.\ - Education: Hundreds of school and community programs would be cut to pay for a deficit in the Pell Grant college programs. At least six in Minnesota are potential victims: two programs involving curriculum and development of an ""e-mentoring environment"" for the Minnesota state colleges and universities, totaling $2 million; the Greater Minneapolis Day Care Council, which could lose $350,000; the Fraser Child & Family Center in Minneapolis, which could lose $200,000, and the Centennial and Stillwater school districts, which could lose $293,000 and $227,000 respectively for after-school programs.\ - Source: White House, U.S. Department of Justice, Small Business Administration, congressional offices"
173,"Published 07/09/96: This article incorrectly said Sen. Paul Wellstone has no opponent in the DFL primary. Dick Franson has filed against him. This article also incorrectly reported the title of R. Jane Brown, Minnesota commissioner of economic security.\A willing target\With no opponent in the Sept. 10 primary, DFL Sen. Paul Wellstone should be taking it easy now, watching his Republican rivals carve each other up. Instead, he seems determined to meet every parry and thrust meted out by Republicans from here to Capitol Hill. Last week, he staged a rally with nearly 100 supporters wearing T-shirts with bulls-eye targets and the slogan, ""Proud to be a Number One Republican target."" Wellstone has insisted he is the Republicans' top target for November (aside from the president, presumably), and last week he said that targeting him was the same as targeting average Minnesotans. ""If you target me, you target the environment,"" he said. ""If you target me, you target senior citizens. If you target me, you target hard-working families."" Republicans, despite running what seem to be continuous ads attacking ""ultraliberal Paul Wellstone"" on various issues, say Wellstone is not their primary target. ""We have many targets for November,"" state Republican Party chairman Chris Georgacas said. Wellstone staffer Bill Lofy said the campaign is not going to wait until November to respond to Republican attacks. ""We're not going to let them get away with that,"" he said.\- Patricia Lopez Baden\Quiz time\What do the following people have in common with Gov. Arne Carlson? Veteran Affairs Commissioner Bernie Melter, Public Service Commissioner Kris Sanda, Department of Military Affairs Adjutant General Eugene Andreotti, Jobs and Training Commissioner R. Jane Brown, State Planning Director Linda Kohl, and Natural Resources Commissioner Ron Sando.\Answer: They are the only original major department heads remaining in the Carlson administration. Each was appointed in late 1990 or early 1991 by the new governor. A couple dozen others have come and gone for various reasons ranging from being fired by the governor to taking more lucrative positions in the private sector. The latest casualty was Chuck Williams. His last day as commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency was Friday. He quit to take a job in the private sector.\- Robert Whereatt\The fastest cops on two wheels\Capitol Security, the police force that patrols the Capitol complex of 16 public buildings, 26 parking facilities and neighboring streets and walkways, has a new look this summer: a bike patrol. Four officers who were given special training on the bikes are now moving about by pedal power. Lt. Patrick Chase, director of Capitol Security, said the bike cops' response time can be quicker than his officers in squad cars because they can cut across the campus and move into crowds more easily. ""They can beat the car nine out of 10 times,"" he said. The bike patrollers also have more contact with the public, allowing them to give directions and other assistance.\- Robert Whereatt\House DFLers losing two top aides\Two top legislative aides, both astute political tacticians, are leaving the House DFL caucus. Jim Wafler, an administrative aide to House Speaker Irv Anderson, DFL-International Falls, (and to speakers before him), is leaving Aug. 1. He is expected to become executive director of the Highway Construction Industry Council, a organization representing road- and bridge-related businesses. Wafler will be back in the Capitol next year to lobby those he previously worked for. His agenda undoubtedly will include an increase in the gas tax. Later this month, Todd Rapp will step down as the top aide to House Majority Leader Phil Carruthers, DFL-Brooklyn Center. Rapp will head up campaign efforts for Senate DFLers. Rapp, who previously worked for the DFL Party, will be assisting Senate DFL candidates who are scrambling to keep control.

174,"Senator says experience will aid him at City Hall\By Lawrence Schumacher\lschumacher@stcloudtimes.com\Dave Kleis has found another way to serve the city he's represented for 11 years at the Capitol, and he's not going to let it get past him for lack of effort.\The state senator thrives on campaigning and talking to people about St. Cloud.\But if Kleis hopes to defeat incumbent Mayor John Ellenbecker at the polls Nov. 8, he has to show he can move from being one vote among many at the Legislature to leading the entire city.\The driving-school owner's legislative record includes victories for the area cities he's represented, including authorization this year of an extended local sales tax.\But he's also frequently been on the losing end of campaigns for government reform, and critics assert that his conservative, anti-tax philosophy has hurt St. Cloud financially.\Kleis sat down with the Times recently to discuss his legislative record, the upcoming election and his vision for St. Cloud's future.\Q\What qualifies you to be mayor?\A\I've served the community for 11 years. I passed legislation every year I've been in the Legislature, despite being in the minority, and in some cases, some significant legislation.\I've authored every issue the city of St. Cloud, through the time that I've been there, has asked for. And in most cases passed them through the Senate.\We haven't been successful totally legislatively, but we did finally pass the sales tax that the area voters voted on. But that has passed the Senate every time that I've been in it.\I've got a strong record of being tough on crime. I was the ranking minority member on the crime-prevention committee and had significant input on parts of Katie's Law, sex-offender legislation and this year authored the governor's bill that puts the worst of the worst away for life without release, and then also first-degree murder, that was an amendment I had on the floor.\That passed this year and is also part of that package.\I was a co-author of the Gang Strike Force that actually got the St. Cloud part of it put into the advisory board. So I helped create that gang force that's been significant in this area in helping to reduce gang activity.\Q\What is your vision for the next four years?\A\My top three priorities are public safety, neighborhood preservation and jobs.\In the St. Cloud area, we're one major business closing away from an economic disaster here. We need diversity in jobs and to bring in good-paying jobs.\My No. 1 priority is public safety and making sure we reduce our crime rate, making sure that public safety is on the top of the agenda.\Also I'm running because of the core neighborhoods. I live in one of the core neighborhoods. I've lived there for 13 years, and I want to stay there. But I see some changes, and I want to make sure that those changes are turned around, that we respect the core of the city. No community is vibrant and vital without a good, solid core.\Q\What do you agree and disagree with your opponent about?\A\I think we both agree on (Local Government Aid). That's what it was designed for, so that (if) you have a city that may not have the property wealth ... you can be able to handle the public services like police and fire. Especially in a regional center ... the property taxpayer shouldn't pay for all of that.\I've been a strong proponent of Local Government Aid. I've offered amendments every year to increase the amount of LGA that the city of St. Cloud receives, and I was actually successful this year. We actually put $1.4 million of additional LGA that the city wasn't expecting or anticipating this year.\I think we disagree on taxation. I believe you should find efficiencies in government. I would disagree with a 10.2 percent property tax increase. I don't think that's responsible. When you look at a lot of folks in my neighborhood, a lot of them are senior citizens who are retired and are on Social Security. There hasn't been a 10.2 percent bump in Social Security.\One other area is probably just in style. I tend to seek out people's opinions on issues. I do a lot of door knocking, a lot of town meetings, a lot of solicitation of ideas. I've always said that the best ideas I have come from other people. That's why you need a full-time mayor, to make sure you seek that out.\Q\Does less state aid mean higher property taxes?\A\That's from the assumption that everything is running efficiently, and I don't buy that everything is always efficient. In business, you do a constant annual review. And I believe in zero-based budgeting, to determine what the city may be doing that isn't necessary and where you can find efficiencies.\I've operated a business for 15 years, and in some of those years I've actually cut prices and increased profits. You constantly have to re-evaluate efficiency. Business does that all the time. I think government needs to do the same thing.\Q\Didn't you vote to cut LGA in the Legislature in 2003?\A\It didn't cut LGA. It didn't put as much in as was anticipated. I actually tried an amendment to bring more LGA in. But again, that was one of those overall tax bills, and quite frankly, what was in that tax bill that I voted for was JOBZ. And if not for JOBZ, Arctic Cat wouldn't be coming to St. Cloud. So there's a give and take in those types of bills.\If you look over the last 10 years, there was a bump in Local Government Aid. In the property tax reform of 2001, where we reduced property taxes for everyone in the state by taking education off, we increased money for local government aid.\Q\What is your position on the proposed civic center expansion and municipal campus study?\A\I'm not convinced there needs to be a government facilities campus. I am convinced there needs to be a law enforcement center. Stearns County's\jail is at capacity. But I don't believe you have to do a joint campus, with everything else involved in that, because I'm not convinced of the other part of the need.\The direction is, let's find a site for this government center without actually figuring out how are we going to pay for (it). If it ever gets to that point, we need to see a referendum on the bonds for that issue and the voters have to make that determination. I don't think we're at that point.\I'm strongly opposed to (Technical High School) becoming a government center. If I was mayor, I would try strongly to say that it's not going to go there so the school district would abandon that plan. I would also be lobbying the school district not to abandon Tech as a school.\I would (lobby) very vigorously to use the post office site, the facility, the parking adjacent to the law enforcement center or the parking where the post office is. We're at a crossroads now, an opportune moment. We're building a new library at the Miller site. What better place to have, in conjunction with a new library, a little post office?\I have some concerns on the current civic center expansion proposal. I believe that the civic center needs to be expanded, renovated. I don't think at this time that it should go forward. The voters rejected the civic center expansion.\Now, one could argue that they voted down the sales tax. But if that was the case, they would have voted down the sales tax on all the other proposals. All the other proposals passed.\If I become mayor, we need to lead and we need to demonstrate to the community that we need that expansion and there needs to be another referendum.\Q\How can public safety keep up with demand without more property taxes or more state aid?\A\In the city of St. Paul, they had an officer killed a few years ago in a neighborhood, and they started a kind of a cross-cooperation with the fire department to do inspections in the area. They actually reduced crime rates in that area, with no additional money.\It's hard to come in, when I've only had four weeks to look at an entire city budget versus a whole year. But I can guarantee you that if I had a whole year, you wouldn't see a 10.2 percent property tax increase.\First of all, the city pays a lobbyist down at St. Paul. As mayor, I'll be that lobbyist in St. Paul. I think we can get rid of that expenditure right away. The most effective lobbyists at the Legislature seem to be former legislators. I think I have the connections on both sides of the aisle and in the governor's office to do that.\There was an appropriation that the City Council actually rejected ... for signs for winter parking. It was a two-hundred-and-some thousand dollar expenditure over (three years), and I thought it was ridiculous.\Those are two examples and you can almost get you to $300,000 with that right there, and that's just something off the top of my head. If you start building efficiencies into other areas of the budget, I think you can come to those kinds of savings.\Q\Should the city do something about the number of homes being converted to rental property?\A\It's the responsibility of someone wanting to rent property to get a license, so there are stipulations, as any property owner has. You can't let your grass grow 10 feet tall. There are responsibilities you have as a citizen.\I'd like to see a little bit more of what other cities have done. But I think we have a very disturbing trend when you have 50 percent of your property in rental and 50 percent in homestead. There's nothing wrong with having a healthy percentage in rental. But when you have an imbalance of rental versus home ownership and you have absentee landlords who look at buying a property as an investment and they don't have a problem letting it depreciate down to nothing, that, I think, is a huge mistake.\I think we need to check in with what other areas have done and develop information from both landlords and tenants and citizens who live in those neighborhoods. In my neighborhood, the Seberger neighborhood, the Initiative Foundation is putting together a healthy neighborhood initiative and I'm part of that, the leadership that's going through the training.\It's long overdue. But for the first time, there's a good process of visioning, from the bottom up. Each neighborhood is different, and that's what's nice about this process.\Right now, when you get a rental license, and you sell the house, the license transfers. I think they probably should have to renew that license. Then the new owner knows exactly what's asked of them by ordinance.\Q\Is St. Cloud on the right track or the wrong track?\A\We're on the wrong track in spending and taxation. And I think we're on the wrong track in crime and the perception of crime. Perception is a huge deterrent to economic development.\In the core neighborhoods, I see a trend of deterioration. I want to see that reversed. I see many large cities and cities that are growing at St. Cloud's pace that create all kinds of programs to revitalize the core. We need to focus on the core right now, before we need to pump millions of dollars into renovations and revitalizations.\We're on the right track as far as the work force that we have, the educational opportunities, the cultural opportunities, the transportation corridors. Speaking of tracks, we'll be on a better track when the Northstar Corridor connects to St. Cloud. That will be a high priority for me in transportation.\Q\Tell me something about yourself that most people don't know.\A\I love to travel. I'm an area representative for an exchange program, for Youth For Understanding. I've hosted a couple exchange students, and I've monitored and placed exchange students in the area.\I also played on an Air Force all-star softball team. I pitched to Fonzie, Wally Cleaver, Joanie Cunningham and Potsie. It was a USO show, back during (the U.S. invasion of Grenada), and it had the cast of ""Happy Days"" in the show. They brought some other TV people along. I was\taken out in the first inning because I wasn't a very good pitcher.\Q\Say something nice about your opponent.\A\John and I are good friends. You know, you always know exactly where he stands on an issue. That can be good and bad, because sometimes you have to be able to build a consensus or coalition around an issue. But John and I have gotten along very well. We ran against each other in 1996 and we had a very cordial campaign.\In working on issues at the Legislature, we've always worked well together. We've never had any cross words, none that I can remember.\In politics, you may be friends, but you have different ideas and you give voters a choice. We have different styles. Clearly, we have different philosophies on a number of issues.\Get to know Dave Kleis\Age: 41.\Family: Single.\Occupation.

175,"This year in St. Paul, lawmakers must find an answer to a $45 billion question.\That figure is roughly what it costs to run the state of Minnesota these days, from health-care programs and schools to keeping the lights on at government agencies. During odd-numbered years, the governor and the state Legislature plan the state's budget for the next two years, bringing their ideas to the public on how much should be spent on what.\It's a complicated debate with a lot of factors to consider, including fluctuating costs for health-care programs and unpredictable tax revenue collections. An updated economic forecast in February showed the state sitting on $1.65 billion more than expected over the next two years, meaning legislators need to figure out how to spend that too.\At heart, it's a debate about political priorities -- what programs deserve more or less funding, and how much of the money the state collects should be given right back to Minnesotans.\Republicans in control of the Minnesota House and Senate released their budget targets over the last week, broad figures that are light on details but signal a big appetite for large tax cuts and budget cuts ahead for some state agencies and health care. They want to spend about $45 billion on government over the next two years, but Gov. Mark Dayton, who released his budget in January, proposed using the surplus to spend about $1 billion more on schools, colleges and state programs.\There's a lot at stake. If lawmakers don't figure out how to square their competing visions for the state by summertime, state government programs will automatically shut down.\While the governor and House and Senate Republican leaders have all released budget plans, they tend to be broad outlines that are short on specifics. Below, we've tried to put together a fair comparison of the plans, based on numbers that are publicly available now. We've also included numbers from the February forecast, which shows what the state would spend if laws remained the same as they are today. In the coming months, legislators and the governor will have to pin down some of these numbers.\With that in mind, here's what we know about the budget proposals so far -- and where lawmakers disagree the most.\Tax cuts\Coming into the 2017 session, everyone was prepared for a big debate over tax cuts. First, the 2016 session ended with a tax bill that was ultimately vetoed over a drafting error related to bingo halls that would've cost the state more than $100 million over the next three years. That meant there was already a push to address some of those failed tax cuts from last year. Then the state's budget surplus grew to $1.65 billion, leaving even more room for the newly installed Republican legislative majorities to propose cuts.\Combining taxes, non-tax revenues, money left over from last year and a few other funding sources, the February forecast estimated that the state would have about $48.4 billion in revenue to work with for the coming biennium.\With tax cuts, that number could get lower. House Republicans have come in with the biggest cut, proposing about $1.35 billion in ""tax relief"" over the next two years. What kinds of cuts? There are few details out yet, but House Republicans have shown interest in phasing out increases to the statewide business property tax and Social Security income taxes for some seniors, as well as cutting taxes on large estates after someone dies. ""We will target our tax bill at middle class Minnesotans and seniors and college students and farmers and small businesses,"" Speaker Kurt Daudt said. ""I would look for those kinds of things, but the Tax Committee will be working through that this week.""\Senate Republicans come in lower than the House at $900 million, but they say their plan will distribute tax cuts to the most individuals. The signature component of their ""Pro-Growth"" tax proposal is a reduction of the lowest income tax rate, currently at 5.35 percent, which affects the largest number of Minnesotans. If passed, it would be the first permanent income tax reduction in Minnesota in nearly 20 years, and it would get more expensive over time. Details are still light on the proposal, and Democrats have already criticized the idea, saying it's not properly targeted to middle-class families and will benefit wealthier Minnesotans.\For his part, Dayton wants to temper strong desires for tax relief this year. His tax-reduction package totals about $280 million, about $1 billion less than the House and a third of the size of the Senate's. And unlike Republicans, Dayton's proposal also includes a tax increase, closing several corporate tax loopholes and continuing inflationary increases on tobacco taxes to raise about $100 million in new revenues.\He frequently references the decade of budget deficits that followed large tax cuts in 1999 and 2000. ""My number one priority for sure this legislative session,"" he said, ""is that stability is not scarified either next biennium or in the years to follow.""\Note that, since some of these tax cuts come in the form of tax credits, they might also be reflected in some of the department-specific spending proposals detailed below.\Property tax aids and credits\Dayton's plan in particular is heavy on tax credits, with many proposals in his tax-reduction plan coming in the form of a credit for farmers, families and local governments.\Among his proposed credits, Dayton pumps money into the so-called working family tax credit and the child and dependent care tax credit to help families pay for child-care costs. Dayton also wants to give tax credits to farmers who are burdened by school levies or working to implement new water buffer requirements between farmland passed last year. Dayton also proposed an increase to Local Government Aid of $20 million.\Republicans had less information about possible aids and credits. Senators don't have a specific breakdown of how much of their tax bill will go to credits, but they've expressed interest in credits for college graduates with student loans. House Republicans said they aren't likely to change the amount of aid given to cities and counties this year.\Property tax aids and credits budget breakdown\E-12 education\Education is one budget all sides agree should get more funding this year -- though there are battles ahead over how much more should be spent and what it should pay for.\Dayton has the highest new education spending plan, proposing to increase the state's education funding formula by 2 percent each year for the next two years, or a total of about $371 million this biennium. That's not all he's proposing: Dayton also wants to spend $175 million for his long-sought voluntary preschool education program.\The education funding plans on the Republican side have not been released yet, but both the House and Senate are proposing an increase ($257 million and $300 million, respectively). Dayton is likely to push hard for his preschool proposal as he heads into his final year in office, but Republicans have pushed back on the bill in the past, arguing Dayton didn't make a strong enough pitch to legislators and school districts and labeling it as a potential unfunded mandate. Republicans have shown more interest in targeted early education scholarships.\E-12 education budget breakdown\Higher education\For the state's higher education institutions, Dayton proposed $318 million in new spending over the biennium. He wants much of that money to go toward keeping tuition low and helping students of color attend college. That includes $125 million to Minnesota State colleges and universities and $68 million to the University of Minnesota for operating costs, urging both university systems to use the money to ""fund activities that address the educational attainment gap.""\House Republicans are proposing spending an additional $150 million on higher education, though the details of their plan have not been released. Senate Republicans want to spend $100 million more on higher education than what's expected under current law, including $30 million for the University of Minnesota to increase the medical school's research capacity and improve its National Institutes of Health ranking.\Higher education budget breakdown\Transportation\Minnesota's transportation budget is confusing at first glance, because the state only actually pays a small portion of its transportation budget out of the general fund, and most of that funding goes toward running transportation-related agencies. The Minnesota Constitution does most of the heavy lifting, creating several core transportation funds and dedicating money from the federal government, gas taxes and other revenue directly to things like highways, roads, bridges and transit.\Dayton isn't proposing to change much in the general-fund appropriation for transportation, but he has a broader plan to pump billions into roads, bridges and transit over the next 10 years. In the next two years, he wants to raise $600 million by increasing the gas tax, about $400 million for transit and other projects by raising the sales tax a half cent in the metro area and another $125 million from higher vehicle registration fees. Those funding increases aren't reflected in his budget proposal, though, because they would come from dedicated funding sources, rather than the general fund.\House and Senate Republicans rolled out transportation plans this week that don't raise the gas tax but do increase transportation revenue by moving some state revenue streams going to other departments and spending them on transportation instead. House Republicans want to specifically dedicate about $300 million of that funding to roads and bridges (a number they appear to have included in their transportation general-fund budget).\Senate Republicans' budget targets keep the general fund expenditure for transportation steady, but they call for an additional $570 million in ""new permanent transportation funding."" Like the House, that comes from transferring revenues on things like car rentals, sales and repairs to roads and bridges and include some federal funds already coming into the state for transportation funding.\Neither plan funds light rail this year -- or in the future. Both the House and the Senate have asked the federal government not to fund the controversial Southwest Light Rail line, and the House bill requires metro counties to pay for all future operating and capital costs of light rail. For past projects, the state had been asked for 10 percent overall of construction costs and 50 percent of annual operating subsidies.\Democrats have criticized Republicans for blowing a hole in the general fund by shifting revenues around and not actually finding new money for transportation. ""The House Republican transportation plan is a short-term and divisive gimmick,"" DFL Rep. Frank Hornstein said.\Republicans say that's a perfectly reasonable position given the state's budget surplus. ""If you look at the surplus we have now plus the surplus going forward, we're pretty confident that we can do that and still take care of the other budget needs that we have, including tax relief,"" Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said.\There is one thing everyone agrees on: The Minnesota Department of Transportation should find savings in its own budget. All three proposals call on the agency to find 15 percent savings within its allocated budget.\Transportation budget breakdown\Health and human services\Health and human services programs make up the second largest part of the state's budget after education. It tends to be the area with the most growth from budget year to budget year; this cycle, it's the area of the budget with the most uncertainty ahead.\The forecast predicted state spending on health care would increase by about $2 billion from the last budget, largely due to the increasing costs of caring for the sick and Minnesotans living with disabilities.\Neither Dayton nor the Republicans spend as much as the forecast budgeted for health and human services, but they come fairly close. Dayton's health care spending comes in lower than the forecast mostly because of an accounting shift, not an actual cut to services. He recommends using the state's Health Care Access Fund to pay for about $716 million in Medicaid spending instead of the general fund. That fund was originally set up to administer MinnesotaCare, but over the years an increasing level of Medicaid spending had been added to its duties.\In addition to that accounting shift, the administration says it is proposing about $316 million in new health care spending. That includes giving Minnesotans a ""public option,"" allowing them to buy into MinnesotaCare, the health care program for low-income residents, through the MNsure health insurance marketplace.\That idea has landed with a thud among Republicans, especially in the House, where it didn't get a hearing. Republicans haven't said yet where they plan to cut health care spending, but House Ways and Means Chairman Jim Knoblach said they might look at trimming eligibility for certain programs.\For everyone, there's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen with the Affordable Care Act at the federal level. Whatever happens, it could have huge implications for Minnesota's budget down the road.\""When you look at some of the changes that are likely coming out of Washington, we really need to figure out how to trim back the growth of some of these programs given that we may have less money for some of them,"" Knoblach said. ""We need to be trying to reform some of these programs now so we are ready for that.""\Health and human services budget breakdown\Public safety and judiciary\Neither House nor Senate Republicans are proposing dramatic increases in public safety and courts spending for the next two years, but Dayton wants to see the budget for law enforcement, prisons and judges increase by $256 million. That would include money to cover the rising cost of health care in prisons, staffing, new IT infrastructure and to give pay raise for judges over the next two years, among other proposals.\Dayton also wants money dedicated to developing new, less-restrictive housing options for sex offenders in treatment at the state's sex offender treatment facility in Moose Lake.\Public safety and judiciary budget breakdown\State government and veterans\Republicans in both the House and Senate recommend spending less than forecasted for veterans programs and the operation of state government, but the details of their plans are still unclear. Daudt said House Republicans likely won't propose a 5 or 10 percent cut across the board to all state agencies, an idea senators had floated.\But senators and House members have both shown an interest in cutting the state auditor's budget after Auditor Rebecca Otto used office funding to pay for a lawsuit fighting a 2015 law change. (The change allowed counties to seek audits from private accounting firms instead of the state auditor's office.) Senators are proposing lesser cuts to the Minnesota secretary of state's office and the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board, and they want to eliminate the state's campaign subsidy program.\Dayton wants to put another $150 million into state government and veterans over what was forecasted, a large amount of that to update antiquated IT systems. The state of Minnesota's system would get $51 million for upgrades and $74 million to boost cybersecurity under Dayton's plan.\State government and veterans budget breakdown\Everything else\Then there's all the rest. Some areas of the budget picture -- including the environment, agriculture, economic development, housing, energy and the bonding bill -- are still fuzzy, even for Capitol regulars. That's partially because some of those numbers were lumped together in House and Senate budget targets and the details of those spending areas haven't been finalized yet.\Some things are clear: In the House and Senate, spending on environment and natural resource programs would go down under their budgets.\Bonding bills -- large packages of construction projects paid for by state borrowing -- also require money in the budget to pay for the debt service on the bonds. Dayton wants legislators to pass a $1.5 billion bonding bill this session, after a bonding proposal failed in the final moments of the 2016 session. House Republicans have budgeted for a $800 bonding bill each year for the next two years, but the size of the bill must be worked out with all four caucus leaders involved (Democrats have leverage in bonding debates because bonding bills need a supermajority to pass).\As for savings, everyone wants to leave a little money on the bottom line, especially with so much uncertainty about what's going to happen to the state's budget under federal cuts. Dayton is proposing to save $200 million on the bottom line, as are House Republicans. Minnesota also has $1.6 billion in its budget reserve fund, which could be used if federal cuts run deep.\""It's no question that if the kind of reductions the Trump administration is proposing, when they take effect, it's going to have a devastating effect on Minnesota's budget,"" Dayton said. ""We're not going to be able to make up for everything.""\Credit: Briana Bierschbach and Tom Nehil"
176,"Note: SOUTH ONLY\State is right to close smoking loophole \I commend the Minnesota Department of Health for taking a strong stand to stop bars from circumventing the Freedom to Breathe law by hosting so-called ""theatrical productions.""

They state that the few-cent increase won't add up to much. Lest they forget that the recently passed bill also increases the cost of vehicle tabs. If you want to drive a nice vehicle I would think the tab fee of $800 to $1,000 is enough to make you want to drive a beater. \Also, the bill causes the state sales tax to increase in the seven-county metro area. The rise in sales tax plus the rise in the gas tax will cause all consumer products to rise. Don't you think the truckers will pass on their increased costs to retailers who will pass it on to consumers? Please remove your blinders and rose colored glasses. \TORI EIDE, SAVAGE \. \Wake up: Debt is a tax on our children \I am curious about the rebukes served up by Gov.

177,"The super tollway proposed to encircle the Twin Cities outside the Interstate Hwy. 694/494 ring is another bad idea whose time has come.\ Its allure as a ""free"" solution to traffic congestion is a mirage that disappears when the facts are examined. It will spur rapid, unplanned development outside present suburbs, increase congestion, reduce the quality of life and environment in the Twin Cities and cost everyone a lot more than the fees paid to drive on it.\ Transportation made development possible. Our country's first towns sprang up along water and stagecoach routes. Later, railroads expanded the reach of American industry and citizens into formerly remote and inaccessible regions. Towns boomed or went bust depending on whether a railroad passed nearby.\ The interstate era likewise encouraged development. As superhighways were built, cheap land fell within an easy drive of downtown, and American cities were transformed. A nighttime satellite photo of America from space clearly shows the lighted commercial and urban corridors, like tentacles fingering out from city cores along interstate highway routes. Since 1970 each one of us has seen semi-rural secondary roads in the metro area become commercial ""strips"" after superhighway interchanges were built on them.\ Rapid and unplanned development caused by superhighways degrades the quality of each person's life, and damages the environment.\ The road itself is harmful. The superhighway corridor concentrates pollution from huge numbers of cars and trucks. People, animals, soil and crops near the corridor absorb several of the pollutants, especially lead.\ Streams and groundwater are flooded with poison runoff from excessive winter salting of superhighways, and with engine and transmission leaks and outright spills. Thousands of acres of prime farm land are paved, leaving less land to produce food.\ The toll on wildlife is enormous; a ring-road will be like a 175-mile-long gill net, trapping everything in a deadly circle of speed.\ A ring-road, by promoting development around and outside it, creates its own market. When a new expressway opens, use exceeds capacity in a few years.\ A second ring-road will increase congestion, not ease it. Congestion on existing superhighways is worst at rush hours, when the roads are choked with commuters going to and from the suburbs. Boosters of a second ring-road have the convenience of the commuters in mind - but not these commuters. The road will mainly serve a future commuter who will live even farther out and have a clean shot at the Twin Cities by following the ring-road to an existing artery. Everyone else loses as roads serving the ring-road clog up and green space is lost to development.\ A ring-road encourages the Twin Cities to spread out - to completely urbanize the seven-county metro area. This is a serious threat to Twin Citians' quality of life. The entire premise of ""spreading out"" ought to be questioned by the Minnesota Legislature in 1991. Spreading out keeps us slaves of cars.\ Ninety years of ""automobile vision"" have produced the loose network of business plazas, shopping malls, housing tracts and industrial parks that walkers, bikers and alternative commuters cannot move around in. Americans will walk a quarter mile, and Europeans a half mile, to get somewhere. A ring-road ignores this good news for city planning. Likewise, spreading out makes it difficult to institute a convenient rail transit system that depends on a concentrated ridership.\ Enslavement to cars - half of American households own two - means everyone needs them to get to work, to shop, to go out to dinner or to a movie, or just to visit friends. The automobile structures American society. This is the root of our oil dependency (75 percent goes to transportation), and one big reason American men and women are in Saudi Arabia.\ We cannot overlook the visual beauty of roadsides destroyed by development and advertisements. In the Twin Cities, that beauty is a unique product of the natural Minnesota landscape. The oppressive sameness of American strip development erases a sense of place. With a ring-road and attendant development, things will look a lot grayer from inside the Twin Cities. Are we going to rob ourselves and our children of conveniently located nature?\ Toll roads are not paid for strictly by users. A toll road puts financial burden on us all because:\ It forces the Minnesota Department of Transportation to build interchanges and to upgrade feeder roads.\ The increase in high-speed traffic heightens use of publicly funded police, ambulance and traffic court services.\ Its 450-foot-wide corridor and vast intersections consume valuable farm land (raising food prices) and take land off tax rolls (raising property taxes).\ It promotes spread-out development and requires more miles of sewer line, telephone line, roads, etc., to serve the same number of families.\ By World War II the automobile and truck were king of American transport, in large part through federal and state subsidies rather than user fees. Subsidies were in highway construction, police and other services, and road maintenance. Serviceable rail and trolley systems could not compete and declined as long as government paid the way of cars and trucks.\ A number of studies by such groups as the Brookings Institution, the federal government and private consulting firms lead to estimates of the automobile's real cost to society as $4 to $9 per gallon of gas, above the gas tax. This subsidy to automobile drivers includes those already mentioned and others, such as parking space and pollution effects. To this should be added future costs our children will pay to maintain the massive, spread-out road system.\ The highway tax we pay on each gallon of gasoline covers only a tenth or less of public tax revenue used to subsidize American highways.\ We subsidize highways at incredible cost; are we going to subsidize a super tollway, too? Making API Group, the holding company proposing the ring-road, the torch-bearer for an outmoded transport idea is bad leadership, as economical as it first sounds. It is not economical in the long run.\ Transportation has always been the business of government in America (except in the special case of railroads, which were subsidized in another way). The Minnesota Legislature should keep transportation its business with its own vision of a transport system with these features:\ It is compact.\ It concentrates development.\ It minimally increases use of highways in its vicinity.\ It integrates with kinds of transportation besides cars.\ The Minnesota Legislature might ask the API Group to propose a high-speed, high-tech, pay-as-you-go transport system with these features to carry a million riders each year. Such systems are in place across America. They are called trains, subways, light railways, and so forth.\ It is time that Minnesota government, finding itself unable to finance an ever-larger system of roads, put its strength of vision behind a convenient rail transit system.\ The main objection to rail transit is that ridership won't be high enough to defray the cost. Yet it is only because cars and trucks have been so heavily subsidized by government that their true, staggering costs can be borne. Subsidize convenient rail transit and, like the highway system, it will create its own market. Look to Washington, D.C., and countless other metro areas for proof that rail transit concentrates development in corridors rather than spreading it all over creation.\ If the ring-road idea wins, goodbye Twin Cities as we know them. Hello, Megacity of the 21st century. The evidence everywhere says that encircling superhighways bring rapid, unplanned development and reduce the quality of life and environment, at high cost to everybody. A ring-road is not a transport option; it is just a bigger noose around the Twin Cities.\Kim Alan Chapman lives in St. Paul. He is a regional ecologist for a conservation group in Minneapolis."
178,"I thought Bill Lindeke's recent post on TCSidewalks would be another in a long line of his great posts. '7 Reasons Conservatives Should Embrace Bikes', sounded promising. Instead he seemingly wants to pick a partisan fight with allies. He has a notion that conservatives just about have anti-cycling cornered and cycling supporters must likely be liberals.\On first thought it would seem that way. Almost universally it's more liberal cities, with Democrats running things, that top the lists of most bike friendly. Reality though isn't so cut and dried nor is the future we're hoping to accomplish.\In the beginning there was indeed a Republican -- Robert Moses. However, it was a Democrat, Al Smith, who provided the power to get Moses' pro-auto, anti-everything-else projects going. Republican mayor Fiorello La Guardia provided a bit more support and from then on it was pretty much Democrats who supported Moses' massive leveling of neighborhoods and freeway building. It took a Republican, pro-transit Nelson Rockefeller, to end his reign of destruction with Democrats fighting tooth and nail to keep Moses in power.\Today, New York City is quickly becoming one of the top cycling cities in the nation and may soon be ahead of the Twin Cities. This is largely thanks to Republican mayor, Rudy Giuliani, and DemRepublIndy, Michael Bloomberg, and to Bloomberg's replacing Iris Wienshall with Janette Sadik-Khan. To be honest, Giuliani was a luke-warm supporter of cycling, though at the time this was quite warmer than the vast majority of politicians of either party throughout the U.S.\Interestingly, the loudest and strongest anti-cycling folks fighting Sadik-Khan are led by Democrats Charles Schumer and Iris Wienshall.\On a national level, the Transportation Secretary who has likely done far more for cycling than any other in history, and possibly all of them put together, is Republican Ray Lahood. And, if ""Right-wing politics is deeply tied to the politics of the automobile"" as Bill says, then why were Democrats the key supporters of the auto industry bail-out while Republicans opposed it?\Democrat R. T. Rybak is one of the heroes of our local cycling infrastructure and I'd nominate Republican Sen. David ""what's a bike lane"" Hann for the dumbest cycling comment made by a MN politician (I think Republican Ed Orcutt retains honors for the dumbest cycling comment by any pol in the nation).\We recently gave Democrats 100% control of MN state government and yet they failed to produce an equitable gas tax. As I wrote in the Star-Tribune on May 12, our auto-culture, and each and every decision we make to drive somewhere, is subsidized by taxpayers. (And, some of these are walking/biking taxpayers.) Any time we are protected from the costs of a decision, we are not likely to make a good one. Thanks to our subsidizing of road users, they are completely out of touch with the true costs of their decisions and that's not serving us well.\BTW, these same Democrats also failed to fix funding for public transit.\Of Twin Cities folk who ride a bike for transportation I know equally as many liberals and conservatives. And a few libertarians. If you have the stomach to listen to talk radio the most pro-cycling person you'll likely hear is conservative radio pundit Mitch Berg who rides a bike to work every day. Likely the most anti-bike on national radio is also a conservative -- Michael Gallahger.\Three of the worst incidents I've encountered with drivers were those with 'Obama' stickers on their 4,000-pound motorized weapons and the one time I've been hit was by a conservative. Interestingly, one of those three had union stickers on their bumper.\I know people on both sides who drive gas-guzzling SUV's and folks on both who drive electric cars. My escapist exurban neighborhood is comprised primarily of liberals who consistently elect Democrats, and that includes the precinct of elderly white people.\Each side, Democrat and Republican, Conservative and Liberal, have their fair share of flunkies, heroes, and greedy folk lacking normal morality. Each includes numerous pro-bike and anti-bike folks. Neither even remotely holds a corner on good or bad, or altruism or greed, and the stink of hypocrisy can make some of both a bit unpleasant to sit by.\While progressives are quick to embrace change, conservatives are often infuriatingly slow to do so. The latter can be frustrating, but also good because not every idea for change, from either side, turns out to be good.\Do 'most conservatives see bicycles as a vast left-wing conspiracy'? A few certainly, but from what I've seen, not even close to most. Bill is right about one thing: conservatives do seem to have disdain for bicycles. But, so do liberals and others. They all appear to dislike cyclists for pretty much the same reason -- they don't like being delayed an extra 15 seconds getting where they're going.\None of this is to say that we can't market specifically to conservatives (or liberals or libertarians or whomever). There are general differences in these groups that we should openly discuss and take advantage of in promoting cycling (and walking, transit, better urban environments, architecture, and aesthetics).\Best of all, we have the advantage because we have solid, logical, winning arguments, and Bill listed six of them. (The seventh, Freedom From Rules, won't fly in most conservative and libertarian circles that I'm familiar with because it confuses libertarianism with anarchism -- a small and mostly un-welcomed minority.)\Sadly, not enough of any group support these reasons yet and Bill ruined his otherwise clever and well-written piece sandwiching the good between slices of hyperbole (Rob Ford comments excepted). Yes, we should talk about immigrants and gun control and many other issues, but within discussions promoting bicycling isn't the place -- if we want to gain support for cycling.\Bicycling is not a partisan issue. It only becomes one when we make it one. And it serves no purpose, for the benefit of bicycling anyway, to do so.\If road users were to pay for what they use (or what we currently spend on them) we'd need to raise the fuel excise tax by about $1.36 per gallon. However, that current spending is not adequate. It is not maintaining our road system at it's current level, much less improving it. Just to maintain our system at it's current level, prevent it from falling in to greater disrepair, we need another $0.40 per gallon. If we want to make reasonable improvements we'd need even more. All total, if each road user is to pay for just their share of what they use we'd need to raise the fuel excise tax by about $2.10 per gallon. Sen Scott Dibble proposed raising the current gas tax by 7.5 cents per gallon, less than 3% of what's needed, and couldn't get it passed.\This post was written by Walker Angell and originally published on streets.mn.

179,"
Incoming House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, says he plans to work as collaboratively as possible with the DFL majority this session.
\
But he's quick to add that he'll apply a strict ""litmus test"" to every issue: ""Does this help Minnesotans? Does this help middle-class Minnesotans find jobs? Does this make their lives easier?""
\
Take a gas-tax increase, for example, which a state task force recently proposed. Bad idea, Daudt says. Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton says he doesn't support it, either.
\
In 2008, when gas prices spiked, so did foreclosures in Daudt's ""bedroom community"" an hour northwest of the Twin Cities as people's commuting costs doubled and they couldn't pay their mortgages, he said.
\
""That's who's hit by these kinds of things,"" Daudt said. ""If we think that there's no impact -- 'Oh, it's just a 40-cent increase on the gas tax' -- that hits your pocketbook, and it's middle-class Minnesotans that feel the pain on that.""
\
Or consider frac sand mining, which legislative leaders have said will be a major issue this session. Critics have raised concerns about the environmental and other impacts in Minnesota of mining the sand, which is used in a hydraulic fracturing process to extract oil and natural gas elsewhere in the country.
\
Restrictions may be needed ""but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" Daudt said. ""Those are jobs. I've got to think that there's people in Minnesota that would love to have a job driving a truck hauling frac sand.""
\
For Daudt, a one-term state lawmaker picked by his Republican colleagues to lead them after election losses put the party in the minority in 2013, the focus this session needs to be on the state budget, the economy and making Minnesota an attractive place for businesses to locate and expand.
\
With the Republicans at a 12-seat deficit compared with the Democratic-Farmer-Labor majority, ""I know that I'm going to be in an environment for the next couple years where it's going to be more difficult to get results,"" Daudt said. ""But I think you get out of it what you put into it, so I'm not going to back away from having conversations about what I think is good for Minnesota.""
\
Rep. Paul Marquart, a DFLer from Dilworth who served with Daudt on the property and local taxes committee, said he often disagreed with Daudt's policy positions. But Daudt has the right demeanor to be effective, Marquart added.
\
""He's thoughtful before he speaks. He's not one to just go off the cuff and say whatever. I think it's measured, and I think that's what a leader has to be,"" Marquart said.
\
""For somebody to try to work with the Democrats, I think he'll be a good voice, but at the same time, I don't assume that he'll give away the store,"" said former Republican U.S. Sen. Rod Grams, a neighbor of Daudt's in Crown.
\
""I've known Kurt all my life,"" said Grams. ""Good kid, and I think he's going to do a great job.""

180,"Cuts to help balance budget\By Kirsti Marohn\kmarohn@stcloudtimes.com\ST. PAUL - The House of Representatives passed two budget bills Monday, providing money for road construction and the justice system.\The transportation and judiciary bills, which closely resemble Gov. Tim Pawlenty's proposed budget, passed by wide margins.\These are the first of several omnibus budget bills expected to reach the House floor this week that balance the state's $4.23 billion deficit largely through spending cuts, fee increases and spending one-time money. The House Republican plan does not raise taxes.\Today, the House is expected to vote on budget bills covering higher education, agriculture and the environment. Later this week, lawmakers will debate bills covering jobs and economic development, state government, K-12 education and health and human services.\The DFL-controlled Senate is moving budget bills through committees, and the full Senate already passed a higher education bill. Conference committees will have about 2 1/2 weeks left in the regular session to work out the differences.\Courts\The judiciary bill cuts funding for the court system by 2 percent, less than the 10 percent proposed by Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Funding for battered women's shelters is cut by $6.8 million or almost 20 percent.\Public defenders would lose 5 percent and the Minnesota Gang Strike Force 10 percent. There also would be less money for crime victim services and legal services for the poor.\The bill cuts the Department of Corrections by 7 percent. It allows the Department of Corrections to double-bunk inmates at the St. Cloud and Stillwater prisons, the state's two maximum security prisons.\The bill requires the state corrections commissioner to study privatizing prisons and to feed inmates two meals a day on weekends instead of three.\One of the more controversial provisions requires some prison inmates with 180 days or less in their sentence to serve their remaining time in county jails. The state will provide about $5 million to counties during the next two years to help cover their costs to house the prisoners, said the bill's author, Rep. Steve Smith, R-Mound.\The bill increases some fees, including hiking the fee to file a civil lawsuit from $135 to $250 and charging a co-payment for using a public defender.\Democrats warned that the cuts will lead to a deterioration of Minnesota's quality of life.\""I think it's clear that we're going to be taking a dramatic step backward,"" said Minority Leader Matt Entenza, DFL-St. Paul.\Transportation\The transportation bill will provide $1.2 billion for road, bridge and transit improvements. About half of that is highway bonds. The other half is federal money that the state would secure ahead of schedule.\""This is a massive investment in roads and bridges that will be taking place during the next five years,"" said House Speaker Steve Sviggum, R-Kenyon, before the session.\The bill does not raise the gas tax or increase license tab fees, as Senate DFLers have proposed. An amendment offered by a Republican legislator to raise the gas tax and tab fees was defeated.\The House plan increases some fees and uses savings from cuts to the Minnesota Department of Transportation. It directs MnDOT to consider allowing highway rest areas to be privately run, and supports a plan to allow lone drivers to pay a fee to use high-occupancy freeway lanes.\The bill won't help Central Minnesota improve its local road system, said Rep. Joe Opatz, DFL-St. Cloud, and it cuts money for transit.\""This is really a disappointing bill after all of the strong support people talked about in the last two years,"" Opatz said."
181,"Minnesota lawmakers gavel in the 2015 legislative session on Tuesday facing a daunting to-do list, including crafting a $40 billion plus budget and fixing the state's aging transportation system. And they must accomplish it all with divided government. Here are some of the top policies, personalities and other dynamics to watch for as the 2015 political season kicks off:\Metro vs. outstate\The most expected theme of the 2015 legislative session was set before the 2014 election results were even finalized. House Republicans had Greater Minnesota voters to thank for their victory -- they picked up 10 of the 11 seats they gained in outstate Minnesota -- and they knew it. Since then, Republicans have split up the environment and agriculture committee into two separate entities, and added two committees: the Greater Minnesota Economic and Workforce Development Policy Committee; and the Mining and Outdoor Recreation Policy Committee. DFL Rep. Jean Wagenius, former chair of the combined agriculture and environment committee, was bounced from the new GOP-led environment committee altogether, a move that miffed Democrats and environmental activists. Democrats already seem to be fashioning a 2016 campaign theme that claims Republicans aren't fighting for the entire state. One factor to watch will be how these tensions continue to play out.\The transportation debate\Both Republicans and Democrats say addressing the state's lagging transportation system is a top priority next session, but how they go about trying to fix problem will be one of the central dramas of the 2015 political season. DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and Democrats in control of the Senate say there's not enough money available in the budget to address transportation needs across the state, which the governor's own administration puts as high as $6 billion over the next 10 years. But Republicans in control of the House say passing any kind of gas tax increase in the upcoming session is unlikely. Other groups are starting to weigh in, too: the Republican Party is saying no to new revenues, while the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce says improvements can be paid for with new user fees and more money in the state's budget dedicated to transportation. The question of priorities -- namely, outstate roads and bridges verses metro-area transit projects -- will also be part of the debate. The new chair of the House Transportation Policy and Finance Committee is significant in that sense: Rep. Tim Kelly currently doesn't serve on any transportation committees, though he is from Red Wing.\DFL Sen. Tom Bakk\If the last two years were any indication, Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk is an independent operator. Even when the DFL controlled both chambers of the Legislature, he clashed with House Democrats and Gov. Mark Dayton on everything from bonding to the minimum wage to a new Senate office building. With that in mind, it's not wise to assume he will immediately align himself with Dayton on the governor's priorities. In fact, Bakk occupies some common ground with the new Republican-led House, including support for the PolyMet Mining project on the Iron Range. What's more, Bakk has had his door open to business groups in the state since he was first elected majority leader.\Dayton 'unbound'?\Dayton hasn't said much about his agenda since he was re-elected this fall, but he's made this much clear: He plans to make his last four years in the governor's office count, and has already dubbed his approach as ""Dayton unbound."" Yes, Dayton has a Republican House and a DFL Senate to work with, but that doesn't mean the governor can't set the terms of the debate. Dayton will be the first to unveil his budget plan in late January, for instance, and that will almost certainly include some kind of new revenue for transportation projects across the state.\Kurt Daudt and the new House GOP\Everyone seems to agree that incoming Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt is an easy guy to work with, earning high praise from DFL leaders and Republicans alike. The big unknown factor is the how he manages his new caucus, as well as how conservative this caucus will lean. There's also a question of how dedicated the more seasoned members of Daudt's own caucus will be this session. Daudt, who is heading into only his third term in the House, was challenged for the speaker job by two more experienced legislators in a five-hour meeting in November.\How much attention will education policy get?\It's not obvious -- lawmakers have a big transportation debate ahead, a surplus to spend and a budget bill to craft -- but education might get some major attention in 2015. It's been brewing quietly, but House Republicans want to push an substantial education policy agenda to try and address Minnesota's achievement gap between white students and racial minorities. Expect Republican lawmakers to introduce proposals to give school districts more control and expand charter schools and the Teach for America program in the state.\Tax cuts\Capitol watchers expect tax cuts and tax reform to be a major point of debate in the newly configured Legislature. Senate Democrats have always been interested in major tax reform -- they created a separate tax reform committee -- and they didn't get everything they wanted in during the 2013-2014 biennium. DFL Sen. Ann Rest, head of the tax reform committee, has previously supported a major overhaul of the state's sales tax. Republicans have kept possible tax cuts on the table, and business groups like the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce are already pushing income tax cuts.\Credit: Briana Bierschbach"
182,"The Minnesota House passed a major increase in education funding Tuesday after an hourslong debate that veered into the contentious issue of sex education.\House Democrats would spend nearly $20.5 billion during the next two years to support local school districts -- a 9% increase that faces resistance in the Republican-controlled Senate.\""We're asking schools to prepare a group of students who have greater needs than we've had in the past,"" said state Rep. Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, the majority leader. ""The value of education for the economy is greater than it ever has been, and we have to make sure the schools have the tools to do the job. And the Legislature has not been doing that for years.""\The increase, passed 79-54, was the opening gambit in what is expected to be a tough negotiation between the newly Democratic-controlled House and the GOP-controlled Senate as they finalize a deal on a two-year state budget expected to top $45 billion. School spending has been about 40% of the state budget in recent years.\""I think everyone is focused on making sure education is taken care of,"" said state Sen. Paul Gazelka, R-Nisswa, the majority leader of the upper chamber.\The difference between the House and Senate school budgets is vast. The Senate, which is expected to take up its own education budget in the coming days, is proposing an increase of 4.8% from the previous two years. House Democrats and Gov. Tim Walz say the increase would be wiped out once inflation costs and enrollment growth are taken into account.\""The Senate budget is a cut budget, an austerity budget in a time when we don't need to take that approach,"" said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park. ""Minnesotans are not asking for that.""\The House's overall budget would require a 20 cent gas tax increase and the extension of a tax on health care providers that is set to expire later this year. It would also increase taxes on Minnesota corporations' foreign income. Republicans, who oppose such hikes, argue that lawmakers should be able to fund government with existing revenue.\""It's unrealistic,"" said state Rep. Ron Kresha, R-Little Falls. ""I have yet to hear the argument of how we're going to pay for this without transferring money from the transportation fund and thus requiring a regressive gas tax to backfill that,"" he said.\Republicans offered up more than 100 amendments that slowed the debate while also taking aim at various Democratic policy proposals, including language requiring comprehensive sex education in elementary and secondary schools.\""School districts have been frank,"" Kresha said. ""Leave the policy alone. Have that in a separate discussion.""\Supporters of the sex education provision said data indicates that the approach would reduce unwanted pregnancies and the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.\Opponents voiced concerns about requiring age-appropropriate instruction on topics like sexual development, same-sex relationships and gender identity. John Helmberger, chief executive of the Minnesota Family Council, called the proposal ""an affront to parents' rights.""\""It is deeply concerning that some legislators think it's OK to circumvent parents and expose children to these sexual issues in this manner,"" he said.\The Senate, which was expected to take up bills Tuesday to fund agriculture and environment programs, has yet to vote on its version of the schools budget. Gazelka said that while bridging the budget gap will be difficult, he sees ""no reason we can't get there"" by the late May session deadline.\""I'm confident we can get there, but I do want to bring down some of the expectations of spending increases that the governor and the House want,"" he said.\J.

183,"<b>executive summary\The new year is expected to begin with strong growth of the area economy, according to the most recent predictions of the St. Cloud Index of Leading Economic Indicators and the St. Cloud Area Business Outlook Survey.\Considerable gains in average hours worked in local manufacturing and large increases in help-wanted advertising at the St. Cloud Times have powered the\St. Cloud Index of Leading Economic Indicators to its highest level since winter 1999.\Since bottoming out in fall 2003, the index has continued to rise as area economic activity has strengthened.\After several months in which area employment growth was weaker than observed elsewhere in Minnesota, St. Cloud employment gains appear to have caught up to the rest of the state. Local employment in October was 1.3 percent higher than one year ago. That's the same rate reported for Minneapolis-St. Paul and slightly lower than state employment growth. October's 2.8 percent area unemployment rate is the lowest reported since October 2000, and help-wanted ad linage in the St. Cloud Times was up 64 percent from the year-earlier period. Surveyed businesses also continue to report increased difficulty in attracting qualified workers.\Sixty percent of surveyed companies expect improved economic conditions in the next six months while only 12 percent expect a decrease. Forty-five percent of firms plan to increase employment compared with only 4 percent that plan to reduce payrolls.\Inflationary pressures continue to mount. Forty-six percent of firms project higher prices received for their product in six months' time. Only 2 percent of firms believe their prices will decrease.\In special questions, firms reported a variety of direct and indirect effects from hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.\Numerous firms say the hurricanes had or will have adverse effects on fuel prices,\building material costs and availability, insurance costs, economic growth and future taxes.\In a separate question, firms identified health-care reform as the most important priority in the upcoming legislative session for the second straight year.\Firms seem only slightly concerned that the declarations of bankruptcy by Mesaba and Northwest Airlines may lead to a future loss of air service at St. Cloud Regional Airport.\Area firms remain concerned about finding qualified workers to replace retiring baby boomers in the next 10 years.\<b>the st. cloud area business outlook survey\Tables 1 and 2 report the most recent results of the business outlook survey. Responses are from 91 area businesses that returned the recent mailing in time to be included in the report. Participating firms represent a diverse collection of businesses in the St. Cloud area. They include retail, manufacturing, construction, financial, health services and government enterprises of sizes ranging from small to large. Survey responses are strictly confidential.\<b>current conditions\Compared with year-ago levels, area businesses experienced mixed economic activity in the past three months.\The diffusion index of 13.2 on business activity in Table 1 is weaker than the 44.4 value reported in the August 2005 survey. It also is lower than the 32.8 reported a year ago. (A diffusion index is the percentage of respondents indicating an increase minus the percentage indicating a decrease.)\By contrast, the diffusion index on the number of employees on company payrolls is higher than it was one year ago. Surveyed firms also report prices received that were similar to those observed in fall 2004.\Capital expenditures and national business activity were weaker in the current period than they were three months ago.\A diffusion index of 24.2 on the difficulty in attracting qualified workers is the highest recorded in the fall survey since 1999. This is one of several indicators referenced in this report that suggest a widely improved area labor market.\A growing number of area employers report difficulties associated with labor shortages. One area firm notes, ""Attracting and retaining quality repair technicians is becoming increasingly more difficult."" One company suggests, ""If the economy remains stronger and more robust, companies and organizations are more inclined to support training for their employees."" Another firm simply states, ""Great work ethic is a vanishing concept.""\<b>future conditions\Area business leaders are quite optimistic about their firms' prospects in the next six months. Sixty percent of survey respondents expect increased business activity six months from now, and only 12 percent expect a decrease. The diffusion index on the level of future business activity is 48.3. That's higher than observed in August (a normal seasonal effect), but lower than the 60.4 value reported a year ago.\Forty-five percent of responding firms plan to increase hiring in the next six months. The diffusion index on this item is the highest recorded in the fall survey.\The diffusion index on capital expenditures is higher than three months ago as is the index on length of workweek (although the latter may be a normal seasonal effect).\While businesses remain upbeat about the national economy, it should be noted that this quarter's diffusion index on national business activity (18.7) is much lower than it was one year ago (when the index stood at 43.1). This may reflect the adverse effects of the hurricanes and rising short-term interest rates.\Upward pressures on prices are\expected to continue. Forty-six percent of business leaders expect their firms to increase prices by May, and few firms expect prices to fall. At 44.0, the diffusion index on future prices received reported in Table 2 is the highest ever recorded on this item.\This is consistent with national trends. The Wall Street Journal noted Nov. 12 that ""Firms Gain Power to Boost Prices in Some Sectors."" The October 2005 Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve district noted that while 49 percent of surveyed firms expected increased prices received by April, 62 percent of firms anticipated higher prices paid.\These reported price pressures highlight the challenge Federal Reserve policymakers face as they continue to adopt policy objectives designed to contain inflationary expectations. Increases in prices received thus do not necessarily indicate improved profit margins for area firms but may compensate for increased costs of fuel, insurance, materials and health care.\Labor shortages have re-emerged as a concern facing local employers. The labor market is expected to remain tight. A diffusion index of 23.1 on expected future difficulty in attracting qualified workers is higher than that reported in August and substantially greater than one year ago (when the index stood at 8.6). In fact, this index is the highest recorded in five years.\<b>special questions\Question 1: Local air service\The airline industry has been battered in recent months by rising jet fuel costs and has experienced ongoing challenges associated with costly labor contracts and persistent excess capacity after Sept. 11. This situation was evident in the recent bankruptcy declarations by Mesaba and Northwest Airlines. Mesaba, in partnership with Northwest, offers local air service.\Area firms were asked if they were concerned these bankruptcies would lead to a loss of local air service. About 73 percent of those surveyed are ""slightly concerned"" or ""not concerned at all.""\About 19 percent of firms are moderately concerned and only 5 surveyed firms said they are ""very concerned.""\Survey respondents provided written\explanations for their responses to the local air service question.

Surveyed firms were asked to write about the extent to which the hurricanes have or will have an effect (direct or indirect) on their companies.\The response to this item was overwhelming. Numerous respondents reported:\a- Increased fuel prices (gas, heating oil, diesel).\Increased fuel prices (gas, heating oil, diesel).a- Rising building material costs.\Rising building material costs.a- Longer delivery times and reduced availability of supplies.\Longer delivery times and reduced availability of supplies.a- Higher insurance premiums.\Higher insurance premiums.a- Slowing of overall economic growth.\Slowing of overall economic growth.a- Fear of a future rise in taxes and reduced profitability.Respondents commented on other effects, which include:\Fear of a future rise in taxes and reduced profitability.Respondents commented on other effects, which include:\a- ""(Affected) only to the extent that assets leave local nonprofits to support those impacted our company provides investment services to nonprofits.""\""(Affected) only to the extent that assets leave local nonprofits to support those impacted our company provides investment services to nonprofits.""a- ""Huge impact!

The list of issues that companies considered important was similar to last year's survey.\Sixty-seven percent selected health-care reform as an important legislative issue. This is the same percentage as last year.\About 46 percent of firms considered tax burden a priority this session, compared with 42 percent of businesses last year.\Transportation policy and K-12 education funding are listed by 36 percent of firms. Education ranked the same last year, and transportation was slightly higher with 40 percent of firms calling it a priority.\While a number of firms did not indicate their most important legislative priority as asked, out of those that did make a choice, health-care reform was the overriding selection. It was the top priority of 30 percent of surveyed firms, and no other item was selected by even 7 percent of respondents.\Written comments on legislative priorities include:\a- ""Our health-care coverage is increasing 16 percent and our claims have (gone) down! The only consolation is that we know everyone's rates will be rising also.""\""Our health-care coverage is increasing 16 percent and our claims have (gone) down!

Cost to Minnesotans is much greater than the small increase sought in the 'gas tax.'""\""Congestion continues to worsen. Cost to Minnesotans is much greater than the small increase sought in the 'gas tax.'""Question 4: Qualified workers\This quarter's final question looked at an issue raised in the cover story in the summer 2005 edition of ROI Central Minnesota. Companies expressed the extent to which they are concerned about their ability to replace retiring baby boomers in the next 10 years.\Women of the baby boom period from 1946-64 had about 3.5 children. By comparison, the number of births per female is now about 2.1 (having averaged 1.8 for an extended period). This means that the share of the U.S. population at normal retirement age will rise starting about 2010.\Area employers are concerned about the availability of qualified workers to replace these retirees. Twenty-six percent responded that they are ""very concerned"" about replacing baby boomers and 28 percent are moderately concerned.\This is not a problem unique to the St. Cloud area. The Nov. 22 edition of The Wall Street Journal pointed out difficulties firms are facing nationwide in finding skilled production workers (81 percent of manufacturers reported they face 'moderate' or 'severe' shortages of qualified workers).\Local respondents wrote explanations for their responses. Comments include:\a- ""Pay well you'll get qualified employees.""\""Pay well you'll get qualified employees.""a- ""We need skilled welders and fabricators.""\""We need skilled welders and fabricators.""a- ""We will probably hire some of the retirees part time.""\""We will probably hire some of the retirees part time.""a- ""No idea how we are going to recruit highly skilled engineers.""\""No idea how we are going to recruit highly skilled engineers.""a- ""We are looking at alternative work schedules to keep good employees beyond retirement age.""\""We are looking at alternative work schedules to keep good employees beyond retirement age.""a- ""Could actually turn into an opportunity.""\""Could actually turn into an opportunity.""\<b>monetary policy: a hard act to follow\We were not surprised when earlier this fall interest rates spiked with the announcement of Ben Bernanke's nomination as the next Federal Reserve chairman. This is most likely because of uncertainty about where monetary policy will go after Bernanke takes the reins. The same thing happened when Greenspan was nominated to replace Paul Volcker.\We argue that monetary policy is unlikely to change much in the short term.\In the longer term, we expect increased transparency of monetary policy, which should help businesses plan for investment.\Also, by the time you read this, it is most likely that the Federal Reserve will have increased its Federal Funds rate target to 4.25 percent from 4 percent, the 12th consecutive quarter-point increase since June 30, 2004. Expectations are for another A 1/4 percent increase at the Fed's\Jan. 31 meeting.\The dilemma for monetary policy in the past year and a half has been the inability of tightening monetary policy to have much effect on longer-term interest rates.\Twenty-year Treasury bond rates have fallen from about 5.4 percent at the time monetary policy began tightening to about 4.8 percent now. When the Federal Reserve began to raise the Federal Funds rate target, the difference (or spread) from the 10-year and one-year Treasury bond yield was 253 basis points (or 2.53 percent). That spread is now a mere 16 basis points. As the graph above shows, the yield curve has become much more flat throughout this period.\Because most research indicates that long-term interest rates are more important for investment and economic activity, this development has meant the effectiveness of monetary policy in slowing the economy has been diminished.\The Federal Reserve and Fed watchers have been puzzled by this development.\The Fed has increased interest rate targets at a ""measured pace"" to steadily achieve an implied inflation objective of 2 percent. While the Fed may have moved too slowly in increasing interest rate targets in the initial phase of this most recent round of tightening, there is some evidence that the anticipated increase at the Dec. 13 meeting will move us close to neutral a point at which further rate increases may be unnecessary.\To date, market participants have been fairly accurate in predicting coming Fed policy moves, but doubts could soon creep in about where interest rates are headed in the future.\Compounding this problem are signs that firms are feeling the ability to pass through cost and wage increases into higher prices, as discussed earlier in this report.\This is where Bernanke's views about increased monetary policy transparency may be helpful. Many financial market observers believe the Fed has had a target inflation rate, but the Fed has given mixed signals about it. Bernanke's research and speeches about explicit inflation targeting suggests he sees advantages of openness in the conduct of monetary policy.\In a speech in March 2003 he said, ""In general, the greater the inherited credibility of the central bank, the less restrictive need be the guidelines, targets or the like that form the central bank's communication strategy. But credibility is not a permanent characteristic of a central bank; it must be continuously earned. Moreover, an explicit policy framework has broader advantages, including among others increased buy-in by politicians and the public, increased accountability, reduced uncertainty and greater intellectual clarity.""\In a November congressional hearing, Bernanke affirmed this view, but he indicated he would explore inflation targeting for the Fed only after long discussions inside and outside the institution.\Because it seems most likely that short-term rates will increase further as the Fed raises its short-term targets, it also seemslikely that long rates will rise with them. So we see no reason to expect a big change in the slope of the yield curve. The National Association of Business Economists forecasts the 10-year Treasury bond yield to reach only 5.15 percent by the end of 2006 from about 4.5 percent now. A modest rise this far into an expansion would be consistent with a healthy environment for investment.\Fed raises its short-term targets, it also seemslikely that long rates will rise with them.

A modest rise this far into an expansion would be consistent with a healthy environment for investment.\<b>housing goes from red hot to pretty warm\We asked a local commercial builder what the most important indicator was to determine the firm's business potential. Without hesitating, he answered, ""Building permits.""\Business must have been good for those builders last year, because building permits reached new levels in the St. Cloud area. But as the chart shows, the number of permits has slowed in recent months (although building permit valuations are up over last year).\After peaking above an annual rate in excess of 1,100 permits, we cooled to 1,028 in September. While still above the previous plateau of 800 permits a year, there is little question from the comments in the business outlook survey that many builders expect to see slower business growth in 2006.\We have plotted 12-month totals to avoid seasonality and confusing fluctuations that can occur when a new development starts.\A number of factors are at play here. First is the possibility the level of activity in 2004 was unsustainable. At some point the supply of raw land reaches a limit unless additional land is annexed.\Second, the aforementioned uncertainty about interest rates has caused some cooling in housing starts nationwide as builders are not sure what mortgage rates will be when they finish a house. Mortgage rates have fluctuated substantially from 5.5 percent to 6.3 percent in the past 15 months.\Also, the increased demand for building materials in the Gulf Coast in the past few months has driven up prices (and reduced availability of materials) in our region, which could further cool the housing market.\<b>looking at the data\Employment and want-ad figures show good gains in the past year. Private-sector employment in the St. Cloud area showed a strong 1.3 percent gain during the year through October.\Manufacturing-sector employment fell 0.5 percent during the year, and the share of employment in manufacturing fell to 17.2 percent, a level not seen in the St. Cloud area since late 1996.\Within services, financial and retail services sectors have both improved, and there is continued strength in the leisure and hospitality area.\Data in Table 4 on the opposite page largely confirm this as well.\The household survey data showed no growth in employment and a decline in the work force. The differences between these data and the payroll survey could be because the additional payroll jobs shown in Table 3 are being taken by individuals who already have jobs in the St. Cloud area.\A decline in labor force participation helped lower the local area unemployment rate to 2.8 percent and may be another indication that we are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers in the area. Increased competition for workers from Twin Cities and Interstate 94 corridor employers also may be draining the area work force.\There has been a slight increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance in the St. Cloud area in the most recent quarter, which may reflect some weakness in manufacturing. But help-wanted advertising continued to expand at an incredible rate in the second half of 2005.\The accompanying figure above compares the help-wanted linage in the\St. Cloud Times to its long-run slightly downward trend since 1989. As we noted last year, alternative forms of advertising for employees have deteriorated the market for print help-wanted advertising.\Help-wanted advertising has returned to levels not seen since 2000 and has quickened since mid-year. Again, this marks increasing competition for skilled workers in St. Cloud. As long as firms continue to feel they can pass on price increases, as they indicated in the business outlook survey, paying a little more for labor and looking harder for good workers will be worthwhile.\Increased demand, however, would be more difficult for firms expanding their businesses if they do not have access to active labor markets.\Help-wanted linage is only part of the growth in the St. Cloud Area Index of Leading Indicators. As Table 5 shows, three of the index's four components grew in the past quarter.\A year ago, we observed area production employees worked an average of two hours of overtime, as firms were reluctant to add (or unable to find) new workers as they expanded output. That reversed course during the first half of this year, but the presence of overtime returned in the last quarter.\This contributed a third of the increase in leading indicators in this report. Incorporation of new businesses in the area have maintained their 2004 pace; only the aforementioned uptick in new claims for unemployment insurance darkens the leading indicators.\The national and international environments look moderately favorable to the local economy. National forecasters expect GDP growth from 3 percent to\3.5 percent in 2006. Increased strength of the dollar in foreign currency markets make it unlikely the trade deficit will fall much below $600 billion in 2006 after reaching $750 billion this year.\We anticipate the European Central Bank will increase interest rates in order to fend off some of the recent declines in the euro.\The Chinese yuan will strengthen some against the dollar as the Chinese allow their currency to float more, but it will not be enough to dent the trade deficit.\But steady-as-she-goes monetary policy in the United States and a Congress intent on addressing how it will pay for the hurricane cleanup should keep interest rates from rising too far.\As we concluded last time, ""business leaders' attitudes seems to be to invest and grow their firms until events change. As long as that attitude persists, expansion is in the cards.""\We see no reason to change that assessment. Indeed, we are more bullish now than then.\<b>What is affecting your company?\Survey respondents commented on special factors influencing their firms.

184,"Republican Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, one of the leading candidates to be the next Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, wouldn't say much Wednesday about the new direction of his now 72-member caucus. But he would say this: There will be a separate agriculture committee under Republican control, and it won't be chaired by someone from Minneapolis.\That was a conspicuous dig at Minneapolis DFL Rep. Jean Wagenius, the outgoing chair of the Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Finance Committee in the House. It was also a strong indicator of the new flavor the all-new Republican majority will bring to St. Paul over the next two years.\That's because Republicans have Greater Minnesota voters to thank for their newfound majority -- they won 11 seats Tuesday night, and only one was from the metro area.\""There were a lot of Democrat freshman incumbents that came to St. Paul and voted with the Minneapolis and St. Paul members and really lost touch with their districts,"" Daudt said at a press conference in St. Paul, where he was surrounded by new and old Republican lawmakers. ""I think they suffered the consequences of that in the election last night.""\These are seats Daudt thinks they can hold again in two years if they do the right things with their newfound power. That means not overreaching and no wasteful spending -- the things he said irked rural Minnesota voters under Democratic power.\The biggest liability for Democrats on the campaign trail was passing a new office-building project for state senators, Daudt said: ""It was an example of misplaced priorities.""\But he hesitated to put too much blame on a controversial 2013 vote to legalize gay marriage in Minnesota. The vote put Democratic rural members on the spot whose districts had voted earlier for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In the end, seven DFLers who bucked their voters on gay marriage lost Tuesday night.\Daudt noted, however, that the two rural Democrats who voted against gay marriage for that reason also lost their seats on Tuesday night. ""I don't think we can make a broad blanket statement that that issue had anything to do with the end results,"" he said.\One thing Daudt did make clear about his new caucus: It wasn't going to jump into power looking to ""divide and conquer,"" since it still has to work with DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and a DFL controlled Senate. The last time Minnesota had divided government, the state went into a 21-day government shutdown over a budget solution.\""I don't see any reason why we would have a [government shutdown], I really don't,"" Daudt said, repeatedly trying to cast his new caucus in a different light than the Tea Party labels that had been tossed out on the campaign trail. ""I hope that the Democrats see it that way as well.""\And what issues will a Greater-Minnesota-focused Republican House make a priority over the next two years? Daudt is still figuring that out with his members, but he did say this:\* Rural Republicans will prioritize road and bridge funding, but that doesn't necessarily mean passing a gas tax increase, Daudt said. The last poll in the election cycle from KSTP/SurveyUSA showed Minnesotans were 80 percent opposed to raising the gas tax.\* In fact, Daudt didn't say much about taxes at all, either holding the line on tax increases or repealing some increases Democrats passed over the last two years. Daudt said he would wait until they see the budget forecast in December and February before making any budget decisions.\* They will try to fix MNsure, the state's health insurance exchange, but Daudt was hesitant to say he would push for a full-on repeal of the program. He said he wants to make sure the ""MNsure board gets more active,"" and bonuses seem unlikely for exchange executives. ""We will try to fix it, but if repeal becomes the best solution, we will try to do that,"" he said.\Credit: Briana Bierschbach"
185,"-RSEC-\ Long after the cheers of this winter's Olympics have echoed through the Wasatch Mountains and faded from memory, this city's everyday commuters will enjoy two huge benefits from the 2002 games.\ One is a freshly rebuilt freeway running 17 miles from downtown to Salt Lake's rapidly growing southern suburbs. The other is a parallel light-rail line - the city's first - with a newly-opened spur that runs to the University of Utah.\ These projects, costing $2.02 billion, might have been built eventually. But landing the Olympics prompted a juiced-up construction schedule that produced a new north-south transportation corridor in half the time and at a savings of nearly $500 million. The result offers a better chance at handling future growth, and a palpable easing of the bumper-to-bumper frustrations that squeezed the domestic lives of family-minded Utahans.\ Timing was important in another sense, too. As the war on terrorism claims additional federal dollars, states will be stuck with a greater share of transportation costs. Utah was fortunate to jump the gun.\ In 1996, it raised the gas tax a nickel to expedite the freeway project. Two years earlier it had committed local transit money to help launch LRT. As it turned out, the first line was so popular when it opened in 1999 that metro voters boosted the sales tax by a quarter cent to add more lines. Buoyed by ridership running 40 percent above projections, the transit agency last week purchased 175 miles of Union Pacific right of way for $180 million, thus establishing a spine for the TRAX regional rail system.\ Two realities have come clear to Republican-dominated Utah: Transit and roads don't compete, but complement one another; and states can no longer count on federal help to build the transportation they will need in the years ahead.\ ""The funding proportions have changed,"" said Tom Warne, Utah's former transportation director, and now an industry consultant. ""It's now state money that counts the most."" He listed Colorado, Arizona and Washington as examples of other states that have recently forged their own road/ rail transportation initiatives designed to benefit not only Denver, Phoenix and Seattle but rural communities as well. ""States want to control their own destiny,"" he said.\ Warne spoke over breakfast at a diner not 500 feet from the gleaming new Interstate Hwy. 15. The road was completely rebuilt; widened from six lanes to 10, including two for car pools; its old cloverleaf interchanges replaced by flyovers; 142 new bridges built, and landscaping added, accentuating the soft green and purple hues of the desert. Three large viaducts were also removed on the west edge of downtown, opening up 20 blocks for housing and shops. Cost: $1.59 billion.\ A normal schedule would have produced all this in eight years. Racing against the Olympics deadline, Utah did it in 4 1/2 years by taking a number of calculated steps that actually stretch back to 1995.\ That's when Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt convened an ""Envision Utah"" summit around the issues of water, open space and transportation. It didn't take long for state leaders to discover what they really wanted. They called it quality growth: new development that fit the desert environment and redevelopment that made existing cities more attractive.\ Their conclusion dove-tailed with a decision to move ahead on LRT despite its defeat by voters in 1992. Republicans Leavitt and Sens. Bob Bennett and Orrin Hatch led the way on the $430 million rail project.\ Next came Leavitt's gas tax increase to form the Centennial Fund, which divided $2.8 billion among the I-15 corridor in Salt Lake City and a number of outstate road improvements.\ Finally, with the Olympics looming, came the decision to pursue a streamlined design-build process in which freeway construction began before all the drawings were finished. To further accelerate the pace, the state completely closed some interchanges for six to eight months. ""Business took a dive,"" said Robyn Payne, a Denny's waitress for 24 years. ""But in the end, it was worth it,"" she said, glancing toward the new roadway.\ The mystery is how conservative Utah has been able to build a balanced transportation system while so-called progressive Minnesota continues to struggle. ""Everyone thought Minneapolis-St. Paul was going to be a leader on these issues,"" said John M. Inglish, general manager of the Utah Transit Authority. ""What happened to you?""\ Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in a list of explanations for Utah's success offered by Vicki Varela, Leavitt's former press aide and now partner in a Salt Lake City consulting firm: courageous political leadership, good economic times, ample civic spirit and a pioneer mentality that emphasizes community values as much as self- reliance. ""It's a culture that rallies together,"" she said.\ While the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints never explicitly endorsed rebuilding the I-15 corridor, its business arm did donate $600,000 toward the second LRT line. By then, opposition from business, taxpayers' groups and the talk-radio libertarians had faded.\ ""I voted against this thing, but I was wrong,"" said Clinton Merrill, who wedged onto a crowded TRAX train at Temple Square and rode toward his home in West Jordan. ""I didn't know what it was. Now I ride it every day.""\ - Steve Berg is a Star Tribune editorial writer."
186,"It was not the famed Halloween snowstorm. It was not the record snowfall in 1988.\ In fact, C.J. Ramstad says, the boom in Minnesota snowmobiling has nothing to do with snowfall and everything to do with baby boomers.\ ""It's straight demographics. There are more people over age 30 and they are coming back or just discovering snowmobiling,"" said Ramstad, publisher of Minnesota Snowmobiling magazine.\ For whatever reason, snowmobiling in the state seems to be undergoing its biggest resurgence since the motorized sleds first became popular in the early 1970s.\ The boom will be noticed today at the Ski, Snowmobile and Winter Show. Compare the crowds at ski displays to those at snowmobile exhibits in the Minneapolis Convention Center. ""The snowmobile booths are the busiest,"" said show spokesman Jim Anderson.\ Registration figures from the DNR tend to confirm the sport's increasing popularity. As of last July, 206,000 snowmobiles were registered, compared to 193,000 a year earlier, said Suellen Rau, DNR's supervisor of snowmobile licensing. It's also the highest registration figure since 1976, when snow sleds peaked with 292,488.\ Rau said that since July, new registrations and renewals have been coming in at a rate of a couple hundred a day, which ""is a fairly steady pace.""\ Snowmobile sales also are an indication of renewed interest. Nationally, Ramstad said, 160,000 new sleds were sold, a figure roughly 10 percent higher than the year before. ""Sales have been increasing at a double-digit rate since about 1985,"" said Ramstad, who estimated that a record 400,000 sleds, new and used, would change hands this year.\ In the meantime, the number of snowmobile manufacturers has declined from more than 100 two decades ago to today's four majors - Polaris, Arctic Cat, Ski-Doo and Yamaha. Two are Minnesota-based: Arctic Cat in Thief River Falls and Roseau is home to Polaris, the largest of the Big Four in total sales.\ Joe Novack, sales manager for Anoka-Ramsey Sports Center, said this fall's snowmobile sales are higher than in previous years. ""I'd say about 60 percent of our sales are previous customers who are trading up,"" Novack said. ""The rest - 40 percent - are customers who are coming back to snowmobiling or just starting.""\ As a winter pastime, snowmobiling has matured since its noisy inception a quarter-century ago. Back then, the machines were loud and considered harmful to the environment. Trespassing and decibel levels were issues before the Legislature.\ With no trail system developed, riders concentrated on parks and lakes and often were hazardous to one another.\ That was then.\ ""The newer machines are nicer,"" said Novack. ""You can ride 500 miles without a problem. Back then, you couldn't go 50 miles without a belt change or something going wrong.""\ Ramstad agrees. ""I'm a motorhead, but most people aren't. Today, you turn the key and go. It's riding for scenery and adventure,"" said Ramstad, who in four days last winter rode border to border, south to north, through Minnesota.\ Snowmobilers also have changed. They are older and more affluent, and a weekend of riding is often a family pursuit. To own snowmobiles you need a garage for storage and money for insurance, fuel and other costs. The family riding aspect has given parents a winter connection to their offspring. ""Kids love snowmobiling,"" Ramsted said.\ Drunken driving remains a stigma, however. Last year, 23 people died while snowmobiling; most of the accidents were alcohol-related. The 15,000-member Minnesota United Snowmobiling Association has launched several safety campaigns, including a ""Steer Clear"" program that emphasizes safe practices.\ Sheriff's departments also have emphasized patrols to nab drunken drivers, utilizing funds derived from snowmobilers themselves via the state's gas-tax refund. A one-year project in St. Louis County reduced fatal accidents from eight deaths to two a year later.\ The DNR also has a youth safety training program, required of youngsters 16 and under and taught by volunteer adult snowmobilers.\ What isn't new about Minnesota's snowmobiling attraction is the state's 14,000-mile trail system. Of the 14,000 miles - all remarkably well-marked - roughly 12,000 are established and maintained by 255 local snowmobile clubs. The other 2,000 miles are on state-maintained trails in state forests or parks.\ ""It's the one great unheralded aspect,"" said Ramstad.\ Maintenance of the trail system is funded from snowmobile registration fees and the state gas-tax refund.\ The DNR, which manages the $5.7 million fund, allocates roughly $2.5 million in grants or cost-shared programs with clubs to establish and maintain trails. Ramstad said the rest is spent on law enforcement and administration by the DNR and county law agencies.\ There's another big difference about snowmobiling then vs. now.\ Snowmobilers seem to be more liked by the rest of Minnesotans. The noise is subdued, and trails cut down on trespassing. Cross-country skiers and snowmobilers actually talk to one another. In the north, snowmobiling has become a major winter boost to the tourism industry.\ What's more, snowmobiling seems to have boomed rather quietly. Last August, the metro Sno Barons snowmobile club sponsored grass drag races and a sled swap in a Lino Lakes pasture.\ Guess who showed up?\ Roughly 30,000 snowmobilers. Yes, 30,000. On a summer day, no less."
187,"Minnesota has unfinished business on transportation. Six years ago, the Legislature overrode a governor's veto to temporarily shore up roads and transit. And last year, it authorized some extra borrowing for selected road projects. Still, the state expects to have only enough money to cover 60 percent of its transportation needs over the next 20 years.\A shortfall of that magnitude cries out for a comprehensive solution, one that Gov. Mark Dayton and the Legislature should be eager to address this year -- if they can find the political courage.\Let's be clear: This isn't just about mobility. Transportation is the public foundation upon which private enterprise operates. There's no way the state's economy can grow, prosper and compete on a crumbling foundation that's 40 percent weaker than it ought to be. There's no way that Minnesotans can sustain their cherished quality of life with a circulatory system that's no longer pumping. Jobs won't come. People won't stay. Access to markets, education, health care and to each other will diminish. That's a sad legacy to leave our next generations.\Your first instinct might be to doubt all of this. You don't have much trouble driving around your own town, after all, and even in the busy metro area, traffic congestion has eased a bit in recent years. But you'd be alarmed if you saw a map of the unstable and dangerous pavement and bridges all around you. Much of Minnesota's infrastructure was built in a short span of years, in the 1960s and '70s, and it's all wearing out at the same time. Patching and mending will no longer do; many roads and bridges need to be completely rebuilt, starting now.\And there's a concurrent problem: The funding mechanism no longer works. For 60 years, federal and state gasoline taxes were the primary revenue source for expanding and maintaining transportation. But now those revenues are declining sharply for two reasons: resistance to higher fuel taxes and the declining value of the tax itself. The rise of fuel-efficient cars, coupled with lifestyle choices that require less driving, have reduced the tax's buying power by one-third over the last two decades. What's good for the environment and energy conservation is bad for building and maintaining roads.\A deflated gas tax is no excuse for inaction, however. Other states are moving ahead to find other sources. Oregon has a pilot program that offers the choice of installing a device in your car that counts your driving distance and taxes you by the mile. For now, the mileage tax is restricted to 5,000 vehicles, but it's generally considered the wave of the future if privacy fears can be overcome.\Until then, Virginia and other states are relying heavily on taxing the gross receipts of oil companies for fuel shipped into local stations. The higher wholesale cost could be passed on, although the retail price would be subject to market pressures. Another idea is an annual tonnage-mileage fee based on a vehicle's odometer readings and weight. Cobbling together a number of these approaches along with what's left of the gas tax seems a likely solution, at least in the near term.\On the transit side, the metrowide sales tax is by far the most popular source nationally. But the quarter-cent sales-tax increase passed in 2008 for the Twin Cities allows for only a fraction of the investments that competing cities make. And the tax fails to meet higher transit demand as the market shifts toward closer-in living and less driving.\Indeed, at five recent public listening sessions around the metro area hosted jointly by Transportation Commissioner Charles Zelle and Metropolitan Council Chair Susan Haigh, the overriding plea was for better pedestrian, bike and transit connections. ""That was the story even in the suburbs,"" Haigh said. And Zelle, who hosted dozens of sessions across the state last year, reported similar reactions in smaller communities.\Another change Zelle noticed is that Minnesotans no longer complain about someone else grabbing all the transportation money; now they see that no one is getting enough. ""That's a game changer,"" he said.\Zelle and Haigh aside, the biggest shortfall in transportation may not be money but leadership. The governor and Legislature should know that kicking the can no longer works; MnDOT has reached its borrowing limit. Dayton, legislative leaders and hesitant business executives should join the robust Move Minnesota coalition that unites business, civic and environmental leaders from 120 organizations, including the Minneapolis and St. Paul chambers of commerce, to push for a real solution.\Maybe the public can't yet detect the deterioration of our transportation infrastructure, but that doesn't make it any less real. We've lived the Minnesota ""good life"" on the wise investments of those who came before us; now it's our turn.\BY THE NUMBERS\- 50: Percent of state highway pavement more than 50 years old\- 35: Percent of state bridges more than 50 years old\- 38th: Minnesota's national ranking on pavement condition\- 19: States that have higher fuel taxes than Minnesota\- $12 billion: Roads and bridges 20-year shortfall\- 15: Percent of the $12 billion gap that MnDOT pledges to make up in efficiency savings\- $5 billion: Transit's 20-year shortfall (metro and outstate combined)\Transportation Finance Advisory Committee, December 2012"
188,"
The Minnesota Legislature's overtired, homeward-bound lawmakers passed their midnight deadline Monday with unsettled business, despite their rush to vote on a $42 billion budget plan.
\
""It's still kind of 'not over until it's over,' "" said Sen. Melisa Franzen, DFL-Edina. She -- along with a bipartisan horde of legislators -- implored DFL Gov. Mark Dayton not to veto the Legislature's $17 billion education bill.
\
But the governor, cut out of the final plan by bipartisan legislative leaders, has pledged to kill that bill with his veto pen because it inadequately funds preschool programs. With no election to face and a willingness to force lawmakers to reconsider his demands, Dayton has also made no guarantees that he would sign the rest of lawmakers' $25 billion spending plans.
\
The Legislature hurried to a close, voting on billions of dollars of spending in bills they had reviewed for just a few hours. Many senators protested fiercely when a 94-page jobs bill drafted by leaders of both parties was presented with less than an hour to go before adjournment.
\
But lawmakers have little clue what will happen next. In the session's final minutes, leaders tried to strike an education compromise that could appease Dayton, but there was no indication of whether House Republicans would agree to a measure that the governor would sign off on.
\
""The governor's going to do what he's going to do, and there's nothing I can do about that,"" Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said in the session's closing days.
\
While the governor, House Republicans and Senate DFLers may differ on whether the Legislature's budget measures should become law, they were united in their disappointment at what they left behind. In the final negotiations, comprehensive, multi-year transportation plans fell from the agenda.
\
""I absolutely think that transportation was a priority for me and for my constituents,"" said freshman Rep. Drew Christensen, R-Burnsville. ""I think folks will also be happy with the things we were able to accomplish.""
\
THE PATH FORWARD
\
With the Legislature's budget plans facing an uncertain future once they are presented to Dayton, Capitol powers begin thinking out what would happen next.
\
For many, the first thing on the agenda was time away.
\
""I always felt that when you get to this point in the session, and people are really, really tired, you've gone days without sleep, you need to go home and recharge and let some of the emotion out,"" said Bakk.
\
When he returns from a fishing trip, he will not have a Capitol office. The entire Minnesota Capitol will be closed for renovations, the House chamber desks removed and the ventilation and other systems shut down.
\
That means the Legislature will also be without a signed budget and no place to meet in special session to keep the state from a July 1 partial government shutdown.
\
Under the state constitution, lawmakers don't have to meet in the Capitol but do have to meet in the city of St. Paul.
\
Dayton suggested, seriously, that the House and Senate could meet in tents on the Capitol lawn.
\
Bakk rejected that notion.
\
""It seems like there's some other options,"" Bakk said. ""What if it's raining that day?""
\
The St. Paul Hotel said it would be willing to provide that option.
\
The luxury hotel, in downtown St. Paul, said they wouldn't charge lawmakers to use its ballrooms for the House and Senate floor sessions -- though they'd likely get lots of free publicity and food and alcohol sales if lawmakers take them up.
\
""We felt the iconic setting of The Saint Paul Hotel would be an appropriate back-up to the Capitol for a special session,"" Ken Boyles, the hotel's general manager said in a statement.
\
WHAT'S DONE AND UNDONE
\
Lawmakers sent Dayton an education spending plan with $400 million in new funding he believes is inadequate because it doesn't include his top priority of universal preschool.
\
House DFLers backed the governor, but other lawmakers urged Dayton to take the bill they sent him.
\
""The governor is not very happy with us right now,"" said Sen. Alice Johnson, DFL-Blaine, adding that she too was disappointed her top priority, more school breakfasts, got cut from the bill. ""I'm sure the governor feels some of those same things. It just was not doable in the environment we are working in.""
\
Top legislative leaders tried to craft a compromise deal on education in the final hours of the session, but Dayton wasn't involved in those talks, which meant that even if lawmakers reached a deal the governor could still decide to veto it in the next three days.
\
Groups interested in the outdoors environment had the opposite message: They want to the governor to veto the Legislature's agriculture and environmental budget measure.
\
""We will be urging a veto,"" said Christine Durand, spokesperson of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership. The group, a coalition of conservation and environment groups, said the measure moves backwards on environmental protections.
\
That measure also has some language to strengthen the state's law protecting waterways with buffer zones to keep pollutants from lakes and streams. Dayton had pushed for a much more expansive buffer law than the Legislature approved.
\
Dayton will not have the option of vetoing a massive tax cut bill or a transportation bill. Lawmakers sent him neither.
\
In January, lawmakers were debating spending $10 billion for transportation over the next decade. By the time lawmakers finished Monday, all they could agree on was $27 million through 2017.
\
That's the amount of general fund money included in stopgap ""lights on"" budget passed Monday, which includes a few million dollars for several projects: road work in small cities, railroad safety, outstate Minnesota transit and a smattering of other issues.
\
The most important item with bipartisan support -- borrowing $140 million for a necessary reroute of Highway 53 in northeastern Minnesota -- stalled Monday evening due to procedural obstacles and faced an uncertain future.
\
Gone were the big plans to rebuild the state's roads, bridges and mass transit. DFLers and Republicans were divided over the issue of a gas tax increase, which the DFL said was necessary to provide a steady fund for roads and bridges but Republicans said was unnecessary and harmful.
\
Instead, lawmakers of both parties who ran on the need for more transportation spending will go home all but empty-handed.
\
""I think there's a lack of responsibility and a lack of vision,"" Rep. Sandy Masin, DFL-Eagan, said about the minimal transportation offering the Legislature produced.
\
State Rep. John Koznick, R-Lakeville, blamed the gap in vision on DFLers' insistence that a new tax was the only way to fund transportation needs. Republicans, largely, wanted to redirect existing funds to build out the state's road and bridge systems.
\
""We'll have to figure this out a little bit more,"" said Koznick. ""It will be interesting to see what the reaction is. But we worked hard, I know that.""

189,"STATE OF THE STATE \DFL answer: Taxes \In response to Gov. Tim Pawlenty's State of the State address, DFL Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller said, ""Anybody can cut things. It takes creativity and leadership to bring revenue to the table."" \Is implementing seven new taxes truly a form of creativity and leadership? Looking at my last pay stub, I see that federal, state, Social Security and Medicare taxes are currently being taken out. \With what's left I get to pay sales tax, gasoline tax, property taxes, license tabs, emergency 911 surcharge, local community service tax, state community service tax, telecommunications surcharge, just to name a few. \When will the DFL understand that it cannot provide everything to everyone? Stop spending and start cutting to balance your checkbook, just as the taxpayers of this state are forced to do in their own households! \Robert Jackson, Rosemount \. \PAWLENTY'S PEN \Protecting himself \So Gov. Pawlenty got out his ""taxpayer-protection pen"" to save us from those spendthrift legislators. I'd be far more impressed if he got out his ""bridge-and-roads-protection pen,"" his ""student-protection pen"" or his ""environment-protection pen"" and decided to work with the Legislature to stop Minnesota's slide to the bottom in terms of infrastructure, education and quality of life. \Sadly, I suspect he's really more interested in using his ""Pawlenty-protection pen"" to protect his standing with the national Republican Party than he is in working with the rest of the state for a brighter future. \Sara Strzok, Minneapolis \. \Pohlad-protecting pen \I saw that Tim Pawlenty has a ""taxpayer-protection pen."" Where was that pen when we needed protection from a subsidy for his billionaire buddy Carl Pohlad? \Darren Tobolt, St. Paul \. \Start with salaries \Because of the condition of our state's budget and infrastructure and our lack of adequate funding for education and health care, I think the governor should use his red pen and cut his salary and the salary of all elected representatives. The proceeds could be directed to our state agencies. How patriotic that would be! \Bonnie Strand, Bloomington \. \A GAS-TAX HIKE \Small price to pay \The Legislature is - again - on its way toward passing a sensible, comprehensive, bipartisan, pay-as-you-go transportation-funding package. And the governor is again threatening a veto. \It is estimated that an ""average"" household would pay an additional $42 per year if a 7-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase was implemented. Could your family afford $42 per year ($3.50 per month!) to help maintain and improve our transportation infrastructure? \If we aren't each willing to annually pay an amount comparable to a monthly cable bill, cell phone bill, Internet access bill or any other luxury bill, then it is time to quit whining about traffic congestion and the condition of our infrastructure. We are getting exactly what we are paying for: potholes and gridlock. \Melinda L. Erickson, Minneapolis \. \FAMILIES IN NEED \MA fee hike hurt them \Rep. Shelley Madore's experience with the health care system is heart-wrenching and cries out for reform in the way far too many Minnesota families pay for (or more accurately, can't pay for) the medical care they need (Star Tribune, Feb. 12). \One frustration that many Minnesota families experience is the fee they pay for ongoing medical services through Medical Assistance for their children with disabilities. While these families are willing to pay this fee, it became much less affordable in 2003 when legislators voted to increase the fee dramatically. About 10 percent of those families affected by the increased fees ended up dropping this health care coverage because they simply could not afford the fee increase. While legislators have since provided a minimal measure of relief in the parental fees, in many cases, the fees are still higher than many families can afford. \The stories from Madore and other Minnesota households should impress upon our elected officials that we need to keep the momentum going this year toward real progress on health care that is more available and affordable to all. \Pat Mellenthin, St. Paul; \executive director, Arc of Minnesota \. \WHERE'S RODHAM? \Who's running? \Hillary Rodham Clinton or Hillary Clinton - which one is running for president? \I've seen and heard both in the Star Tribune and on CNN and MPR. If the media don't know who she is, how can the voters? \Elizabeth Pavlica, Bloomington \. \KERSTEN ON ETHANOL \The truth, finally \Katherine Kersten hit the nail on the head regarding the hyped-up, bipartisan support and subsidy of ethanol producers in Minnesota by the Legislature and the governor (""Ethanol: Is it a miracle cure or another dose of snake oil?"" Feb. 13). The price of food has gone up tremendously in Minnesota and around the world since this process gained support in the United States as a way of reducing our need for foreign fuels. \Hats off to Kersten for doing her homework and reporting the truth regarding ethanol production. \Don Kerr, Blaine \. \A QUICK TURNROUND \Can-do government \Looking for some good news? I filed my Minnesota income tax return electronically on Feb. 9; on Feb. 12, my refund was electronically deposited in my bank account! This is a huge improvement over prior years, and a great way to inject cash into our sagging economy. \Congratulations to the Minnesota Department of Revenue for this excellent performance. It shows what government can do when it gets busy and ""just does it."" \Ward Lyndall, Minneapolis \. \LETTER OF THE DAY \Congress is distracted by baseball hearings \I'm glad to know that Congress thinks it has the time to go after professional baseball players for steroid use (""Contradictions, but no clarity,"" Feb. 14) and isn't too worried about the war in Iraq, the poor economy, our porous borders, the skyrocketing cost of health care and a host of other issues. Congress needs to let baseball take care of its issues and get to work on the real issues of the day. \Dale Nelson, Inver Grove Heights"
190,"The Republican majority in the Minnesota Senate has been clear since the beginning of the 2019 legislative session: It believes the state can spend more money on priorities like K-12 schools and the transportation system — without raising taxes. But because Minnesota has limited extra cash on hand to make that happen, other parts of state government would face shrinking budgets as a result.\That includes Minnesota’s environmental spending. As part of their two-year budget plan, Senate Republicans have proposed $57 million in general fund cuts from offices like the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA).\While few other areas of government would see as large a cut if the Senate’s budget were to become law, top GOP lawmakers contend the cuts wouldn’t be a serious threat to Minnesota’s ability to keep parks open and take care of water and air. Not surprisingly, many in the DFL-led House and in the administration of Gov. Tim Walz do not agree, and the Senate plan has drawn enough backlash to become another sticking point in already contentious budget negotiations.\Laura Bishop, commissioner of the MPCA, told a Senate panel last week the Republican plan “makes drastic negative changes” that will impact Minnesotans “who expect clean water, clean air and environmental protection, which also protects human health.”\ Why the cut? \So why do Republicans have the environment in their sights for a spending cut?\Unlike, say, a freeze on money for the state’s troubled Child Care Assistance Program, the environmental budget proposal isn’t born out of frustration with how state agencies are performing, said Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen, R-Alexandria, who chairs the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Finance Committee.\He said it’s part of a broader Republican strategy to slow down the growth of state government and limit tax increases. The agencies doing environmental work are better positioned to absorb general fund cuts, Ingebrigtsen added, because they can use money from dedicated environmental fees to make up for it.\For example, the Senate plan would ax about $2 million from the MPCA’s budget dedicated to paying for operations at the Environmental Quality Board, and replace it with money from the state’s Environmental Fund, which is paid for mostly by taxes on garbage.\The budget proposal would also cut more than $10 million from the general fund for state parks and trails, though it would shift state lottery money to the same purpose. (As a result, however, there would be less lottery money, which is used to pay for environmental projects around the state.)\The MPCA would see a general fund budget cut of $11.4 million in the Senate’s plan, although its total available money is only reduced by $4.65 million, according to Republicans. The DNR would lose $34 million from the general fund, and a net reduction of $21.9 million from its total available cash. (Even the Minnesota Zoo gets a $2.7 million cut.)\Ingebrigtsen sought to put the spending cuts in perspective, however. Senate staff noted the net reductions for the MPCA amounted to a roughly 0.7 percent cut, and about a 2.1 percent cut for the DNR (or 1.4 percent if the lottery money for parks is included). The DNR had a roughly $1 billion budget in the last biennium.\Ingebrigtsen also noted environmental spending isn’t exactly coming to a screeching halt. He pointed to the billions in dedicated money from the Clean Water, Land and Legacy Amendment, a sales tax approved by voters in 2008. The Legacy Amendment, however, explicitly specified that Legacy funds were required to be used to supplement, not substitute for, traditional sources of funding.\“Having to cut budgets and having to cut the zoo and having to cut things like that are not popular things to do,” he said. “But we think we can do this and still get by.”\Ingebrigtsen did have some additions in his budget, including $200,000 for a program aimed at increasing fishing among high schoolers to spark new interest in the sport. Fishing licenses pay for a host of DNR work and were at near-historic lows in 2018.\ Contrast with Walz and the House \Even so, the agencies being cut did not take kindly to the proposal. Bishop, the MPCA commissioner, said the Republican budget put existing work at risk, and ignored a swath of new initiatives proposed by the governor.\For example, the GOP plan would not fully fund Walz’s request to maintain staff who are coordinating clean-up of industrial waste in the St. Louis River — expected to cost about $484,000 in the next two years, and another $726,000 in the following two years. The state uses about $25 million in bonds for the clean-up itself and, as a result, gets another $47 million in matching funds from the federal government. “Without staff to do the work, we risk the federal government reassigning the money to projects in other states that are prepared to use it,” Bishop wrote in a letter to Ingebrigtsen.\She also said funding agencies with fees based on habits they want to end or reduce — like garbage or pollution — was not a good idea.\Sarah Strommen, the DNR commissioner, also told senators the money was not enough for their efforts to combat chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer or to fight invasive species, among other issues.\The governor’s budget and the House DFL budget are not identical, but would each spend roughly an extra $33 million from the general fund above base funding on environmental agencies, in addition to other money raised from increases to fees and a hefty boost to Minnesota’s gas tax. That includes $4.57 million for CWD and the requested money for the St. Louis River.\The House budget has a sweep of new measures aimed at increasing outdoor recreation and environmental health, including $500,000 for a “no child left inside” program that would pay for outdoor education and $637,000 in the next two years for a “lawns to legumes” grant program to subsidize homeowners planting pollinator-friendly yards.\Walz also proposed a bonding bill to raise $1.27 billion for construction projects around the state, including $109 million for the DNR to take care of trails, roads, building, wastewater systems and more. Republicans have been opposed to a bonding bill this year, arguing one should be done in 2020 instead.\Rep. Rick Hansen, a DFLer from South St. Paul who chairs the House’s Environment and Natural Resources Finance Division, said making agencies rely on money transferred from fees was a “short-term fix” but not a “long-term solution” for problems that need attention.\Still, despite the sharp words from the Walz administration and budget plans that are seemingly at odds, Hansen and Ingebrigtsen said they expect to find common ground before the Legislature adjourns on May 20. Issues that have become most divisive to party leaders, such as continuing a health care “provider tax,” are not huge obstacles for the environmental debate, Hansen said.\Legislators are currently on a weeklong break for Easter and Passover holidays, but they will reconvene Tuesday to hash out compromises.\Ingebrigtsen even made a point to note he has supported increases in some environmental fees in the past. “Everybody says you’re supposed to work together to get to the middle, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said."
191,"Minnesotans chose divided government in last year's election, giving Gov. Mark Dayton a second term while flipping control of the House to Republicans. And division is what they got. Some thought a projected $1.9 billion surplus would make for smooth sailing, but the extra money created a fierce debate about what to do with it. Democrats would spend most of it on schools, while Republicans would give tax cuts. It's a debate still not settled, and a special session looms.THE ISSUES AND WHAT HAPPENED (AND DIDN'T)BUDGET PASSTaxes: DFL scuttled the GOP plan for $2 billion in tax cuts, but there's $1 billion left over to fight about next time.The big picture: Minnesota will spend $41.65 billion during the next two years, up 4.85 percent from the previous two.Drivers: Education and health care, well more than half the state budget, continue to drive costs.TRANSPORTATION FAILNothing doing: Both sides had big multibillion dollar plans, with the DFL pushing a gas tax increase and the GOP wanting to take from the general fund. They couldn't agree.Nothing? They did increase the fine for a second offense for texting while driving to $225 and mandated plans to better time city traffic light signals. Gr8!ENVIRONMENT UNRESOLVEDBuffers: Dayton and the Republican House compromised on a plan for buffers to protect the state's waterways from pollutants, but Dayton vetoed the overall bill over other objections.Citizens be gone: The Pollution Control Agency Citizens' Board was eliminated, one of many provisions Dayton objected to.SUNDAY LIQUOR FAILSunday sales: The Sunday sellers got more votes this time and they think they have momentum, but the powerful coalition of liquor stores and cities beat them back again.Growlers and bloodies: But if you're desperate, you can now buy a growler of beer on Sunday from a taproom, or start your Sunday right with a bloody mary at 8 a.m. instead of 10.EDUCATION UNRESOLVEDUniversal Pre-K: Unresolved. Dayton is demanding it. The Republican House and DFL Senate declined. To be settled in the upcoming special session.Teacher seniority: Despite lots of noise on last-in, first-out rules for teacher layoffs, the teachers union beat it back, though anything can be a bargaining chip in a special session.CRIMINAL JUSTICE PASSProtecting privacy: Legislators agreed cops can store location data from license plate readers for 60 days.No on voting: A bipartisan push for felon voting rights died, but supporters believe they have momentum for next year.Suppressed: Lawmakers legalized firearm ""silencers"" like the device above, used as a demonstration during testimony.HEALTH CARE OVERHAUL FAILMinnesotaCare: The public health insurance program for 90,000 working poor survived a challenge by Republicans.MNsure too: A task force will decide what to do with the two programs.Good news: Spinal cord injuries got some research funding.MISCELLANY PASSFire retardant no more: After bagpiping in the Capitol hallways, firefighters helped pass the toughest flame retardant ban in the nation because they say the chemicals are unsafe and ineffective.Shocked! Shocked! The Legislature stopped the State Lottery from selling tickets online, at gas station pumps and ATMs.WINNERSDaytonA rocky start, but in the end, Dayton will get most of what he wanted on schools and possibly prekindergarten.Education Minn.The powerful teachers union, 70,000-strong, beat back an effort to scrap last-in, first-out rules for layoffs. And, Dayton is going to the mat for universal prekindergarten, likely expanding the ranks of the union even more.Daudt, Bakk and their allianceDaudt, a new, fresh-faced House speaker, looked worn during negotiations with Dayton and Bakk, but he cut a deal with the latter to finish on time and fight another day. As for Bakk? The master negotiator got much of what he wanted -- again.LOSERSTax cuttersRepublicans came in with high hopes of doing what they love most: cutting taxes. Despite a $2 billion plan, they wound up with nothing once Bakk demanded his transportation package in exchange. As the adage goes in baseball, wait until next year.Outstate MNIt was supposed to be the session of Greater Minnesota. Republicans flipped 10 seats outstate, but in the end, much didn't get done. Nursing homes will get a cash infusion. But without a tax or transportation bill, outstate will be without added local government aid or the road construction that creates jobs and pumps money into local economies.Transportation advocatesBoth parties said transportation was a priority, but neither could agree on a funding mechanism. Senate DFLers wanted a gas tax, which the House GOP said was too onerous. Republicans wanted to tap general funds, which the DFL said was not a long-term solution. Stalemate still on!NOTEWORTHYRep.

192," Gov. Arne Carlson on Tuesday signed legislation that will raise posted speed limits on most interstate freeways and most divided four-lane highways in Minnesota despite earlier indications that he would veto the bill.\ In a letter to the president of the state Senate, the governor said he signed the measure ""because I recognize that this bill has considerable support from many Minnesotans who drive safely every day but who are at times subjected to an overly restrictive law that criminalizes their actions.""\ Under the law:\ - About 650 miles of rural interstates will go to 70 miles per hour, from 65 mph, on July 1.\ - About 660 miles of rural divided four-lane highways will go to 65 mph, from 55 mph, on the same date.\ - All two-lane state highways - about 10,000 miles - will remain at 55 mph.\ - About 200 miles of urban freeways and 100 miles of urban four-lane highways would go to 65 mph, from 55 mph, but Carlson said he plans to tinker with that part of the new law.\ Carlson said he told Transportation Commissioner James Denn to conduct traffic and speed surveys of metro-area freeways and highways before July 1. Using existing authority, Denn then can set limits more consistent with road design and traffic patterns.\ ""My expectation is that there will be parts of the metro freeway system at 65, some at 60 mph, and the remainder will continue at 55,"" said William Schreiber, an assistant to Denn.\Reaction mixed\ The increase in speed limits was hailed by some, but critics said it will lead to more highway fatalities.\ ""I think this is a step forward in traffic safety,"" said Sen. Leo Foley, DFL-Anoka, the chief Senate sponsor of the measure.\ ""I believe more people will be in compliance with the speed limit. More people will be driving approximately the same speed. Therefore, there will be a lot less passing and probably a lot less following too closely. . . . The result will be less lane changes. . . .\ ""Ultimately, my view is that more people will be arriving alive,"" said Foley, a retired State Patrol officer with 33 years of service.\ Rep. David Bishop, R-Rochester, a champion of higher speed limits for almost 10 years, said laws that are not obeyed should be changed. Most drivers are flouting current speed limits, he said.\ Bishop said the new limits are safe and that most drivers will not exceed them.\ But Bob Johnson, executive vice president of the Insurance Federation of Minnesota, which represents about 85 insurance firms that do business in the state, said he expects fatalities and serious injuries to increase.\ ""The studies we have seen conclude that higher speeds cause more serious injuries and more fatalities, period. . . . To the extent there are more serious injuries and fatalities, that increases automobile insurance costs,"" he said.\ Lisa Peterson, vice president of the Minnesota Trucking Association, lamented the speed increase, saying it will make freeways more dangerous and add to the cost of operating trucks.\ Trucks that maintain the higher speeds will use more fuel, she said, and those that don't maintain the higher speeds create a safety problem.\Drunken driving veto\ ""This was a bad year for safety,"" Peterson said. ""They {legislators} didn't lower the blood-alcohol {limit for adult drivers}. They didn't make seat belts for kids a primary offense. They defeated {other} seat-belt legislation. They didn't approve more troopers.\ ""And now they're increasing the speed limit.""\ On the same day he signed the speed-limit bill, the governor vetoed a bill that would have lowered the blood-alcohol limit to 0.04 percent from the current 0.10 for drivers under age 19.\ In his veto message, Carlson said it is not sound public policy ""to enact legislation that subjects one group of citizens to a different set of standards than we would impose upon ourselves.""\More troopers\ During the legislative session, Carlson, through aides, threatened to veto the speed-limit bill unless he received an additional 75 troopers for the State Patrol.\ Last year, he used his executive authority to cancel a similar bill because it, too, did not provide more troopers.\ ""Minnesota currently ranks 45th nationally in both the number of highway miles per trooper {243} and the number of licensed drivers per trooper {4,929}, unacceptable levels in a state that prides itself on the well being of its citizenry,"" Carlson said.\ ""With the proposed speed-limit increase, a greater trooper presence and the corresponding perception of apprehension is essential to maintain the safety of the state's highway environment.""\ He said he expects the Legislature to fund more troopers in the 1998 session.\ ""The presence of a trooper has a chilling effect on speeding,"" said Carlson, who acknowledged that he received two speeding tickets in one day.\ The governor said he is concerned that drivers may drive even faster than the new posted speeds. ""I think that's just a fact of life. . . . I hope that the implementation of this law does not result in more injuries or fatalities.""\ A study in Texas and California just before and after the federal maximum speed limit was abolished in 1995 found that average speeds on urban freeways rose along with the higher limits, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, based in Arlington, Va.\ The governor's request for more troopers was tied up in the legislative debate over additional highway funding. The State Patrol is financed largely from gas taxes, which also are used for highway construction.\ Some legislators, mainly from rural areas, want additional highway construction dollars. They argued that additional troopers would eat into available highway money, so they linked the governor's request for troopers to an increase in the gas tax.\ The gas-tax increase passed in the Senate, but ran out of fuel in the House, which doomed the governor's attempt to get more troopers this year.\ Minnesota's new speed limits\ What's affected? Outstate interstates and divided highways. Perhaps some metro freeways depending on safety studies.\ When? July 1.\ Why now? In 1995, Congress gave states the right to set their own speed limits. Gov. Arne Carlson prevented an increase from taking effect last year.\ What about the speeding cushion? 55-mph highways that go to 65 mph no longer will offer the 10-mph margin that keeps tickets off your driving record.\History of Minnesota speed limits\1942-45 35 mph Wartime fuel and rubber conservation.\Congress lets states raise rural interstate speeds.\1997 70/65/55 Speeds raised on rural interstates (70 mph) and divided highways (65 mph) two years after Congress gives states control.\Source: Minnesota Department of Transportation Star Tribune graphic"
193,"Gov. Mark Dayton isn't exactly known for his riveting speeches.\Even with the unusual setting of his sixth State of the State address Wednesday evening, which was held at the McNamara Alumni Center on the University of Minnesota campus -- the first time it's been held outside the Capitol in years -- there was little new or noteworthy about the whole affair.\Instead, the 41-minute speech was vintage Dayton: loaded with rankings, numbers, budgeting jargon, a handful of self-deprecating jokes (""when I taught in New York City -- a few years ago,"" said the 69-year-old governor, who last taught in 1971) and an overall positive message about the state of the ""North.""\""When I took office five years ago, I pledged 'A Better Minnesota,'"" the two-term Democrat said. ""There is no doubt in my mind that our state is better today than it was back then.""\But what the speech lacked in pizzazz it made up for in its collegial tone, which members in both houses of the Legislature agreed was a nice break from the partisan rancor that's taken over the year in politics. ""It's nice to see someone who actually takes the job of governing seriously these days, compared to what's going on at the presidential level,"" DFL House Minority Leader Paul Thissen said after the speech.\Even Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt, one of Dayton's chief political opponents, agreed: ""There have been some forums recently where words have gotten a little sharp and has given me some reason to be a little bit nervous about how we are going to get through this session, but it was nice to hear the governor set a tone [good] tonight.""\In the course of the 5,386-word speech, the governor also managed to lay out his approach for the 10-week session, in which he must find agreement with a divided Legislature in a high-stakes election year. Here are the major takeaways from the address, which offer an outline of his priorities for the session:\Dayton wants a lead role when it comes to pushing the state to address racial disparities.\The first issue Dayton addressed in his speech, and the one to which he devoted the most time, was widening racial economic disparities in the state. It's not a new topic for the governor, but it was clear that events in recent weeks and months were weighing on him. One of his guests at the speech was Asma Jama, who was assaulted late last year for not speaking English in an Applebee's in Coon Rapids. A woman smashed a glass beer mug across Jama's face, requiring her to get 17 stitches. Dayton also visited a vandalized mosque two weeks ago, calling it ""one of the most most profoundly painful site visits of my career.""\""This despicable act of bigotry was even worse than others,"" Dayton said. ""It desecrated a place of worship.""\He cited efforts in his administration to double the percentage of minorities working in state government by the time he leaves office. He also plans to unveil a ""significant initiative"" in his supplemental budget next week to tackle the widening gap in income between black and white Minnesotans. ""We cannot resolve these disparities in one legislative session, but we must begin now.""\He's going to be cautious about spending.\For the 2016 session, Dayton said his No. 1 priority is not a specific policy proposal, but ""to protect the fiscal integrity of our state government."" His entire speech was loaded with warnings for legislators and special-interest groups eyeing the state's $900 million surplus. That number is down 25 percent from November, when state economists were predicting a $1.2 billion budget surplus. In 2018 and 2019, the projected surplus is down from $2 billion to $1.2 billion, he said. At an annual meeting of governors from across the nation two weeks ago, he added, prominent economists predicted the strong likelihood of a national recession by 2018.\Dayton knows about recessions: When he first took office in 2011, the state was facing a $6 billion budget deficit.\""I will not leave that kind of fiscal disaster to my successor or the people of Minnesota,"" he said. Now, that doesn't mean Dayton won't propose some new spending in his supplemental budget next week, he said, but that does mean he's soured on the idea of ongoing tax cuts. That's setting him up for a clash with Republicans, who are promising a ""robust"" tax-cut proposal.\He wants the Legislature figure out a fix for transportation funding.\Not once during the speech did Dayton utter the words ""gas tax."" Last year, he said those two words a lot. In fact, an increase in the wholesale sales tax on gasoline was the cornerstone of his push for a 10-year transportation funding package for roads, bridges and transit, but it was rejected by anti-tax-increase Republicans in control of the state House. This year, Dayton wants the Legislature to figure it out. ""I made my proposal over a year ago,"" Dayton said. ""Many people didn't like mine.""\After the speech, Republicans said they were happy the governor didn't talk about the gas tax, but that doesn't mean Dayton isn't going to push for transportation funding this year.\""I'm waiting for an alternative. I'm willing to be flexible, but I will also insist on a real solution,"" Dayton added. ""No smoke and mirrors. No double-counting existing revenues. No counting nonexistent revenues. This is about construction projects, not campaign posters. And it's too urgent to be left for another year.""\His concerns about Minnesota's environment go beyond water.\Dayton has spent a lot of time talking about his concerns about the quality of the state's lakes, streams and drinking water. Just last month he held a two-day summit in St. Paul focused exclusively on water issues. He wants to spend $220 million this year to help small cities maintain clean water and sewer systems.\But his speech went well beyond water, looking at broader environmental concerns. This session, expect Dayton and Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to push for more clean-energy jobs.\""From kids concerned that pond hockey doesn't start until January to farmers trying to predict growing seasons to folks wondering why this year's March blizzards have turned into 60-degree days, many thousands of Minnesotans have expressed their concerns about the growing impacts of climate change,"" Dayton said. ""It's clear that we need to do more to protect Minnesota's climate.""\Credit: Briana Bierschbach"
194,"Gov. Mark Dayton has a 30-year reputation as a government boss who asks a lot of his employees, and generally gets it. Still, I doubt he's ever asked as much as he's asking of Transportation Commissioner Charles Zelle this summer.\Then again, I wonder if any governor has had a transportation chief better suited to the politically charged assignment Zelle has been handed: Go sell a multiyear batch of transportation tax increases to Minnesotans, with special focus on -- gulp -- the state's leading business organizations.\Those would be the very organizations that are starting to amass a multimillion-dollar war chest to unseat Dayton in the 2014 election, mostly because they don't like the governor's willingness to raise taxes.\They're also the very organizations in which Zelle was a transportation policy leader for years, until he threw in with the Dayton administration six months ago. As the longtime president and CEO of Jefferson Lines bus company, Zelle was chair of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce and cochair of the Itasca Project Transportation Initiative. He's still listed as a member of the state Chamber of Commerce board of directors.\That means that on June 13, when Zelle walked into the state Chamber policy board's inner sanctum, he was a familiar figure. Whether he was received as an old friend or a new enemy -- or both -- is hard to discern (especially since journalists were not invited). Chamber staffer Kate Johansen would only say afterward that the big business group's thinking about state transportation needs is ""in process.""\""There's interest but hesitation"" in what Zelle was selling that day, Johansen said. As for Zelle, ""he's been a wonderful chamber member,"" she said. But the state's business leaders ""want the governor to talk to them. They want to see a plan.""\The Dayton transportation plan has this much in common with business thinking: It's ""in process."" Zelle isn't out selling a specific blend of taxes and fees -- not yet. But as he contemplates a rigorous summer and fall schedule of appearances around the state, he intends to formulate that plan based on what he hears, he allowed in a recent conversation.\Zelle uses the words ""comprehensive,"" ""statewide"" and ""competitive"" to describe what's coming. ""World-class"" slips in, too. I take that as a clue that he's not thinking about just a few more cents on the gas gallon, or a fraction on the metro sales tax, or a few high-tech toll roads or wheelage fees or license tab hikes. The Dayton/Zelle plan may well contain all of the above and more.\He also isn't ready to say when it's coming. Dayton has been saying since February that he would like to devote the 2014 legislative session to government reform, including repeal of outdated statutes and streamlining of regulation. He calls it ""the Unsession.""\Throw a big controversial transportation tax proposal onto the agenda, and the Unsession would become the Transpo Session in short order. It won't be a replay of 2007-08, the last time transportation dominated state politics. That spell included the tragedy of a bridge collapse and the political drama of a veto override in which six Republican legislators crossed a Republican governor's gauntlet and voted for a package that included a 7.5-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase.\But even without a veto in the plot, a 2014 Transpo Session would be fraught with tension as swing-seat House DFLers (the Senate isn't on the 2014 ballot) struggle to discern what their constituents dislike more, deteriorating mobility or higher prices at the pump.\The nervousness that tends to be epidemic at the Capitol in election-year sessions will augur for delaying the whole messy matter until 2015. But delay would carry its own risky downside. Antitax Republicans could wind up back in charge of the House and/or the governor's office in 2015, postponing any new transportation funding infusion indefinitely.\It's up to Zelle to explain to Minnesotans -- and especially to the business leaders who are planning to write big checks to Republican candidates -- why that would be a problem.\He'll undoubtedly draw on the findings of a yearlong task force on which he was one of 18 members (five of them business representatives), the Transportation Finance Advisory Committee. It reported in December that Minnesota ""cannot preserve the existing quality and performance of the state's transportation systems under current investment levels and current infrastructure replacement lifecycles.""\The state has three options, it said: Do nothing and watch both mobility and the economy deteriorate, come up with an additional $21 billion over the next 20 years to preserve the status quo in service quality, or aim higher with investments that would spur economic growth. The report said doing that right would take $50 billion to $55 billion -- but Zelle says it would produce a return on that investment many times over.\For example, he said, building out the envisioned rail/bus/bike transit system in the metro area means ""not just convenience, but a way to attract and retain employees, attract and retain businesses, and improve the disparities we have in incomes. This makes a whole lot of sense.\""We haven't made as good a case for the larger statewide return on transportation investment, the societal gain. We need to do that.""\When Zelle invokes return on investment, he's speaking a language business folk understand. He also uses their lingo when he acknowledges that more transparency and accountability at the Minnesota Department of Transportation would help sell a new investment package.

195," The Twin Cities area is witnessing a new philosophy in the leadership of its bus system.\ The Independent-Republican majority that has dominated the Metropolitan Transit Commission's board of directors for a year is working with its new chief administrator, Tom Sather, to make public bus service operate more like a cost-conscious business.\ Having proved that the MTC could accomplish the goal of gaining bus ridership (up 5 percent in May and 2 percent in June from a year ago), Sather and the board are shifting from a ridership-at-any-cost philosophy to one that asks riders to pay a greater share of the cost of providing service.\ To move toward that balance, the board has proposed raising fares substantially in November so that by next year riders will pay 35 percent of the cost of regular route service. This year, fares will cover between 30 and 33 percent of the cost. The rest is paid by state and federal money and taxpayers in the Twin Cities area.\ The board contends that fares have been kept artificially low to promote ridership, and it is proposing for the first time that they be raised automatically by small amounts every year or two to keep up with costs.\ The focus on higher fares is an effort to put the MTC on better financial footing, after the board decided to use $700,000 from its emergency fund to avoid setting back its ridership gains this year with a fare increase, said Board Member Christine Dean of Edina.\ ""I see it as move to operate the organization in a responsible manner, not only for our riders but for the taxpayers,"" she said.\ Although the MTC estimates that 7 percent of its riders could walk away because of the fare increase, state Rep. Tom Workman, IR-Chanhassen, a member of the House Transportation and Transit Committee, said he believes that taxpayers will appreciate the MTC's new direction.\ ""Voters would say that running it like a business makes a little more sense in these frugal times,"" Workman said. ""Given the light in which all politicians are operating, whether elected or appointed, to have an open-ended pit into which we are going to pour money is not acceptable anywhere, let alone in transit.""\ In his first year in the Legislature last session, Workman said, he found little inclination on the part of legislators to boost the $10 million state subsidy for the MTC.\ ""There's more and more discussion about the value we're getting out of the system,"" he said. With a $120 million operating budget, ""it may have swung from more riders at any cost to let's take a look here under the hood and see what we are getting for our money,"" he said.\ The IR board members - Dean, Allyson Hartle of St. Paul and Chairman Bob Mairs of St. Paul - came to the MTC with concerns about waste and inefficiency. In the seven months that Sather has been on the job, they have encouraged him to redesign the agency, using his background in private business.\ Sather is working, for instance, to reduce the bus parts inventory, to free $4 million tied up in spare parts, including $500,000 in parts for buses the MTC no longer owns. He is also trying to establish standards of performance for the mechanics who maintain the buses.\ The new approach has its detractors.\ The board's desire to hire Sather without going through a national search for candidates was criticized, especially after he was offered $92,500 a year, up from his predecessor's $78,000. The board reasoned that it had to compete with the private sector, but even Gov. Arne Carlson complained that it was excessive and sent a bad message about government austerity.\ And the fare increase isn't expected to be popular.\ The proposed increased fare would bring in $44 million of the MTC's estimated $131 million operating budget in 1994, up from $36.3 million brought in by fares for its $120 million budget this year.\ MTC officials say the increase is necessary to meet its mandate that it take in at least 35 percent of its operating money from fares, to prevent service cuts and to raise money for service improvements.\ Specifically, the agency needs more money to pay for a new labor contract with the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents drivers, mechanics and other employees; hire more people to answer phones in the public information center, and hire more people to keep buses running, Sather said.\ The Regional Transit Board (RTB), which sets transit policy for the Twin Cities area, will have the final say on the MTC proposal. Many members of the RTB, which also has an IR chairman and majority, agree that there is no choice but to raise fares if they are to keep the agency out of the red. But whether the RTB will endorse the entire MTC proposal, especially an increase that will affect the elderly, remains to be seen.\ Because a fare increase is almost certain to reduce ridership, key legislators oppose it. They acknowledge that the governor and the Legislature have not provided the agency with enough money to expand service and keep fares low, but they want the ridership increase protected.\ ""I don't see the fiscal responsibility in making it more difficult for the average person to ride the bus,"" said Rep. Charlie Weaver, IR-Anoka. ""Public transit is not only a way to move people but also a way to keep roads clear for business and protect our environment.""\ With the passage of President Clinton's energy tax, ""we're going to see a gas tax increase. If it's going to be more expensive at the pumps it seems to me that a lot of Minnesotans might take another look at riding the bus,"" Weaver said.\ ""But if the first thing they see is the gas tax going up and the next thing they see is fares going up, where's the incentive to think of public transit?""\ Some say it's time to reexamine the requirement that fares bring in 35 percent of operating revenues. ""To say you have to raise fares to meet the 35 percent fare recovery is plain foolishness,"" said Sen. Phil Riveness, DFL-Bloomington.\ But Rep. Sidney Pauly, IR-Eden Prairie, said that unless state leaders are willing to pump more money into subsidizing the bus system, she sees no alternative to raising fares to cover costs: ""I can't quarrel with 35 percent. . . . It's our guarantee against a certain amount of waste.""\Where the MTC gets its money\Sources of operating funds (1993)\state, $55 million from Twin Cities property taxes)\Other revenue sources 1.8% ($2,163,000)\Source: Metropolitan Transit Commission Star Tribune Graphic / Jane Friedmann"
196,"KENILWORTH CORRIDOR\I live in north Minneapolis and for years have loved the solitude and the ""Up North"" feeling of biking along the Kenilworth corridor -- four short miles from Ole Olson Park, the trail begins and is walked, biked and enjoyed by people from all over the city.\I have seen deer on several occasions, as well as fox and other wildlife. Riding along, I have heard nothing but birds. A rare solace in a noisy city.\The proposed destruction of this beautiful corridor will include much wildlife as well as all the trees (""Light-rail toll: 1,000 trees on trail,"" April 22). To replace this by noise-polluting trains is not progress -- find another avenue.\Susan Vikse, Minneapolis\• • •\I walk and bike in the Kenilworth corridor regularly, but I wouldn't call this area ""sacred,"" as one person quoted in the April 22 article did. It's an active rail corridor, part of which was acquired by the Hennepin County Regional Railroad Authority decades ago for the explicit purpose of siting a light-rail line. Since then, many trees have sprouted, including ash and buckthorn.\What is sacred is the health of the planet we live on. Building low-carbon infrastructure like rail transit is an important part of the fight against global warming, Of course it's sad that this impacts an area we care about. One response might be to adopt and water a few of the thousands of new plantings, so that future generations will inherit a new urban forest and a cooler world.\Richard Adair, Minneapolis\• • •\Will the weeping and wailing over the Southwest light-rail project never end?\We don't want to see it!\We don't want to hear it!\It's too close to this or maybe to that!\Now it's the ""sacred ground"" of the existing trail, and its trees and bushes that should be the reason to halt a project that will, like its fellow lines, likely prove to be an incredibly popular way to get around the Twin Cities area.\Two things that should be remembered.\First, although I haven't researched it, I would imagine that there were also objections from those who didn't want the houses now owned by those who don't want their views sullied, or the ""sacred"" trail built in the first place.\Second, if we hadn't spent seemingly endless years arguing over issues that in a more realistic society would have been easily settled, the entire project might now be finished -- its riders happily using the service, neighbors adjusted to its presence and the replacement trail's new trees and shrubbery well on their way to full-grown.\Harold Onstad, Plymouth\DENSITY IN MINNEAPOLIS\Has it occurred to the city that this, too, is environmentally intensive?\It was remarkable to hear Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey say, regarding climate change and the environment in his State of the City address: ""At the local level, we don't have the luxury of ignoring science."" (As reported in the April 19 article.) Unfortunately, the city of Minneapolis has denied the need for any environmental study of the 2040 Comprehensive Plan and its likely cumulative effects. The plan will intensify land use in virtually every square inch of the city.\A blanket upzoning on this scale has never been attempted anywhere in North America and will, if it receives final approval, affect over 49% of the land in Minneapolis. Any responsible plan for greater density must anticipate and identify ways to mitigate unintended harm to already fragile urban water, air and earth resources, as well as planning for climate-change resilience. The only way to do this is through meaningful scientific study, which the city has refused to do. This is why Smart Growth Minneapolis and its co-plaintiffs are suing the city: because at the local level we really don't have the luxury of ignoring science.\Rebecca Arons, Minneapolis\PAYING FOR ROADS\Suburbs are not making good use of the money taxpayers are spending\Ten years ago, the Metropolitan Council told suburbs that they should plan new housing developments next to or near existing interstates or major highways in order to reduce unnecessary new road construction. The suburbs ignored the council's suggestions.\The city of Lakeville is a prime example. Interstate 35 is on the west side of the city, and new home construction is on the east side. All the roads have had to be upgraded to four-lane highways in order to accommodate the traffic heading to the interstate. Just stupid.\Lakeville established an industrial park five miles off Interstate 35. Then built a two-lane road to service it. Today there is so much traffic on the new road that it needs to be upgraded to four lanes. Just think of the traffic hazards the city's decisions have created for the motoring public.\Today, the Legislature is considering a proposal by Gov. Tim Walz to raise the gas tax by 20 cents a gallon to pay for road improvements. What this really would do is tax the motoring public to pay for the stupid decisions suburbs such as Lakeville have made. These suburbs need to pay for their own new road construction. No new gas tax.\Mark Lene, Elko New Market\• • •\I read with interest Minnesota Department of Transportation Commissioner Margaret Anderson Kelliher's April 17 commentary, ""Our goal: Funding sufficient for quality roads and bridges."" She stated that Minnesota ""spends less on transportation than most other states. We've tried the 'do more with less' approach and it isn't working. … The need [for more funding] is real, urgent and serious.""\Shortly thereafter, while browsing the daily news on the MSN website, I ran across an article headlined ""States that are falling apart"" (tinyurl.com/msn-apart). The website 24/7 Wall St. had created an index using the share of bridges, roads and dams that are in a state of disrepair or potentially hazardous, to identify the states with the best and worst infrastructure. States were ranked on infrastructure from best (No. 50) to worst (No. 1).\Based on Kelliher's article, I fully expected to see Minnesota ranked toward the bottom. To my surprise (tinyurl.com/msn-mnrank), it was 48th (third best). Roads in poor condition: 4.1% (20th lowest). Deficient bridges: 5.3% (11th lowest). Dams at high hazard risk: 5.1% (fifth lowest). State highway spending per driver: $555 (18th highest).\The article stated that ""[i]n the Donald Trump era, the United States appears to be more politically divided than it has been in decades. Still, there are matters of public policy that most Americans can agree on -- chief among them is investment in infrastructure."" That would include me. And according to a recent nonpartisan Gallup poll, 3 out of 4 Americans support the president's plan of spending more federal (not just state) money on infrastructure. The president proposed a $1 trillion plan to improve aging roads, bridges and tunnels across the country. While funding the project has proved to be a political challenge, broad public support for the plan is rooted in necessity.\Thomas B. Johnson, Walker, Minn.\AUNTS AND UNCLES\Hmmm …\I couldn't help but notice an April 21 letter writer's response to the April 17 article about the value of ""aunties"" and the author's defense of the role of uncles. I see his point. However, I couldn't help noting his narrative: ""This is how men are marginalized in the lives of children -- by being ignored or excluded, by being assumed incompetent or disinterested, and by being perceived as a liability rather than a resource."" Replace the word ""men"" with ""women,"" and this describes how women have been treated in general throughout the ages. Just sayin'.\Carol A. Henderson, Minneapolis"
197,"Imagine this scenario: Under the blazing June sun, all 201 Minnesota legislators gather and sit down in folding chairs under a giant tent on the front lawn of the State Capitol. There they would debate how much money should be spent over the next two years on education, and maybe even transportation and tax cuts.\It sounds like a cruel prank, but it was a very real suggestion from a frustrated DFL Gov. Mark Dayton over the weekend, as he publicly promised for the second time in two days to veto a legislative education budget. The biggest sticking point is universal pre-kindergarten education: Lawmakers don't fund the program in their education budget bill, but Dayton says it's his top priority. It's not uncommon for governors to veto bills and call lawmakers back for a special session, but this time around, the 109-year-old Capitol is in the midst of a multiyear restoration project, and the desks are coming out of the House chambers for construction immediately after lawmakers adjourn Monday night.\""It would have to be a nice day,"" Dayton said of a potential outdoors special session. ""They could do a roll call vote as we still do in the U.S. Senate.""\It's a messy potential solution to a messy end of session, wherein divided government has led to pretty much nobody being happy. Instead of creating harmony, a nearly $2 billion budget surplus only widened divisions among the newly Republican-controlled House, Democrats in control of the Senate and the executive branch. Republicans wanted $2 billion in tax cuts; Democrats wanted a gas-tax increase to pay for a decade-worth of transportation fixes; Dayton wanted universal pre-kindergarten education for 4-year-olds in every school district across the state.\In the end, lawmakers cobbled together a fairly status-quo budget in round-the-clock hearings over the weekend, leaving $1 billion of the surplus unspent to deal with tax cuts and transportation later. And if Dayton has his way, those issues -- plus education -- might be dealt with under a tent this summer.\Legislators were up into the early hours of Monday morning passing a flurry of budget bills, a process that should continue throughout the day. And while everything is fluid until the clock strikes midnight, when the Legislature is constitutionally required to adjourn, here's where some of the top issues of the session stand right now:\Education\By Monday afternoon, both the Senate and House had pass an education budget bill that adds $400 million in order to increase the per-pupil funding formula 1.5 percent in 2016 and 2 percent in 2017. The bill also puts $30 million into the state's School Readiness program, and another $30 million into Early Learning Scholarships. The House passed the bill on a 71-59 early Monday morning, and the Senate passed it 52-14 several hours later.\But it doesn't go far enough for Dayton, who wants $150 million more added on to the target, much of that going to his proposal for voluntary, half-day pre-kindergarten education. He made that clear all weekend, promising to veto the bill on arrival and set out on a statewide tour to build support for his plan. If Dayton vetoes the bill, that could put in danger funding for the Minnesota Department of Education and its 400 employees, who process payments to school districts.\""If we go into those disaster modes, it's the fault of the Republicans in the Minnesota House of Representatives entirely. It's entirely their fault,"" Dayton said. ""I said very clearly, you know I'm governor, they want to take the last $1 billion and leave it on the bottom line and walk away and ignore my number one priority? That's not the way this system works.""\House Speaker Kurt Daudt said the governor should have spent more time this session building support for pre-kindergarten education among legislators and school boards. The bill didn't pass out of either chamber.\""It's his responsibility to build the ground support and the groundswell of support in the Legislature,"" Daudt said. ""I certainly asked the governor to reconsider and not veto the education bill that is going to put so much more new money into our classrooms and really in a way that we know school districts prefer. This is what they are asking for, money on the formula.""\Tax cuts\What tax cuts? It was one of the main points of debate this session after Republicans proposed a $2 billion package of tax cuts, but it was also one of the first casualties of the impasse, getting wrapped up with transportation into a to-do list for a potential upcoming special session or next session. So far, Daudt and Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk have left about $1 billion on the bottom line to deal with both issues, though it's unclear if and how they would split that up in some kind of global deal.\Transportation\In the end, Republicans and Democrats agreed to a so-called ""lights on"" transportation funding bill, meaning it kept the wheels turning on the state's current system. Some lawmakers have quibbled with that description, however, noting that the final bill did include some new money, including $12.5 million to help cities with fewer than 5,000 people with their roads. The big lingering question: Can Democrats get Republicans to agree to a gas-tax hike in a special session or next year, when all 201 lawmakers are on the ballot?\Health care\Another one of the session's biggest fights -- whether to cut $1 billion from the health and human services budget -- ended anti-climactically in a late-night conference committee. Republicans were pushing to eliminate MinnesotaCare, a subsidized health care program for 90,000 working, low-income Minnesotans. Democrats pushed back all session, and in the final bill, a task force was set up to look into the future of the program. Some users of the MinnesotaCare, however, will see their health care costs go up after a $65 million shortfall in the program was shifted to enrollees through premium and cost-sharing increases. There were also few substantive changes made to MNsure, the state's health insurance exchange, and a call for hundreds of millions in savings by cutting down on waste and fraud in the system amounted to only $25 million in the next biennium. Republicans did get one big win in the bill: $138 million directed toward the state's nursing homes.\Higher education\College students across Minnesota: Prepare for tuition increases. Dayton and legislative leaders were able to agree on spending $166 million more on higher education over the next two years, but that amount is not enough to freeze tuition at either the University of Minnesota or in the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) system. The University of Minnesota gets about $53 million in the bill, including $30 million to boost research teams at the medical school. MnSCU gets $100 million in the bill to put toward keeping tuition costs down.\Water quality, environment\Dayton said he has some concerns about provisions passed in the agriculture and environmental budget, but he wouldn't go into detail on Sunday. Environmental groups are worried about a proposal to abolish the Citizens' Board of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The board has been around since 1967 and makes decisions on everything from permitting to regulations, and both chambers showed interest in changing the way the group operates this session. However, one of Dayton's top priorities all session -- a proposal to create buffers between the state's waterways and farmland -- did end in a compromise late Monday morning. Lawmakers put $22 million into the Legacy funding bill for buffers between farmland and public waterways, a compromise that environmental groups say is better than an eariler version, but still falls far short of what Dayton originally wanted.\Bonding\A very last-minute $100 million bill is heading to the House floor and it's unclear if it will pass. Bonding bills need a three-fifths majority to pass, meaning Republicans need to round up at least 81 votes in the House. The bill that passed out of the Ways and Means committee late Saturday night spends money to deal with avian flu, repay communities affected by last year's floods and puts nearly $20 million in to local road and bridge projects. The biggest ticket items are more than $30 million to pay for security upgrades and unexpected expenses for the state Capitol building renovation project. Dayton pitched an $850 million bonding bill this session, supported by many others in his party. In the other chamber, Senate Democrats say at least a $200 million bonding bill is needed this session. Stay tuned.\Courts and public safety\Lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill to spend $111 million more on the courts, prisons and public safety over the next two years, but the compromise deal made members of both parties unhappy. A push to restore voting rights for ex-felons on probation or parole fell on the floor in negotiations, after it became clear House Republicans wouldn't support the measure, DFL Sen. Ron Latz said. While that measure went away, the bill includes a priority for Republicans; it legalized firearm suppressors, also known as silencers. Earlier this year, Dayton said he would veto that measure.\Lawmakers also struck a deal on the retention of data collected by law enforcement via license plate readers (LPRs). The devices track and store the movements of vehicles to try and catch criminals, but many of those vehicles belong to innocent citizens. The deal would destroy LPR data after 60 days unless it's part of an ongoing investigation. Some advocates wanted no retention of the data at all, while an earlier Senate bill allowed for 90-day retention. No deal was reached on what to do with the data collected in body cameras worn by law enforcement.\Credit: Briana Bierschbach"
198," The United States must soon fund the World Bank unit that makes loans to the poorest of African and Asian nations or lose credibility and the cooperation of Japan and Europe, the bank's president said Wednesday.\ ""The U.S. would lose influence and (demonstrate) that its only interest is Latin America and Eastern Europe,"" said Barber Conable after an address to Minnesota Meeting, a policy forum. ""In the fight against poverty, the International Development Association (IDA) plays a crucial role. It's the largest single source of development assistance.""\ Conable said that if the Bush administration and Congress don't produce by November, IDA-financing nations might cancel a meeting in Japan. That might prompt Japan and Europe to pull out.\ Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan to reduce the debt of developing nations essentially forced other governments and U.S. banks to swallow loses on billions of dollars in loans, primarily in Latin American and Eastern Europe. Now the United States must accept its share of IDA funding, said Conable, a former Republican member of Congress from New York.\ Under the three-year plan beginning in 1990, the United States would advance more than $4 billion of the $14.5 billion in IDA credits over three years.\ ""Hundreds of millions of people living in unacceptable poverty must not be let down,"" Conable said.\ The World Bank, which also borrows capital in world markets, has been criticized for loans that enriched government officials and their cronies instead of helping the poor and for backing projects that harm the environment.\ Conable said the bank has enhanced economic and social progress in developing nations by getting basic programs closer to people.\ ""I would not pretend that we don't make mistakes from time to time,"" he said ""But clearly we are a positive force in a world that has a lot of negative forces bearing on the poor. Clearly, we must continue to try. We must . . . insist that borrowing countries establish priorities that benefit the poor.""\ Conable has criticized U.S. officials who try to restrict aid if it includes funds for family planning. Experts believe that over-population in poor countries stretches resources and exacerbates poverty.\ ""The Bank seeks to raise the productivity of the poor and assure their access to such necessities as safe water and waste-disposal facilities, health care, family-planning assistance, nutrition, education and housing, through lending for agriculture and rural development, small-scale enterprises and urban development,"" said Conable, who has headed the Bank since 1986.\ Conable chafes over pollution issues, noting that the United States is by far the most energy-consumptive and polluting nation in the world.\ ""There are a lot of senators who are concerned about the Amazon rain forest but wouldn't vote for a three-cent gas tax to encourage conservation,"" he said. ""The U.S. produces five tons of carbon dioxide for every man, woman and child in the country. The world average is under one ton.\ ""Unless and until the industrialized world is prepared to accept and act upon its own environmental shortcomings, it will be difficult to persuade developing nations that there is such a thing as a collective global responsibility for our planet's health.""\ Nevertheless, Conable said, the Third World and the World Bank appreciate environmental considerations. For example, the Brazilian government has stopped incentives for ranchers to deforest the jungle, he said.\ ""A third of all our projects, half of our energy projects and 60 percent of our agricultural projects last fiscal year contained specific environmental components,"" he said. ""While cleaning up the environment helps improve the quality of life, sweeping away the pollution of poverty is a much broader task.\ ""Hubert Humphrey wrote that, `Ancient adversaries of mankind - poverty, hunger, disease and ignorance - are the allies of tyranny.""\ The World Bank committed $21 billion in 76 countries in fiscal 1989. Its International Finance Corp., which works to strengthen private sectors of developing countries, invested about $1.3 billion in 38 countries, which spurred an additional $8.45 billion in development from private sources.\ ""Growth is the best antidote for poverty in the world,"" Conable said. ""But you can have growth that bypasses the poor. The most important thing is the development policy of the country itself."""
199," This is the first in a series of articles on the records of the two leading presidential candidates.\ Next Sunday: An examination of the Bush presidency.\ .\ In April 1985, just three months after becoming a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, John Kerry flew to Nicaragua on a fact-finding mission. The specter of a U.S. foreign policy misadventure was once again on his mind.\ Tempered by his own experiences in Vietnam, Kerry had developed a deep mistrust of government. It was a preoccupation that would shape his 20-year Senate career, turning him into a high-profile investigator and watchdog, rather than someone focused on bringing home big projects or passing major legislation bearing his name.\ ""He has been more important as an investigator than a legislator,"" said David Mayhew, professor of political science at Yale. ""He's not a major legislator - nothing really jumps out.""\ Republicans see an undistinguished Senate record that produced a lot of showmanship but few Kerry bills of any note. The Senate has passed 59 bills and resolutions that carry his name, 11 of which became law.\ ""I'd like to say give me five significant pieces of legislation,"" said Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., co-chairman of President Bush's Minnesota campaign. ""But I'll lower the ante. Give me two. Give me one.""\ But Kerry's Democratic allies say that's a poor measure of his legislative accomplishments. They describe him as a foreign-policy expert who used his perch in the Senate to investigate U.S.-backed contra rebels in Nicaragua, government drug trafficking in Panama and missing U.S. servicemen and POWs in Vietnam.\ ""It's a pretty good legacy,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.\ Harkin, a fellow Vietnam veteran who accompanied Kerry on the 1985 trip to Nicaragua, said that when Kerry tackles a subject ""he wants to know all about it. Before he comes to a conclusion, he wants all the data and all the facts.""\ To his critics, Kerry's propensity for methodical investigation is a sign of indecisiveness or political expediency. To them, Kerry the investigator is just Kerry the equivocator. They also see him as a Vietnam veteran who came home to lead protests against the war, and then, as a senator, was willing to compromise America's national security.\ No issue illustrates that perception better than his votes last year for and against an additional $87 billion to fund the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. He voted for the Democratic version, which would have raised the money by rolling back tax cuts for the wealthy; he voted against the Republican plan which added the money to the budget deficit.\ War hawks have cited Kerry's votes opposing a number of defense programs, from the early versions of the B-2 bomber to the Strategic Defense Initiative (""Star Wars""). In fact, in his first speech on the Senate floor, Kerry spoke out against the MX missile. Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., speaking at the Republican National Convention, labeled him ""more wrong, more weak and more wobbly than any other national figure.""\ To Democrats, Kerry has taken fiscally prudent stands against bloated Pentagon programs that even Miller and leading Republicans such as Vice President Dick Cheney sometimes opposed. They see him as a champion of the environment, education and health care.\ .\ 'The bad guys'\ Kerry turned 41 a month after he was elected to the Senate in 1984 and immediately got a seat on the Foreign Relations Committee.\ His visit to Nicaragua, three months later, came on the eve of President Ronald Reagan's request to Congress to aid the anti- Marxist contras. The trip was a media boon for Kerry, who saw the contras as little more than CIA-backed mercenaries.\ But Kerry's effort to block U.S. aid to the contras faltered when, soon after his trip, Nicaragua's Marxist Sandinista leader, Daniel Ortega, flew to Moscow to collect a $200 million check from the Soviets. Congress then approved Reagan's request for nonmilitary funding for the rebel contras in an effort to counter the Soviet influence.\ The Ortega flap, and Kerry's 85 percent voting record from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, positioned him immediately on the Senate's political left.\ But while burnishing his liberal credentials, Kerry also surprised his allies in 1985 by signing on early to the Gramm- Rudman deficit-reduction package, which set limits on government borrowing, forcing Congress to either cut programs or raise taxes - and which passed by wide bipartisan margins.\ A year later, forging an unusual alliance with then-Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Kerry helped persuade the Foreign Relations Committee to investigate the contras and their alleged drug connections in Central America. The probe eventually exposed the Iran-contra scandal, the Reagan administration's secret scheme to trade arms for hostages held by pro-Iranian terrorists in Lebanon and use the proceeds to fund the contras. One of the scheme's main protagonists, Oliver North, would make a national name for himself in the unfolding scandal. So would Kerry.\ Later, taking charge of a Senate panel on terrorism, narcotics and international operations, Kerry would launch inquiries into alleged drug trafficking by Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and alleged banking irregularities by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which had strong insider ties to some powerful Washington Democrats, including former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford.\ ""He went after powerful people at a time when it was unpopular,"" said Joseph Peschek, professor of political science at Hamline University. ""We haven't heard as much about that. We've heard a lot about Vietnam.""\ Peschek said that Kerry's investigations, combined with his background as a Massachusetts prosecutor, should help him make the case that he's tough enough to be president and that he ""knows how to stand up to the bad guys, whether it's crooks in the streets or crooks in the suites.""\ One factor behind Kerry's dearth of marquee bills is his absence from formal Senate leadership posts.\ Mayhew, the Yale professor, said it's easier for committee chairs to pass their bills, but Kerry is not heading any committees: ""He doesn't rank very high on committees for somebody who's been there for 20 years; I don't know why.""\ Senate historian Don Ritchie said it's easy to criticize members of Congress for not passing bills because so few of them have bills passed with their names attached to them.\ ""You can make that charge against most of the members of Congress right now.""\ But Ritchie noted that many members of Congress have elevated their profiles by focusing on investigations: Sen. Harry Truman took on defense contractors before Franklin Roosevelt chose him as his running mate; John Kennedy and Barry Goldwater were relatively obscure junior senators when Congress held televised hearings into the Teamsters Union; and Richard Nixon was only a freshman congressman when he found national fame by going after Alger Hiss.\ .\ 'Last mission'\ After Kerry won his first Senate race in 1984, he developed a reputation in Massachusetts as being aloof and ambitious. His mother once described him as ""a very warm, caring person, despite possibly an outward appearance of being self-centered and ambitious.""\ In his first year in Washington, he voted against President Reagan's positions 73 percent of the time, according to Congressional Quarterly. Many of the votes were against Reagan's proposed weapons systems.\ By the end of his first term in 1990, Kerry had branched out by getting seats on three other committees: Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Commerce, Science, and Transportation; and Small Business.\ Those assignments placed him at the center of financial- interests legislation in Washington at about the same time he was stung by unfavorable press attention for a controversial condo deal in Massachusetts and an old tax-shelter investment in the Cayman Islands.\ Despite that, he easily won reelection and soon faced a high- profile vote. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had sent his army into Kuwait on August 1, 1990. President George H.W. Bush vowed that the Iraqi invasion would ""not stand.""\ Seeing fresh comparisons to Vietnam, Kerry called for sanctions and a diplomatic solution, asking his colleagues if the nation was ready ""for another generation of amputees [and] paraplegics.""\ When Congress voted in January 1991 on a resolution authorizing what would become Operation Desert Storm, Kerry was one of 47 senators who voted against it.\ During Senate debate, Kerry explicitly rejected the argument that voting for a congressional war resolution merely would give the president more leverage in dealing with Saddam. ""This is not a vote about sending a message,"" he said. ""It is a vote about war.""\ Kerry has now adopted the leverage argument to justify his vote to give the second President Bush war powers to invade Iraq in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\ Despite Kerry's criticism of the first Gulf War, he lauded the liberation of Kuwait and faulted Bush for leaving Saddam in power.\ On a subsequent fact-finding trip to the Middle East, Kerry found himself in close quarters with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., an ex- Vietnam POW who had viewed Kerry with distrust. Eventually, the two put aside their animosities and teamed up to try to resolve the ongoing controversy over the fate of more than 2,000 U.S. troops who were unaccounted for in Vietnam.\ Kerry chaired the newly formed Senate Select Committee on POW- MIA Affairs. Working with McCain, the panel won unprecedented cooperation from Vietnamese authorities and eventually concluded that it was highly unlikely that Americans were still being held in Vietnamese prisons.\ Although some POW-MIA advocates accused the committee of suppressing reports of sightings of Americans, the committee's findings were widely accepted. Their findings launched an effort to get President Clinton to lift a trade embargo and normalize relations with Vietnam, which he did in 1995.\ For Kerry, this was something of a career hallmark, and a ""last mission"" to Vietnam.\ .\ Toward the center\ The Clinton era also saw some of Kerry's most conspicuous efforts to inch toward the political center. He once again shocked liberal supporters by giving a speech at Yale questioning affirmative action for racial minorities. Though he insisted he still supported the concept, he blamed racial preferences for keeping Americans ""thinking in racial terms.""\ He supported Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction package of spending cuts and tax hikes, including a 4.3 cent a gallon increase in the federal gas tax.\ It was during that period that Kerry briefly expressed support for a 50 cent a gallon gas-tax increase. Although he later dropped the idea, the proposal became fodder for Bush campaign ads earlier this year.\ But even as Kerry fought deficits, he urged Clinton to put $13.5 billion into a crime bill to get 100,000 new cops on America's streets to combat a wave of drug violence.\ In another move to the center, Kerry provided a critical vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), lifting trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States. Just as controversial with many Democrats, Kerry also supported most- favored trading status for China.\ On the campaign trail, he has been critical of free trade agreements and the exporting of American jobs. To Republicans, this has been one of his many political zigzags.\ On most social legislation, however, he remained consistently on the left.\ He defended Clinton's doomed health-care initiative. He championed an environmental agenda, beginning with acid-rain legislation that he introduced as a freshman senator.\ He opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And he became an outspoken advocate of higher automotive fuel efficiency standards, a cause that is opposed by many union Democrats as well as pro-business Republicans.\ He also was one of 14 senators who voted against the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal marital benefits to same-sex partners and created a federal definition of marriage as the union between a man and a woman.\ In 1996, in a tough reelection battle against Republican Gov. Bill Weld, Kerry made headlines pushing for an increase in the federal minimum wage. Weld attacked him for that, as well as for his past opposition to Republican welfare-reform proposals.\ Kerry blunted those attacks, noting that he had voted for Clinton's sweeping overhaul of the welfare system, which created new work requirements and set lifetime limits on welfare eligibility.\ Kerry also introduced legislation during the campaign to establish a new health-care program for uninsured children. With strong support from his fellow Massachusetts senator, Ted Kennedy, Congress passed the bill.\ Once Bush was elected in 2000, Kerry lined up in support of the new president's first major legislative initiative: the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandated educational testing as a benchmark of school effectiveness. It wouldn't be the last time he would disappoint his liberal friends.\ .\ War on terrorism\ Three days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Kerry joined in the 98-0 Senate vote to give Bush broad powers to strike back at those responsible and any nations that harbored them. That was consistent with his past support for Clinton's cruise missile attacks against Al-Qaida camps in Sudan and Afghanistan.\ Kerry was still a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and had written a book on terrorism (""The New War,"" 1997). He had also taken a seat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where critics accused him of championing spending cuts that weakened U.S. intelligence gathering capabilities.\ For example, he proposed billions of dollars in budget cuts in 1995 to programs he decried as wasteful relics of the Cold War. While Kerry's proposal didn't pass, a different intelligence budget cut proposed by Republicans did.\ After Sept. 11, Kerry came around to supporting the U.S. Patriot Act, which granted greater police powers in tracking terrorists.\ He overcame his philosophical aversion to capital punishment to support the death penalty for terrorists convicted of murdering U.S. citizens.\ He also supported the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and helped broker a deal in the Senate that broke an impasse on legislation to federalize airport screeners.\ Finally, on Oct. 10, 2002, Kerry broke with Kennedy and many of his liberal supporters and voted for a resolution authorizing Bush to use military force against Iraq.\ Harkin, his old ally, also voted for the war resolution. Since then, Harkin has apologized for that vote. Kerry has not.\ But Kerry has said that he meant only to give Bush the leverage he sought to confront Saddam, and that as president he would have assembled a larger international alliance and prepared an exit strategy before going to war.\ Earlier this year, he told voters in New Hampshire: ""If anybody . . . believes that John Kerry would have gone to war the way George Bush did, they shouldn't vote for me.""\ .\ Washington Bureau Correspondent Paul Sand contributed to this report.\ The writers are at kdiaz@mcclatchydc.com and\ .\ KERRY VOTED FOR\ - North American Free Trade Agreement\ - No Child Left Behind Act\ - USA Patriot Act\ - 2002 Iraq war resolution\ - Family and Medical Leave Act\ .\ KERRY VOTED AGAINST\ - 1991 Gulf War resolution\ - Strategic Defense Initiative (""Star Wars"")\ - Defense of Marriage Act\ - Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\ - $87 billion in supplemental military funding for the Iraq war\ .\ KERRY ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE\ ""I will vote against this bill, though I am not for same-sex marriage, because I believe that this debate is fundamentally ugly, and it is fundamentally political, and it is fundamentally flawed."" - Senate speech on the Defense of Marriage Act, Sept. 10, 1996.\ .\ . . .

200,"Special to the Star Tribune\A 2014 book written by local preservationist Robert Roscoe gives a detailed account of how a group of residents in Minneapolis' Seward Neighborhood saved two-block-long Milwaukee Avenue and its historic houses from demolition in the 1970s. While an excellent history of the early years of historic preservation, the book -- and Milwaukee Avenue itself -- has renewed relevance today as cities struggle to maintain their aging infrastructure and extensive road networks.\When Milwaukee Avenue became a ""Planned Residential District"" in the 1970s, the city closed the street to cars, and the homeowners' association took responsibility for the design and maintenance of the common. Walk down that avenue today and you will find a quiet, tree-shaded, pedestrian corridor, lined with front porches and featuring a playground and benches, with shared parking lots for residents and visitors and half the residents without an alley.\You will also see a possible future for many streets in the city.\Most blocks in Minneapolis -- and St. Paul -- have alleys for garages and trash removal, which leaves the streets for visitor parking and extra car storage. That represents a convenience for the property owners on these streets, but it ignores the fact that most municipalities do not have enough money to pay for the maintenance and repair of our roads.\Gasoline taxes, for example, go toward state and federal highways, not local roads. And according to a recent study by the Tax Foundation, fuel taxes and other tolls and user fees pay, on average nationwide, only half of what it costs to build and maintain our road system.\In Minnesota, gas taxes cover only 42 percent of the\cost, placing us in 32nd place in the U.S. Most of the rest of our spending on roads comes from general tax revenues, competing with all of the other demands on public funds. Meanwhile, the new Republican majority in the Minnesota House of Representatives has pledged to invest more in our roads and bridges, although not necessarily increasing the gas tax, according to Majority Leader Kurt Daudt, which means that other areas of state spending will take a hit as a result.\While no one questions that our road infrastructure needs attention, too few have asked: How many roads do we need? Having fewer roads to maintain and repair will obviously make what limited public funds we have for this purpose go a lot further. Which brings us back to Milwaukee Avenue: It represents an alternative to our road-repair dilemma that deserves more attention.\What if other blocks in the city served by alleys did what the residents of Milwaukee Avenue accomplished: forming a homeowners' association, taking over the street in front of their houses, and converting the road to green space, play grounds, bike paths and pedestrian walks, with visitor parking at either end of the block? How many homeowners already have the equipment needed to clear snow, cut grass, and rake leaves in front of their property, and who wouldn't want more space in which children can play and nature can thrive?\Skeptics might ask: Why would homeowners take on this extra responsibility while reducing access to their property by car?\As Milwaukee Avenue shows, the replacement of the street with a greenway has led to a safer and less noisy environment for residents and to a strong sense of community among the homeowners responsible for collectively maintaining the space they share.\But there exist economic incentives as well. A recent study of real estate values across the country shows that residential areas that increase their ""walk score"" see improved housing values, which also aids local governments by increasing property tax revenues, while lowering infrastructure costs.\While many cities have car-free commercial zones, closing residential streets to traffic has occurred mainly in historic districts. If it's such a good idea, why hasn't it spread like wildfire?\Roscoe's book offers one answer as to why this hasn't happened to more residential streets: When it came to turning the public right of way over to Milwaukee Avenue's homeowners' association, he writes, the ""legal steps necessary to establish deed covenants and its related aspects were excruciatingly difficult.""\The legal challenges to street closure remain an issue, but only if the cities want it so. The residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul -- as well as the cities themselves -- would be much better off if we saw Milwaukee Avenue not as an outlier, but as a model of a modern city street.\Thomas Fisher is dean of the College of Design at the University of Minnesota and active in the college's Metropolitan Design Center.\Streetscapes is a column devoted to Minnesota architecture.

201,"Last month, every country came together for the COP24 United Nations Climate Negotiations to finalize the Paris Agreement’s rulebook. Thirty-plus Minnesotans were there observing the process; we learned a great deal. Most observers seemed to agree that the compromises reached were more ambitious than expected. However, they are still not nearly enough to limit global warming to 1.5º C, which is necessary to avoid devastating climate impacts in many areas.\These impacts are detailed in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which identifies necessary targets of 45 percent global CO2 emissions reductions by 2030 relative to 2010, and net-zero by 2050. At COP24, the U.S. teamed with Russia and Saudi Arabia to block language welcoming the IPCC Report. This contributed to the lack of sufficient ambition. They were opposed by developing countries that will suffer the worst impacts, including increased deaths, and losses of entire islands. Developed countries are morally obligated to take action to ensure that climate change does not exacerbate global inequities.\ It’s already happening \This is most certainly not just a problem that will affect distant countries in the distant future. Climate change is already happening in every corner of the world, including Minnesota. We will continue to experience more extreme weather events as a result of carbon emissions originating in Minnesota and elsewhere.\In August 2007, seven southeast Minnesota counties were declared federal disaster areas as a state record 15 inches of rain fell in 24 hours. Seven died, and many lives were significantly disrupted, especially those living in poverty. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed, along with significant infrastructure damage. Economic losses exceeded $200 million.\In August 2018, an air quality alert was issued for all 87 counties as wildfire smoke, industrial and vehicle emissions, and high temperatures caused significant ozone and particulate air pollution statewide. The health of thousands of Minnesotans was put at risk. Those with breathing conditions, the elderly, pregnant people, and impoverished communities are especially vulnerable.\ Not on track \The 2007 Minnesota Next Generation Energy policies established America’s most assertive Renewable Energy Standard, catalyzed energy efficiency, and set emissions reduction goals. However, we are not on track to meet those goals, according to a new Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) report. Minnesota should retake its place as a national leader on energy and environmental issues by enacting more ambitious and equitable policies.\The Minnesota State Investment board should completely divest from fossil fuels. This would be a win-win by withdrawing support from environmentally harmful practices, and maintaining more financially sustainable funds in the long term for Minnesotans that depend on them. Similarly, fossil fuel infrastructure projects should not be supported.\Minnesota should also continue to transition its fleets to electric vehicles, and build out charging infrastructure. Furthermore, the long-stagnant gas tax should be increased, and tied to inflation. Revenue should be used to make our transportation system safer, healthier and more efficient. Per the MPCA, transportation now causes more emissions than any other sector.\ Look to goals set by California, Hawaii and Xcel \Recently, California joined Hawaii in setting an ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, and Xcel Energy announced a goal of 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050. Minnesota should join their leadership mantle by enacting a similar target. The proposed “50 by ‘30” legislation would continue the momentum from the Minnesota Next Generation Energy Act.\Without federal climate leadership, states should consider enacting a revenue-neutral carbon fee to achieve their decarbonization goals. This would protect the environment by motivating emissions reductions, and funds collected would be returned to the hardworking taxpayers of Minnesota. Funds could also be directed toward green infrastructure projects. It is critical that these policies benefit those who suffer most from environmental pollution. In Minnesota this is disproportionately communities of color and indigenous communities.\Economical and equitable policies like these would significantly benefit Minnesotans, and the planet. Climate change does not stop at borders, it affects everyone. Every action — big or small — moves us closer (or further) from a cleaner environment. This includes international agreements, national, state, and local policies, and actions by businesses, nonprofits, and activist groups. It also includes personal action. We can all take direct action to reduce and minimize our own personal environmental impacts, while simultaneously advocating for systemic changes. Every action matters.\Jacob Herbers was the University of Minnesota Delegation Lead to the COP24 United Nations Climate Negotiations in Katowice, Poland.\WANT TO ADD YOUR VOICE?\If you’re interested in joining the discussion, add your voice to the Comment section below — or consider writing a letter or a longer-form Community Voices commentary.

203,"More than 600 deteriorating bridges across Minnesota would be replaced under a $1 billion capital investment proposal made by Gov. Tim Pawlenty on Monday. \Nearly 40 percent of the borrowing, or bonding, plan is devoted to transportation, Pawlenty said, a record amount. \""This is a historic commitment to bridges in Minnesota,"" he said. The stunning collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge that killed 13 people in August threw into new light the long list of bridges in need of repair and replacement. \Monday's proposal, Pawlenty said, meets repair needs ""in a more aggressive fashion."" \That means other longstanding priorities, such as higher-education projects, conservation and even prisons, may be passed over. \The local projects that often find a place in bonding bills got the cold shoulder in Pawlenty's proposal. \""This is not the year to be doing recreational things,"" Pawlenty said, ""so they'll have to wait."" \The plan would spend $965 million raised through general-obligation bonds and an additional amount from other bonds and cash, bringing the total to $1.09 billion - the state's recommended limit for debt. \Pawlenty said that while the mix of projects may change as the Legislature brings forward its own priorities, the amount would not. \""There will not be a bill signed by me that is more than $965 million,"" he said during a Monday news conference. \DFL has a different plan \DFLers criticized Pawlenty sharply for using so much of the state's credit capacity for bridge projects that could be paid for through increased taxes. \Higher education, which historically has received nearly a third of available bonding funds, would get less than a quarter under Pawlenty's proposal. \DFLers maintain that the state needs a comprehensive transportation funding bill that would include increases in the gasoline tax and license-tab fees and a wheelage tax to address its transportation backlog. \""The state has $790 million worth of locally deficient bridges,"" said Sen. Steve Murphy, DFL-Red Wing, who leads the Senate Transportation Committee. ""We have another $1 billion in deficient bridges at the state level."" \Pawlenty, he said, ""is trying to fool the public into thinking that we can use the state's credit card one more time to cover his political career. The amount of politics that gets played out of the governor's office is repulsive and this is just one more example."" \In July, before the bridge collapse, the Minnesota Transportation Department made a bonding request of just $70 million to replace 400 local bridges in the 2008 construction season. Pawlenty said that the bridge collapse highlighted the need for an accelerated replacement schedule. \But even at $225 million, his recommendations would replace fewer than a third of the 1,800 deficient county, city and township bridges scattered across Minnesota. \Murphy said the Senate would have its transportation bill ready when the session opens on Feb. 12. That bill, Murphy said, would create a bridge account that would include a comprehensive plan to address what he said was a nearly $2 billion backlog of transportation projects statewide. \Education, transit included \In addition to funding transportation, Pawlenty recommended $129 million each for the University of Minnesota and for the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, although MnSCU officials say they would have to self-fund $29 million of their allotment. \Another $46 million would go to clean drinking-water programs, while Pawlenty would spend $50 million on a package of economic development initiatives he recently introduced. \The proposed Central Corridor light-rail line, which will connect Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the Minnesota Steel project in Nashwauk would also get funds. \On the Central Corridor, however, Pawlenty cautioned that he was recommending only half the $140 million needed as a signal to developers to ""get their act together."" Planners for the project have had to deal with varying objectives for the corridor and have been unable to reach agreement. \House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall, said that he disagreed with Pawlenty only on funding for the Twin Cities rail line and the Duluth convention center. ""This is a year for the basics,"" Seifert said. ""We want a pork-free bill."" House Republicans will likely trim both areas, he said, to free up more money for roads and bridges. \County officials delighted \Over at the Association of Minnesota Counties, officials were near giddy at the proposed boost in bridge funding. \""Can we spend $225 million in two years? Absolutely,"" said Carol Lovro, a transportation analyst with the association. ""There are bridges in greater Minnesota that county engineers have had to close because it was too dangerous to let school buses and cars drive over them and they couldn't get the money to fix them."" \Lovro said that Pawlenty's recommendation nearly doubles the $130 million that counties had requested. But that lower figure, she said, ""is only because there's been such a lack of funding in recent years that counties haven't been as aggressive."" \Pawlenty's proposal, she said, was ""easily the largest in state history. The most we've ever gotten was $55 million two years ago, so we're very encouraged that the governor recognizes the level of need."" \Lovro said she was a little dismayed at the bickering that had already broken out on Monday on how to fund repairs and replacements. \""This shouldn't be a partisan issue,"" she said. ""It shouldn't be either bonding or a gas tax. The answer should be all of the above."" Local governments alone fall short by $300 million for road and bridge maintenance, she said. \""We've got bridges built in the early 1940s that are becoming critical,"" she said.

Rudy Perpich these days is saying he's never been as pessimistic about the economy, and is considering putting even more money into the state's $550 million budget reserve to prepare for bad times.\ ""It's slowing down, folks,"" the normally upbeat governor told the Star Tribune late last week.\ His pessimism and the tight money outlook casts a sobering if not gloomy mood over what already is being described as a phlegmatic, lackluster 1989 legislative session.\ A Minnesota Legislature that opened 11 weeks ago with some lawmakers talking about major proposals for disadvantaged children and for those without health insurance may be remembered as a ""stand-pat"" session.\ The uneasiness about the economy, coupled with increasing nervousness about rising property taxes, has legislative leaders keeping a low profile on major money bills until after the next revenue forecast due March 28. Lawmakers who go home for a long Easter break this weekend will have seven weeks when they return to make the tough decisions of where to spend and where to cut.\ Some new demands are emerging.\ For the first time, the governor last week was promising that he will ""do something for the suburbs,"" meaning their school financing and property tax problems.\ He met Friday with Sen. Don Frank, DFL-Spring Lake Park, chairman of the Senate Economic Development and Housing Committee, to talk about what that should be. They plan to meet again Monday. There will be no hearing on a bill in the governor's Year of the Cities package for Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth, until ""we have some conversation"" on suburban needs, Frank said.\ Perpich did not say how much more money he expects to be available in the revenue forecast. House Speaker Robert Vanasek, DFL-New Prague, and Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, DFL-Erskine, speculated it will only be $100 million to $150 million, about half of what was anticipated in January. Some economic consultants have lowered their growth projections since the last forecast in November, , and say there's a greater probability of a recession.\ The governor said he's more pessimistic than the Department of Finance and Commissioner Tom Triplett, who is recommending that half of the new revenues be added to the $550 million reserve.\ ""We're talking about going higher, $650 (million) or $700 (million),"" Perpich said.\ Perpich's priority for any extra money from the revenue forecast will be reducing property taxes. His initial request was for about $85 million, and he wants more - for tax relief for commercial and rental property owners in particular. Moe said he'd like to find at least $250 million for property tax relief. Vanasek said $200 million.\ Perpich also probably will recommend more for the University of Minnesota than the additional $17 million he's already promised out of new revenues. ""But I'll have to sit down and talk with the university before we come out with that,"" he said.\ House Minority Leader Bill Schreiber, IR-Brooklyn Park, predicts that there will have to be a general tax increase by 1991, earlier if there's a recession, because of ""the environment that Perpich has created in this state, making promises to everybody.""\ DFLers do seem to be in a dilemma, particularly in their search for more money for property tax relief. Complaints, particularly in the Twin Cities, are mounting.\ Perpich is adamant about his refusal to increase the sales or income tax this year. ""That's out - period,"" he said.\ In the long run, a campaign by the Minnesota Business Partnership and other business groups to build public support to cut $1 billion from his proposed $14 billion budget may help him, said Perpich.\ ""Legislators, instead of shooting at me (for not putting more money into education and other programs), now are going to be shooting at the Business Partnership,"" he said.\ The partnership made a big mistake, he said, with its ""put a cap on spending"" campaign, which has irritated legislators of both parties.\ Some observers say the Legislature was drifting even before this week's new pessimism about the economy. They attribute that to an intentional strategy on the part of DFL leaders who think a low-key, harmonious session is the safest plan going into the 1990 elections.\ Vanasek and Moe disagrees with critics who say that with more than half of the session over, the Legislature has accomplished little or nothing. Committee reports to the floor and bills passed by the Legislature are running ahead of budget years going back to 1983, they said.\ Except for ""living will"" legislation, legislative leaders are hard-pressed to name major bills that have been passed so far.\ Here's the outlook for major legislation at this point:\ # Bonding bill. Both Houses are expected to pass one but Perpich won't get all he wants. His request for $14 million in borrowing to finance additional amateur sports facilities is on the endangered list.\ # Children's initiatives. These modest programs by Perpich and Lt. Gov. Marlene Johnson are scattered among many different committees making it difficult for a coordinated push to get them moving.\ # Crime package. This is perhaps the only major legislation moving through at medium to fast speed, fueled by a consensus that it's time to get tough on crime. The only question appears to be how tough and whether the state can afford the expense of many more prisoners.\ # Elementary and secondary education. This is likely to be one of the last and stickiest issues on the table. House DFLers have taken the position that any new money should be pumped into the basic school aids formula. They think that money should do things such as reduce class size, rather than be spent on what some call Perpich's ""glitzy"" new programs - computers in classrooms, more emphasis on foreign languages and family education.\ # Higher education. The Senate appears to feel strongly that more money should be directed to post-secondary education rather than elementary and secondary.\ # Environment. Legislative leaders are confident that the 1989 Legislature will pass landmark bills in the areas of garbage recycling and ground-water protections, which do not necessarily require large appropriations.\ # Gas tax indexing. This measure, basically a tax increase, passed out of the friendly Senate Transportation Committee but it's in for rough going in other committees.\ # Mandatory health insurance for the uninsured (Healthspan). This program would be financed through a new payroll tax. It's not supported by the Perpich administration and is opposed by some businesses. Other DFL leaders say it's a major step that will probably take more than one session to consider.\ # Lottery. This revenue-producer for the Greater Minnesota Corporation and the Environmental Trust Fund was approved by voters last fall. It's taking shape slowly in a series of committees.\ # Property tax relief. The dilemma for legislators is where to find enough money to head off big tax increases in 1990, a year in which practically every state government office is up for election. The eternal quandary is who should get how much relief. The likeliest recipients are: commercial property owners, who are now paying the highest taxes in the nation, according to some studies; rental property owners, who are in roughly the same shape, and owners of higher-valued homes in the Twin Cities, who are an important target for the future of the DFL Party.\ # Regional treatment centers. A major Perpich initiative is to move the mentally ill and others from state hospitals to community centers. Many legislators are questioning the cost.\ # Year of the Cities. This package of aid for the state's three largest cities is meeting resistance from suburban and rural legislators who say their areas have the same problems as Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth."
205," Asked to divvy up taxpayers' money in their prospective state budgets, the endorsed candidates for governor from Minnesota's four major parties showed surprising similarities - and a few marked differences - Wednesday evening in their first televised debate.\ Republican Tim Pawlenty would spend twice as much as his rivals, and more than twice what's currently budgeted, on transportation, mostly with borrowed money.\ DFLer Roger Moe would increase health and human services spending by nearly one-quarter.\ Pawlenty and Independence candidate Tim Penny would keep health and human services spending the same, while the Green Party's Ken Pentel would cut it nearly one-fifth.\ Pentel would double spending on the environment and Pawlenty would increase it by half. Penny would hold state support of higher education at its current level, while the others would increase it.\ And Penny, Moe and Pawlenty all would make small increases in state spending on K-12 education, while Pentel would cut it one- sixth.\ These indications of the candidates' fiscal priorities came as they worked out an unusual feature of the debate sponsored by Twin Cities Public Television called ""Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is."" Before the telecast, each was given 100 $1 bills and asked to allocate them to various budget categories.\ Most of their decisions closely matched current state policy for the $28 billion two-year budget. But some of their differences led to the evening's sharpest debate.\ Pawlenty, who has pledged no increases in statewide taxes, said transportation spending should be supercharged with state borrowing of $1 billion to $2 billion.\ ""If we raise the gas tax a nickel,"" he said, ""we'll all be dead before you see any appreciable improvement in our roads and bridges.""\ The state's gasoline tax is now 20 cents a gallon.\ The 5-cent gasoline tax increase called for this year by business interests and DFLers would generate only $70 million to $80 million a year, barely ""a spit in the ocean,"" he said. His plan, he added, would ""give us the big 20-year catch-up that we need.""\ Penny, however, said Pawlenty's proposal would only rob future road improvements and maintenance. ""Borrowing and borrowing and borrowing again is not fiscal responsibility,"" he said. He voiced support for a gasoline tax increase of 5 or 6 cents, saying, ""I think people are willing to pay for what they need.""\ Moe, who supported a 6-cent gasoline tax increase in the Legislature this year, called for raising transportation spending by one-quarter. ""I am committed to making that investment,"" he said. Traffic congestion, he said, has made the cost of trucking goods across the metro area the same as from northern Minnesota to the Twin Cities.\ Pentel said his proposed one-quarter increase in transportation spending would go to new technology, village planning, bicycle freeways and other alternative travel modes. ""The car culture is just an economic sinkhole right now,"" he said.\ .\ Education promises\ On K-12 education, Pentel said he would ""make schools more efficient"" to meet his proposed deep cuts, but he also noted that he had left 12 percent of his budget unallocated, some of which he said could go to increasing the share for schools.\ Moe vowed that as governor ""I'll make sure that Minnesota is the first state in the nation where all kids are able to read by third grade."" He promised to demand accountability and high standards of schools, but also to cut back mandated testing.\ Pawlenty said he would expand education tax credits as ""the next chapter in school choice,"" push for performance pay for teachers, repeal the Profile of Learning graduation standard and replace it with a ""world-class curriculum.\ Penny said state financing of schools is ""our first and foremost responsibility.""\ The candidates also briefly staked out positions on a handful of other divisive issues:\ - Metropolitan Council. Moe and Penny hailed the council's recent performance under Gov. Jesse Ventura and Chairman Ted Mondale, but Pawlenty and Pentel said the appointive body should be elected.\ - Handgun rights. Pawlenty called for changing state law to make permits to carry handguns available to more Minnesotans, Moe and Pentel opposed it and Penny suggested, without offering specifics, that ""a workable compromise"" could be reached.\ - Abortion. Pawlenty backed abortion opponents' efforts to require a 24-hour waiting period while women are given information about the procedure. The other three said they oppose the waiting period.\ - Twins stadium. Pawlenty and Penny said they would support allowing Hennepin County, excluded from the 2002 stadium law, to sponsor a stadium plan. Moe said the Twins are ""an asset that's worth protecting,"" but added: ""If baseball goes on strike, the ballgame's over."" Pentel said he opposes public financing for professional sports in favor of support for youth athletics and the arts.\ - Driver's license restrictions. Pawlenty praised recent changes, inspired by the Sept. 11 attacks, to tighten identification requirements and track immigrants' legal stays in the United States, while the other three voiced doubts about such measures. Pentel said they tend to ""stereotype and ostracize"" foreigners, while Moe said a national standard should be adopted.\ - Governor's residence. Pawlenty and Penny said they would conduct state functions at the official residence on St. Paul's Summit Avenue, which Ventura closed this year, but they wouldn't live there. Moe and Pentel said they would live there.\ Four other candidates who are challenging the endorsees in the Sept. 10 primary election protested outside the public TV studios in St. Paul over their exclusion from the debate. Station officials said that the four - DFLer Ole Savior, Republican Leslie Davis, Independence candidate Bill Dahn and Green candidate Richard Klatte - hadn't reached a threshold of 5 percent support in independent opinion polls to be included.\ - Conrad deFiebre is at cdefiebre@startribune.com.\ .\ Coming up\ - Today: Gubernatorial candidates Roger Moe, Tim Pawlenty, Tim Penny and Ken Pentel will take questions and speak at the Coalition of Greater Minnesota Cities' summer conference in Worthington from 3 to 6 p.m.\ - Saturday: The candidates for governor will participate in a debate sponsored by the Independent Community Bankers of Minnesota at Arrowwood Resort in Alexandria at 11:30 a.m.\ - Aug. 6-7: Candidates will be featured in three forums on agricultural and rural issues at Farm Fest at the Gilfillan estate, 7 miles southeast of Redwood Falls.

206,"GUN VIOLENCE\Friday, Dec. 14, marks the sixth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy in Connecticut. Since that day, we have seen an ever-increasing rise in incidents of gun violence at schools and mass shootings in this nation. As we reflect this holiday season, let us honor all victims of gun violence by turning tragedy into transformation. There are many seemingly simple -- yet incredibly powerful -- things we can do today to prevent gun violence, including advocating for sensible gun-safety laws and access to programs in our schools and communities that help us identify the signs and signals before a shooting might happen and intervene to get help for at-risk individuals.\More and more people are uniting to bring the change we need. The phones in Congress are ringing off the hook with calls for ""common-sense"" gun reform, peaceful rallies are growing in cities across the country, and families and friends are gathering together in their own living rooms to talk about bringing violence-prevention programs to their schools. The movement is growing, and we must keep the momentum.\To keep this hope alive and bring the change we need, I am asking everyone to take three simple actions today. First, call your member of Congress and ask that he or she support gun- violence-prevention legislation to keep guns out of dangerous hands. Second, ""Know the Signs"" to prevent gun violence at sandyhookpromise.org. And third, ""Make the Promise"" at www.sandyhookpromise.org/promise and truly honor victims by turning tragedy into transformation.\Mary Cook, Andover\CLIMATE CHANGE\Americans do care. They decisively support a carbon tax and dividend.\Contrary to claims in the Dec. 12 commentary ""The (political) science behind climate change,"" the public does support effective solutions to the climate change crisis.\In March 2018, the Yale University Program on Climate Change Communication survey showed that 68 percent of Americans favored a revenue-neutral plan to ""require fossil fuel companies to pay a carbon tax,"" with only 29 percent opposed. That matches a 2014 poll from Stanford, the New York Times, and Resources for the Future that found that requiring companies to pay a greenhouse-gas tax and then giving ""all this tax money … to all Americans equally"" was favored by 67 percent to only 31 percent opposed.\While the specific poll language and methods differ, these reports show that the public approves of a policy that imposes a price on greenhouse-gas emissions and then returns all of the money to American households.\Fortunately, there is now a bill in Congress (the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act) that does just that. This bipartisan bill (HR 7173) will drive down carbon pollution and bring climate change under control while benefiting people and the economy. Just what the public wants.\Claudia Egelhoff, West St. Paul\• • •\It's not possible to ponder every hunk of data that floods by each day.\But here are a couple bits of information that deserve a little contemplation from recent Star Tribune articles.\• From a Dec. 12 article on EPA plans to roll back the Clean Water Act:\""Farm groups also worry that strict clean water regulations will limit their ability to use pesticides and fertilizer that could drain into creeks and swamps.""\• From a Dec. 11 article on the Trump team pushing fossil fuels at the climate summit in Poland:\President Donald Trump's energy and climate adviser said, ""We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice their economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability.""\Mull over those for a minute.\Greg Larson, Excelsior\• • •\It amazes me that climate-change deniers think that the economy is not at all connected to the environment. Former U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson, father of Earth Day, had said: ""The economy is a wholly dependent subsidiary of the environment."" As we are seeing from the reports out of Poland where current climate-change talks are being held, most of the countries realize this truth, while the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia reject the truth. If national governmental units cannot act responsibly, local ones (state and city) need to act independently to counter their outrageous disregard for the welfare of future generations and all other life-forms on the planet.\Anne Baynton, Roseville\POLICE SHORTAGE\No wonder -- it's a rare person who has the fortitude for this job\It is a unique person who seeks employment where every call means their life could be on the line, yet they are required to make the right decision in a few seconds (""Police call officer shortage a 'crisis,' "" front page, Dec. 13). The field of medicine has doctors making errors and patients dying, but doctors do not have their every move recorded then played back on the evening news, nor do they typically face firing or relocation. In Minneapolis, an officer who has committed an error often receives little support.\Most of us do not seek that kind of job. I have the utmost respect for law enforcement. Mistakes are made. Law enforcement officers are people just like me, yet their job often has no forgiveness. Call them what you want, but nothing feels more comforting than a call to 911.\Sharon McKernan, Bloomington\BORDER WALL\We can afford it. Math with me.\Dec. 21 is the deadline to fund the federal government or it will be ""shut down."" Of course, a government as large as ours cannot truly shut down completely, and despite attempts to gin-up fear about a ""shutdown,"" essential services will continue and benefit checks will continue to be sent, because statutory safeguards were put into place decades ago to continue such services.\At issue is that President Donald Trump is asking for $5 billion in funding for ""border security"" to build a wall on our border with Mexico to help prevent illegal immigration. I lived in Los Angeles for 17 years and saw firsthand the negative effects of illegal immigration and how a sanctuary city operated to the detriment of legal taxpaying citizens.\Democratic leaders have said that a wall would be ""immoral, ineffective and too expensive."" The purpose of this letter is to focus on the issue of the wall being ""too expensive.""\For most people, $1 million seems like a ridiculous amount of money, so when you see a $5 billion price tag, that must be outrageous, right? For 2018, the federal government has a budget of approximately $4.1 trillion dollars. Here is the math on ""too expensive"" in a few intuitive steps: (1) $5 billion is 5 percent of $100 billion; (2) there are 10 $100 billions in $1 trillion, so $5 billion is 0.5 percent of $1 trillion; and (3) with a budget of $4.1 trillion, that means $5 billion is 0.0012 percent of the total budget. Putting this math into monetary terms to which all of us can relate, compared with $100, what is being opposed is 12 pennies, which is the monetary equivalent of 0.0012 percent of $100. Opposition to the president's request based on a ""too expensive"" standard is outrageous and ridiculous.\Carter J. Erickson, Nevis, Minn."
207,"ENBRIDGE LINE 3\The Jan. 14 letter to the editor ""We can't 'modernize' energy with technology from last century"" fails to take into account some important facts.\First, Enbridge's Line 3 replacement project in Minnesota is about safety; we're replacing an old pipeline with a new one that uses the most advanced technology to protect the environment and ensure people receive affordable energy they need and count on every single day.\We believe climate change is a serious issue that requires action, and Enbridge is taking steps to address the challenge head-on. In fact, we are part of the solution to the transition to a lower carbon future.\For example, Enbridge has set and met greenhouse gas targets and is setting more aggressive ones. We've helped our utility customers reduce consumption and emissions equal to taking 10 million cars off the road. Half of our business is dedicated to moving natural gas in North America, which is helping to drive down carbon emissions dramatically. And, we've invested nearly $8 billion in renewables in the U.S. and around the globe.\Line 3 is a $2.6 billion private investment in Minnesota's energy infrastructure that will create 4,000 construction jobs, an additional $35 million in annual taxes for communities along the right of way, and $100 million in spending with tribal- and native-owned businesses. In respect and recognition of treaty rights, Enbridge has been working with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which led a groundbreaking cultural survey that identified resources and led to adjustments of the route of Line 3.\By upgrading and modernizing existing infrastructure and investing in new technologies, Enbridge is at the forefront of delivering long-term and sustainable energy solutions. Too often, the debate is framed as ""either environment or energy."" We're committed to ""both/and"" to deliver the energy Minnesota families need -- safely, reliably and cleaner.\Barry Simonson, Duluth\The writer is project director of the Line 3 replacement.\PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY\In this election, your vote matters more than the mangled process\Don't sit out the presidential primary election! Yes, I myself would have preferred that the presidential primary balloting had the same ballot format as the admirably anonymous traditional ballot -- one party along one edge of the ballot and the other party along the other edge (""We pay $12 million; the parties take our data. Sound fair?"" Readers Write, Jan. 20).\Remember, however, that -- especially in these challenging times -- what is important is your vote, not a mangled voting process. And that the so-called loyalty oath is simply a statement that you are enough of a Democrat to vote in the Democratic presidential nominating election or enough of a Republican to vote in the Republican presidential nominating election.\There is nothing certain individuals would want more than for you to sit at home on Election Day. As we hear time and again, young Americans have given their lives so that you could act and do what a citizen of this republic is supposed to do. Don't trash your vote!\Frank Malley, Minnetonka\• • •\I will not be voting in the presidential primary because I do not know if I am a moderate Democrat who believes in fiscal responsibility or a moderate Republican with a social conscience. There is no place for me, and I do not want solicitations from either party.\Mark Odland, Edina\INFRASTRUCTURE\We have the fifth-most miles of public roads. That's plenty.\I applaud Gov. Tim Walz's refusal to include highway expansion projects in his new bonding proposal (""How will state pay for roads, bridges?"" front page, Jan. 20). But I caution the governor and Legislature against finding other ways to fund roadway expansion when user fees on driving fall short of maintaining what we've already built.\Less than 38% of state road expenses are covered through user fees such as the gas tax and motor vehicle sales tax per recent Tax Foundation data. The vast majority of roadway expenses are cross-subsidized from the general fund, meaning people and companies who choose to drive less are covering for people and companies who choose to drive more.\We can't afford to maintain the roads we already have, let alone build more interchanges, lanes, highways and bridges like the bonding requests sent to the governor.\To climb out of a hole, first stop digging deeper. That means no new roads.\Matt Steele, Minneapolis\LIGHT RAIL\Not intransigence. Just practicality.\Facts do not support a recent letter writer's claim (""Our 'griping' is for a good reason,"" Jan. 17) that the Metropolitan Council is pushing ahead with co-location of light rail and freight trains in the Kenilworth route ""due solely to bureaucratic intransigence."" There can be legitimate debate about the role of light rail in future transportation. There can be legitimate debate about whether the public is better served by light rail to Eden Prairie or a network of streetcar routes in Minneapolis. But light-rail planners began looking at multiple routes between Hopkins and downtown Minneapolis more than a decade ago, and eliminated a number of possibilities because of excessive travel times or excessive costs (such as rebuilding Hwy. 100 to accommodate light rail.)\Three remaining choices were studied in greater depth. One, rerouting freight through St. Louis Park, was killed when the railroad exercised its legal power to veto it. Another was rejected because politically, it would kill the district along Nicollet Avenue known as Eat Street, and operationally, it would dead-end in downtown without a correction to lines to the airport and St. Paul. That is what leaves Kenilworth as the only viable route for efficient service between Eden Prairie and downtown, not ""bureaucratic intransigence.""\Rodgers Adams, Minneapolis\MARTIN LUTHER KING\Here's a good way to celebrate\There are many events and honors for this Martin Luther King Jr. Day, most focused on King. But here's one that will last decades:\Many kudos to the U.S. Navy for naming the next Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier for Doris Miller, African-American Navy Cross recipient, for his actions on the battleship West Virginia at Pearl Harbor and who later gave his life while serving on an escort carrier in the Pacific (""Navy plans to name carrier after black sailor, a hero at Pearl Harbor,"" Jan. 20). Usually, just the smaller support and combat ships are named for enlisted men. The gigantic $13 billion fleet carriers go to presidents and national leaders. To its great credit, this time the Navy is choosing a common seaman to represent all sailors who have served, fought and also died on its ships, and Doris Miller, whose highest rank was Cook Third Class, is an ideal choice to be that representative.\The USS Doris Miller (CVN-81), set to begin construction in 2023, will replace the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) named after the former Georgia congressman who also happened to be a staunch segregationist. That's the cherry on top.\Dennis Fazio, Minneapolis\We want to hear from you. Send us your thoughts here."
208,"Executive summary\St. Cloud-area firms experienced weak conditions in the past three months as key sectors continued to adjust to challenging market conditions. Along with ordinary seasonal weakness in the winter quarter, area firms also saw conditions of a more cyclical nature. This weakness was widely expected and, to date, there is no formal evidence that the local economy has slipped into recession - though economic weakness abounds.\Substantial local employment growth revisions suggest the area economy was much stronger through much of 2007 than many generally believed. Area employment growth for the 12 months ending in January 2008 was 1.7 percent - well above employment growth in the Twin Cities, and almost equal to St. Cloud's longer-term trend job growth rate. While conflicting signals have been a challenge in forecasting local economic conditions, evidence seems to show a period of very weak growth through spring, followed by an expansion in growth in the final half of 2008. The St. Cloud probability of recession index fell to a reading of 32.8 percent in February, indicating subsiding recessionary pressures. The St. Cloud Area Index of Leading Economic Indicators continued to drift sideways.\Twenty-nine percent of surveyed firms reported an increase in economic activity in the past three months, while 31 percent reported a decrease. Current employment conditions are also very weak, with only 13 percent of 87 firms who returned this quarter's business outlook survey reporting increased hiring in the past three months - and 18 percent trimming employment. The capital expenditures survey index was virtually flat over the past three months and the national business activity survey item was very weak. Employee compensation numbers remained low.\The future outlook is much brighter, as 60 percent of surveyed firms expect an increase in activity in six months and only 7 percent expect conditions to worsen. Employment and hours worked are expected to pick up, though this is, in part, a seasonal pattern. National business conditions are expected to modestly improve. After several periods of relative weakness in capital expenditures, this area is expected to rise substantially. However, 59 percent of firms report no expected plan to increase worker pay over the next six months.\Forty-six percent of area firms expect a slowdown in local commercial construction in the next year, while 11 percent expect that local sector to expand. Almost one-half of surveyed firms report the effects of increased ethanol demand have had ""no discernible effect"" on their business (although almost one out of every 10 firms says it has had a large unfavorable effect). Forty-four percent of firms believe we are in or are soon headed for local recession, while 33 percent expect below normal local growth (but no recession) and 20 percent expect normal growth.\Current Activity\Tables 1 and 2 report the most recent results of the business outlook survey. Responses are from 87 area businesses that returned the mailing in time for the report. Firms represent a diverse collection of businesses, including retail, manufacturing, construction, financial, health services and government enterprises of sizes ranging from small to large. Responses are confidential. Written and verbal comments have not been attributed to individual firms.\Survey responses suggest that, in the past three months, the St. Cloud area experienced economic conditions that are weaker than normal for this time of year. The current activity diffusion index (representing the percentage of respondents indicating an increase minus the percentage indicating a decrease in any given quarter) is -2.3 in this quarter's survey, which is about the same as was reported one year ago (-1.1), but is well below the February 2005 reading of 19.3.\The employment diffusion index was also lower than normal in February (although it is usually at its seasonal low in this quarter). However, it is markedly improved from the -19.4 recording registered one year ago. Similar comments can be made for the survey question on length of workweek. Area firms still report some difficulty hiring qualified workers, but they seem to be hanging on to those they have. Prospective labor force entrants may be finding it difficult to obtain the requisite skills and experience employers find so valuable.\Firms' capital expenditures were very weak over the past three months. With a value of 3.4, the index on this item is the lowest since the winter 2002 survey, when the area economy was mired in recession. Concerns about capital spending are worth noting, because this is such a key indicator of firms' outlook. Fortunately, while current capital expenditures were very weak, the future outlook on this survey item (see Table 2) is much more favorable. With a value of 35.6, the future capital expenditures index is the highest recorded in two years. Expectations of a rebounding economy, accompanied by more favorable federal tax policy and lower interest rates, may stimulate capital purchases by midyear.\The current national business activity index is the lowest recorded since the fall 2001 survey - although this outlook is expected to improve (see Table 2) in six months' time. The current prices received index is positive, but we don't observe much local pricing pressure. Many commentators have suggested a stagflationary scenario could play out in the U.S. economy. While there are genuine risks this could happen, so far it seems inflationary expectations are sufficiently in check to manage the risk for now.\Outlook\Recent quarters' future outlook has been seasonally tepid. We have consistently observed a future outlook below what's expected during normal times. For the first time in several quarters, the survey seems to suggest a brighter future outlook. With a value of 52.9, the diffusion index on future business activity is the highest observed in two years. To be sure, this recording is below its high of 75 in winter 2004, but it is also well above the 30.6 reading in winter 2002 (when the outlook was bleak).\Unfortunately, this improved outlook is only expected to marginally impact workers. While an index of 23 on expected future employment is a welcome relief from the 2.3 value recorded last quarter (and the negative number recorded before that), it is well below normal winter survey expectations. For example, the winter 2004 survey number was 42.9. Expected increases in average hours worked (as well as higher future capital expenditures) will play a large role in firms' future expansion efforts.\At a value of 34.5, the average value of the expected future employee compensation index has slowly declined. On one hand, this may not be good news for the work force. On the other hand, this may be part of a natural evolutionary market dynamic resulting from economic weakness. Many economic models incorporate reductions in real wages as the natural adjustment firms make to challenging market conditions, so this series may be saying something about that. These adjustments are ultimately necessary to put an economy back on a path of sustainable growth.\As noted, while some seem to be concerned about stagflationary pressures, there is no real evidence of this in the prices received column of Table 2.\While inflationary pressures seem to be a consideration in, for example, world commodity markets, the reverse is found in housing markets, where housing price declines continue to emerge across the United States.\Special questions\Anyone driving around the St. Cloud area in the past several months has noticed several high-visibility commercial construction projects. Examples include the ING downtown expansion, St. Cloud's new public library, a new parking ramp and Science Building expansion at SCSU, and the Sauk Rapids bridge and associated commercial development. With many of these projects soon approaching their ends, we thought it appropriate to ask businesses to comment on what is in the pipeline. Specifically, we asked the following question:\QUESTION 1\The St. Cloud economy has recently benefited from a number of high-visibility commercial construction projects, some of which are nearing completion. Relative to the past 12 months, which of the following does your business expect for area commercial construction projects in the next 12 months?\Almost half of firms expected a slowdown in commercial construction relative to the past 12 months. Many observers have noted how important commercial construction contracts have been for area homebuilders who have shifted into commercial projects. To date, much of this high visibility construction has helped support this key local sector, so it will be worth watching to see what happens if commercial construction weakens at the same time the area housing market is weak.\Written responses include:\* ""(A moderate slowdown) due to recession talks.""\* ""Our clients are delaying expansion projects.""\* ""Low interest rates should entice some companies to build.""\* ""(A moderate expansion.) As a supplier of construction supplies, we have orders booked for spring of 2008.""\* ""We are seeing a decrease in new loan requests for commercial construction and expect that will continue.""\QUESTION 2\Ethanol markets have received attention in recent months as ethanol gasoline requirements, among other things, have led to increased demand for corn. This has not only pushed up gas prices, it has also led to secondary effects in which grain supplies have declined (leading to higher grain prices) as farmers allocated a greater share of their acreage to planting corn. This has caused higher food and beverage prices, among other impacts. We asked area firms the following question:\Many observers have noted that increased demand for ethanol has caused an increase in feed (and other) prices. To what extent has your business (either directly or indirectly) been influenced by the increase in ethanol demand?\While almost one-half of firms report the increase in ethanol demand has had no discernible impact on their firm, the results are more interesting than that. Twenty-three percent indicate an unfavorable impact and 9 percent report a favorable impact. The written responses are most illuminating about the relative distribution of costs and benefits of the ethanol requirements. Farmers (and those who sell to farmers) seem to be better off, while any firm that uses corn or grain as a productive input are worse off.\Written responses include:\* ""Our cost for grain and protein products has gone up over 75% in the last year. Capital required for inventory has dramatically increased.""\* ""High commodity prices have increased income. Capital investment by farmers has increased business for us. Less account delinquency and increased farm income.""\* ""We are in (an industry that uses grains as an input) and we've seen more farmers growing corn versus (grains). The price for (grains) has increased by 50% and that has also raised (our final product) prices.""\* ""I think the ethanol program will go in the history books as one of the largest boondoggles to ever hit the state of MN and the country.""\* ""Wheat prices are three times what we paid a year ago. We expect our (processed inputs) to go up also as soybeans are affected.""\* ""Farmers are spending more money due to increased revenue from this demand.""\* ""Increased production of ethanol from corn is the primary reason corn and soybean prices have doubled. Wheat prices are up 300 percent due to crop shortfalls. Grain markets will remain high to attract acres. Food prices will increase substantially in 2008. Expect rising inflation. Our energy policy is basically a tax on food. This impacts food prices in the U.S. and globally, leading to more starvation and hunger.""\* ""Farmers are profitable and able to invest in capital equipment.""\* ""Hydrogen is the fuel of the future for the U.S. 2009 red and white meat costs will be at all-time highs. 2008 will be the largest weather market in the history of U.S. farming and agriculture.""\QUESTION 3\This quarter's final question is on a topic of high interest to the authors of the St. Cloud Area Quarterly Business Report. We have spent much of our professional lives teaching students about the characteristics of the business cycle and their key components, particularly expansions and recessions. There has been a media clamor - some might say an obsession - with the desire to call the current situation a recession, even though economists generally agree that it takes months to determine when one has started. Recessions are big events and are not to be taken lightly - most economists agree that business sentiment drives investment decisions - so it is wise not to get too far ahead of the data in making premature pronouncements.\It may well be that the local economy has slipped (or will soon slip) into recession, although we cannot say for sure at this time. We decided to take a different approach and ask area firms if they thought we were in recession, heading for recession or could expect differing degrees of local economic growth in the year ahead. We asked:\There has been a lot of recent discussion about the possibility of a national, state and local recession. Which of the following best describes your company's expectation about the prospects of a local recession in 2008?\We will let the chart (and the accompanying comments) do most of the talking, but suffice it to say economists are not the only ones who are uncertain about whether we are in, heading for or will avoid a recession. One interesting note is 44 percent of surveyed firms report they believe we are either in recession - or will be in the coming months. This is remarkably close to the 45 percent of economists recently surveyed by the National Association of Business Economists who indicated recession is likely this year.\Written responses include:\* ""We will see an increase in business revenue due to a recession. We will experience a slowdown in the number of new clients due to the reduced number of new startup businesses and the delay in expansion by our existing client base.""\* ""We continue to see weakness in housing both in commercial developers and residential demand. This is leaking over to commercial retail.""\* ""Slowdown - but small scale.""\* ""I feel the spring will be slow, but if interest rates and high gas prices continue to drop, it could stimulate the economy for a good fall and start of 2009.""\* ""There has been and will be a decrease in growth, but I would not call it a recession.""\* ""Unless we're buying into the rumors, it seems that disposable income isn't as plentiful and people are watching their spending.""\* ""While we don't expect a 'technical' recession, we do expect a slowing local economy during the next six months and slow growing economy thereafter.""\* ""We expect recession will continue to show signs for all of 2008. High gas prices and poor performing stock market has placed a lot of people in a conservative behavior.""\Recession or not?\Since state economist Tom Stinson stated Jan. 15 that Minnesota is in a recession, that word has dominated conversations about the local economy. At that time, his data on jobs over the year was a decline of 353. The revisions discussed in the special box revised that number to a gain of 6,217. Growth in Minnesota jobs was 0.6 percent, almost on a par with the 0.7 percent experienced by the United States as a whole.\Still, the question was whether the decline in jobs was sufficient to trigger a call of recession for the state or local economy. There are data available for the state economy that some economists have used. One project at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is an index derived from a set of data on income, employment and unemployment data, and hours worked in manufacturing. The data since 2000 is plotted in the chart at top right and shows that since late summer, the trend has been down for the Minnesota economy, which could indicate the state has begun a period of recession.\Consistent with the method we have used in the last few issues of QBR - and in fact part of our inspiration for the model - economists at the St. Louis Federal Reserve have provided a model that instead provides a probability of recession. It has an advantage that ours lacks insofar as it makes much stronger statements of whether a state or local economy is in recession. But as can be seen in the graph below, it can give a false positive reading of recession. The authors advise caution in using it in isolation; the model's predictions have to be placed in context with other information the forecaster has about the state of the economy. But the signal from this data - given before revisions in employment reported in early March - suggests Minnesota was in recession from August 2007.\Data revisions may change this result. Some anecdotal data received since then indicate sales tax revenues in the state slowed sharply in December, and the unemployment rate fell 0.2 percent in January. Each indicator pushes in opposite directions. The mix of data generally makes the forecasting environment even more treacherous than usual for a potential turning point.\Locally, Table 3 shows that growth in employment locally was relatively broad-based. Local manufacturing employment was up 1.5 percent in the 12 months to January, and growth in services kept about the same pace. The retail and leisure-hospitality sectors put some drag on area employment, as higher oil prices and narrowing access to easy credit to home credit lines harmed retailers nationwide, particularly for higher-end retailers. The decline in retail was more severe in St. Cloud than elsewhere in the state. We also note that with the latest data revisions, the annual share of employment in manufacturing has moved below 17 percent for the first time since data collection began in 1990. St. Cloud is not immune to the secular decline in manufacturing employment occurring nationally, as productivity gains allow firms to expand production and firms report skilled labor shortages.\Other local data found in Table 4 provide mixed signals. Unemployment is traditionally high in St. Cloud in January, so the current reading of 5.7 percent is high compared with last summer but below the 6 percent reading of January 2007. Unemployment insurance claims have fallen slightly, suggesting improvement in the local labor market. However, lines of help-wanted advertising has fallen 6.5 percent over the year, and building permits fell by more than half. Regional economists point out that the decline in permits and building starts has affected not only construction but also the sale of wood products, appliances and other items that go into new homes.\Help-wanted advertising has moved higher in the past few months (on a seasonally adjusted basis), and this is the only item in the St. Cloud Area Index of Leading Economic Indicators that increased. Its strength more than counteracted the slight declines in the other three indicators, as seen in Table 5. Unemployment claims rose late in the last year, and hours worked did not increase as much as normal for this season. Incorporations of new firms were virtually flat. Those items are also assembled in our recession forecast index, which had a reading of 32.8 percent probability of recession for February 2008. This forecast is a statement of the probability of a recession four to six months ahead, so compared to our forecasts of last fall for actions this spring, the latest reading indicates a weakening risk of recession for summer 2008.\National forecasts generally put the risk of recession somewhere between 40 percent and 50 percent for this spring. That number moved up slowly but steadily throughout fall. Forecasters generally moved up their forecasts for growth for the second half of 2008 on the expectation that the stimulus package passed in February will increase consumer spending by mid- to late-summer, and perhaps the cuts in interest rates made by the Federal Reserve would gain more traction at that time. GDP growth in the first half of 2008 will either be negative (if there is a recession) or anemic (if not).\Forecasts of home prices for 2008 nationally show a 4.5 percent decline according to the February forecast of The Wall Street Journal's Economic Forecasting Survey. Federal Reserve policy is expected to be expansionary through the first half of the year, with Fed funds rates in the area of 2 percent to 2.5 percent expected by most forecasters by June. While many writers appear concerned about the Fed's perceived lack of concern for inflation, forecasters still put their forecasts of CPI inflation by December 2008 at 2.3 percent - slightly higher than the Federal Reserve's perceived target of 2%, but unlikely to constrain its actions if the situation should warrant further cuts in interest rates.\Question marks for 2009, which forecasters are projecting for the first time, vary dramatically. The National Association of Business Economists survey finds a median forecast of 2.9 percent GDP growth. Those who have had lower expectations for recession in 2008 had higher expectations of recession in 2009 in the WSJ survey. Uncertainty of professional forecasters and of our business survey participants in the special question about recession are about equal.\This does not mean there necessarily will be a recession in either year. A problem is in the defining of local recessions - there is no independent arbiter. Even for state recessions, nobody agrees on one body to make an ""official"" declaration (even national recession dating is done by a private group.) Suppose employment growth, after final revisions of data, did register a growth rate of 0.1 percent or 0.2 percent, and unemployment rose above 6 percent. Would observers want to say that was not a recession because the number somehow stayed positive? Economists argue that one can have a recession without a slump in employment. That may be what happens this time.\What is affecting your company?\Comments to this question include:\* ""One area of concern is increasing property tax rates, especially commercial property tax. I am involved in several commercial real estate projects and I am seeing that the excessive burden of real estate taxes is starting to be a deterrent to investment.""\* ""Foreclosure market is a direct competition for new construction as many foreclosed homes are five or less years old.""\* ""Increase in gas tax will negatively affect our business. Local taxes have skyrocketed. Our Legislature has misspent our gas tax on social programs, etc., over the years.""\* ""We are in a normal seasonal slowdown. We are fortunate to be diversified (in type of work we do and multiple locations served).""\* ""Federal Reserve cuts and further cuts will materially affect older depositors who live off dividends - reducing their spending habits.""\* ""Reduced demand for (building materials) has caused increased pressure on prices from competitors in that market segment.""\* ""The media needs to balance reporting to include some good signs to the economy or we can talk ourselves into a recession.""\* ""Our business is strongly influenced by the new housing market. With it being slow - we are slow. ...""\That's some revision!\We live in a time where change happens faster and faster. That can create issues for government workers who try to figure out how many people are employed. Firms come and go faster, entrepreneurship activities increase, and thus more jobs are created in places we do not know about.\The data we report as employment comes from a survey of a sample of businesses. Government cannot survey them all. Annually, it looks back at data from all employers it can track, primarily using unemployment insurance information, to revise the estimates they reported the previous two years. The revisions typically change the monthly estimates by 0.5 percent to 0.9 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\The revisions reported in March on the level of St. Cloud employment were larger than this, as the graph below shows. On average, the number of area jobs reported monthly was raised by more than 500 workers in the first half of 2007 and by 1,252 in the second half. The impact of this change cannot be understated. Our previous Quarterly Business Report had reported job growth of 0.8 percent for the year through October based on the previous data. This was consistent with a story of a slowing economy and job growth from levels experienced in the first half of the year.\The data now revised show growth job growth of 2 percent, which would mean real output in the area grew perhaps 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent faster than we previously thought. This is possibly the difference between recession and continued normal growth in the local economy. Area employment growth from December 2006 to December 2007 was 2 percent rather than 0.5 percent reported in late January. (January over-the-year growth in employment locally eased to 1.7 percent.) The revised figure is consistent with normal employment growth in the area.\This same pattern occurred last year and was reported in last April's QBR. Indeed, the revisions in second-half 2006 employment averaged 1,942 workers, larger than this year. As we noted then, the usual explanation for this is the churn of firms may be larger. The old firms drop out of the sample when the firm surveyed reports it is no longer in business, but the workers may go to a new concern that is not in the set of surveyed firms. Government data collectors can only learn about those new firms from the tax filings.\What sectors accounted for the differences? One probable source of new firms is the construction sector. Unlike past statements we may have made about this sector, revised data show average employment at 17,393 in 2007, up from 17,232 in 2006. Almost a thousand jobs were added in the health and education super-sector, more than double previous estimates.\This should be a reminder to users of local area data that the data are subject to substantial revisions that could cause us to change our views of what is going on locally. We can no longer say the area economy was slowing in the second half of 2007 as the previous data was suggesting. This will lead us as well to revise downward our projections of a recession slightly.\In the next QBR\Participating businesses can look for the next survey in May and the St. Cloud Area Quarterly Business Report in the July-September edition of ROI. Area businesses that wish to participate in the survey can call the St. Cloud State University Center for Economic Education at (320) 308-2157."
209,"ST. PAUL It will go down in history as the ""stadium session.""\Lawmakers crossed home plate last weekend at the end of a 12-week legislative season with a $1 billion state construction bill in hand and other modest achievements to pad their stats.\But bench-clearing brawls about public money for three stadiums the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings and University of Minnesota took up much of their time and most of the attention this spring.\In the end, two of the stadiums touched 'em all and one got sent back down to the minors, though probably not for long.\Politicians of all stripes are betting such results will help dull memories of the do-nothing 2004 Legislature and last year's partial state government shutdown before they all stand for election this fall.\Several other ideas took their swings this spring as well.\Here's a session scorecard to keep track of this year's players, followed by some trading cards on Page 4A, showing how St. Cloud-area lawmakers did on their top issues and what's coming up for the fall.\Home runs\Twins stadium\What: A $522 million outdoor baseball stadium in the warehouse district in Minneapolis, backed by the Minnesota Twins and Hennepin County.\Why: Most lawmakers got to vote for keeping the Twins in Minnesota without taxing their constituents.\Gophers stadium\A $248 million, on-campus football stadium for the University of Minnesota, backed by university administrators and alumni.\Why: Lawmakers decided spending state tax dollars for stadiums is acceptable, as long as it's not for professional sports.\Eminent domain reform\Local governments can't take private land from unwilling sellers just to boost tax revenue or create jobs anymore, with some exceptions.\Why: Many states enacted reforms in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that said states can do pretty much what they want.\Mercury emissions reduction\Big coal power plants, like Xcel Energy's in Becker, must eliminate more airborne mercury pollution faster than federal law requires.\Why: Gov. Tim Pawlenty wanted environmental progress this session, and he got all sides to agree to his version of this deal.\Northstar commuter rail\$60 million in the bonding bill covers the remaining state share of start-up costs for the Minneapolis-Big Lake service to start in 2009.\Why: Lawmakers made a $37.5 million commitment last year. This spring, it reeled in federal final-design approval and a contract with BNSF Railway for track use.\St. Cloud Regional Airport\$2 million in the bonding bill plus local sales tax money should buy nearby expansion land and leverage future federal dollars.\Why: Pawlenty, local lawmakers and St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis overcame objections from House Republicans to get it in at the last minute.\St. Cloud higher education\St. Cloud State University's renovations of Wick Math and Science building, Riverview Hall and St. Cloud Technical College's HealthPartners building purchase got what they needed.\Why: Higher education scored big in the bonding bill, and projects that emphasize science received preference.\Science Initiative of Central Minnesota\The partnership trying to grow bioscience agriculture and manufacturing jobs can seek state reduced-tax status and pursue up to $4 million.\Why: Pawlenty encouraged the area to pursue both, and the limited scope eased Twin Cities and Rochester lawmakers' territorial concerns.\St. Cloud metro gang strike force\Authorization for area cities' law enforcement to dedicate officers to urban gang problems and seek state funding.\Why: Rep. Jim Knoblach put it in the last-minute spending bill.\Tri-county nursing homes\State Medical Assistance reimbursement rates for facilities in Benton, Sherburne and Stearns counties will rise to match the Twin Cities.\Why: The change got in the last-minute spending bill Knoblach helped put together.\Strike outs\Property tax relief\House Republicans offered one-time rebate checks for homeowners. Senate DFLers proposed state aid increases to local governments.\Why: Everyone said it was a top priority, but even after the Minnesota Supreme Court allowed the state to keep the tobacco tax money, the two sides couldn't agree how to spend it.\Gay marriage amendment\Enshrining in the state Constitution a state law prohibiting recognition of homosexual marriage and extending it to legal equivalents.\Why: House Republicans voted last year to put the amendment on the ballot. Senate DFLers this year gave it a hearing, killed it off and kept it under wraps the rest of the session.\Environment and arts amendment\Dedicating part of the state's sales tax revenue to fish and wildlife, clean water, parks, arts and culture funding.\Why: House Republicans wanted to dedicate existing sales tax, Senate DFLers wanted to increase it. They couldn't agree on a final ballot question for voters.\Illegal immigration\Enhanced penalties for fake IDs, making locals enforce immigration laws and in-state tuition for children of illegal immigrants were a few ideas.\Why: Too polarizing an issue for a short session. Most immigration duties fall to the federal government.\Abortion restrictions\Language designed to trigger constitutional challenges eliminating state abortion funding and tracking courts that grant parental notification waivers to minors.\Why: House Republicans approved it, but Senate DFLers kept it and any health-related bill it could have been added to from a politically difficult vote.\St. Cloud Civic Center\A $10 million bonding request to help expand the Civic Center and build a new parking lot to allow for larger trade shows.\Why: Voter rejection in a 2004 sales tax referendum, St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis' initial ambivalence toward the project made it a hard sell.\Central Minnesota Regional Parks and Trails\Although a Sherburne County trail did win $485,000 in funding, $2.3 million in requests for Benton, Sherburne and Stearns counties land and improvement priorities, such as a new park in Rockville, were not funded.\Why: The state directs money to Twin Cities parks, but it makes others compete for statewide funds.\On deck\Taxes\This fall: Both sides will beat each other up this fall over the lack of property tax relief and who's to blame.\Next year: If one party wins control of both houses, expect significant income and/or sales tax changes.\Transportation\This fall: Voters decide whether to constitutionally dedicate the state's motor vehicle sales tax to roads (60 percent) and transit (40 percent).\Next year: A gas tax increase for roads and a metro-area sales tax increase for transit will be back.\Education\This fall: Both sides will claim credit for last year's big K-12 funding increase.\Next year: Expect lawmakers to look at helping schools with high special education and foreign student populations, possibly more reforms.\Health Care\This fall: Republicans want more flexible insurance plans and mandate relief. Democrats want universal coverage and state insurance buy-ins.\Next year: The future of state insurance programs such as MinnesotaCare could be affected if one party controls both houses.\Environment\This fall: Both sides are blaming each other for the dedicated funding amendment's failure. Both are taking credit for mercury and bonding items.\Next year: Lawmakers set up the Clean Water Legacy plan to test and repair Minnesota's waters but don't have a good way to pay for it yet.\Social issues\This fall: Gay marriage amendment and abortion-restriction supporters are furious with Democrats. But without the amendment, they might not vote as much.\Next year: Unless Republicans control both houses and the governor's office, further changes are unlikely.\Vikings stadium\This fall: Vikings owner Zygi Wilf is rethinking his Anoka County proposal and could come up with different options.\Next year: The Twins stadium bill contains language favorable to a future Vikings stadium. Expect another push regardless of who wins.\Local projects\This fall: Lawmakers came through for their districts' requests pretty well this year. Expect them to emphasize that and not the past two or three years.\Next year: St. Cloud State University's National Hockey Center could be in the mix if the Vikings stadium is back. St. Cloud's Civic Center will likely wait until 2008.\Michelle Fischbach\Position: State senator, District 14.\Season: Fourth. Elected 1996.\Team: Republican Party of Minnesota.\Hometown: Paynesville.\Performance: Fischbach sought special aid and lease levy authority for the Rocori school district that got included in a supplemental spending bill that will become law. She also sought bonding money for Richmond to expand its sewage treatment plant. No line item for that was included in the bonding bill, but the city might get it anyway from a statewide pot of money for that purpose. Legislative priorities on tax credits for health insurance for the uninsured and a Terri Schiavo-inspired bill preventing starvation and dehydration of people with disabilities went nowhere in the Senate this year.\Dan Severson\Position: State representative, District 14A.\Season: Second. Elected 2002.\Team: Republican Party of Minnesota.\Hometown: Sauk Rapids.\Performance: Severson was the chief author on bills that became law on topics such as tri-county nursing home reimbursement rate increases and bioscience zones. On a top goal of increasing state benefits for veterans and active military members, the Legislature created veterans service officers for higher education institutions and appropriated about $2.5 million in grants, but larger steps, such as ending state taxation of veteran pensions, fell short. Severson was not able to get the state to require elections for watershed district managers, and the Senate took no action this year on the gay marriage amendment which passed the House of Representatives last year with him as chief author.\Tarryl Clark\Position: State senator, District 15.\Season: Rookie. Elected 2005.\Team: Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\Hometown: St. Cloud.\Performance: Clark was the chief author of a number of bills that became law this year, on topics such as tri-county nursing home reimbursement-rate increases, St. Cloud metro gang strikeforce, outstate biotechnology zones, adult basic education aid increases, a pilot character-development education program and multiple bonding requests for her district. Not all of them passed on the Senate side, however, but they became law by being attached to other bills. She was not successful this year in stated goals of improving education funding to shift costs off property taxes and boost aid for districts with many special education students this year, nor in a call to fund all-day kindergarten statewide.\Larry Haws\Position: State representative, District 15B.\Season: Rookie. Elected 2005.\Team: Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\Hometown: St. Cloud.\Performance: Haws was a chief House author on bills authorizing a St. Cloud gang strike force and bonding requests for St. Cloud Regional Airport and area higher education institutions that found success, though not necessarily in the House. On top goals of reducing state mandates on local government and increasing reimbursement rates to counties for housing state inmates, Haws made little headway this year. He found some committee success for a bill allowing counties more flexibility in publishing their financial statements, but he withdrew it to work more with all sides.\Jim Knoblach\Position: State representative. District 15A.\Season: Sixth. Elected 1994.\Team: Republican Party of Minnesota.\Hometown: St. Cloud.\Performance: Knoblach was a key player in getting nursing home reimbursement rate increases, St. Cloud gang strike force authorization and outstate bioscience zones included in a supplemental spending bill. He was also a proponent of the St. Cloud area's successful higher education bonding requests. The Legislature did not go for Knoblach's version of a plan to test and clean the state's waters this year, but elements of it got incorporated in the final bill. A marriage tax penalty fix he introduced also found success. He was unable to get his proposals for ending illegal immigration ""sanctuary ordinances"" signed into law, nor in getting tax credits for private school tuition or buying back school districts' expanded levy authority to reduce property taxes.\Larry Hosch\Position: State representative. District 14B.\Season: Rookie. Elected 2004.\Team: Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\Hometown: St. Joseph.\Performance: Hosch was the chief House author on requests for special aid and lease levy authority for the Rocori school district that were included in the final spending bill, though they did not pass the House. He sought bonding money for Richmond's sewage treatment plant, which did not receive a line-item in the bill but might find funding from a statewide pot of money. His top goals of legislative reform and MinnesotaCare eligibility expansion fell by the wayside this year, though he did get an amendment making it easier for watershed district residents to repeal their district into a bill that should become law."

Remarks as prepared for delivery on April 30, 2014
\
When I ran for Governor four years ago, I promised ""A Better Minnesota."" Tonight, I can report that the state of our State is better -- much better -- than before. It's better for us, and it's better for those who will inherit it from us. But the economic growth and social progress we have achieved, also reminds us of the work we still have left to do.
\
Becoming a parent introduces a longer-term perspective. We begin to consider the effects of our actions not only on our own lives, but also on lives that will extend beyond ours.
\
Becoming a grandparent, as I did a year-ago, thanks to my terrific son and wonderful daughter-in-law, Eric and Cory Dayton, who are in the gallery tonight, adds another generation to that timeline. It also raises the stakes.
\
Somewhere down the road, my grandson and his generation will assess the state of the state we have left to them. They will decide whether we, through our actions or inactions, made their lives better. Let's keep them in mind, as we choose our state's path.
\
In my first State of the State, three years ago, I said, ""I know what we must do to create that better future for all of us. To progress, we have to invest.
\
""We have to invest in more jobs. Invest in better education. In improved transportation. In the health of our citizens, our communities, and our environment. In the transformation of government services.""
\
In other words, we have to invest in growth, quality, and effectiveness.
\
JOBS & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
\
Well, we invested in jobs. Minnesota's private sector and public sector both invested in jobs. We are blessed with so many outstanding businesses, located everywhere in our state, operating everywhere in the world -- and who, during the past three years, rediscovered that they can be successful and profitable here in Minnesota. As a result, we have the 5th fastest growing economy in the country.
\
There are more than 2.8 million jobs in Minnesota today. More jobs than ever before in our state's history. 150,000 more jobs than when I became Governor three years ago.
\
This economic growth is happening all over our state. A recent newspaper story was entitled, ""Lots of jobs find a home on the prairie in southwestern Minnesota."" It said that, for example, Jackson County reported a 5 percent increase in jobs during 2013. The City of Jackson's economic development coordinator is quoted saying that, ""Everybody who is able to work, and willing, is probably employed.""
\
Jackson's largest employer, AGCO, has doubled its workforce to more than 1,300. Nearby, HitchDoc, which manufactures automotive and farm equipment for 300 customers, has grown from a dozen employees to 140. ""And I'm looking for another 30,"" said the company's owner, Brad Mohns. ""I'm turning down work, because I can't find enough employees.""
\
Some people believe there is no role for government in private sector expansion and job creation. To see that they're mistaken, just look around Minnesota.
\
There would not be a new stadium under construction in Minneapolis without the financial support of the City and the State of Minnesota. 7500 construction workers will have jobs building that stadium over the next couple years. Over one-third of them will be people of color.
\
Located right next to the stadium will be a $400 million private sector development, the largest in a generation. It will provide office space for 5000 Wells Fargo employees, residential apartments, stores and shops, a hotel, and a new, two-block public park. Its construction will employ another 1000 Minnesotans. And that is just the beginning of the area's revitalization.
\
Another new stadium is being constructed in downtown St. Paul. It would not have occurred without an investment by that City and the State of Minnesota. It will anchor the resurgence of the Lowertown Neighborhood in our Capitol City.
\
Perhaps the most transformative development project anywhere will occur in Rochester, thanks to the world-renowned Mayo Clinic's decision to build its expanded Destination Medical Center there. Already Minnesota's largest private employer, Mayo expects this multi-billion dollar expansion to double its employment over the next twenty years. The Center will be surrounded by new hotels, restaurants, stores, and recreational opportunities.
\
This project will enhance Rochester's standing, as the premier health care center in the world. It will establish Minnesota as one of the world's best locations for advanced medical research; the development of new medical treatments and technologies; and the thousands of good new jobs they will create. This project would not be happening without Mayo's extraordinary commitment. It would not be happening here in Minnesota without the significant state investment approved by the legislature last year, along with investments by the City of Rochester and Olmsted County.
\
There are many more successes. Segetis in Hoyt Lakes, Price Mechanical in Maple Grove, AXIS Clinicals in Dilworth, Viracon in Owatonna, Shutterfly in Shakopee, AAR Corporation in Duluth, Toro in Bloomington, Baxter in Brooklyn Park, WFSI in Sauk Rapids, and 3M in Maplewood, all located or expanded their businesses and created jobs all over Minnesota, partly as a result of their financial partnerships with the state and local governments.
\
There will be many more, if we are smart enough to continue making those investments. But there won't be as many, if we are not.
\
To illustrate, let's go to Luverne and Worthington, right next to the South Dakota and Iowa borders.
\
Both cities report opportunities to expand existing businesses and attract new ones. However, they desperately need more water. Without it, business growth is being stifled, new jobs are being lost, and residents are being forced to buy bottled water. Meanwhile, the solution to their water problems, the Lewis & Clark pipeline, is stalled at the Minnesota-South Dakota border, due to lack of public investment.
\
The federal government has essentially bailed on the project, despite the strenuous efforts of our Minnesota Congressional Delegation. The $71 million needed to complete the pipeline's Minnesota leg must come mostly from us, or that region's growth in population, businesses, and jobs will suffer.
\
The harsh reality is that there is probably not enough room in an $850 million bonding bill to fund the pipeline's construction all the way through Luverne, into Worthington, and on to the Iowa border. However, there could well be enough room in a larger bonding bill to complete the Minnesota segment and turn the water on in Luverne and Worthington. Otherwise, they will have to wait at least until the next bonding bill, one or two years from now.
\
Why am I for a $1.2 Billion bonding bill? Because I'm for jobs. Our building this pipeline means jobs now and more jobs in the future. It means this region of our state will have the opportunity to grow and to prosper. Isn't that a purpose we can all support? I hope so.
\
There are other cities throughout Minnesota, which need the state's financial support to complete key projects that will bring them new businesses, new jobs, new people, and new economic growth. Those job-creating projects will either be funded in this year's bonding bill, or they will lose out again. That decision is yours in the legislature.
\
EDUCATION
\
Improving education is closely connected with good jobs and economic growth. It is also closely connected with our citizens' health and well-being. I am very pleased to report that we have made significant new investments in education, all the way from early childhood through post-secondary, and improved results are beginning to show.
\
We started in 2011, when, despite facing a projected $6 Billion deficit, we increased K-12 education funding by $223 million, reversing a decade of declining state support for our public schools.
\
The 2011 legislature also passed an Alternative Pathway for Teacher Licensure and a ""Read Well by Third Grade"" literacy initiative. It enacted comprehensive teacher and principal evaluations. Principal evaluations began last fall, and teacher evaluations will start state-wide this September.
\
Last year, the 2013 legislature made $485 million of new investments in education. It increased the per-pupil aid formula as well as support for Special Education.
\
State funding for early childhood education scholarships was increased to $46 million last year, and the Senate wants to raise that amount this year. Early childhood education is real education reform.
\
The legislature also passed one of my consistent priorities; and state-funded, all-day kindergarten will begin this fall. Studies show that both early childhood and all-day kindergarten can make crucial differences in boosting students' performances and closing achievement gaps. So do nutritious hot school lunches. No child should be shamed because parents can't afford lunch. Hopefully, that funding will soon be enacted.
\
And, very significantly, during the past two-and-a-half years, we have repaid ALL of the $2.8 Billion previously borrowed from our schools. Now, school districts can put their money into classrooms, not bank loans. Let us vow that no more will we balance state budgets by creating deficits in school budgets.
\
Just weeks ago, the legislature passed strong anti-bullying legislation. That is also important education reform. Children don't learn at school, if they are scared. Or made to feel bad about themselves.
\
Once, Minnesota students competed successfully not only with students around the country, but also with kids around the world. We are on our way to doing that again.
\
Testing by the Trends in International Math and Science Study ranks Minnesota #9 among world educational systems in Science and 6th in Mathematics.
\
Back home, in the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress testing, Minnesota's 4th graders tested #1 in the nation in math. They ranked 10th best in reading, which was a big improvement from 22nd the year before. Very important was that the state's reading gap for African-American and Latino 4th graders closed by 10 points from 2009 to 2013.
\
Our 8th graders ranked 11th best in the nation in reading and 5th best in math.
\
We have had the highest ACT scores among seniors for 8 years running, and our graduation rate, nearly 80%, is the highest in a decade.
\
Regarding higher education, we have started to make progress, but we have quite a ways to go. In fiscal 2012, state support for higher education, in real, after-inflation dollars, fell to its lowest level since 1981. Last year's legislature began to reverse that trend, and increased state funding for higher education by a record $248.5 million.
\
One result from that declining state funding had been the increased reliance on tuition revenues to fund our public colleges and universities. According to the College Board, in this school year Minnesota has the 4th highest in-state tuition and fees for two-year public colleges and the 12th highest for four-year colleges and universities. Last year's legislature wisely imposed two-year freezes on tuitions at the University of Minnesota and the MnSCU colleges and universities.
\
In addition, the State Grant Program was expanded. As a result, over Minnesota 100,000 students have received increased state financial aid this year.
\
TRANSPORTATION
\
Improved transportation is also essential to support economic growth and a Better Minnesota. Unfortunately, Minnesota's highways, roads, bridges, and public transit systems have been underfunded for the past quarter-century. Federal funds, state gas tax revenues, license fees, and the other traditional sources of transportation funding have not kept pace with escalating project costs.
\
Every day, Minnesotans everywhere suffer the consequences of that serious underfunding. Congested freeways. Unsafe two-lane highways. Deteriorating roads and bridges. Inadequate public transit systems. Inadequate transportation systems stifle economic growth and cost jobs.
\
The future of transportation in Minnesota and the funding for it have to be among the 2015 legislative session's top priorities. Whatever is decided -- whether to do nothing, a little, or a lot -- will have an enormous impact on the lives of all Minnesotans -- for decades.
\
Some say that MnDOT should be looking to save money by becoming more efficient. Well, they have. $50 million in construction savings have been identified that can now be used to advance other important projects, such as a much-needed third lane on Highway 494 in Plymouth.
\
MnDOT officials have also outlined one possible combination of funds, which could nearly raise the $6 Billion of additional revenues needed over the next ten years to maintain, expand, and improve our state's transportation systems. Obviously, it would be very expensive. It would, however, cost less than doing nothing.
\
HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT
\
A better Minnesota also means a healthier Minnesota. We can take satisfaction in our national ranking as the third healthiest state. And the Commonwealth Fund has just announced that Minnesota ranks as the best state in the country for health system performance, which includes health care access, quality, costs, and outcomes.
\
I am especially proud that we've expanded access to affordable, high-quality health care, while at the same time reducing state health care costs. The Department of Human Services has saved taxpayers over $1 Billion through more competitive contracts for our state health care programs.
\
Among the states, we have the fifth lowest percentage of citizens without health insurance coverage. 8 percent of our residents are uninsured, compared to the national average of 14.8 percent. And our state's entire health care network deserves credit for enabling MNsure to offer the lowest insurance rates of any Health Exchange.
\
These low rates have helped MNsure enroll over 206,000 Minnesotans in affordable health coverage -- many for the first time. MNsure didn't start well, but it's gotten better, and it will keep on improving.
\
It's also important to remember that the federal Affordable Care Act provides all Minnesotans with some very important protections, whether they obtain their insurance through MNsure or not. No one can be denied coverage, because of pre-existing conditions. There can be no lifetime limit on a person's health care needs. Young adults are covered under their parents' health insurance plans until the age of 26. Certain screenings for cancer and other preventative procedures are free.
\
Here in Minnesota, we greatly enhanced the well-being of many of our citizens by passing into law last year's Marriage Equality legislation.
\
However, there is always more that we can do. Better school physical education programs will encourage children and youths to enjoy physical exercise and appreciate its benefits. The Statewide Health Improvement Program (SHIP) helps people of all ages to become healthy and to stay healthy.
\
Under SHIP, the Cites of Frazee and Fergus Falls have adopted ""Complete Streets"" policies, making it easier for residents to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines.
\
In Fairmont, SHIP has helped community leaders create Safe Routes to Schools. They have installed wider crosswalks, additional safety guards, pedestrian and bike safety education, and a ""Walking Tuesday"" program at four elementary schools.
\
Farm to school/ Healthier food programs have taken off under SHIP. In just four years, 29 percent of Minnesota's schools have implemented Farm to School strategies, providing access to locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables to more than 272,000 students.
\
In Kelliher, for example, SHIP has brought healthier food to the public schools with more fresh fruits and vegetables and more local foods. Kelliher's Superintendent reports that for the first time in 20 years, the school's hot breakfast and lunch budgets are in the black. Last year, at this time, they were between $30,000 and $40,000 in the red.
\
Healthier habits, lower costs and supporting local economies. That's what SHIP is about.
\
We also need to support caregivers who are taking care of aging parents. My proposed State Income Tax Credit for Child Care costs would apply equally to the costs of care for dependent, disabled, or elderly family members. I urge that this tax credit be included in the second tax bill.
\
TRANSFORMATION OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE
\
We must also work continuously to improve government services and provide Minnesotans with the quality and the efficiency they deserve. We have made real progress, and we have much more to do.
\
We've reduced environmental permitting times, as well as the time it takes the Department of Labor and Industry to license plumbers, electricians and other professionals. And DVS's car registration turnarounds have been slashed from 90 to 19 days.
\
The Department of Veterans Affairs completely reworked their website, allowing the 490,000 people who visit it each year to more easily access information about veterans' benefits and services. The Department of Natural Resources created a one-stop shop for all State Park camping reservations and license purchases. What used to take campers 11 clicks from the DNR home page to reserve a campsite online. Now it takes only two clicks.
\
Last year, I recommended that this year's legislative session be the ""Unsession."" The response has been tremendous! Thousands of Minnesota citizens offered ideas to improve state government at the State Fair, on-line, and in-person.
\
We also received terrific ideas and suggestions from hundreds of State employees. I thank them for their interest and participation. No one knows better how to improve government services than the people who work provide them. I also thank legislators, who added their own initiatives and who have taken valuable time during this short session to give consideration to the 1000 proposals submitted by my administration.
\
They all have one goal: to create a Better Government for a Better Minnesota. I have already signed 121 provisions into law. They include the first middle-class tax cut bill, which simplifies the preparation of federal and state taxes, saving one and one-half million Minnesota taxpayers time and money.
\
This work may not grab news headlines, but it is very important. It is what citizens should rightfully expect from their government. It is what I expect.
\
I ask the legislature tonight to continue this work and pass the remaining Unsession bills.
\
While we have made great progress toward a Better Minnesota, it should also serve as a reminder of the work left to do. The middle class is still struggling in our state and all over our country. There is still too much poverty and inequality. There is too much uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Of the 145,000 Minnesotans, who are unemployed, over one-fourth have been without jobs for more than 27 weeks. Nationally, that number is more than a third.
\
We need more jobs that pay enough to raise families; jobs that have good benefits; that offer retirement security; and keep pace with the cost of living. Too many Minnesotans have to work two or three jobs to try to make ends meet.
\
We took a very important step two weeks ago, when the legislature increased the state's minimum wage and indexed it to inflation. When fully in effect, 325,000 Minnesotans will earn almost $500 million more every year.
\
At $8.00 per hour effective this August, a worker's earnings will still be one-third below the federal poverty level for a family of four. At $9.50 per hour in two more years, earnings will remain one-fifth below the poverty level.
\
Nevertheless, those increases will be enormously important to them and their families. They will use that money to give their children better lives. They will use it to buy necessities, and much will be spent quickly and locally. A higher minimum wage leads to more economic growth by rewarding hard work and improving workers' productivity.
\
In a couple weeks, I will be speaking for the fourth year at the Minnesota Prayer Breakfast. This year, the theme is ""Unity."" I am going to say that, unfortunately, where I work, unity in an election year is an oxymoron.
\
But the truth is ... we're all in the same boat together. We're all in the same rough seas. We can affect much of what occurs here in Minnesota and improve our state. However, we are part of a very big world.
\
One which is ever more inter-connected and moving very fast.
\
Today, the U.S. economy comprises 22% of the entire world economy. In 1960, however, the U.S. share was almost 39%.
\
Other countries' standings in the global economy have also changed. In the last quarter century, Japan's share of the world's GDP has dropped to half of what it was. China's has increased seven times. Germany's share fell by almost half, while Brazil's more than doubled.
\
What does this mean? That the world economy is very dynamic, with big winners and losers over time. The U.S. economy is still dominant, but other countries are catching up to us. And they don't want to join us; they want to beat us.
\
The recent serious recession and slow recovery from it evidence a profound economic change. We used to make here most of what we bought here. And we made it better here than anywhere else in the world. That was our overwhelming competitive advantage, which drove our economic dominance and steadily raised the living standards of our growing middle-class.
\
In past years, it has shifted. The rest of the world now makes much of what we buy here. However, they cannot yet afford to buy enough of the goods and services we produce here, to replace the jobs that we have lost. And we have not created enough new ideas to launch enough new businesses to provide enough new jobs for everyone who wants and needs one.
\
This intensified global competition will dominate the rest of our lives, our children's and our grandchildren's lives. How we respond will determine the quality of the lives we all live.
\
Here in Minnesota, we are better prepared than succeed in this new global economy -- because of the ingenuity and productivity found everywhere in our state. From our farmers, who have made Minnesota the 4th largest agriculture exporting state in the nation, to our Iron Range mining companies, who have merged new technology with tried and true methods.
\
Farmers, steel workers, loggers, plant workers, construction crews, teachers, nurses, truck drivers, corporate executives, and public employees. They are living proof that we have always earned our success. By working harder. By managing better. By innovating smarter. By producing more efficiently. Per capita, we have the highest number of Fortune 500 companies headquartered here. 3M. General Mills. Target. United Health Group. They didn't move here. They started here.
\
Cargill. Marvin. Andersen. Carlson. Digi-Key. Toro. Schwan's. Polaris. Arctic Cat. Magnetation. Medtronic. Mayo. They, and too many others to mention, began with an entrepreneur with an idea. Which became a product or service. Which other industrious people built into other products and services. Which succeeded, because they were designed well, produced well, and serviced well, by well-educated, talented, and hard-working Minnesotans. Working together, they have produced success after success after success. And they have built a state, which reflects their values and virtues.
\
That was the key to our past success. It will also be the key to our future success. What we have to do for a better future is what we did for a better past. We have to invest. We have to invest in our people. We have to invest in economic growth. We have to invest in a Better Minnesota.
\
INVEST IN BETTER EDUCATION
\
We have to invest in better education. Education that teaches people what they will need to succeed in the world of the future, not the world of the past. We need to invest in their new ideas, in their new ways to solve problems. We need to invest in their better health. We need to invest in a cleaner environment to keep them healthier for longer. And we need to invest in the infrastructure they need to live productive lives: efficient transportation, reliable sewer and water systems, and high-speed world-communications.
\
We have begun that process by recognizing the critical importance of our investments in education, and reversing their decline. Increasing our commitment to early childhood education will be one key to closing the achievement gap and enabling all of our children to become successful adults. Let us all commit that by 2018, all three and four year olds in Minnesota will have access to quality, affordable early childhood education.
\
Then, from the beginning of their elementary school educations, we must teach our children how to think creatively. To learn how to learn. To learn to love to learn. Creative people develop new ideas, which start new enterprises, which provide new jobs. Creative people figure out how to do their work more efficiently and productively.
\
The excessive amounts of time and rote learning required by today's excessive school testing are counter-productive. They stifle teachers' abilities to not only impart information, but also to show kids how to use it. How to apply their knowledge to solve new problems in new areas. And to enjoy doing so.
\
This approach does not require abandoning testing, as a measure of each student's progress. It does require more efficient, more effective testing. A growing number of elementary schools in Minnesota are applying ""one-minute, read-out-loud"" tests, which can determine reading levels in just that one minute. Such tests can be repeated throughout the school year, as often as necessary, to measure students' progress and adjust learning strategies accordingly.
\
Compare that approach to the high-stakes, anxiety-provoking testing, which is now imposed on children in third grade -- or even younger. Many children come to school terrified on test days; then go home demoralized. What purpose does it serve to send a third-grader home believing she has failed life, because she may have performed poorly on a test?
\
Last year, I'm very sorry to say, our state went backwards. More tests were mandated in the upper grade levels. I'm told some tests are required by state statute. Others are necessary to satisfy federal requirements. Still others are added by local school districts. They may make sense individually; but added all together, they do not.
\
I am asking our Department of Education to prepare for the 2015 legislative session an analysis all of the tests now required at each grade level. And to recommend which ones could be streamlined, combined, or eliminated. I urge next year's legislators to work with state and national experts to reduce the amount of school testing and allow dedicated teachers to spend their time teaching students what they will need for their future success.
\
Minnesota offers one of the fewest school days per school year in the country. The amount of time students spend in classrooms each day has also declined. Next year's legislature needs to re-evaluate those practices. The rigors of the school day and the school year are important ways to prepare young people for the far more competitive world they will enter.
\
We also need to consider what environments we offer young people, when they're not in school. It pains me to drive by a school in the early afternoon and see it closed, with its playground locked up. I always wonder, ""Where are the kids, who are locked out of their schools? Where do they go, when they have nowhere to go?""
\
We need our schools to open earlier to offer their students nutritious breakfasts, and we need them to stay open later to provide safety, mentoring, tutoring, exercise, and new learning opportunities. These additional responsibilities would not be placed upon schools' regular teachers. Instead, a new group of adults would take over after regular hours.
\
Minnesota has the third highest labor force participation rate in the country: over 70 %. Too many of their sons and daughters have too little to do after school and no one watching them do it. Afternoon and evening programs at schools and recreational centers should be community responsibilities. Ask local businesses to help pay for them. Ask major corporations to sponsor them. Ask adults to volunteer one day a week or a month to run them. Get everyone involved in the lives of our children.
\
Starting in Junior High School, our education system needs to make students aware of the real world opportunities and pitfalls in the world they will be entering. First and foremost, they need to hear again and again and again that continuing their educations will be absolutely essential to achieving the lives they want. Our schools need more guidance counselors, who are specially trained in career guidance, to help junior high and high school students better understand what their opportunities are and how to prepare for them.
\
Then we must better align our high school and college curricula with the world of the future, not the world of the past. This means we have to provide leading-edge instruction; in world-class schools, colleges, and universities; with state-of-the-art equipment and technology -- all aligned with the good jobs that will be available for their graduates.
\
The need for this alignment is well-understood by our state's secondary and post-secondary education leaders. However, they need the resources to carry it out.
\
The State's current bonding levels do not adequately support the improvements that both MnSCU and the U of M must make in their existing physical plants, in new buildings, and in state-of-the-art equipment and technologies -- to continue to attract the best students and give them the best possible educations.
\
Higher education is by no means alone in suffering from inadequate capital investments. We need to find new revenues to finance.
\
I have given special emphasis to education, both because I believe it holds the key to our continued growth. I am convinced that whoever retools their education systems to align most effectively with the world their students will live in, and gives them the tools they will need to succeed in it, will prosper. Whoever doesn't, will lag behind.
\
INVEST IN JOBS
\
We also need to increase our investments in new jobs and better jobs throughout our state. Last year, the legislature made major new investments in the Department of Employment & Economic Development's job creating programs. I thank Speaker Thissen and Majority Leader Bakk for their excellent leadership, and I thank all the legislators of both parties who supported those new incentives.
\
They are already putting more Minnesotans to work. Since last July, the Minnesota Investment Fund has provided companies with low-interest loans totaling $8.4 million, which have leveraged $235 million in private investment.
\
In January, the new Minnesota Job Creation Fund was launched. It provides pay-for-performance incentives for businesses to locate or expand here. In its first four months, the program has invested $5 million in 10 different business expansion projects (five in Greater Minnesota and five in the Metro area). It has leveraged $87 million of new, private investments, which have created 550 new jobs.
\
For this session, I proposed an expansion of our Angel Tax Credit program, our State's primary tool to attract private investments into promising business start-ups and growth. They have the potential to become Minnesota's next Fortune 500 companies. Whether they become large or remain small, their success will drive Minnesota's future economic growth.
\
As I will say at the Prayer Breakfast, Unity may be beyond our reach at the Capitol this year. I don't want to rule it out entirely, with second tax cut, supplemental budget, and bonding bills still ahead. We might surprise ourselves.
\
But while we may not find a Unity of Means, I believe we do share a Unity of Purpose. We all love this state. We all want to see it prosper. We want our International communities -- there are now over 100 languages and dialects spoken in Minnesota -- to retain their special identities; yet, also live together harmoniously and work together productively.
\
We want Minnesota to be the Best. To be the very best it can possibly be. Because we live here. Many of our children and grandchildren will live here. We want them to achieve the very best they can for themselves and for their families.
\
In his epic saga Giants in the Earth, O. E. Rolvaag wrote, ""By attempting the impossible, they accomplished the unbelievable.""
\
Unity of purpose might seem impossible. But if we try, it might just show up, when we really need it.

211,"Candidates differ on use of sales-tax funds\By Sue Halena\shalena@stcloudtimes.com\ST. JOSEPH - The campaign strategies range from chatting when the opportunity strikes to building an informative Web page.\The candidate educational backgrounds range from high school graduate to doctorate-degree holder.\The city government experience level ranges from none to four years.\St. Joseph voters have four choices for two four-year terms on city council.\All four acknowledge the need to control growth, to keep their small-town atmosphere and to support a proposed half-cent sales tax.\Here's a look at what candidates said about their council races.\Why run?\Political science professor Steve Frank, 62, has turned down earlier chances to run but appears to be running out of excuses as his academic career winds down.\""I don't want to retire and sit and watch Twins games,"" he said ""I think I can contribute in other ways.""\Herman Gangl, an electrician, said he's running to make government fair.\If elected, he says, he'll talk to parties affected by a pending decision and vote against projects they oppose.\""If they're wrong, they've got to live with it. It should cut back on the sniveling and whining that you hear when people talk about city government because they've got to live with it then.""\College of St. Benedict groundskeeper Al Rassier is ending his first four years on the council, and he wants to keep working on transportation issues.\""The growth (of the city) will depend on how the transportation is laid out.""\Renee Symanietz, an account executive, is running with support of some business leaders. She wants moderate growth and adequate equipment for the police and fire departments.\The vision\Council candidates know their city will change in the years that the winners are in office.\From Page 1B\St. Joseph\Symanietz says her vision is to have St. Joseph be known as a clean, neighborly town for young families and retirees.\It should be ""a city people want to come to because of the Wobegon Trail.""\Rassier imagines a carefully paced unfolding of development plans, including one that would bring 950 homes to the south side of the city. He would like to meet affordable housing needs with a program that repairs older homes. ""I think there are some really good options in all our local cities for repairs that could make those affordable,"" he said. Gangl hopes the city will help the school district accommodate rapid growth in student numbers. He likes the idea of placing a high school in the city. The expanding bedroom community needs to keep its small-town flavor, he said.\Frank supports the vision expressed in the city's comprehensive plan. Growth pressures are at odds with the small-town atmosphere, and that means making ""smart growth"" decisions.\Frank is familiar with zoning and planning principles from work on the St. Cloud board of appeals. Rassier has recent experience with the St. Joseph Planning Commission.\Sales tax vote\Although they all support the 17-year sales tax, the four candidates have different ideas on where the money should go.\On Nov. 2, voters can weigh in on spending up to $15 million for transportation projects, up to $5 million on a community center and up to $3 million on parks improvements.\Rassier particularly favors the transportation option. Well-designed corridors can attract businesses that pay taxes or fees with which to fund park improvements and other projects, he said.\Symanietz favors transportation and park use of sales tax revenue.\Gangl prefers a community center, possibly with a branch library. He said he wants roads to be built and maintained with gas tax money.\The sales tax may not be the most fair way of raising funds, Frank said, but it is a necessity at a time of state funding shortfalls.\""I've accepted the idea that if we're going to engage in some of these projects, probably the sales tax is the most feasible way,"" he said.\He said the city will need ""extensive discussion"" before setting priorities for the sales-tax funds.\In general, he would like the city to explore technologies that help involve residents in the community, such as providing meeting information and feedback via Web sites.\Profiles of candidates for St. Joseph city council\Stephen I. Frank\Address: 606 Birch St. NW, St. Joseph, MN.\Age: 62.\Phone: 208-4131 (work); 493-0311 (cell).\E-mail address: electsteve@astound.net.\Campaign Web site: http://electsfrank.com.\Education: Doctorate degree in political science from Washington State University; post-graduate work at University of Michigan.\Occupation: Professor of political science, founder and co-director of The SCSU Survey at St. Cloud State University.\Elected experience: None.\Appointed boards: Charter member St. Cloud Zoning Board of Appeals, St. Cloud Charter Commission and St. Joseph Personnel Committee.\Family: Spouse, Barbara A. Frank; one child.\Top three priorities:\1. Citizen input and follow through: Solicit more and different types of citizen input at city council meetings and inform residents of council member's inclinations before public input is closed. Quicker and better follow through when citizens have concerns with issues. Encouraging more discussion and input into city development and growth.\2. Budget issues: Pursue an examination of homeowner property taxes and budget decisions. (St. Joseph appears to be on the high side for proposed property taxes for the area.)\3. Recognize the strong contributions made by the College of St. Benedict and St. John's University to St. Joseph and increase discussions with all elements of the universities' communities to minimize problems.\*\What ideas do you have for managing residential, commercial and industrial growth in the city of St. Joseph?\I don't believe growing cities ever control growth. St. Joseph citizens have given their input in documents such as the comprehensive plan.\These could be used as a starting point with a recognition that they are not written in stone. We are not so big that we can't have community discussions on these topics. This might allow us to discuss and listen to each other without the threat of an imminent project. Often it seems local governments try to reinvent the wheel. Through our membership in groups such as the League of Minnesota Cities, we can ask what other like cities have done and what has worked or not worked.\As identified in the comprehensive plan, we have a vibrant population, many who have lived in other areas.\Their experiences would be helpful. Growth will occur, but do we want Stearns County Road 75 to look like Division Street in St. Cloud? Do we want all our open land covered by more and more houses? We need to talk about this as a community before it is too late. Studies indicate cities lose money for every new house valued less than about $150,000 (some studies say this figure is way too low).\We don't have to be hostile to those who want to develop, but we should consider what impact rapid development has on our property taxes and our city's livability. As a sizable part of St. Joseph is not taxable, combined with a small business/industrial base, we need to continue our efforts to help our existing businesses and attract businesses and industry (especially to our industrial park) to increase our tax base and provide decent jobs. The market will handle fast-food businesses and the like.\What is the best way to manage traffic in and through the city?\The comprehensive plan provides a sound start. My reading of the traffic section indicates other than Stearns County roads 75 and 2, most of our roads are and will be lower-volume roads. However, as noted in the plan, there are factors beyond the city's control such as the Minnesota Department of Transportation's plans for Interstate Highway 94 and growth in surrounding areas.\However, we need to develop the County Road 2-County Road 75 corridor to reduce truck traffic coming into St. Joseph. County Road 75 probably will need frontage roads, strict traffic enforcement, sidewalks and an underpass/overpass. More sidewalks into downtown and perhaps some more lighting (my view) need to be considered. Other areas include more stoplights along Stearns County Road 75 and extensions or work on roads such as Stearns County Road 133 to Stearns County Road 121. Mass transit needs to be explored, but citizens have mixed views due to costs. In a survey for the Central Minnesota Builders Association, I was asked if I would favor narrower roads in developments. I suspect this is being proposed to reduce costs. Some cities are using narrower roads as a way to slow traffic, but I would like to ask citizens, law enforcement and those who do things such as snow plowing what they think.\How should the city shape its identity going forward?\A lot of work has gone into the comprehensive plan, and it should serve as our guide. However, plans can become stale if not discussed and updated from time to time.\Additionally, there are factors beyond our control such as a looming billion-dollar state shortfall, growth in surrounding areas, changes in Interstate 94 and the like. I am suggesting exploring new and different ways of interacting with each other.\For instance, we could devote part of a council meeting to discuss topics of interest to St. Joseph citizens. Or, have a special town meeting once a year or so to discuss topics without the need to make a quick decision.\We should explore using technologies such as making us an Internet or wired city. Chanhassen is wiring the entire city for a cost of about $16 per household per month. If citizens can't physically attend meetings, we could solicit opinions through technological means.\Herman John Gangl\Address: 316 Seventh Ave. SE, St. Joseph, MN.\Age: 56.\Phone: 262-4592 (home); 293-6780 (work); 267-9200 (cell).\E-mail: hj gangl@stcloud state.edu\Education: One year of electronics at St. Cloud Vocational School 1967; two years of electrical at St. Cloud Vocational School, 1971-1973.\Occupation: Lead electrician, St. Cloud State University.\Elected experience: Commander of the Avon American Legion, six years; union representative.\Appointed boards: None.\Family: Spouse, Pat; three children.\Top three priorities:\1. More public involvement in city, county and local government.\2. Open communication on all issues.\3. More opportunities for the St. Joseph community.\*\What ideas do you have for managing residential, commercial and industrial growth in the city of St. Joseph?\More balance in the growth. St. Joseph is currently experiencing huge residential growth, which is bringing in a lot of young families. Our current schools won't be able to handle the growth. I would like to see more industrial and commercial growth.\What is the best way to manage traffic in and through the city?\Mass transit and ride share should be promoted more. I would also like to see the Metro Bus provide service to St. Joseph to accommodate the elderly, students and low-income residents.\How should the city shape its identity going forward?\Make St. Joseph more self-sustaining and move away from the ""bedroom community"" identity. Possibly being able to support its own high school.\Alan G.

Work with county, township and APO to refine our transportation needs to make our growth as smooth as possible.\2. Try to adjust the city budget so St. Joseph does not need to depend on outside sources to run our city, such as local government aid.\3. Work with our economic development authority to build the commercial and industrial base of St. Joseph.\*\What ideas do you have for managing residential, commercial and industrial growth in the city of St. Joseph?\My main way to manage growth across the city as a whole is to make sure we do not outgrow the sewer, water and roads. If we stick to this policy, we should not have any problems.\What is the best way to manage traffic in and through the city?\To be proactive in where and when the future roads and corridors are laid out. That in itself brings growth to the city, it it follows the comprehensive plan.\How should the city shape its identity going forward?\We need to keep moving forward with controlled growth to make sure we don't outgrow our infrastructure, police department and citywide needs.\Renee Jean Symanietz\Address: 354 Fourth Ave. SE, St. Joseph.\Age: 36.\Phone: 363-8169 (home); 980-1461 (cell).\E-mail: Puffypinkwings@aol .com.\Education: Farming Elementary School, Albany High School, St. Cloud Technical College, continue education in business.\Occupation: Account executive, Birch Publications.\Elected experience: None.\Appointed boards: Girl Scout troop leader.\Family: Two children.\Top three priorities:\Ensure that our city services such as police and firefighters are supplied with essential equipment to protect and guarantee safety in our community.\Balancing the needs in planning, financing, providing services to the city of St. Joseph. Having taxpayers have more of an involvement on city amenities such as environment, parks and trails. Commercial business should have more say on the operations of their own business. Remember they are creating jobs in our area.\During the growth of the city we should also keep in mind the big picture and the long-term effect to sustain health and the needs of future generations. This way we can ensure a financially sound environment within our community. One of the best decisions of the council was adding the trails and walking paths to the area. They are well-utilized by our community. This also draws more economic growth to local business.\*\What ideas do you have for managing residential, commercial and industrial growth in the city of St. Joseph?\Supporting growth and development in commercial, industrial and residential areas and balancing the finances to benefit the whole city with a positive outcome while controlling spending.\What is the best way to manage traffic in and through the city?\By making sure there are enough stop signs and stoplights at busy intersections.\How should the city shape its identity going forward?\By standing together on upcoming city issues and working as a community.\A positive move forward are the city parks and the walking trails. We are a friendly town with a lot of caring people."

213,"It’s official: St. Paul’s pot-holed roads are even more pock-marked than those of Minneapolis. But the bad news gets worse.\St. Paul streets are, on average, in fair condition but fading fast. Roughly a dozen miles of roadway are officially failing.\Some streets that were extensively rehabbed just a few years ago are already in need of major repair. If road funding stays flat, at least 80 percent of residential streets will hit poor-to-failed condition by 2039, meaning more than 500 miles of road could become virtually un-navigable within 20 years.\And the $26 million or more that the city already spends each year patching potholes, rehabbing arterial roadways and reconstructing city streets?\That would need to double to $50 million annually to achieve noticeably better results than the status quo.\ STREET CONDITION REPORT \That’s the latest prognosis from St. Paul Public Works, which is scheduled to present a 47-page “Street Condition Report” to the St. Paul City Council on Wednesday as part of planning leading into the budget season.\“When we defer maintenance, the work piles up,” said City Council President Amy Brendmoen.\St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter is expected to unveil his 2020 budget proposal on Aug. 15 at the Frogtown Community Center.\“Our streets have decades of wear and tear that we need to address to ensure that people can continue to connect to opportunity in St. Paul,” said Carter, in a social media post Tuesday. “We started down this path through our 2019 city budget, but we still have work to do.”\The Street Condition Report examines 199 miles of major city roadways, or arterial streets carrying a $1 billion replacement value, as well as 563 miles of residential streets carrying a $1.88 billion replacement value.\Overall, St. Paul is home to 869 miles of roadways, including 762 miles of city streets, 82 miles of county roads and 25 miles of Minnesota Department of Transportation trunk highways.\ RATING ST. PAUL’S STREETS \Public Works rates roads from 0 to 100 based on a Pavement Condition Index — the same measure established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers — with 0 being failed, 20 being serious, 40 being poor, 60 being fair, 80 being satisfactory and 100 being good.\GoodPointe Consulting, which worked with Public Works to analyze data for the report, assigned PCI scores to city streets based on municipal inspections that cover about a third of the city each year. St. Paul’s streets average a PCI score of 62, with notable variation among street types.\St. Paul’s arterial streets averaged a score of 55, or borderline poor and fair. Residential streets were 64, or fair. County streets were 71, or just barely satisfactory. And trunk highways scored a PCI of 54, which is poor.\Most cities in snowy, cold weather environments aim to keep road conditions between 60 and 70 if they can help it. Minneapolis streets average a PCI score of 70.\Des Moines, Iowa, averages 65, Cleveland averages 70, Boulder, Colo., averages 75, Omaha, Neb., reports averages of 64 and 72 depending upon the type of road, and Tulsa, Okla., is at 62.\According to the report, even streets that are constantly maintained are expected to survive no more than 60 years, maximum, before they need a full reconstruction, and the city isn’t hitting that target.\With current funding levels, arterial streets are on a 124-year reconstruction cycle. Residential streets would be reconstructed every 289 years if funding stays the same.\ $22M PER YEAR ON ROADWORK SHOULD BE $50M? \The report finds that the $22 million the city spends each year on roadwork would need to grow to about $50 million to move beyond the status quo and show actual improvements.\The city currently spends about $11 million annually maintaining arterial streets, including $8.5 million on reconstruction and $2.5 million on mill and overlay work.\The report states that the city needs to spend another $1 million per year just to maintain current levels and keep the PCI score at 55, or fair-to-poor. To reach a PCI score of 65, the city would need to invest an additional $4 million per year beyond current levels, or $5 million to hit a score of 70.\The city also spends about $11 million annually on residential streets, including $6.5 million on reconstruction and $4.5 million on sealcoating. Pothole patching adds at least another $4 million. Those numbers would need to increase by $20 million annually to maintain the status quo, or $24 million annually to show improvement.\ PREVENTION AND REPLACEMENT \The report looks at different types of prevention (seal coats, crack seals), rehabs (mill and overlays) and replacement (reconstructions).\It finds that St. Paul spends an average of $4 million to $6 million per year on pothole patching, which strains staffing and equipment when patching, sweeping and plowing must be done at virtually the same time. The report states that “this money could be gradually applied to paving if PCI’s were to improve.”\In 2014 and 2015, the city of St. Paul began mill and overlay treatment along 20 roads that were in especially tough shape — the “Terrible 20.” Most of those roads will need serious attention again within five years, given their age.\That’s because a rehab approach on asphalt roads is most beneficial when PCI scores are over 40 and the road is under 40 years old. The report states that most roads should be fully reconstructed when PCI scores fall below 40 or when the road is at the end of its useful life — every 50 to 60 years.\For instance, Fairview Avenue near Highland Parkway was milled in 2010, but the current PCI score has fallen to 47, or poor, just nine years later.\St. Paul does not mill and overlay residential streets, but the report suggests that should change.\Approximately 2 percent of city-owned streets are concrete pavements, and require joint maintenance every 20 years. For these roads, the report urges the city to create a new concrete rehab program similar to the existing mill and overlay program.\ WHAT CAN BE DONE? \How can the city raise funds and contain costs?\The report lists a series of potential approaches, including reducing miles traveled, refusing to build new travel lanes and demanding development agreements for new roads.\There’s also the possibility of reconstructing roads so they’re narrower, enforcing new or existing restrictions to minimize truck damage and experimenting with pavement mixes.\The report notes the city could find new funds through a gas tax increase, assessments for street improvements and Ramsey County projects, special service districts, sales taxes, property taxes, bonding referendums or user fees.\Currently, 159,000 workers are employed within the city limits, and 309,000 residents live there. The city has added 27,000 residents since 2010.\Crédito: Frederick Melo"
214,"The cost of fishing licenses and snowmobile registration would go up, and snowmobilers would have to comply with new safety rules, under a bill given final legislative approval Saturday.\Fishing license fees would rise from $13 to $15 for individuals, from $17.50 to $20.50 for a couple and from $4.50 to $5.50 for seniors.\The state's sport-fishing associations sought the increases as part of an effort to improve fisheries and habitat. Some legislators had objected to fee increases at a time of a record budget surplus.\Original fishing license proposals amounted to a 28 percent increase in fishing fees, but the approved bill shaves those hikes to about 15 percent.\In response to 32 deaths last winter from snowmobiling accidents, the most lethal winter since 1972, a slew of restrictions had been proposed.\The proposal requires snowmobilers under the age of 25 to acquire a training certificate by the year 2002, and tougher penalties for snowmobiling while intoxicated are contained in another bill.\The bill passed Saturday by the House and Senate raises the three-year registration fee from $30 to $45 and captures more of the gas tax for snowmobile programs. Nonresident snowmobilers would pay $15 for a trail stamp if they travel on state trails.\The bill also raises about $6 million more in fees for snowmobile trail and enforcement programs. But the bill was stripped of House provisions for mandatory liability insurance and lowering the speed limit from 50 miles per hour to 40 mph at night.\Total spending in the environment, natural resource and agriculture appropriations bill, which finances agencies dealing with pollution and natural resources, was $947.3 million, or about $8 million more than Gov. Arne Carlson's recommendation. However, the administration has not threatened to veto the bill."
215,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
216,"According to a DNR survey in 2012, 79 percent of Minnesotans opposed wolf hunting and trapping. Other 2013 polls indicate a large majority of Minnesotans and Wisconsinites want wolves to be protected, oppose trophy recreational wolf hunting, and the use of traps, bait and dogs to hunt wolves.\To reinforce the validity of these numbers, Michigan citizens overwhelmingly rejected two wolf-hunting bills in the November elections in the first statewide vote on wolf hunting in the nation. A 2013 poll shows most Americans support the Endangered Species Act.\Still, misinformation and misrepresentation persist. For instance, wolf depredation of livestock in Minnesota is minimal, and farmers are compensated at 100 percent of the estimated value of the livestock. Further, there are animal husbandry practices that can reduce the likelihood of wolf depredation and proven non-lethal management strategies to protect livestock.\Wolves do not have a negative impact on the number of deer. Former Wisconsin DNR biologist Adrian Wydeven stated, ""Wolves are not driving deer numbers down to dangerous levels. The biggest factor that affects our deer herd are winters and the hunting harvest. When wolves have established themselves, deer are going to be more elusive. ... They're harder to see, so it gives the impression there's a lot less deer.""\Indeed, scientists have documented the positive impacts that wolves have on ecosystems. They keep deer populations healthier by culling the sickest members of herds. By keeping the herds together and moving, they reduce overgrazing, providing more habitat for beavers, otters, muskrats, fish and waterfowl.\So why are the Minnesota DNR, state officials and some members of Congress not listening to the majority of their constituents?\Let's remind them to support the Endangered Species Act and stop state wolf hunts. Support policies for wolf protection, not killing!\Julie Andrzejewski\St. Cloud\Julie Andrzejewski, professor emeritus, Social Responsibility Program at St. Cloud State University, has published on the environment and the sixth mass extinction of species.\Put state tax dollars toward fixing roads\I am sick of hearing about our money going to trails, parks, an aquatics center and the arts. Those can wait a year or two.\All the surplus money in the budget should go to fixing the roads. They want free preschool, free two years of college. Now they want to raise our gas tax.\Let's use the money from the surplus. Our taxes could be going up for the new and remodeled schools. Tell your legislators and Gov. Mark Dayton: No more spending until we get the roads fixed.\Mary Mueller\St. Cloud"
217,"A Yea to the news that Minnesota's congressional delegation last year took fewer privately funded trips.\An Associated Press examination shows only half of the state's 10 congressional members took these trips, which came under scrutiny last year as part of the political scandal involving lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\The previous year, eight Minnesota members made trips, led by Sen. Norm Coleman, who made 12. In 2006, he made only three. Rep. Collin Peterson made the most trips last year with four. As chairman of the House Agricultural Committee, he said they were necessary in drafting a new farm bill.\Congressional travel records showed former 6th District Rep. Mark Kennedy made no trips.\Our annual Nay goes out to those ice anglers who fail to clean up after a day, week or season of fishing.\While minimal snow cover most of the winter has helped reduce some littering on the area's frozen lakes, the removal of fishing shelters this time of year always spotlights how much trash anglers leave behind.\For the sake of the environment - and the reputation of fellow anglers - strive to meet these three words: Leave No Trace.\A Yea to U.S. Rep. Jim Oberstar for testifying before the state Legislature about the importance of some sort of gas-tax increase for Minnesota.\It's hard to remember the last time a federal lawmaker came to lobby at the Capitol, especially one as high-ranking as Oberstar, who chairs the House Transportation Committee. That speaks volumes about this issue.\As we've noted before, the hang-up here is Gov. Tim Pawlenty. We just don't understand why the governor can't see this issue through the same ""user fee"" glasses he wore so often in boosting other revenue streams.\A Nay to those folks who initially complained about a plan to move the next Mississippi Music Fest to St. Cloud State University but then failed to attend a forum Thursday on campus to discuss those concerns.\The University Program Board set up the forum after getting complaints about the move from Riverside Park to campus. The complaints primarily came from an online group supposedly numbering 865 members. A common issue was the move to campus means no alcohol can be served.\But as a Times news report noted Friday, no students showed up for the forum."

But the problem is geopolitical, not geological: In the '80s the world discovered oil faster than it consumed it. ""Energy independence"" is as misguided a goal as ""food independence"" is for Japan. Still, U.S. gasoline is underpriced: The price at the pump doesn't reflect gas's environmental costs or the military costs of assuring stable world supplies. Let's tax it. 2/Only as part of a bona fide deficit reduction package - with cast-iron guarantees that Congress won't go on a spending spree with the proceeds. Deal must include budget reform (line item veto, enforceable spending limits). Which taxes? 1. Small hike in top rates, 2. gas tax (offset by EITC boost), 3. limit itemized deductions, 4. cap mortgage deduction, 5. replace health insurance exemption, 6. limit deductibility of state taxes, 7.

Developing alternative fuels will not only protect our national economy from the vicissitudes of world politics and will protect our environment. Our economy cannot tolerate a tripling of oil prices, nor should our values be the loss of U.S. lives to maintain 15 mpg automobiles. 2/The 1991 budget package should break with the cold war mentality, reduce Pentagon spending, stop redundant weapons systems and respond to our domestic concerns on jobs, health care, education, drug abuse, and infrastructure. Progressively raised revenues should be the foundation of a fair deficit reduction package. The top rate of income tax should be set at 33 percent so that the ""bubble"" is corrected to ensure that the wealthy pay at least as much as those less well off.

220,"While the recent stimulus bill focused attention on highway and transit ""shovel ready"" projects, the real heavy lifting will be done with the authorization of a new surface transportation bill, which is due for its six-year renewal by the end of September. \Except if it's done right, it won't be a renewal, but a reinvention. It's time to bring new approaches, new road vs. transit balance and, yes, new funding to upgrade America's transportation infrastructure. \""The federal government and Congress rewrite the surface transportation bill every six years, but it's really only once in a couple of decades when there is an opportunity for a groundswell of support to really do something different and take a fresh look at transportation policy,"" said James Corliss, director of Transportation for America, a public policy group advocating for transportation investment. The group urges new rules for the legislative road in a new report called ""The Route to Reform."" \But given Transportation for America's lofty ambitions, the four fundamental reforms the report suggests actually seem modest. That's probably less reflective of a lack of ambition and more indicative of how ad hoc the previous transportation bills may have been. For instance, the first reform suggested -- ""Develop a new national transportation vision with objectives and accountability for meeting performance targets"" -- should be the minimum for a bill that may be significantly larger than the current five-year, $286 billion version. \The next three suggested reforms are to restructure federal transportation programs and funding to support a new national transportation vision and objectives; reform transportation agencies and the decisionmaking process; and revise transportation finance to pay for needed investments. Those sensible reforms should be minimum benchmarks. Indeed, not having a measurable vision, objectives and accountability seems negligent, especially for a bill that will need bipartisan support. And new funding sources will need to be identified because the existing funding mechanism, the gas tax, may not raise enough revenue. \Two prominent politicians will give Minnesota considerable clout in crafting the bill. Sen. Amy Klobuchar sits on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will write the Senate's version of the bill. Even more influential will be Rep. James Oberstar, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. While the structure of what Klobuchar deems ""a process bill"" won't appropriate investment for specific projects, both need to push for what Robert Johns, the director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Transportation Studies, identifies as ""just a huge need for our existing infrastructure in bringing it back to an acceptable level."" \The bill should also push for a revision of the federal funding ratios used for highway and transit projects. If there were more federal funds available for mass transit, states such as Minnesota that are playing catch-up would have more of an incentive to invest their own transportation funds. \Most important, all involved need to go beyond the partisan positioning that has characterized Congress this year and craft a bill that reflects what infrastructure spending should be: an investment in safety, efficiency and global economic competitiveness. \. \THE MINNESOTA LESSON \""We are the shining example of how we have to fix infrastructure in this country."" \Sen. Amy Klobuchar, referring to the Interstate 35W bridge collapse"
221,"
WASHINGTON - Senate Democrats, divided over how to pay for President Barack Obama's jobs plan, on Wednesday tossed out the White House tax proposals and replaced them with one of their own: a tax increase on millionaires.
\
Obama's plan to increase taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 and joint filers making more than $250,000 was highly unpopular among some Democrats.
\
""Many of them are not rich,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. In many areas of the United States, he added, such an income ""does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that's associated with wealth in America.""
\
Obama's $447 billion proposal still faces huge trouble in the Democratic-run Senate, where it's expected to be considered next week. Sixty votes are needed to cut off extended debate, and Democrats control 53 of the 100 seats.
\
In addition, the package as a whole is ""dead"" in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said Monday.
\
But at least the millionaires' tax could spare Obama the embarrassment of Democrats abandoning him on a key issue, one that he's been campaigning for.
\
When Senate Democrats returned this week from a weeklong recess, many expressed reservations about different elements of Obama's plan, including the proposal to limit itemized deductions for individuals earning more than $200,000 and joint filers making more than $250,000.
\
Other lawmakers from energy-producing states were annoyed about the plan to close oil and gas tax loopholes.
\
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who opposes the Obama initiative, tried to get the Senate to take an up-or-down vote on the jobs plan, but Democratic leaders blocked the effort.
\
On Wednesday, the package changed, as the Obama taxes were replaced by a 5 percent surtax on income of more than $1 million.
\
Republicans, who have been adamantly opposed to tax increases, immediately signaled they would not go along.
\
""Republicans have identified areas of common ground where we can work with the president and Democrats to create a better environment for job creation,"" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""That should be our focus, not desperate tax hike gimmicks floated to cover up divisions within the Democratic caucus.""
\
At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said the administration's priority is passing the legislation and it's open to suggestions for how to pay for it. Carney said he wasn't fully familiar with the Senate proposal, but he suggested it's one ""we think would work.""
\
The current top tax rate is 35 percent. Democrats estimate that taxing millionaires will raise the $447 billion Obama needs to implement his jobs plan. The plan, which would boost spending for road construction, schools and aid to the unemployed, and cut the Social Security payroll tax, is still expected to go nowhere as a complete package.

222,"Minneapolis and St. Paul didn't need the automobile to become cities. But the car helped them spawn the Twin Cities metropolitan area.\Until the early 1900s, horses and carriages, railroads, riverboats, streetcars, wagons, sleds and shoe leather moved people and goods around just fine in a compact urban area that took root on the Mississippi's riverbanks. Not until horsepower replaced horses did the destiny of the Twin Cities area become set in concrete and asphalt running to the horizon.\The car drove urban and suburban growth, spreading people and businesses beyond and between the spokes of rail lines. Unfettered by ocean or mountain range, the area spilled in all directions. Urban trappings sewers, paved roads, factories and offices began transforming communities with bucolic names: Richfield, Maplewood, Golden Valley.\Just as highways fed growth, growth fed the highways. Result: congestion, wider roads, more congestion and controls such as metered freeway entrance ramps. Nearly 50 years after Twin Cities trolleys carried their last transit passengers, there are renewed calls to rebuild rail transit.\Besides its impact on mobility, the car and its supporting services shaped both the Twin Cities landscape and the built environment.\In neighborhoods, garages replaced barns, and many became the dominant architectural element of people's houses.\Parking ramps, an entirely new phenomenon, sprouted on valuable downtown real estate. In the suburbs, parking lots became vehicular lakes around commercial islands.\As traffic grew, intersection control became predictable as a semaphore: uncontrolled crossings became two-way stops, which became four-way stops, which graduated to traffic lights, which gave way to over- and underpasses.\Gas stations, drive-in restaurants, drive-in theaters, drive-through banks, motels, truck stops, car washes and car dealers became metropolitan fixtures. Urban freeways such as Interstate Hwy. 35W sliced through established neighborhoods, becoming simultaneously a vital, bustling artery and an open wound.\The scenic and development impact of the proposed bridge over the St. Croix River near Stillwater is the latest extension of this contentious highway heritage.\Public dollars proved as crucial in the car's (and land speculators') success as they had in building the railroads. Federal aid built roads and freeways between 1956 and 1991. Minnesota locked in the gas tax and license fees as sources of revenue.\People paid because their cars had become more than transportation tools; they grew into social amenities on wheels: places in which to be alone and to escape, to gather friends, to make love, to smoke with impunity, to listen to any music at any volume and to flaunt their economic well-being. Transit was undistinguished mass movement; autos were individual status symbols.\And their exhaust was less messy than horse manure."

224,"Note: See microfilm for chart.\Minnesota drivers appear to have taken a historic turn by driving less - or at least no farther - than they used to. \Since 2004, car and truck drivers have covered roughly 56 billion miles each year, after decades of nearly unbroken annual increases. \If drivers have indeed hit a ceiling, it would have broad implications, beginning with highway building plans and including statewide goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \""Something is really happening here,"" said Barb Thoman, program director for Transit for Livable Communities and a member of a state climate change advisory panel. ""It changes our assumptions about transportation. It makes it a little bit easier to achieve the goal [of reduced greenhouse gas emissions] than it would be if we thought people were going to drive as much as they did in the last 15 years."" \State analysts are convinced the change is for real. \""If it's one or two years, maybe it's a hiccup. But four years starts making a trend,"" said Frank Pafko, director of the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT)'s office of environmental services, who has worked on the recent figures that were compiled in December. \Transportation accounts for about 25 percent of the state's greenhouse gas emissions. Because of that, it has been one of the key areas targeted for emissions-reduction strategies by the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group, which will have its final meeting today before its recommendations go to Gov. Tim Pawlenty and the Legislature. \Among that group's proposals has been a goal of not just capping but reducing VMT, the insiders' term for ""vehicle miles traveled."" Proposals to make that happen include changes in urban land use and design, providing more mass transit and other commuting options and removing subsidies and other public and private incentives that favor solo driving. \But even without any major new policies, the MnDOT numbers now seem to show there's been a small but significant change in Minnesotans' driving habits. Projections now call for a 0.9 percent annual growth rate in VMT to about 2030. That's less than half as steep as the line rose in the past. \. \Why is anybody's guess \Many who have studied the dynamics point immediately to rising gas prices - more than concern for the environment - as the reason why people might not be driving as much as they used to. Twin Cities average gas prices were just under $1 per gallon in December 2001, hit $2 in May 2004, and $3 in July 2006, according to GasBuddy.com. \A handful of readers who responded to a Star Tribune online query indicated that gas prices are a main reason they've cut back on driving. But several cited decisions they made more than a decade ago to reduce their commuting stress by taking jobs closer to home, or moving closer to work, or telecommuting. \MnDOT's Pafko added that baby boomers might be driving less as they retire. John Adams, associate dean of the University of Minnesota's Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and a retired geography professor, said the state's rate of population increase has also slowed and the number of high-driving 20-somethings has leveled off. At the same time, high-density living has increased, both in the metro and outstate Minnesota. A lagging economy may also mean less driving, Adams said. \. \A whole mix of reasons \""It's a consequence of a lot of things going on, rather than an explicit choice to drive less,"" Adams said. \Pafko added that the new numbers will change some of the long-range road and highway plans for MnDOT as well as local governments. That's because road-building revenues come in part from the gas tax. Indeed, that income has been flat since 2004. \Could the mileage traveled each year actually decline? The climate advisory panel has wrestled with goals calling for steep rollbacks in per capita mileage by 2025, as well as the even tougher standard of an overall decline despite a likely population increase. \Scott Lambert, executive vice president of the Minnesota Automobile Dealers Association, said he thinks it will be difficult to get Minnesotans to change their driving habits that dramatically, even with changes in urban layout land use and other policies. \""It's all a big challenge,"" he said. \. \Bill McAuliffe - 612-673-7646 \. \MINNESOTA'S DRIVING MILEAGE \After decades of nearly unbroken increases, driving mileage in Minnesota appears to have flattened. \Minnesota vehicle miles traveled, in billions \1990: 39.4 \2007: 56.7 \2030 proj.: 69.7 \Source: Minnesota Dept. of Transportation \(See microfilm for chart.)"
225," One might expect someone named Pillsbury to frown on DFL proposals to hike the income tax bills of well-heeled Minnesotans - as George Pillsbury does.\ But think not that the retired Pillsbury Co. executive and former GOP state senator is merely looking out for himself and his Lake Minnetonka crowd - or for his party's young governor, to whom he's partial. John Sargent and Eleanor Lawler Pillsbury raised their six children as much on Minnesota boosterism and public service as on Pillsbury's Best flour. No son of theirs would judge state tax policy purely on the basis of self-interest or partisan gain.\ George Pillsbury dislikes quite a few of the spending reductions that Gov. Tim Pawlenty has proposed. He is willing to pay higher state taxes to avert them. He's particularly interested in putting the sales tax on clothing, and in a higher gas tax. But he rejects higher income taxes on the most affluent Minnesotans.\ ""I don't like the idea of trying to line up the rich vs. the poor,"" 81-year-old Pillsbury said in a recent interview. ""That's really not the battle. The battle is, how best can you help everybody?""\ There's a good question. It's one that hasn't been asked often enough this year in St. Paul, as lawmakers have been chewing on budget proposals that do a lot more dividing than uniting.\ Gov. Tim Pawlenty's no-new-taxes budget largely spares the affluent and the suburbs, while burdening the poor, the inner cities and Greater Minnesota. The DFLers who control the Senate responded with kinder cuts but a tax jolt for high-income Minnesotans: a new 9.4 percent rate on income above $135,000 for a single taxpayer, $250,000 for joint filers.\ DFLers justify socking the rich by noting that tax cuts in 1999, 2000 and 2001 accrued greatly to their benefit. (That may explain why a lot of Minnesotans don't quite recall getting a tax cut in those years.) Further, the biggest earners in Minnesota pay a lower percentage of their income in state and local taxes than the middle class - less than 10 percent, vs. 12 percent. And that's before taking into account the federal income tax deduction for state income taxes.\ They make a strong case, but Pillsbury makes what might be a better one: Minnesota needs to compete with other states - and most other states give the rich an even better tax deal than does Minnesota. Increasing taxes only at the high end of the income spectrum would drive affluent people away - just when the first baby boomer retirees become footloose.\ ""I go back to thinking of the state of Minnesota as a competitive organization with the other states,"" he said. ""We have got to be able to provide an environment for our citizens so that people will want to move to Minnesota, will want to stay here, will want to work here and do business here.""\ Competitive considerations lead Pillsbury to a sales tax on clothing. It's a change that would not make Minnesota an outlier among the states; only three other states exempt all clothing purchases from taxation. Moreover, it's progressive. Rich guys really do buy $1,000 suits.\ Community-building considerations lead Pillsbury to the conclusion that a tax increase is needed. Pawlenty's cuts in services to the poor go too deep, Pillsbury says. ""You cannot leave people behind."" He dislikes a four-year freeze on public employees' salaries. ""We never did that at the Pillsbury Co.""\ Pillsbury has fewer qualms about squeezing state and local governments into greater efficiency. In fact, it's his favorite idea. For 20 years, he has been the godfather of the push for a unicameral legislature in Minnesota. This year, he'd carry that idea way past the disbanding of the Minnesota Senate, to wholesale consolidation and reorganization of metro, county and municipal government.\ Push a reform strategy, rather than cuts in assistance to the poor, and Pawlenty could emerge as a reformer rather than a miser, a uniter rather than a divider. That would align Pawlenty better with the best Minnesota leaders, of both parties. It would be more in concert with what Pillsbury says is at the core of the values brought to this state by its pioneers: ""We want to help everybody succeed."" He would know.\ .\ Lori Sturdevant is a Star Tribune editorial writer and columnist. She is at lsturdevant@startribune.com."
226,"
Taxpayers frantically filing their 1040s -- as well as anyone following the spending and deficit debate in Washington -- may be asking where exactly their tax dollars are going.
\
Some believe most spending goes to welfare and foreign aid. Others believe defense and corporate welfare dominate the budget. In realty, Social Security and Medicare are the largest programs, and are set to nearly double over the next decade.
\
Overall, Washington will spend $32,137 per household in 2011 -- the highest level in American history (adjusted for inflation). It will collect $18,295 per household in taxes. The remaining $13,841 represents this year's staggering budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Government spending has increased by $5,000 per household since 2008, and nearly $10,000 per household over the past decade. Yet there is no free lunch: If spending is not reined in, then eventually taxes must also rise by $10,000 per household.
\
Washington will spend this $32,137 per household as follows (all numbers adjusted for inflation):
\
Social Security/Medicare: $10,458. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of Social Security's and some of Medicare's costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. Unless these programs are reformed, paying all promised benefits would eventually require doubling all income tax rates.
\
Defense: $6,465. The defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment. Lawmakers drastically reduced defense spending following the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the $2,800 per household increase since 2000 has returned defense spending closer to its historical levels (but still lower than during previous wars).
\
Anti-poverty programs: $5,374. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. President George W. Bush increased anti-poverty spending to record levels, and it has grown an additional 29 percent since the end of 2008 under President Barack Obama.
\
Interest on the federal debt: $1,739. The federal government is $14 trillion in debt. It owes $10 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raided annually before the program fell into permanent deficit last year). Record-low interest rates have recently held down these costs. However, the national debt is set to double by 2020, which will combine with higher interest rates to raise annual interest costs to nearly $6,000 per household.
\
Veterans' benefits: $1,190. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending has leapt 147 percent over the past decade.
\
Unemployment benefits: $1,135. Unemployment costs have nearly tripled since the recession began.
\
Education: $698. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. The federal education budget has jumped 83 percent since 2000. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
Health research/regulation: $552. This spending is up 56 percent over the decade, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
Highways/mass transit: $522. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached.
\
Justice administration: $510. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law-enforcement grants. New homeland security costs have added $100 per household to justice spending.
\
The programs listed above cover $28,643 per household. The remaining $3,494 is allocated to all other federal programs, including international affairs, natural resources, the environment, regional development, farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers -- and the next generation that will be paying nearly half of the bill -- must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.

227,"Note: SOUTH ONLY\Arts school would be more waste \Per an article in the Star Tribune regarding the Burnsville, Eagan, Savage school district: \""The board gave school staff the go-ahead to plan for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) schools... The staff will also plan a fine- and performing-arts school that will be a collaboration between Nicollet Junior High, Burnsville High School and the city of Burnsville's Performing Arts Center, which is under construction. The district intends to hire four staff members to start the planning, and the final decision to open the schools will be put before the school board this fall."" \Remember the referendum that narrowly passed in November, to ""sustain existing and necessary program funding""? Now ISD 191 is hiring new staff to plan for a program that would affect what percentage of the student enrollment? The city of Burnsville, against significant objection from the majority of its citizens, pushed forward with the construction of a $20+ million Performing Arts Center and a parking ramp. Now the school district administration is spending what the recently retired superintendent referred to as ""critical budget resources"" creating a program to use this facility which has little use. \Is there no accountability with Burnsville officials other than some sort of ballot every few years? \MARK A. HAUGEN \BURNSVILLE \Sex ed program should be praised \The Shakopee School system Sex Education program should be applauded and not critiqued because of the honest, unadulterated look at the changes male and female bodies undertake. Keeping boys and girls together is appropriate and needs to be encouraged. As the instructor informs the sixth grader of the changes both the male and female will expect to experience, the children can have open dialogue, which can lead to breaking down barriers between the sexes. \CHRIS LUND \HAMBURG \How you invest can change the world \Ever since the release of ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" it seems that the nation is undergoing a sea change regarding the importance of environmental sustainability. Everywhere I look, I see articles about ""being green."" \And, people seem to be listening. I tried to buy a push reel lawn mower today at Sears, but was told that they were sold out. This, I take to be a hopeful sign for our environment. Companies will follow sales. However, it seems to me that if we really want to ""be green,"" another consideration, often overlooked, has to do with our financial investments. Environmentally and socially responsible investing seems to be rarely discussed in the media and among individuals and even more rarely practiced. Most mutual funds, for instance, invest in companies that are not sustainable (e.g., big oil). Imagine the pressure that could be placed on less sustainable companies if large numbers of ordinary investors started shifting their assets to companies more committed to the greater good and lobbying for change in these ways. \Further attention to environmentally and socially responsible investing by the Star Tribune also would be helpful. Buying green may be good, but green investing might be even better. \ANDY TIX \HASTINGS \Turning the tables on the green crowd \Perhaps liberal environmentalists will ask Congress to impose windfall taxes on renewable energy profits. After all, addressing global warming is all about our children, grandchildren and planet's health -- profit motive has no bearing, whatsoever, on the scaremongering. Therefore, renewable energy profits should be capped with excesses being redistributed to homeless shelters and bridge repairs. Any liberal environmentalists care to put your money where your mouths are on that? \JOHN RAUSTADT \PRIOR LAKE \Who has a plan to reduce gas costs? \I would like to know why the candidate that talks about change won't leave me any. Sen. Barack Obama indicated this week on television that he supports higher gas prices for Americans; he simply doesn't think the price spike should have happened so suddenly. \Regardless of how and why the spike occurred, Sen. Obama, as a leader in Congress and a presidential candidate, should at least offer some leadership on how fuel can be made more affordable in the near term. Sen. McCain offered a plan to suspend the federal gas tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day and Sen. Obama has criticized that proposal. \Well, Sen. Obama, what is your plan to ease the costs on American families? Is it possible you don't have one, since you think higher gas prices are a good thing? \NATHAN KRAHN \EAGAN"
228,"The Aug. 7 headline reading “St. Paul streets in ‘fair’ condition” comes as no surprise to us readers. As a driver I would say that that average rating is charitable.\The recommended solution is large additional funding for road maintenance for the next 20 years. But wait, the people’s mantra continues loud and strong — no new taxes. Our roads, bridges, sewers, and water supply systems continue to age and deteriorate. They won’t fix themselves and they don’t get fixed without using money. But where is that money going to come from?\How about an increase in the gas tax strictly dedicated to road maintenance. It wouldn’t take much of a bump up to produce sizable revenue to get the needed funds. We need to quit kicking this can down the road and act responsibly now.\Mike Koenigsberger, West St. Paul\ Dog park disconnect \This letter is meant to shed light on the proposed dog park at Hamline and Ayd Mill. The intent is to show how the neighboring community, who will be most impacted, was left out of the process.\In January 2018, a biased survey was passed out to the community in regard to the dog park. The survey was presented as if this dog park was already happening. It asked what amenities the neighborhood would like to see at the dog park, how they would get to the park, what dog park(s) they already use, and if there were suggestions for names of the park. The survey did not ask if people wanted a dog park or if there were concerns regarding the proposed location. Many neighbors reached out to the surveyor and to the city, after the survey, requesting more information and asking to be kept current on its direction. There was no further community outreach. Now, that same biased survey has been used to develop a Community Engagement Report that paints the community as 100 percent supportive of the development plan and mentions no community opposition or concerns.\The neighborhood has many concerns with this land being turned into a dog park. Here are just a few:\The intersection is already incredibly congested and arguably dangerous to walk through, car accidents are a regular occurrence here.\Parking is limited for residents and added traffic will compound the issue.\Neighboring homeowners are commonly affected by theft and break-ins near the proposed dog park and are worried this gives reason for people to linger in the area.\The proposed park would abut the alley road that already is far too narrow, according to Saint Paul city code. This would leave residents’ garages virtually unusable for their vehicles. With being adjacent to Ayd Mill Road, noise is an ongoing issue and a dog park would only add to the frustration of homeowners.\We neighbors attended the Environment and Parks Committee meeting of Union Park District Council in July. We were given some time to voice our concerns and ask questions, but received very few actual answers from the council member directing the meeting and next to no response from the surveyor who created the Community Engagement Report. We were told to respect the process, which had ignored us from the beginning. Thankfully, a few members had concerns based on what we shared and voted to table the dog park lease for the next meeting. We are left in limbo and are unsure what this means for next steps. We have reached out via a new survey we created to see if neighbors in the community actually want this dog park and what concerns/if any they have — we’ve received many responses both for and against the dog park, along with a long list of concerns (including concerns from those who want the dog park) all of which will be shared with Union Park District Council.\We fully intend to hold the entire council accountable to their mission statement: “The Union Park District Council is a nonprofit neighborhood organization that elevates community voices in local decision-making. Through our committees, events, and community outreach, we engage all those who live, work, learn and play in Union Park.”\There is an apparent disconnect in the process of how we got to this point. Our hope is with more awareness and community discussion about how development works and is approached, from beginning to end, the disconnect can be mended. Our community members can then have a voice in what happens in their backyard.\Justin Spanier, St. Paul\Crédito: Letter Writers"
229," Senate DFLers on Tuesday proposed taking almost half the pot of money earmarked this year for sales tax rebates and using it to accelerate road and bridge repair and improve transit service.\ The proposed diversion of $425 million of the projected surplus for transportation spending sets up a struggle among the DFL- controlled Senate, the Republican-controlled House and Gov. Jesse Ventura that probably won't be played out until the end of the legislative session in May.\ Ventura and House Republicans have said this year's entire surplus, projected at $925 million, should be returned as rebates.\ But Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, DFL-Erskine, told a highway group Tuesday that he wants to leave $500 million of the surplus for rebates and use the balance - $425 million - toward a $500 million one-time transportation package. The additional $75 million for the package would come from another projected surplus in the 2002-03 budget cycle.\ The $500 million in one-time spending would be on top of more than $1 billion that the state has earmarked for road and bridge spending over the next two years. That does not include federal highway money.\ ""This is a reasonable proposal,"" Moe told the Highway Construction Industry Council, a federation of more than 175 contractors, suppliers and other businesses interested in funding for the state's road system.\ Moe said the proposed $500 million for transportation, coupled with about $500 million approved in the last legislative session, would provide a jump start on improving regional highways in outstate Minnesota, breaking up bottlenecks in the metro area and improving the bus system.\ He said using the surplus is warranted because Minnesotans want a better transportation system. ""This is deferred maintenance,"" he said.\ And part of the surplus accrued because spending on roads, bridges and transit has been put off, he said.\ ""This is not a solution to everything,"" Moe told the group. ""We need a permanent, long-range solution.""\ Sviggum favors full rebate\ House Speaker Steve Sviggum disagreed with Moe's plan to tap the 2001 surplus. ""We want to keep faith with the commitment we made with the state of Minnesota"" to give back all the 2001 surplus, he replied when asked about Moe's plan.\ As part of an earlier budget agreement, the 2001 surplus was considered reserved for a rebate. However, the law isn't that precise. It stipulates that the surplus must be designated as ""available for rebate.""\ In December, Moe proposed setting aside the 2001 surplus for an endowment, and using the interest from it for one-time needs in transportation, environment, infrastructure and other areas. That was his own suggestion, not an official position of the DFL caucus he leads.\ Moe's top aide, Vic Moore, said Tuesday that the endowment proposal was one of several ideas Moe was considering as an alternative to a 100 percent rebate of the surplus.\ Transportation Commissioner Elwyn Tinklenberg, who officially has no funding proposal before the Legislature this year, was asked whether he will advise the governor to oppose using surplus money for roads.\ ""This keeps the discussion alive,"" he responded. ""The governor challenged them to put out a [transportation funding] proposal.""\ John Wodele, the governor's communication's director, was more direct.\ ""The governor made a commitment to the people during his election that he would rebate the surpluses at the end of the biennium [June 30, 2001], and he is standing by that commitment,"" he said.\ Sen. Dean Johnson, DFL-Willmar, chairman of the Transportation and Public Safety Budget subcommittee, said the infusion of one-time money would speed up construction schedules. ""There's roads all over Minnesota that are going to be fixed,"" he said.\ House Republicans are considering ways to pump more money into roads, but so far have held the 2001 rebate plan inviolate.\ Sviggum reiterated Tuesday that House Republicans are considering a constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would transfer part of the sales tax on motor vehicles from the general fund to the highway fund. That would provide a permanent increase.\ Last year, at the governor's urging, the Legislature reduced the cost of annual vehicle license tabs, depleting the highway trust fund about $170 million a year.\ So far, legislators have used surplus revenues to make up that loss, but they are searching for a permanent fix.\ This year, Ventura has asked the Legislature to reduce tab fees again, to a maximum of $75 per vehicle. That would take about another $170 million from the trust fund each year. An increase in the state gasoline tax has been considered. It has been at 20 cents a gallon since 1988. But Sviggum and House Taxes Chairman Ron Abrams, R- Minnetonka, said Tuesday that a gas tax increase isn't in the cards.\ Robert Whereatt can be contacted at rwhereatt@startribune.com"

I know it was extremely careless, but I risked my life Jan. 6 and left the house. I guess when I saw we still had power and the sun had come up, I got brave. As I departed in my many layers, I was stunned that my truck started. I got even braver and decided to attempt my normal routine of a coffee stop at Holiday, and then go pick up my mail. I departed my driveway carefully since I expected frozen bodies of other fools to be everywhere. However, there were none, and I even crossed paths with other careless, but brave, individuals who were also doing their morning routine. I made it home safe and sound, very thankful that I had been blessed with uneventful travels.
\
In deep reflection after this excursion, my hope is that someday we will return to a country where everything isn't based on how wimpy, skinny-jean-wearing, hair-tinting so-called men are affected. My hope is that the ""wussification"" of this once-great country will stop and be reversed so that cold weather -- in January, in Minnesota --becomes normal again, and not a reason for extended news coverage, grocery runs and panic. Sadly, I am not hopeful.

A different model
\
""Our move to Texas"" (Jan. 2), contrasting the ""low-tax, good services"" environment of Texas with Minnesota needs a reality check. Texas taxpayers benefit because their state has more natural gas and oil shales than any other state and their government revenue streams are dominated by oil and natural gas revenues, a source of revenue Minnesota is not blessed with. Texas is projecting a 2014-2015 biennium surplus due largely to those revenues being $2 billion more than anticipated; Texas will also use oil revenues to fund a $2 billion State Water Plan and almost $1 billion in transportation projects. The state's Rainy Day fund of $8 billion is almost entirely funded by Texas' oil and natural gas severance tax. This oil and gas revenue growth has been going on for more than 10 years. The latest oil and gas tax binge takes pressure off passing an income tax, but still hits the average Texas family with a $1,562 per capita payment for property taxes, 11 percent higher than Minnesota.
\
This good fortune has virtually nothing to do with whether the government is liberal or conservative.
\
The real test is how these benefits impact the lives of Texans. A Dallas TV station notes, ""Texas politicians like to tout the state's economic growth, but more and more Texans are finding themselves teetering on the edge of poverty ... 27.7 percent of Texas households have no financial cushion in case of an emergency. If you exclude homes and automobiles from the calculation, a full 50 percent of Texans have no assets they could use to survive if they suddenly lost their income ... even if Texans survived the last economic storm, another one would swamp them.""
\
Texas ranks as the 39th-best state in the country for economic security for its families. Minnesota ranks ninth-best.
\
And how is Texas doing in combating poverty? Whether it is through state services or economic growth, there are much lower percentages of people in economic distress in Minnesota than in Texas. In Texas, 17.9 percent live below the poverty line, ranking it 40th in the nation. Minnesota has about 11.4 percent in poverty, near the best in the country. For children, it is worse. In Texas, 26 percent of children live in poverty (39th in the country). Minnesota is tied for fourth-best with 14.6 percent of children in poverty.
\
Education: In 2012, the Texas Legislature cut per-student spending for the first time since World War II and cut $1 billion out of programs that have proven successful in boosting student achievement.
\
Jobs? Minnesota private nonfarm employment is growing faster than the national rate. Since October 2012, the state has gained 50,000 more jobs than it has lost. The national unemployment level is 7.1 percent. Texas's unemployment rate is 6.2 percent. Minnesota's unemployment rate is at 4.8 percent, with strong factory hiring.
\
Average Minnesotans make more money than average Texans. The median income for both households and on a per-capita basis is more than the national average in Minnesota and below the national average in Texas. The median household income in Minnesota is $7,500 a year higher, even though Texas has more adults in an average household. Minnesota's per-capita income is almost $5,000 more per person.
\
In Texas, if you are well off, the world looks rosy. Minnesota has a different model: We build our economic power through lifting all boats, not just the ones containing the already well-off.

231,"washington - The White House on Wednesday fleshed out the plans President Obama announced in the State of the Union address to repair the nation's ailing infrastructure.\A summary of the plan, which. Obama discussed in interviews, was obtained by The New York Times. The draft sounds three major themes that Obama has discussed since he was first a candidate for the presidency, but with initiatives intended to engage in work that minimizes the need for Congressional approval and which can capitalize on private investment to help start projects.\The first element of the plan is a ""fix it first"" policy that calls for investing $50 billion in transportation infrastructure, subject to Congressional approval. Fully $40 billion of that amount would be directed to work on the highways, bridges, transit systems and airports ""most in need of repair,"" the document said.\There are 70,000 bridges classified as ""structurally deficient"" in the United States -- 11.5 percent of all highway bridges. More than 1,100 of them are in Minnesota, one of the few states that has raised its gas tax and significantly increased funding for highway and bridge rehabilitation.\While that does not mean that all of them are unsafe, it does suggest an urgency in the kinds of repairs that could keep them from becoming unsafe. The White House estimates that 80 percent of those bridges could be brought up to date under the program.\Call to lawmakers\The second part of the plan would draw on private investment from across the nation and around the world for federal, state and local projects. It revives the president's call for creation of a National Infrastructure Bank, which could bring public and private financing together to plan projects. The proposal would also allow issuing new America Fast Forward bonds to follow up on the Build America Bonds program from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\The third portion of the plan would work to eliminate red tape in permits and review for infrastructure projects. This effort would build on a White House initiative to speed up plans for projects like harbor deepening and surface transportation. The administration has said modernizing the process of permits and review can ""create better outcomes for communities and the environment.""\The goal of the plan is not just to make the nation safer, according to the proposal, but to create jobs ""that cannot be outsourced.""\Obama discussed the initiatives during the State of the Union address and urged lawmakers to join him in support of transportation proposals. ""I know that you want these job-creating projects in your districts,"" he said. ""I've seen you all at the ribbon-cuttings.""\'Important shift'\After hearing a general description of the proposal, Robert Puentes, director of the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative, said that while some of the announcement had been on the president's agenda for some time, ""the important shift seems to be the administration is not waiting for the legislature,"" but is ""maximizing the things they can do themselves.""\Puentes expressed enthusiasm for the infusion of more private capital into infrastructure investment. ""This is not going to solve all our infrastructure problems -- we still have a long way to go,"" he said, adding that private money cannot meet all of the nation's needs. However, he said, ""this will go a long way.""\Phineas Baxandall, program director for tax and budget policy at U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, applauded the idea that ""fix it first"" will be part of the administration's plan. His group issued a report in 2010, ""Road Work Ahead,"" that sounded some of the same themes, calling for ""fix it first"" policies ""that give priority to maintenance of our existing roads and bridges."" The problem with such policies, Mr. Baxandall said, is that states do not like being told how to spend their infrastructure money, and ""right now there's very little accountability for results in transportation policy.""\""It will be very welcome if they are being concrete about it,"" he said.\Washington Bureau correspondent Kevin Diaz contributed to this report.\ROADS PLAN\Fix it first policy: Invest $50 billion in transportation infrastructure, subject to Congressional approval.\National Infrastructure Bank: Could bring public and private financing together to plan projects.\Cut red tape: Eliminate red tape in permits and review for infrastructure projects.\Credit: JOHN SCHWARTZ"
232,"The steadily rising price of oil represents a gift that keeps on giving to our political leaders.\As the cost of oil grows more exorbitant, stretching the already stretched budgets of American households, elected officials are provided with an endless opportunity to seduce voters with simplistic proposals they claim will provide relief from this economic burden. Such vacuous efforts know no ideological boundaries, as Hillary Clinton and John McCain proved by issuing another call for a federal gas tax holiday.\However, the Republican Party has demonstrated an exceptional ability to draft legislation on this issue that serves no purpose beyond pandering to the electorate, exemplified by its 2004 proposal for a $100 gasoline rebate. Party leader have outdone themselves with the irresponsible ""No More Excuses Energy Act."" The bill, introduced to Minnesota voters by our Congresswoman Rep. Michele Bachmann, has several reprehensible components.\It would end the prohibition against off-shore drilling for oil and natural gas on the outer continental shelves of the United States. The proposal also represents yet another shot at opening Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for energy source development. Finally, the legislation contains one more attempt to promote construction of new refineries.\The Bush administration, apparently forgetting the president's concern about our nation's ""addiction to oil,"" has voiced its approval of such measures. Presidential candidate McCain, reversing a previously stated position on this issue, also supports drilling offshore but, for the moment, is against exploitation of ANWR.\In her comments regarding our untapped oil reserves, Bachmann blamed the federal government, otherwise known as Democrats, for high gas prices through its interference with access to ""this wonderful resource."" She claimed unrestricted drilling would drop gas prices to $2 per gallon within four years, in part by curbing speculation among commodities traders.\Finally, displaying sensitivity to the worries of environmentalists, Bachmann reassured skeptics that use of ANWR would create ""enhancement of wildlife expansion."" As an eco-friendly conservative, she highlighted the importance of warm oil pipelines serving as a ""meeting ground and coffee klatch"" for caribou.\I find the absurdity of these remarks psychologically painful, even if one ignores the patronizing observations regarding the environment and caribou. Bachmann's tired conservative rhetoric on the benefits of government deregulation blithely ignores how such measures fostered a multitude of disasters during the Bush years.\Her estimate of the economic benefits of unrestricted drilling is a gross exaggeration. Last year the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. government projected offshore drilling access would not have an impact on domestic crude oil prices before 2030. Once tapped, the amount available would have an ""insignificant"" effect on the price of these commodities within the international market given rising world demand.\Similarly, recent calculations by the EIA suggested the economic advantages of drilling ANWR would be equally insignificant, cutting the price per barrel of oil by 1 percent or less by 2027.\As opposed to our legislators, commodities traders pay attention to the nuances of their market. These feeble statistics would not alter the behavior of energy speculators. I have heard no explanation as to how increased refining capacity, a measure which escalates oil consumption through production of gasoline, decreases the cost of oil.\Bachmann may have touched upon something useful in her comment on commodities traders. Speculation bets by large investment funds and foreign interests may be a factor in determining the price of oil, perhaps fostered by the collapse of the housing market and deficits in trading regulation. In this light a Senate subcommittee is evaluating the role played by large corporations, pension funds and university endowments in the rising price of food and oil.\Unfortunately, the above point, as well as the drivel within the No More Energy Excuses Act, diverts attention from reality. Oil is not the answer to our long-term energy needs. A brief surge in oil supply will not ""give us time"" to implement other solutions. The oil crises of the 1970s demonstrated our ability to talk a good game regarding alternative energy sources, only to forget our noble intentions once oil supply increased. Like any good addict, out nation made a collective decision then to ""quit later."" There is no reason to believe we would behave differently this time.\A Rasmussen poll from June 17 suggested two thirds of Americans regard offshore drilling as a viable solution to high gas prices. Such incorrect perceptions are fostered by elected officials who promote bad policy for the sake of political gain.\Good energy policy incorporates conservation, efficient consumption and promotion of viable alternative energy sources. Sadly, it is easier to please voters with empty-headed legislation that requires no sacrifice or change in lifestyle on their part. I understand that this approach is ""politics as usual,"" but at some point such juvenile tactics need to stop, especially in regard to an issue as critically important as this.\This is the opinion of Dave Shuster, a St. Cloud resident whose column is published the first Sunday of the month."
233,"A $151 billion transportation bill that awaits final congressional approval would send Minnesota about $1.9 billion over the next six years, including $1 million a year for a highway research institute at the University of Minnesota.\ Passage had been expected last night, but partisan disagreements over tax cuts to stimulate the economy delayed final action, possibly until next month. The bill has been approved by House-Senate negotiators and President Bush is expected to sign the legislation quickly, in part because of its economic significance. It could create more than 4 million jobs.\ The bill, financed by the Highway Trust Fund and the extension of a 2.5 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, provides unprecedented funding for highways ($119 billion) and mass transit ($31.5 billion) and gives states and metropolitan areas more flexibility in spending the money.\ The legislation encourages research, safety in automobile design and more decision-making power for state and local governments. For example, a new $24 billion surface transportation program allows up to half the funds to be used for mass transit projects, at the discretion of local officials. Areas that have trouble complying with the Clean Air Act will be able to use all of the funds for mass transit.\ ""It's a radically different bill . . . because it offers so much more flexibility to the states,"" Kelly Shannon, spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said in an interview.\ For Minnesota, the bill's passage will mean more highway money will come into the state next year than the state contributes to the Highway Trust Fund, a change from last year. In 1992, 102 cents will flow to Minnesota for each dollar paid in the gas tax.\ The legislation will fund some long-planned projects in the metro area: $38 million for the Bloomington-Ferry Bridge; $8.7 million for Hwy. 212 between Eden Prairie and Cologne; $11.6 million for improvement of 77th St. in Richfield, and $19.9 million for widening Hiawatha Av.\ The University of Minnesota will receive $1 million a year for the next six years to set up the ""Intelligent Vehicle Highway System Institute.""\ The money is part of $660 million Intelligent Vehicle and Highways program designed to make highways safer and less congested. Minnesota already is receiving funds to use cameras, computers, stop lights and other technology to help ease traffic congestion along Interstate Hwy. 35W.\ Every member of Congress likes to take credit for bringing home this sort of bacon. Minnesota's are no exception. Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger and Democratic Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., were members of the conference committee that produced the final bill.\ Durenberger, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, had a special interest in the intelligent vehicle program and the University of Minnesota funding. Oberstar, a member of the Public Works Committee, looked after projects in his district, such as the $18 million earmarked for the Forest Highway between Ely and Silver Bay and $500,000 to provide access to the planned Northwest Airlines base at the Chisholm-Hibbing Airport.\ Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., joined the conference for discussions of safety portion of the bill, which, among other things, requires driver and passenger air bags in 1998 cars. Sikorski cites experts who predict that this will save 7,500 lives a year.\ The subject of highway improvements warmed the usually reticent Rep. Martin Sabo, D-Minn., to an enthusiastic pitch. Sabo, a member of the Appropriations Committee, also boasts that Minnesota has the lowest traffic fatality rate in the nation, thanks in part to the intelligent highway experiments.\ He envisions the day when Minnesotans will drive in ""controlled vehicles"" that will be literally driven by computers through busy and congested intersections.\ ""Some of this may seem like 21st century science fiction,"" Sabo said, ""but a lot of it's here and being used today. If we want to see real results, it's time for the federal government to actively support this new technology."" And this year, as in years past, Congress agreed.\ Minnesota now receives federal money to experiment with remote-control cameras that monitor critical junctions on major routes. Information from the cameras is then used to set stop lights on highway on-ramps to control traffic flow.\ The Smart Highway Program already is operating in Minnesota along I-35W, where it has reduced highway accidents by 40 percent, Sabo said. It also will ""reduce pollution and reduce the pressure to expand existing roads or build new ones,"" he said.\ Of special interest to large cities, the bill strengthens the ability of local officials to influence local transportation decisions through metropolitan planning organizations.\ The complex legislation also:\ Authorizes $7.2 billion to complete the 44,000 interstate highway system.\ Sets aside $38 billion for a 155,000 mile National Highway System to complete the interstate system and major primary roads. States will be permitted to transfer half of this money to transit.\ Authorizes $16 billion to replace and rebuild bridges.\ Earmarks $9.2 billion for transit projects and rail modernization.\ This article includes material from the Associated Press."
234,"Republicans retained control of the Minnesota House, giving the GOP an important bulwark against DFL influence at the State Capitol with which to fight for lower taxes and smaller government.The House GOP was poised to expand its majority, strengthening a firm grip of rural districts while also winning unexpected suburban races.Rep.

Mark Dayton in the final two years of his second term, while control of the Senate remains in doubt.Republicans promised during the campaign to thwart Dayton's efforts to pass a higher gas tax for transportation.They also are skeptical of Dayton's efforts to create universal prekindergarten in public schools.The House GOP will seek to use the state's surplus to cut taxes, while pushing a regulatory environment friendlier to business interests. It will continue to demand an immediate end or major changes to MNsure, the state's health insurance marketplace.Republicans hit the DFL hard this election season over MNsure and a spike of 50 percent or more in premiums for people who buy their health insurance on the individual market, which includes about 250,000 Minnesotans.In the near term, Daudt can claim a voter mandate as he negotiates with Dayton to give relief to Minnesotans socked with the premium hikes. They are in talks to hold a special session soon after the election.Daudt attributed the GOP wins to the ""resounding failure"" of MNsure and the Affordable Care Act.It was not entirely clear which issues broke through in the House races. Interviews with voters provided scant clues about legislative races, as the presidential contest sucked up most of the oxygen of the 2016 election, and voters expressed few knowledgeable opinions about House contests.The two parties, their financial backers and outside interest groups in business and labor unions spent millions of dollars on TV, radio and mail ads for control of the House, widely viewed as the state's most competitive and important contest.The battle for the House also had significant personal stakes for the political futures of key players in both parties.Daudt is suddenly in the forefront of GOP contenders in the 2018 governor's race.After leading the GOP in its 2014 victory, he again showed an ability to raise money and run a strategic statewide campaign in a year widely believed to be better for the DFL because of higher presidential turnout and the unpopularity here of Trump.Minority Leader Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, had hoped to win instant redemption after losing the speaker's gavel in 2014. He is considered a potential candidate for the governor's race.It's unclear who will now lead the DFL caucus minority.Staff writers Eric Roper, Emma Nelson and Liz Sawyer contributed to this report.J.

235,"Minnesota business interests who went all-in to help Republicans hold legislative majorities at the State Capitol are worried what it might mean for the bottom line after midterm elections instead increased the power of Democrats in St. Paul.\The political funds for major business groups devoted most of their money and muscle to maintaining the GOP's two-year hold on the state House and Senate rather than lavishing it on Republican Jeff Johnson's bid for governor. It was a calculation that even if Democrat Tim Walz were to win the governor's office -- which he did -- that a Republican House and Senate could curb his power.\But Democrats also seized the House majority. Republicans held onto a one-vote state Senate majority, leaving Walz on the verge of the support he needs for initiatives opposed by broad swaths of the business community.\That includes his support for a statewide minimum wage of $15 an hour, strongly opposed by many business owners and leaders of major business groups. Walz has also proposed a gas tax increase for road repairs and spending hikes across a number of state programs, and voiced support for a single-payer health care system. It's left business leaders reckoning with the near-certainty that Minnesota will remain one of the nation's most highly taxed states.\""It's a big step backward,"" said Mike Hickey, Minnesota director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which mostly represents smaller companies and businesses. The group endorsed Johnson and a slate of Republican candidates, and he said the best he hopes for now is two years of gridlock in St. Paul and a better showing for Republicans in the 2020 election.\Hickey also said he doesn't think Walz and state lawmakers will be able to agree on changes to the state tax code that would bring it into alignment with its federal counterpart. That would mean a confusing tax season for business owners, he said, and a signal that Minnesota is an unappealing place to do business.\Voters in the same suburban districts that are home to some of Minnesota's biggest companies -- and their employees -- helped Democrats flip 18 House seats to take the majority.\Charlie Weaver is a former Republican legislator and operative who is executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership, which represents some of the state's biggest companies. The group has generally supported Republican candidates, but Weaver said he believes the new Democratic lawmakers from the suburbs won't swing too far to the left.\""They recognize business … contributes 50 percent of all the money to places like the Guthrie and the Walker, places we love and contribute to our quality of life which is something they want to maintain,"" Weaver said. He also said he's optimistic that Walz appreciates ""the value of business.""\The election underscored the complex and sometimes competing interests between the business community and shifting political alignments. While Democrats locked down wider suburban support, Republicans strengthened their grip in rural areas where support for President Donald Trump is among the strongest.\Trump has cultivated that political base in part through promises to crack down on immigration, another area of friction with big business. Leaders like Weaver and others have called a continued strong flow of immigrants into the state vital to maintaining workforces.\Weaver noted that Walz won the support of business leaders like Jeff Ettinger, the former CEO of Hormel, and suggested relationships built during his six terms in Congress made Walz ""the perfect candidate for the Democrats to put up.""\""Doesn't mean he's going to do everything we ask him to do but at least he cares enough to find out where we are,"" Weaver said. ""That's about all I can ask.""\Rob Stenberg, president of the Duluth BizPac, a new political action committee launched in the city earlier this year, described the ""wholesale change"" brought on by this election as cause for ""a little nervousness"" for the business class. He expressed worry over the specter of continued tax increases under DFL leadership.\""Sooner or later, because the pie in Duluth is not getting any bigger, we're not growing … you're going to tax people out of their houses and then you've got even bigger problems,"" Stenberg said. ""So from a business perspective over-taxation to me is going to be one of our biggest issues moving into the future.""\Republicans failed to win a statewide race again this year, a drought that reaches back to 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was re-elected. Stenberg cited a leadership void in the party and said Trump's brand of politics hindered the party's prospects in Minnesota. Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic, agreed, pointing to Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar's overwhelming re-election to a third term -- and her success in courting donors who represent some of the country's biggest corporations.\""Look, we're not a red state, we're not gonna be, we're a moderate state,"" George said. ""Look at Senator Klobuchar, very moderate across the aisle. Every CEO I know supports her because she is willing to work with them to create a good business environment.""\For now, some business leaders are sounding a hopeful note about working with Walz and the new Legislature even as their priorities promise to clash with what was previewed on the campaign trail.\Doug Loon, president of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, said he is looking forward to working with lawmakers ""regardless of party."" He said he expected the chamber to highlight issues of tax code alignment, diversifying revenue streams to improve transportation, boost access to health care ""in the commercial market by increasing market competition and stability,"" and to steer away from mandating employers to offer certain benefits packages.\""Our advocacy efforts are well-positioned to navigate divided government and deliver on behalf of the statewide business community,"" Loon wrote in an e-mail.\Stephen Montemayor • 612-673-1755\Twitter: @smontemayor\Minnesota House\74 Dem.\59 GOP\Minnesota Senate\33 Dem.\34 GOP\CREDIT:STEPHEN MONTEMAYOR; STAFF WRITER"
236,"Minnesota lawmakers slogged through a series of budget votes Friday that will determine the next two years of state spending on everything from farms to prison staff, but they were unable to wrap up their work in one day.\Gov. Tim Walz, GOP Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka and Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman had initially planned to adjourn the special session by 7 a.m. Saturday. That goal was quickly cast in doubt when legislators gathered Friday in St. Paul, as hours passed with only intermittent action on the House and Senate floors.\There were indications late Friday night that lawmakers were prepared to speed up the process, but deliberations still seemed likely to stretch at least into the early-morning hours Saturday.\The tight timeline hinged on the support of minority parties in the House and Senate. House Republican leaders said more time was needed to properly assess some of the budget measures -- particularly the 649-page health and human services bill, which was not published until Friday afternoon.\Each vote opened new avenues for political gamesmanship, the order of the day in a frantic vote-a-thon to put the finishing touches on a sweeping $48.3 billion spending agreement.\Bills typically require a first, second and third reading on separate days.\Lawmakers can vote to suspend the rules and clear the bills in a day.\But they need a supermajority to do so, which means getting some House Republicans and Senate Democrats on board.\House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said a one-day special session would leave too little time for legislators to fully review the bills.\""At this point we're not planning to vote to suspend the rules. ... We think it's reasonable that we just get to read the bills, get to understand the bills and comprehend what's in them,"" Daudt said.\If the special session cannot be done in one day, Hortman said she planned to continue work into Saturday or Sunday, rather than take a break and resume votes after the Memorial Day weekend.\Hortman said Minnesotans ""deserve a budget absolutely as soon as possible."" She disputed Daudt's claim that members have not had enough time to review bills, arguing she has sent copies of bills to legislators over the past two days and they have had more time than in past sessions to review the measures.\Daudt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, have thus far had little involvement in the negotiations on the state budget.\But the supermajority requirements grant them some leverage to make their desires heard.\""As in any special session, this is where the minority leaders have a little bit more influence, and we're trying to work through that,"" Gazelka said Friday morning. ""But it's my hope that we finish everything by 7 a.m. Saturday.""\Exactly how the minority leaders would use their leverage was not yet clear Friday.\A supermajority also would be required for the Legislature to pass a $500 million public works infrastructure borrowing bill, which was part of the deal reached between Walz, Gazelka and Hortman.\That deal was negotiated over a couple of weeks of closed-door meetings.\The three leaders landed on a plan that eliminated Walz's goal of a gas tax increase but continued a tax on medical providers that Democrats supported, although it was reduced from 2% to 1.8%.\The two sides also decided to cut the income tax rate for some middle-class Minnesotans and increase school spending by $1.25 billion during the next two years.\After reaching a broad agreement on those big-ticket items Sunday, the leaders have been working with state agency staff and key legislators to sort through the policy details of the budget.\Gazelka said Friday that the quick time frame to sign off on the budget bills was doable but depends on how much legislators want to talk about each of the measures.\""People really want to finish, but they also want to make sure that everything is done right,"" Gazelka said. ""So let's wait and see.""\By midafternoon Friday, legislators had made progress on less controversial bills.\Both the House and Senate suspended the rules and passed an agriculture, housing and rural development bill, as well as Legacy Amendment funding.\But the health and human services measure -- the longest and most contentious spending bill -- was not publicly available until 4:30 p.m., around the time House and Senate committees were scheduled to start holding informal public hearings on the bill.\""There will be mistakes,"" Sen. Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, said of the bill language at the Senate committee public hearing. ""There will be things that you are like, 'How did that happen?' But we really did our very best. There was some tension and then [we] worked through some things.""\Potential amendments also could drag out the process. Early Friday, the Senate tabled an environment bill after Sen. Charles Wiger, DFL-Maplewood, refused to withdraw an amendment to ban the carcinogenic solvent trichloroethylene.\Senators returned to the bill and passed it in midafternoon.\Sen. Melissa Wiklund, DFL-Bloomington, said she plans to bring an amendment to the health and human services bill adding an emergency insulin program, which had bipartisan support in the regular session that ended Monday.\""It just doesn't make sense to me to have people who are forced to ration their insulin,"" she said.\Hortman said Friday that Senate Republicans refused to include the insulin measure in the bill, and it will have to wait.\""I'm hoping that we might be able to do it next year,"" she said.\Staff writers Stephen Montemayor, Torey Van Oot and J.

237,"Gov. Mark Dayton and state lawmakers deadlocked Thursday over his push to provide up to $20 million for Lake Mille Lacs businesses struggling with a premature end to the walleye fishing season, leaving the DFL governor once again unable to marshal political support for a top priority.\A working group of legislators and administration officials tasked with assembling an aid package abruptly adjourned Thursday on an acrimonious note, diminishing the prospects for a special session to bail out a summer walleye season that ended last week because of population decline.\""If they do not want to help Mille Lacs resorters and residents in a special session, they should say so,"" Dayton, in Mexico on a trade mission, said of legislators in a prepared statement.\Rep. Denny McNamara, R-Hastings, obliged.\""For those that want immediate help in the next month ... it's not happening,"" said McNamara, chairman of the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee.\For Dayton, it's a frustratingly familiar scenario. Now just eight months into his second term, the governor spent much of the regular legislative session watching major priorities and demands go unheeded by the Legislature.\What he frequently called his top two priorities went unfulfilled: money to provide universal prekindergarten classes at public schools and more transportation spending funded by a gas tax increase. Dayton also retreated on what initially appeared to be strong stands on principle, as when he demanded that Republicans back down in their bid to strip power from the elected state auditor, then backed down himself when they were unwilling to do so.\Now his bid to help out an emblematic Minnesota industry -- fishing-based tourism -- is sputtering from lack of support not just among House Republicans but Dayton's fellow DFLers who control the state Senate.\Communication is key\Robert Vanasek, a DFLer who was House speaker from 1987 to 1992, said in his experience it's important for governors to privately lay groundwork with lawmakers before going public with top priorities. By most accounts, Dayton took lawmakers by surprise when he called in July for a Lake Mille Lacs-centered special session.\""The word that comes to my mind is communication,"" said Vanasek, who now works as a lobbyist but has not been involved with the Mille Lacs issue. ""If the governor thought that a special session would make some sense and do some good, I would think the governor would want to confer with the legislative leadership before going public with that notion.""\Looking at long-term goals\Sen. David Tomassoni, the Iron Range DFLer who chaired the working group with Republican Rep. Tom Hackbarth, said lawmakers are reluctant to champion the struggles of one region at the expense of others.\""The implications of doing this just for this particular area are huge, because those 1,500 miners laid off in my area -- should we put a 15-mile radius around Eveleth and figure out what businesses are affected?"" Tomassoni said.\In a similar vein, lawmakers raised the example of Lake Minnewaska in west-central Minnesota, which saw tourism dollars decline this summer after an initial, incorrect diagnosis that a 14-year-old boy died after exposure to a brain-eating amoeba in the lake. It turned out to be bacterial meningitis.\Just hours before the working group meeting ended in stalemate, Dayton in a call with reporters demanded that legislative leaders and members of the working group commit to an assistance plan so that he could call a special session. Dayton has proposed about $20 million for low-interest loans, property tax abatements and more tourism marketing for the region.\""They need the financial ability to pay their employees, make it through this month of August, through Labor Day, which is already coming up on us,"" Dayton said. ""The clock is ticking.""\Dayton said during the phone call that he wanted to be able to call a special session for next week. Now, the working group has no plans for further meetings.\Hackbarth said he wanted a more specific legislative proposal than what Dayton has offered so far. He and other lawmakers have been heavily critical of the Department of Natural Resources' management of Lake Mille Lacs, and suggested that changes to some of those policies would have to accompany any aid package.\""The long-term problem is the lake,"" said Hackbarth, R-Cedar, who said he's been in daily consultation with House Speaker Kurt Daudt over the issue. ""We don't want to be back in this same position a year from now.""\Something of a theme\Both Daudt and Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, declined interview requests for this story. Both have largely delegated the issue to Hackbarth and Tomassoni. Bakk's relationship with Dayton has been at a low point since a public falling-out earlier this year, costing the governor someone who, under normal circumstances, should be a top ally.\Legislative inaction has downsides for state lawmakers as well, particularly House Republicans like Rep. Sondra Erickson of Princeton and Rep. Dale Lueck of Aitkin, whose districts include most of the affected business owners. But Erickson said her own sense from talking to them is that most prioritize a long-term solution to the declining walleye population over short-term help, particularly if it means amassing more debt.\Inability to rally legislators around a cause has become something of a theme for Dayton's still-young second term. He has promised to keep pushing his universal prekindergarten and his road-funding proposals again in next year's regular session.\Dayton made clear Thursday that lawmakers should bear the blame for inaction in response to the Mille Lacs area's struggles. He described the unwillingness to put forward a bipartisan aid package as ""unprecedented in my two terms as governor.""\Patrick Coolican - 651-925-5042\Credit: PATRICK CONDON; J.

238,"Minnesota, are you ready to take a demographic dip?\For the next two years, Minnesota's working-age population -- the 25-to-64-year-olds -- will hold fairly steady in number, state demographer Susan Brower says. Then it will start a multiyear downward slide in size, while the number of senior citizens spikes and the number of children slowly swells.\The working-adult population isn't projected to grow again until the early 2030s, and won't be back to its 2015-17 strength until 2040.\That dip represents a major change for a state that has benefited from a rapidly growing workforce since at least World War II. It threatens to put a negative kink in just about every other trendline worth watching in the next 25 years.\What should Minnesotans know and do now to prepare for the coming trough in the state's working-age ranks? What's needed for Minnesotans to be at least as prosperous and proud as they usher in New Year 2040 as they are this week as 2015 arrives? Those are questions I posed to a panel of six future-minded Minnesotans at a Dec. 12 discussion at the Star Tribune. (Details about the panel members are on Page OP4.) Here's some of what they said:\Assuring equality of opportunity is now crucial.\Laura Kalambokidis: We are already seeing labor-market tightening in Minnesota, more acutely than we might have expected. We are entering an era in which we'll no longer have a deep-bench labor market. We need everyone in the game now. We cannot afford to leave any workers behind.\Paul Mattessich: What are we going to do about [socioeconomic] inequity? Educational outcomes and to some extent health outcomes with the growing racial minority part of our population are very different from the current majority population, which is shrinking. With today's trends the up-and-coming workers of the future, the ones who will be entering the workforce in 25 years, are less destined for educational success than today's workers were. You put that together with declining numbers in the workforce in total, and we face a real issue in Minnesota -- because even if everybody were qualified, we'd have a shortage of workers.\Gary Cunningham: This is a situation that requires increasing productivity, and utilizing all of our citizens. We haven't been doing that, and we struggle with why. Is the problem systemic, or is it about individual choices? As long as we stay stuck in that argument, we won't be able to compete at the same level internationally [that we aspire to]. Other parts of the world don't have the deep divisiveness we have here.\Brad Finstad: Rural Minnesota is graying and browning. The good news is there will be more of us that are aware and care about equal opportunity.\Minnesota needs more bang for its education bucks.\Margaret Anderson Kelliher: For the sake of Minnesota in 2040, early education is a singularly important issue. Kudos to Minnesota for spending more recently. We can't take our foot off the gas on this.\In higher education, the No. 1 thing is when students start college, we need them to finish. We need to help them to finish. At [the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities], we're serving a diverse group of Minnesotans, but too many are not completing their two-year or four-year degree in a timely way. That makes education much more costly for students and their families, and the public investment is not being utilized to its full potential.\Mattessich: There's an analogy to health here. There's only so much you can do to improve health by improving the health care delivery system. To go further, you have to improve the environments in which people live. Same goes for education. A child's academic achievement results from a combination of school, family and community. Yet we focus 98 percent of our attention on the school. We have to think about what we can do through communities and families to help kids learn. That's where we can get a big breakthrough -- by understanding and improving the social determinants of education.\Tom Gillaspy: Fortunately for the community side, we have a potential resource we've never had before. It's all these people retiring in record numbers. We can do more to use them. Mentors can have a dramatic positive impact, and cost the state and the schools virtually nothing.\New technology is Minnesota's ally.\Gillaspy: Tremendous technological changes are coming that can enhance worker productivity. Just with robotics -- wow! The constraint with moving into robotics isn't the technology. It's the human acceptance of the technology. There's a creepiness factor to androids, particularly among older people. Yet they may stand to benefit the most from what new technology can offer.\Kelliher: With an aging population, making broadband available across the state becomes phenomenally important. It's what will allow worker productivity to continue to rise. People are going to need to create more on their own. There's going to be an appreciation of craft, of hand-touched work. Right now, 385,000 rural Minnesotans are not connected to broadband. That's 43 percent.\Bringing broadband everywhere can solve a lot of problems. The statistic I can never get away from with broadband is that for low-income families, their incomes go up on average by $2,000 a year within a year of being connected. It's because they're able to do certain things -- find a better job, make more money, start a business, get more education, file their taxes online and claim the credits they have coming. Broadband is a critical thing that the state can partner on.\Leave no part of the state behind.\Finstad: We can't succeed if we don't have a statewide view of the future. There are pockets in rural Minnesota where the challenges will be deep. A third of their population will be over the age of 65, living on fixed incomes. How will we keep the lights on in those communities -- and what will be the cost if we don't?\Rural Minnesota has a lot of unfunded liabilities already. There's $2 billion, $3 billion in infrastructure that is in dire need of repair. There are small communities that can't add more toilets and showers because they have met the limit of their wastewater infrastructure's environmental standards. We need a strategy that gives those places a future.\Gillaspy: In demographic terms, I see Minnesota increasingly as three rings that don't interact very well. They are the inner city and inner-ring suburbs; the outer-ring suburbs that don't have any idea what goes on in the inner city and don't care, and Greater Minnesota. Their differences are increasing over time. Understanding the rest of Minnesota doesn't happen automatically anymore.\Kelliher: That's why shared experiences and community will be important in keeping people attached to this state. That's why things like major-league sports teams, the Minnesota Orchestra and the University of Minnesota are important. These are connection points of pride and identity, and we shouldn't neglect them.\Attracting workers from other places is getting harder -- so Minnesota must try harder.\Gillaspy: We've been drawing some of the top scientists, engineers from other countries. That's getting very, very difficult now. Even laborers from Mexico are becoming increasingly scarce. We're now in an age in which place is choice, not destiny. We need to create an environment that develops, attracts and retains the best talent.\Kalambokidis: Minnesota's industrial diversity is in our favor. We're not a state that is overly dependent on one industrial sector. That helps make this state an attractive place, especially for two-earner couples. It's a place where, if I come here for a job, my spouse is likely to find work here too.\Cunningham: A new study by Greater MSP has found a large division on race in that regard. If African-American professionals come here without kids, they don't stay. If they're white, they stay. That's a huge talent gap.\Mattessich: That tells me that we should work hard to recruit African-Americans and other educated people of color who have families and would like what we have to offer. Minnesota is at the top on so many ratings -- health, overall education, homeownership. If we want to stay there, we need more educated, middle-class, up-and-coming people of color.\Encouraging small-business development can attract and keep working-aged people.\Cunningham: Minnesota is not a leader in developing small businesses. We rank 32nd among the states in the development of micro-enterprises. And you know who does most of the hiring? Small businesses. We are going to have to up our game with regards to supporting development and success of small businesses in general, and businesses of color in particular. What's our small-business strategy? Other states do more by way of small-business assistance -- things like technical support, mentoring and assistance in getting access to equity investments.\Kelliher: We could have a much stronger entrepreneurship effort going on. ... One key thing is entrepreneurial exposure for students. We want to identify a base-level curriculum in entrepreneurship that colleges and universities could use with students in their first year or so in college. Minnesota has an incredible work ethic, but we haven't cracked the code in how to form new companies. We should say to young people, ""You're likely to be a company owner someday. Here are some basic things you'll need to know.""\Minnesota can't move ahead if it's stuck in traffic.\Mattessich: The transportation conversation we're about to have [at the 2015 Legislature] needs to acknowledge that the purpose of transportation goes beyond transportation. It's how do we stay healthy, feed people and promote businesses in the future. If we stay stuck at how are we going to improve our roads and our bridges vs. light-rail transit, we're just going to dig ourselves into a deeper problem.\Kalambokidis: We need to think more about commerce. The goods-producing sectors in Minnesota matter a lot for bringing money into the state. They depend on getting stuff from place to place. This conversation needs to be about more than how am I going to get to work or to Wal-Mart or the hockey game.\Finstad: Four hundred fifty semis leave New Ulm every day, and we don't have a four-lane road. That's a big deal.\We need new ideas about funding. I don't think we can keep going back to the well of the gas tax. We know that it adversely affects rural Minnesota, because rural people drive more miles and drive bigger vehicles. Let's have a discussion of a full transportation plan with new sources of funding.\Prepare to pass the generational torch.\Gillaspy: The last ag census showed a change that's going to be important in Greater Minnesota. It's not unusual to see the average age of farmers being about 56. That's been that way for a long time. But in the past, there were secondary and tertiary operators, sons or younger brothers working the farm and preparing to take it over. The last census found very few of those people. When this group of farmers retires, who will take over?\Finstad: We've got to look at easing the transition of wealth to the next generation. How do you turn the next generation into the land owners, the business owners that will carry Minnesota forward? Right now, owning just 100 acres makes you a millionaire. What can we do to ease the estate tax and gift tax burden, so that the next generation can take hold?\2015 is a fine year for looking ahead.\Gillaspy: The good news is that most of the problems we have in Minnesota are solvable. That's not the case in some states.\Mattessich: But we're talking about problems that are gradual and long-term. We're not good at thinking ahead beyond the next election. That's got to improve now.\Kalambokidis: These aren't just questions for government. Businesses have to step up. The businesses that are going to thrive these years without a deep bench are the ones that can attract, train and retain the workforce that we do have. They need to see that now, and decide what they can do now to have the workers they need in the future.\Finstad: The state is at a turning point. All we've been doing is fixing things for the past 25 years -- one crisis after another. A lot of that is behind us now. We have an opportunity to create policy, to look forward and say: How do we envision Minnesota in the next 15, 20, 25 years? And then create it.\Lori Sturdevant is a Star Tribune editorial writer and columnist.

239,"The Builders Association of the Twin Cities is best known for putting on Parade of Homes, a showcase of some of the most luxurious, innovative and environmentally friendly homes in the Twin Cities.But in recent years, the organization has emerged as a powerhouse in state Republican politics, giving money to candidates and attempting to gain influence at the State Capitol.The Builders Association, or BATC, ""works hard to serve our members by encouraging legislators and local leaders to better understand the importance of building neighborhoods that are safe, healthy and affordable,"" said executive director David Siegel, who declined an interview but answered questions via e-mail.The Parade of Homes, which recently featured more than 200 new and remodeled properties for its fall show, sells advertising and sponsorships based on robust attendance of an estimated 225,000.The money -- at least $3.8 million earned during 2014 on the various shows -- goes to the association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of the building industry at the Capitol and tries to elect legislators friendly to their cause.The tax-exempt group spent $647,000 on political activities in 2014, according to its most recent IRS documents. The money went toward successfully helping Republicans regain the House majority they had lost in 2012.Siegel said the money spent on politics comes from dues and other revenue, not from Parade of Homes or the group's ""general fund dollars."" According to IRS records, Parade of Homes proceeds comprised more than half of BATC total revenue.The homebuilders' political contributions illustrate the new world of campaign finance spending: Recent federal court decisions loosening campaign finance laws have heightened the importance of outside groups that can raise and spend large sums to help their political friends.On the DFL side, labor unions like the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which contributed $450,000 to each the House and Senate DFL, serve a similar function to the builders group.The outside groups can also collect money from wealthy individuals. Alida Messinger, the ex-wife of Gov. Mark Dayton, gave a single donation of $815,000 to a group that funds the Alliance for a Better Minnesota, which supports DFL candidates.The money spent reflects the huge stakes: If the DFL can pick up seven House seats and retain control of the Senate, the party would control all levers of power in the Capitol and allow Dayton to move forward with an aggressive agenda of universal prekindergarten and a major transportation package funded by a gas tax increase.The builders' Housing First Fund has taken in more than $250,000, according to the newest campaign finance reports. Of that, $145,000 came from a group that shares an address with the builders called the Housing First Network, which is a ""social welfare organization"" that in this case advances the message of ""housing affordability and the importance of a robust housing industry,"" Siegel said.Housing First is one of the top 10 political contributors in the state this year, behind both political parties, unions, Alliance for a Better Minnesota and some GOP groups, according to the latest campaign finance records.As a ""social welfare"" organization, Housing First Network does not have to reveal its donors, allowing corporations and individuals to push their agenda while avoiding disclosure and the scrutiny it might bring.Although not a registered political group, the Housing First Network has engaged in efforts to promote policies helpful to the industry, going so far as to release ads for friendly candidates, singling out Rep. Roz Peterson, R-Lakeville, as ""a leader who thinks local in the Burnsville and Lakeville area."" Peterson, who is in her first term, is considered one of the most endangered GOP incumbents in the House. Another recipient of a favorable ad by the Housing First Network is Randy Jessup, who is challenging Rep. Barb Yarusso, a vulnerable DFLer from Shoreview.BATC has yet to file its 2015 tax information, and Siegel declined to discuss their political strategy but said the group backs candidates in both parties who support the housing industry.In August, the group endorsed 16 legislative candidates, including three DFLers.The builders' 2014 political spending came with mixed results.Housing First spent $100,000 trying to defeat two-term DFLer Dayton, to no avail.But investments in Peterson, as well as Reps. Jim Knoblach, R-St. Cloud; Jeff Backer, R-Browns Valley; and Jason Rarick, R-Pine City, all paid off, vaulting the GOP into the majority.At the Legislature, the builders want a friendlier regulatory environment that will lower home prices, as well as lower taxes. After the 2016 legislative session, the trade group told members in a newsletter that they successfully prevented any damaging legislation while deepening key relationships at the Capitol. ""We are now sought out regularly by legislative leaders from both sides of the aisle on major issues,"" read the report.All of this politicking comes with added scrutiny.Tom Brever, who early in his career was an IRS lawyer before becoming a tax attorney and adjunct instructor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said the homebuilders' tax documents could catch the attention of IRS examiners -- most likely for ""the lack of specificity regarding their revenue and the significant amount of political spending.""Several people attending Parade of Homes' final weekend of showings were ambivalent about the builders' political activity.Cooper Butler, there with his wife to check out renovating ideas, said he fully expected the housing industry to advance its interests. Otherwise, it wouldn't be following very good business practices, he said.Of seven people interviewed, none of them were aware of the group's political activity.""You just tainted our thing,"" joked Marjorie Grevious. She and her spouse, Lisa Robinson, who are raising a teenager, said they try to be mindful of their consumer choices, like buying American-made goods, supporting LGBT businesses and avoiding products or services that don't represent their values. They are not Republicans.Still, they left the interview and walked toward the Uptown house, eager to see what was inside.J. Patrick Coolican - 651-925-5042\Credit: J. PATRICK COOLICAN; STAFF WRITER"
240,"During a recent DFL gathering at a Woodbury pizza parlor, House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher got the question every hungry Democrat wants answered: How will you win?\Her quick and passionate reply: I know the Capitol and the state, know how to win partisan fights, and I'm a woman. Women, she told them, make up 58 percent of DFL primary voters.\A win at next weekend's DFL endorsing convention would put Kelliher a step closer to her goal of becoming Minnesota's first female governor, one already tested by many legislative and political battles.\But few top-ranked women politicians in the state have campaigned so overtly in recent years on their gender. Kelliher's bid to motivate women could give her a crucial voting bloc -- or alienate voters she still needs to win over.\To claim a seat Democrats have not held in a generation, Kelliher will have to best a mostly male field that includes several House members, a state senator and the mayor of her city, chief rival R.T. Rybak.\Kelliher is acquiring powerful allies for her campaign: former Vice President Walter Mondale, national and local women's groups, dozens of DFL legislators and others who say her combination of collaboration, leadership, smarts and yes, gender, should make her tough to beat both in August and November.\Many say they are backing Kelliher's candidacy because of what they've seen over the years, as she has risen from community organizer and legislative staffer to the second most powerful position in state government.\Kelliher learned early how to pull the levers of power at the Capitol, starting as an aide to the House Speaker in the early '90s. By 1998, she was a legislator and in 2006 became only the second female speaker in state history.\Since then, she has been pitted daily against one of the most nimble, forceful Republicans in the state, Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- against whom she has scored some big wins and some losses serious enough to raise doubts about whether she has what it takes to be governor.\Kelliher was skillful enough to wring out a rare override when Pawlenty vetoed the gasoline tax in 2008, but she appeared to be caught flat by his unilateral budget-balancing that effectively sidelined her and other DFL leaders last year.\""She's made mistakes,"" said Rep. Tom Rukavina, an Iron Range DFLer who is among Kelliher's challengers at next weekend's endorsing convention. He contends that the Legislature should never have sent Pawlenty all its spending bills in 2009, which allowed him to unallot, and should have taken him to court once he did.\""I tried to build a coalition to sue the governor, but I couldn't do it on my own,"" Kelliher said, adding that potential partners ""chickened out.""\Late last year, the House joined in a lawsuit from a legal aid group against the governor.\Negotiating skills\Some say Kelliher's collaborative style is what sets her apart and has allowed her to keep a large, unwieldy caucus together while making steady gains on things DFLers want.\In a letter last week, Mondale urged Democrats to pick Kelliher because ""we need a DFL candidate who is ready to be governor the day after the election ... the results of Margaret's inclusive style of leadership have been remarkable."" As examples, the letter ticked off the gas tax override; the Legacy amendment, which increased the sales tax to generate funds for the environment, water and culture; and a $1 billion bonding bill.\Kelliher, he said, ""recognizes leadership is not about scoring political points -- it's about improving people's lives.""\Others think Kelliher needs polish and may lack the charisma that defines Rybak.\""I think her stump speech skills just suck,"" said Sue Halligan, a DFL delegate from Woodbury who favors Rybak, but still puts Kelliher as her second choice. ""She might have a problem getting elected.""\Among those tracking delegates, several believe Kelliher will come into the Duluth convention ahead in the count.\'I'll use my mom skills'\Kelliher says that her childhood on a farm and her life now as a working mother in the state's largest city have given her a foot in two worlds and a deep connection to regular Minnesotans.\To unite the state's disparate elements, she said, ""I'll use my mom skills, I'll use my skills as a speaker and executive ... and I'll also use my common-sense Minnesota skills in being able to get this done.""\With two school-age children, Kelliher frequently peppers her speeches with references to children's behaviors, comparing recalcitrant Republicans to obstinate toddlers and Pawlenty to a ""petulant teenager.""\She's also not above taking gentle pokes at her own past. ""I think a former dairy princess, a former state 4-H president ... is our best shot at having a contrast,"" she told supporters.\If she claims the DFL's endorsement, Kelliher would face two men in the August primary: former U.S. Sen. Mark Dayton and former House Minority Leader Matt Entenza. Kelliher would also be running against Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner, whose campaign so far doesn't appear to be catching fire.\Kelliher emphasized her gender in a recent interview. ""Our party could choose to put up the same looking candidates that they have for 152 years as the governor of the state, or we might do something different,"" she said.\Susan Nelson, executive director of Minnesota's Women Candidate Development Coalition in St. Paul, said a gendered appeal could put a candidate on a tightrope.\""I would never recommend that a woman run as a 'woman candidate,'"" Nelson said. ""I mean, it's apparent that she is a woman."" The coalition doesn't endorse candidates, but Nelson said she personally has contributed to both Kelliher and Gaertner's campaigns.\Former gubernatorial candidate Judi Dutcher says it's ""smart politics"" for Kelliher to mention the advantages a female candidate would bring.\""The electorate in this state has shown time and again if they have a qualified woman candidate, they will chose that candidate,"" Dutcher said.\But the DFL bypassed Dutcher for gubernatorial endorsement in 2002 and skipped former state Sen. Becky Lourey in 2002 and 2006. Both Dutcher and Lourey support Kelliher's bid.\Denny Schneider, a DFL delegate, agrees Kelliher's gender can be an advantage. ""If everything else is good, then that's an extra plus,"" he said.\Schneider said he had been leaning toward Rybak, but was less sure after hearing Kelliher at the Woodbury event.\Kelliher, ever the strategist, was happy about the possible convert.\""Did Denny tell you how I made his life worse tonight?"" she said with a laugh.\Rachel E.

241,"
DULUTH -- With just three weeks to Election Day, DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and Republican challenger Jeff Johnson more clearly defined their differences in a one-on-one debate here Tuesday that largely plowed familiar ground.
\
In their third forum in three weeks, the two leading candidates reiterated their positions on mining, jobs, the state's business climate, transportation and a handful of other policies they had covered in previous confrontations. But this time the tone was sharper.
\
For instance, on copper-nickel mining, the most divisive issue in northeastern Minnesota, Johnson renewed his prediction that Dayton would block the proposed PolyMet Mine project on the Iron Range, which has undergone nine years of environmental reviews.
\
""If Gov. Dayton is re-elected, PolyMet is not going to open, at least not in the next four years,"" he said. ""I will do everything I can to get that mine open and other mines open... Nine years is long enough.""
\
He accused the governor of being ""beholden to what I consider some pretty extreme environmental groups, most of them based down in the Twin Cities, who don't want to see any mining in the state.
\
In response, Dayton charged Johnson with ""absolutely pandering to northeastern Minnesota"" by proposing to ""run roughshod"" over the environmental review process for the project.""
\
He compared his opponent to hucksters who have gone to the Range and dangled the prospects of jobs that have never materialized.
\
""We're going to do this one responsibly,"" he said. ""We're going to protect the environment. We're going to protect jobs.""
\
Johnson fired back that he would push to get the project done and not let government agencies slow it down.
\
""It's not pandering,"" he said. ""I think it's actually showing some leadership, and that's what governors are supposed to do.""
\
The debate invited more direct contrasts, in part because a third candidate, the Independence Party's Hannah Nicollet, was excluded. She had participated in the two previous debates and often buffered exchanges between Dayton and Johnson.
\
The Duluth Chamber of Commerce, which co-sponsored the debate with the Duluth New Tribune, said it had negotiated the terms of the debate with the Dayton and Johnson campaigns in August, and Nicollet had not expressed interest in participating until recently. The chamber said it decided to honor the original terms of the debate.
\
Johnson said having him and Dayton ""going back and forth maybe makes the difference more stark.""
\
While the debate didn't break new ground, he said it hit all the topics ""that are really important to people.""
\
Both candidates again said creating jobs is their top priority. Dayton ticked off a list of statistics showing job creation is up and unemployment is down as the state nears the end of his first term in office.
\
Johnson rattled off numbers indicating that in the past year Minnesota is near the bottom among states in creating good-paying jobs.
\
Dayton and the DFL-controlled Legislature have ""created a tax climate that is so uncompetitive with the states that surround us and a regulatory climate that is just overbearing,"" he said.
\
The governor replied that Minnesota is better off now than when he took office, and a ""preponderance of the statistics"" confirms that claim. He accused Johnson of ""being so desperate to find something to make Minnesota look bad that you jump on whatever (numbers) you can find.""
\
Last spring, Dayton signed a law raising Minnesota's minimum wage from one of the lowest in the country to one of the highest. He said that will help build the middle class, while Johnson's proposal to cut income taxes for with wealthiest Minnesotans and his opposition to minimum wage increases would undermine middle-income earners.
\
While he opposed the minimum wage bill, Johnson, a Hennepin County commissioner and former legislator, said he would not roll it back. He said he would focus ""maximum-paying jobs"" that enable Minnesotans to build careers, not low-paying jobs.
\
Unlike Dayton, whose economic development strategy has been to ""travel around the country and essentially beg businesses to come here by offering them tax breaks and giveaways that no one else gets,"" he said, he would create a tax and regulatory climate that encourage Minnesota businesses to create more jobs here.
\
The two also resumed their debate over how to pay to maintain the state's deteriorating roads and bridges.
\
Dayton said he would ""consider"" imposing a sales tax on gasoline at the wholesale level as one revenue-raising option, stepping back from his statement last week that he would propose that tax increase. ""I'm not going to raise the gas tax"" at the pump, he said.
\
The GOP candidate said he'd find the money for transportation projects by reprioritizing state spending and borrowing funds for roads and bridges.
\
The governor said that wouldn't raise even half of the $6 billion needed over the next 10 years for road and bridge maintenance.
\
""If you want to invest in infrastructure and making things better, it's going to cost money,"" he said. ""It's not going to come from the federal government; it's not going to come from the sky; it's not going to come from the administrative fictions you describe.""
\
Johnson said he would ""beef up the bonding bill"" to fund transportation projects, but Dayton noted the state constitution bars using general fund bonds for state highways, so he'd have to amend the constitution to implement his plan.
\
Dayton and Johnson are scheduled to face off in two more debates, both in St. Paul. They will appear on a live, televised debate on KMSP Fox 9 from Hamline University at 9 a.m. Sunday, and they will face off again Oct. 31 on Twin Cities Public Television's ""Almanac"" show.

242,"-RSEC-\ Let Eagan weigh in\ Eagan Mayor Pat Awada's claim of community support for Mary Jo Copeland's orphanage (Counterpoint, March 25) seems at best premature and makes one wonder just what Awada means by ""local control.""\ I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of the proposed orphanage. I am, however, troubled by Awada's claims that Eagan's citizens have ""thought over the proposal"" and ""overwhelmingly endorse"" the orphanage. While Awada and City Council Member Paul Bakken have been talking to the press and rallying the troops against legislation at the State Capitol, there has not been a single hearing or public meeting between Awada's City Council and the community at-large to discuss the merits of the orphanage proposal. Eagan's planning committee will hold its first public meeting to look at the proposal or take input at the end of the month.\ While I applaud the mayor's and her supporters' personal and political concern for children, I am troubled with Awada's assumption that agreement from her reliable circle of friends translates into broad support. If this is truly an issue of local control, wouldn't it be best to actually consult with the community before claiming to have its support?\ - Mike Maguire, Eagan.\ The more things change\ A new baseball stadium? Hold everything! I have a hot new idea. What if we bulldoze Mall of America and build an outdoor stadium there? No, wait. What if we bulldoze Camp Snoopy and build an indoor stadium there? No, wait. What if we bulldoze Nicollet Park and play baseball there? No, wait . . . .\ - Barbara J. Miller, Eagan.\ Broad opposition\ I'm compelled to correct at least one the factual errors in John Caile's diatribe about ""gun-control zealots"" (Counterpoint, March 23). Opposition to the concealed weapons bill does not come from a small number of antigun types, as he suggests. Citizens for a Safer Minnesota, with over 800 members statewide, is just one of many groups concerned about the impact of more loaded handguns in public. Our goal, by the way, is to prevent gun violence, not ban all guns.\ Our coalition partners and others who've opposed the law include: the Minnesota Medical Association, Minnesota Academy of Pediatrics, Minnesota Institute for Public Health and Minnesota Nurses Association; Jewish Community Action, the St. Paul Area Council of Churches, National Council of Jewish Women, Joint Religious Legislative Coalition and ISAIAH; the League of Women Voters, Urban Coalition, American Association of University Women; Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, Initiative for Violence-Free Families, Safe Communities St. Cloud, Million Mom March and the Children's Defense Fund.\ Concealed Carry Reform Now of Minnesota, on the other hand, stands alone. It represents the narrow interests of the gun lobby.\ - Rebecca Thoman, executive director, Citizens for a Safer Minnesota, St. Paul.\ The long road\ Congratulations to the Senate and the governor for passing a transportation bill that will make real improvements in metro-area transportation. The bill recognizes that the solution to our traffic crisis is a combination of road improvements and transit options.\ Shame on the House for not stepping up to the plate on the transit issue. As a lifelong Republican, I am losing patience with my Republican representation in the House. Minnesotans have always proven to be visionary when it comes to quality-of-life issues. Without adequate funding for transit, however, we are quickly becoming an antiquated region in terms of how we get to our destinations each day. It is frustrating for residents, and embarrassing when we are trying to attract new employees or business to the area.\ Of course, we need to maintain and upgrade our roads and bridges as well. But without providing enough funding for mass transit, we are taking the most shortsighted path possible.\ - Luke Swenson, Eden Prairie.\ Speed limit, anyone?\ Instead of automatically jumping on the idea of a gas-tax hike as a source of revenue, I would like to suggest that the fines for speeding and other traffic offenses be raised three or four times from what they currently are.\ I would also like some thought given to maybe even enforcing some of those laws.\ - Brian Jacobson, Paynesville, Minn.\ Job security, so to speak\ Molly Ivins' March 25 Commentary page article, ""Damage an election can't fix,"" was enlightening for many, I'm sure. However, as an undergrad majoring in wildlife ecology, I had heard most of her points before. It seems as if no action will be taken toward protecting the environment during the Bush administration. But it's not all pollution and extinctions; millions of jobs will be created to clean up the mess!\ - Kristin V. Johnson, Medina.\ Claiming Berry\ Halle Berry, Academy Award winner for best actress, was reared by her white mother. Her black father was largely absent from her life. Knowing American society, her mother told Halle to consider herself black, because that is how she would be identified by others. Sure enough, the Star Tribune front page calls Berry ""the first black actress to win an Academy Award in a lead role.""\ How long will it take for us white Americans to recognize people who are of multiracial heritage as one of our own too? Maybe once we can begin to recognize our relationship with folks of mixed race we can take the next step in recognizing all people, of whatever hue, as our brothers and sisters?\ - Daniel Johnson, Crystal.\ Military baggage\ Thank you, Peter Smith, for your firsthand account of a Vietnam we don't like to remember (""Memories of a war with no exit strategy,"" March 19). I spent the last part of the 1970s patching up returning vets with vicious heroin addictions in a treatment center in Michigan. No one expected that our brave young boys would come back with a $200-a-day habit. The only plus side was that federal funds got chemical dependency treatment to other poor junkies as well as to strung-out soldiers.\ Let's not repeat these ""glory days.""\ - Diane W. Carr, New Hope."
243,"TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY \Would Teddy be in? \While I would like to see the return of progressive Republicans to leadership of the conservative party, I wonder whether Sally Pillsbury's ""Big Tent"" is inclusive enough (Opinion Exchange, Aug. 10). \After, all ""to conserve"" would seem to include caring for the environment, which a GOP icon, Teddy Roosevelt, made a top priority. Modern-day Republicans ridicule this cause. John McCain has missed all eight votes to renew the tax credits for renewable energy technologies. What of future generations? Shall we leave some oil for them? And what of global warming? \No, Mrs. Pillsbury, the Republican Party of today doesn't believe in conservation, or in small government, personal freedom or individual responsibility, and won't in your lifetime. After Bill Clinton reined in federal spending and left behind a large surplus, George W. Bush with his ""borrow and spend"" approach ballooned the federal budget into a half-trillion-dollar deficit. Personal freedom? Not if you're a woman who wants the right to choose, or if you're gay or lesbian. And as for individual responsibility, the Republican majorities in the House and Senate refused to stop or even to hold this administration responsible for torture, illegal wiretapping, lying about the rationale for going to war, political hiring in the Department of Justice, corrupt contracting in Iraq and a host of other travesties. \So come on over, Mrs. Pillsbury. We have more in common than you think, and we like your spirit. The Democrats would welcome you and other progressives, and we can promise you a much bigger tent, higher principles and way more fun. \MARY MCLEOD, ST. PAUL \. \CONVENTION NIGHT LIFE \Keep it to a minimum \Great that St. Paul wants a $2,500 fee from bars that want to stay open until 4 a.m. It should be more. \Good for the bars that are resisting and will not extend their hours. \Who wants a convention of drunken sots with a huge hangover setting policy and choosing leadership for this country? Now is the time for sober, intelligent minds to ponder our many problems, not to party, party, party. \BRUCE BLANCHER, DULUTH \. \KEILLOR'S POLITICAL CLAIMS \Where's the evidence? \Garrison Keillor (""Taking the 'candid' out of candidate,"" Aug. 10) accuses John McCain of ""eagerness to inject race into the race"" without any example to support this vile and dishonest claim. Your editors should at least require minimal attribution before allowing such a slanderous bell to be rung. Old Scout? Read the oath; I don't think so. \DAVID NEIMAN, MINNETONKA \. \Insightful, they're not \Garrison Keillor doesn't understand how the presumptive Democratic nominee for president can be characterized as arrogant. \For just one example, Keillor needs to think back to April when Barack Obama said that Pennsylvania's small-town voters ""cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them"" in order to deal with frustration. Obama made this condescending remark while hobnobbing at an exclusive California fundraiser. \Humble backgrounds do not provide immunity to arrogance. A poor black kid raised in part by a single mom has grown up to be a snob much like a gangly farm boy from Anoka has grown up to be a cultured despiser. Good thing the latter achieved his celebrity through poignant reminiscences of his childhood; he would never make it to the top on the basis of his skills at political analysis. \THE REV. KATHRYN JEFFREY, ST. PAUL \. \ROD HAMILTON AND HWY. 60 \Punished, of course \According to Republican House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, Rep. Rod Hamilton was double-crossed by the Democrats regarding Hwy. 60 fixes (Star Tribune, Aug. 11). \Pretty strong language. Whom does Seifert think he's kidding? \The Legislature may determine a total budget for the Department of Transportation, but it doesn't get to dictate which projects are actually initiated. MnDOT does that itself, and MnDOT is full of Republican appointees. \I think it's more accurate to say that MnDOT is participating in Republican efforts to penalize Hamilton for crossing party lines, and Seifert is picking up on an opportunity to go negative on Democrats. \DAVID M. PERLMAN, NEW HOPE \. \Starved for funding \Maybe there was no double-cross or misunderstanding. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we have not had a gas tax increase in over 20 years. We can blame both our parties for that. \D. BERGSTROM, CHANHASSEN \. \LETTER OF THE DAY: Some are survivors; none should know abuse \It is good to hear stories like Roger Huerta's (""Life: His toughest fight,"" Aug. 9). I was struck by the amazing courage this young man has shown in working to overcome his experience as a child and move on with his life. This story can be replicated many times over by those who find the strength within to make a different life for themselves and their children. \But there are many others who don't make it. The trauma of childhood abuse and parents whose personal tragedies make them unable to care for their children can last for a lifetime. Our prisons are full of men and women who had no real childhood, as are our homeless shelters and treatment centers. \Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota is the only statewide nonprofit organization that works to prevent all types of abuse and neglect of our children. We work to strengthen families and equip communities to support these children. Experiences like Roger's should never happen. \It takes incredible fortitude to keep going when your spirit is damaged by those who should protect and love you. While for some this adversity makes them stronger, for many more it destroys their lives. \I can't help but wonder how many survivors read this article and had it bring back memories of the struggle to just grow up. I appeal to readers to remember that our children deserve to be loved, respected and protected and that we can all help to see that children do not experience the trauma that Roger experienced. \CONNIE SKILLINGSTAD, ST.

244,"Minnesota's sprawling southern First District has a history of electing congressmen who rise to national notice -- people like Al Quie, a Republican education policy leader before becoming governor, and Tim Penny, a Democratic fiscal hawk who was ahead of his time. The district's three-term incumbent, Democrat Tim Walz, has begun to attain similar stature. His work on congressional ethics and veterans affairs legislation has been truly distinguished.\Walz's strength makes the task that confronts the winner of the Aug. 14 Republican primary in the First District a daunting one. Understandably, GOP partisans are looking for a candidate whom they believe can defeat Walz. This newspaper's criterion for a primary endorsement was slightly different. We looked for the candidate more likely to give Walz the kind of competition that can make a good representative better.\Former state Rep. Allen Quist better fills that bill than state Sen. Mike Parry. Quist has been out of elective office since 1988. But the St. Peter farmer and recently retired government professor from Bethany Lutheran College demonstrates deeper knowledge of the issues that confront Congress and more ability to debate them with Walz this fall.\Quist, 67, has been a local and state Republican Party leader for nearly 30 years, and ranks among the engineers of the party's shift to the philosophical right. He and his energetic wife, Julie, a former district director for Sixth District U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, were forces to be reckoned with inside the state GOP well before his unsuccessful party-endorsed bid to topple Republican Gov. Arne Carlson in 1994.\Quist's sustained political involvement contrasts with Parry's briefer public career. The 59-year-old radio and pizza restaurant businessman served one term on the Waseca City Council, ending with a reelection defeat, and three years in the state Senate. Aligned with the Senate's most conservative faction, Parry chaired the Senate's State Government Innovation and Veterans Committee with a blend of charm and pugnacity.\Parry is not well-known among primary voters. He might have used his comparatively small war chest to tout his own assets. Instead, he's been bashing Quist's record. Among the things he dredged up is Quist's support in the 1980s for gas tax and cigarette tax increases, both of which occurred in the context of an overall state tax reduction.\We think those features of Quist's record do him credit. They are evidence that his mind is not automatically closed to all arguments for higher taxes, and that he appreciates government's rightful role in securing public health and providing for public mobility. That record ought to strengthen Quist's credibility among general-election voters as he questions Walz's views on the federal budget.\As a legislator in the 1980s, Quist focused excessively on social issues. Today he assures that while his positions have not changed, his emphasis has. If he wins on Aug. 14, he promises a robust debate with Walz over how best to reduce the nation's fast-growing debt. First District Republicans should give him the green light to proceed.\- - -\The state's most-watched primary contest this year is in the historically DFL-dominated Eighth District, where voters will decide which of three candidates will make the party's bid to reclaim the congressional seat from first-term GOP Rep. Chip Cravaack.\Many primary voters will attempt to judge which of the three is most likely to topple Cravaack -- former U.S. Rep. and party endorsee Rick Nolan, former state Sen. Tarryl Clark, or former Duluth City Council member Jeff Anderson.\We hope they also consider which candidate has the best potential to provide the region and the nation with top-notch congressional service. It's on that basis that Clark gets our nod.\Unlike Nolan, 68, who last sat in Congress in 1980 representing a different corner of the state, and Anderson, 35, whose elective record consists of one term on the Duluth City Council, Clark at age 51 is in the prime of her political life. She practices a brand of politics akin to that of U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- moderate, pragmatic, Minnesota-minded, people-focused.\A nonprofit attorney by profession, Clark was a standout as a state senator for five sessions, representing a St. Cloud district that had long been in Republican hands. She was elected deputy majority leader by her peers after just one year in office. She exhibited quick grasp of the complexities of the state budget, wide-ranging policy interests, and the pragmatism and interpersonal skills necessary to turn ideas into legislative action.\Much has been made -- too much, we'd say -- of Clark's decision to move to the Eighth District after failing in 2010 to unseat Sixth District Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann. Talent ought to matter more than residency when judging capacity for leadership.\Some DFL partisans fault Clark for running a poorly focused, insufficiently strategic campaign against Bachmann. That, too, we find overstated. Bachmann was riding high in 2010 as a founder and leader of the congressional Tea Party caucus and a potential presidential candidate. That Tea has cooled since then. Clark deserves a chance to demonstrate that she has gleaned the constructive criticism from the carping about her 2010 campaign, and can turn it to her advantage in 2012.\Each of Clark's two opponents would also be a worthy opponent for Cravaack. Anderson is a promising newcomer to politics outside Duluth. But he would face a steeper learning curve in Congress than would Clark, in part because he's too given to judging national policy questions for their impact on the Eighth District.\Nolan, who gave the old southwestern Minnesota Sixth District excellent representation in the 1970s, served when Democrats had unshakable control of the U.S. House and Washington politics was a much tamer game.\Of the three, Clark alone has shown that she can operate effectively in today's rough-and-tumble partisan lawmaking environment. That ought to count for much with primary voters."
245,"LETTER OF THE DAY: Remarkable public servant deserves everyone's respect \Maybe now that the election is over and the verbal grenade-throwing has mercifully ceased, perhaps we can all celebrate the remarkable 44-year life story of Sarah Palin without regard to politics. \My dad always taught me to try to see the good in people without being Pollyanaish about their weaknesses. As far as I can tell, Sarah Palin has always tried to be the best she could be. As a small-town mom, she served her local public school and her community. When the door opened, she stepped through and served the citizens of her state, and when another person chose her to serve on the national stage, she did, all the while maintaining what appears to be a wonderful relationship with her husband and five kids. \The bashing of her religion has been cowardly and shameful, and those writers who did this should publicly apologize to her. Gov. Palin may not have been ready to be president, but all of us should celebrate her remarkable life. \JIM HANSON, PINE CITY, MINN. \. \ELECTION 2008 \Deliverance from the past and into the future \During the past several years I've been wanting to see more flag waving and a patriotic America. Not for a certain political idealism, but just plain grateful patriotic spirit that exemplifies being an American. \After viewing Grant Park in Chicago on Election Night, I believe that patriotic spirit has been reborn. The emotion and surrealism shown on the many faces that night gave me a great sense of pride, and I didn't vote for Barack Obama. \Many who always felt outside of the system now feel proud to call Obama their president, and so do I. \JOHN GIESE, GOLDEN VALLEY \--- \The Emancipation Proclamation in 1863; the Voting Rights Act in 1965; the first African-American president elected in 2008. This has been a 145-year journey from slavery to the presidency. It does give me hope that both our Constitution and our democracy are dynamic, real and evolving to a higher plane. \WILLIAM S. SEELEY, MINNEAPOLIS \--- \The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s words ring so true today, that a man will be judged not by the color of his skin but by the strength of his character. We can truly shout, ""Free at last, free at last! Thank God Almighty we are free at last!"" \WILLIAM MEDELLIN, PARK RAPIDS, MINN. \--- \Stay engaged whether your candidate won or lost. Volunteer in your community. Give money to your favorite charity or organization. Our elected leaders are faced with unprecedented challenges and need our help. It is time to unite for our children's future. \BETH POTTER, MINNETONKA \. \A message for the GOP \For the first time in 40 years of voting, I didn't choose any Republican candidates Tuesday. In the past I have strongly supported the likes of Elmer L. Andersen, Al Quie, Arne Carlson and Jim Ramstad. \We are now offered the likes of George W. Bush, Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann -- all of whom I consider national embarrassments. \As a believer in the two-party system, I hope that the GOP will start promoting moderate, intellectually curious candidates I can support. \MIKE WOLSTED, PLYMOUTH \. \Bachmann's reelection \We have a little cabin in northern Wisconsin, and we really enjoy every opportunity we can to get to our magic little oasis. We typically drive up Interstate 35 to Hwy. 70, and then head east into the beauty of the St. Croix Valley that is the ultimate image of living in the North Central part of this beautiful country. \Our dilemma now is how to get there without having to spend too much time (and no money) in the Sixth District of Minnesota. The idea that some of these people actually voted for Michele Bachmann is beyond comprehension. There's conservative and then there's blind. We see a huge difference. \JIM SMART, MINNEAPOLIS \. \Coleman shows colors \Shame on Sen. Norm Coleman for attempting to blame a necessary recount on Al Franken. It clearly demonstrates a desperate ""win by any means"" character on the senator's part. Additionally, shame on the Star Tribune for supporting such a character with its endorsement. \RUTH MAKINEN, OWATONNA, MINN. \--- \Norm Coleman's call for Al Franken to forgo the state-mandated recall is right out of the Rovian playbook. \John McCain's remarkably graceful call for bipartisanship is a great example of what will hopefully be the new direction both parties will take in trying to solve our nation's many problems. It is obvious that Coleman won't be playing on McCain's team, but will continue to be part of the nasty, obstructionist partisanship that has plagued Washington in recent years. \PAUL TESSMER-TUCK, HASTINGS \. \THE LEGACY AMENDMENT \Thanks, and be really careful with the money \The state constitutional amendment to fund clean water, land acquisition and the arts passed thanks largely to the tireless efforts of Star Tribune columnist Dennis Anderson. Without his persistent, thorough coverage of this story, it is doubtful enough people would have understood the issues, let alone become engaged in seeking a solution. Thank you on behalf of future generations of Minnesota citizens who will benefit. \M.D. KELLEY, MINNEAPOLIS \--- \""Is taxophobia fading?"" (letter, Nov. 6): Not really. \I'm one of the 44 percent of Minnesota voters who voted against the conservancy tax.

If they need more money, make and present a business case, not make an end run around accountability. \A.J. RICE, EDEN PRAIRIE \--- \Regarding ""Next step in sales tax issue: Deciding who decides who gets funds"" (Star Tribune, Nov. 6): The state, or supposedly the environment and the arts, think they are going to reap an additional $275 million per year. Let's look to the past to see how ""dedicated funds"" do. \The Legislature couldn't decide how to fund bridges and roads, so it chose to 1) increase the gas tax, and 2) dedicate sales tax from cars. The price of oil skyrocketed, people drove less, car sales tanked, and MnDOT said it did not have enough funds. \The ""user fee,"" or whatever the governor called it, of 75 cents per pack on cigarettes to get money for education: People quit smoking, and how many referendums were on the ballot this fall? \The state won big bucks from the tobacco companies, and those funds were for stop-smoking programs. Those funds were taken to help balance the budget a few years ago. The 2 percent provider care tax on health care providers, meant to fund MinnesotaCare; those funds were taken to help balance the budget. And perhaps the biggest travesty of all, the Social Security trust fund that doesn't exist. \Believe me, politicians cannot stand to see sums of unspent money lying around. \ROBERT GJERTSON, FRIDLEY"
246,"LONDON -- Chalk it up to basic economics of supply and demand.\Americans are driving less, and the price of gas keeps falling -- 25 cents or so. The national average for a regular gallon of gas -- at $3.86 -- is still more than a dollar higher than it was this time last year.\But that's nothin' compared to what they're paying across the pond.\I took this picture (below right) at a petrol station while in London about 10 days ago. At first glance the price appears to be $1.18 a gallon.\Look again.\Actually, it's 1 pound, 18 pence per liter. With roughly 3.7 U.K. liters in one U.S. gallon, that comes out to 4.50 pounds per gallon. Given that the pound is twice as strong as the dollar, petrol in London costs an average of $9 per gallon -- $10 or $11 for premium.\""It's ridiculous,"" said Liz Domingua, a young Brit I talked with briefly while she was filling up her tank.\""I don't even use my car that much anymore. I just walk everywhere. I'm only using it today because it's the weekend,"" she said.\On average, British motorists reportedly shell out 67 pounds every time they fill up. That's $134 (U.S.) per tank.\And you thought we had it bad.\""I think the economy is shot to pieces on both sides,"" said Domingua. ""It doesn't really make any difference. The cost of living is much higher here, I think, than it is in America. And the pound being strong, you see that. It's very evident. But really, I think it's down to each side to try and find a solution.""\Slow going\According to British news reports, one solution involves simply slowing down.\Cars, trains, ferries, buses and even planes have been ordered to go slow in order to conserve energy.\One of Britain's biggest budget airlines, EasyJet, for example, cut flying speeds -- by up to 2 percent -- on some routes. Another air carrier BMI, dropped its average flight speed by (a paltry) 3 mph.\Drivers on Britain's TransPennine Express train service have been asked to cut their engines and coast downhill.\Seriously.\The Guardian quoted an executive at a U.K. rail franchise who said: ""There's a hell of a lot going on. Life has changed, we're working very hard -- we've got to.""\Similarities vs. differences\Earlier this summer as the price of oil began to drop from its record high of $147 a barrel, three of Britain's biggest supermarket chains began passing those savings onto shoppers by cutting the price of petrol by as much as 5 pence per liter, for those customers who spent at least 50 pounds in the store.\Sound familiar? I think I still have some of those Rainbow or Cub coupons lying around somewhere.\Yet for all our similarities, there are differences too.\""Americans tend to be quite insular in their view of the world,"" said Mal Fletcher, a broadcaster and social commentator who moved with his family to London from Australia four years ago. ""The only comparisons [Americans] can make are on the basis of their own experience as far as a year ago or on the basis of someone who lives an hour away by plane. Where as in Europe nations border nations, and so you're constantly comparing yourself. If you live in Denmark you're comparing prices in Germany or France. It's just part of life.""\Just like death ... and taxes.\""More than half the money I pay at the petrol pump (over 60 percent) is for taxes and duty,"" said Fletcher. ""Actually only 32 percent when its unleaded petrol is for the product itself.""\By comparison, as of July 2008 the average gas tax in the United States was 49.4 cents per gallon.\Fletcher says Britain's higher taxes have only intensified the grumbling in London over the petrol prices, even though Europeans may recognize the benefits those taxes bring ... namely in the form of public transportation.\""We're from Australia,"" said Fletcher, ""so we have the same heritage you do in America ... public transport in Australia is nothing like it is here. We lived in Denmark for 10 years and that's an even better example of public transport at its best. You get the clean trains on time all the time, buses that will take you anywhere pretty much. Cabs cost more; most people were content to use buses. We were paying 60 percent of our income in tax, plus 25 percent VAT on everything we bought. So you get what you pay for.""\While in London, I noticed that the iconic red double-decker buses appeared with all the frequency of pigeons in Hyde Park. And it was pretty easy to catch a black taxi, although traffic was a nightmare no matter what time of the day. A ride from our hotel to a local restaurant for lunch should have taken 20 minutes, but took an hour and half in stop-and-go traffic at 11:30 in the morning.\Underground, though, crowds of commuters made their way on foot through curved tunnels to catch one of London's famed trains. They fill to capacity within minutes of arriving at the loading platforms and stop briefly for boarders who seem to fill every seat and cling to every rail as the trains rattle off in the darkness to the next tube stop.\To and fro\There were lots of Europeans going lots of places, by one means or another. I asked Mal Fletcher if he thought Americans might need to rethink the way we get to and fro.\""It's the opinion of only an occasional visitor,"" he said, "" but I think the new generation of America is much more aware ecologically than their predecessors, and I think there is an entrepreneurship in America that will drive the development of new fuel sources, new types of cars. When it comes to the environment, I think we're yet to see the power of America to change it through sheer inventiveness. The same people who invented the Chevrolet can reinvent the car with that same pioneer spirit, with that same can-do attitude. Some of that is happening in Europe, but I'm looking forward to seeing it happen more in America.""\In the meantime, as the slight decline in gas prices is tempered by cautious analysis, and characterized as a trend that could potentially be reversed, London resident Liz Domingua may have summed it up best for both of us.\""We just have to try to live with it and try to make it work. It's tough.""\Credit: Roxane Battle"
247,"-RSEC-\ Souls over minds\ I commend Children, Families and Learning Commissioner Christine Jax for admitting that it is ""not her job"" to be Minnesota's lead advocate for K-12 education.\ If she were an advocate for public education, she would be promoting a broad, academically based liberal-arts curriculum steeped in knowledge, facts and information. After all, this is what the average taxpayer thinks education is.\ Instead, she believes that education should focus on the child's soul. A child's ""soul"" reflects his or her spirituality: faith, beliefs, values and attitudes.\ When education becomes an exercise in values training, it's moved beyond its jurisdiction. It is about ""making"" a child into a certain kind of person. This should scare all parents.\ To quote Sunday's story, ""Jax said it is natural some superintendents and other education leaders might want a commissioner chosen by voters or an appointed board because they often end up being one of their own.""\ State taxpayers shelled out many billions for public education last year. We should settle for nothing less than representative government.\ - Bonnie Gasper, Eden Prairie.\ An easy $108,400\ Christine Jax has said that teachers receive pay raises for just showing up. Apparently, to earn her $108,400 salary, Jax doesn't need to do that much.\ - John Kantar, Minneapolis.\ A lame legacy\ Christine Jax's Profile of Learning legacy is one of confusion, frustration and waste. I'm sure thousands of high school students and teachers would agree with me.\ Thanks, Commissioner Jax, for making me do projects below my grade level, screwing up my schedule and causing a lot of lost sleep. Legacy indeed.\ - Ona Keller, Minneapolis. Sophomore, I.B. Program, Southwest High School.\ Education's unadvocate\ Thank you for publishing the well-researched and insightful article about Commissioner Christine Jax. Now the stakeholders in K- 12 education know why it seems as if they have no advocate in the Ventura administration: It's because they don't.\ - Matt Abe, Plymouth.\ She's right about her job\ Charlie Kyte, executive director of the Minnesota Association of School Administrators, seems to be confused. Apparently, he believes that Commissioner Christine Jax is supposed to be an apologist and lobbyist who represents the interests of public school bureaucrats (""Education chief draws criticism,"" Feb. 24).\ That's his job. He's a paid advocate for his special-interest group. The education commissioner is a public official. Her job is to serve the public interest. Kyte's inability to discern the distinction is a symptom of the ailments of public education in Minnesota.\ - David Aquilina, Minneapolis.\ Theft is theft\ In utter disbelief I read what Maplewood city prosecutor Robert Fowler said regarding the guilty plea by James Dick for shoplifting (""Figure in shoplifting case pleads guilty to theft of groceries,"" Feb. 23).\ Dick was caught shoplifting twice at the same Cub Foods in Maplewood. He pleaded guilty to one charge, and the other charge was dismissed. Fowler said, ""It really wasn't that big a deal except for . . . the past notoriety.""\ I had to read this twice, because it sounded as if these words were coming from Dick's defense attorney.\ It is a big deal to Cub Foods and other retailers who suffer annual shoplifting losses of $10 billion, and it is a big deal to consumers who pay higher prices at retail because of thieves like Dick.\ - Paul Barry, Minneapolis.\ Paying for Ventura's tabs\ Three years ago Gov. Jesse Ventura complained that $800 was too much to pay for the license plate tabs on his Porsche, so he took a third of the surplus and cut the cost.\ Now that the surplus has dried up and he needs to pay for the tab- fees reduction, he wants to raise the gas tax 5 cents a gallon.\ It would have been easier on my pocketbook if he drove a Chevy.\ - Jim Wickoren, Champlin.\ Save us, Star Tribune\ First those nasty snowmobiles and now the deadly ATV (""Nature pays the price as ATVs hit the woods,"" Feb. 24). Will the eco-warriors of the Star Tribune's editorial staff win the day and save all of nature?\ I can only hope that next week we will see a five-page article about the horrors of newsprint: all the trees killed for paper, the toxic inks, the gas-guzzling delivery vehicles, and all of the energy wasted by huge printing presses.\ Now that's a story!\ - Kermit Hauge, New Hope.\ Needed: Laws with teeth\ It is so infuriating that we allow our last few wild places to be destroyed by ATV users, whose callous disregard for the environment is disgusting.\ The ignorance and selfishness of ATV and snowmobile users will not be curtailed by signs and petty fines.\ We need legislation with teeth for those who abuse protected lands, including confiscation of their machines and jail time.\ - James Russell, Crystal.\ It's the law, Sen. Day\ Sen. Dick Day, R-Owatonna, said, ""The first person that stops at a meter in the morning is the person I would like to talk to. Why do they do it? There's nobody out there on the highway and he is going to start the day starting and stopping? A lot of us are just going."" (""New ramp metering to begin on Friday,"" Feb. 24.)\ Why do they do it? Maybe because it's the law. And most of us don't get to decide which laws to follow and which to ignore.\ It's a very disturbing message that Sen. Day is sending to the citizens of Minnesota.\ - Ben Seymour, Minneapolis.\ Commuter rail works\ If I had the means or the influence, I would do whatever I could to make the commuter rail happen (""Northstar rail / House still blocking the tracks,"" Feb. 17). When I moved to St. Cloud five years ago, I hoped to see commuter trains.\ I lived in Crystal Lake, Ill., a town on a rail line. It was great to take the train into Chicago and not have to worry about parking or gas.\ - Paul Ciarrochi, St. Cloud, Minn."
248,"-RSEC-\ Self-centered Twin Citians?\ After watching the news and learning, once again, of the rejection of Mary Jo Copeland's children's home proposal, I can no longer be silent.\ What I am struggling to understand is how so many in our community fail to grasp Copeland's concept of ""the greater good"" because they can't see beyond their own needs and agenda. Have we become such a self-absorbed community that we not only refuse to give back to society ourselves, but sabotage the plans of those who do as well?\ I guess the sad answer is yes. After hearing one woman comment that she didn't want ""those children associating with mine"" and another insist that the horses that may potentially be displaced ""were just as important as disadvantaged children,"" I must reluctantly confess that I am ashamed of our Twin Cities community and how out of touch we have become with the needs of others.\ Mary Jo says that she will be a voice for our children until she dies. I hope it doesn't take until then for our community to look inside itself and realize that we do have a heart after all.\ - Susan Lacek, Minneapolis.\ Concealed handguns\ I have a suggestion that might satisfy both those who advocate Minnesota residents be allowed to carry concealed weapons and those of us who fear more weapons on the street and all of us who fear for the security of our infrastructure. Allow concealed weapon permits on the following conditions:\ - The applicant must take a state-created security course, pass that initial course and take refresher courses with repeat testing every two years.\ - The applicant must undergo a thorough psychological screening and background check.\ - The applicant must register all the weapons to which he/she has access with the state.\ - The applicant must agree to some number of hours per year of guard duty at state-identified critical installations. This would be an annual commitment to retain the concealed weapon license. These would be guard hours around the clock. The exact number of hours per licensee would be established depending on the number of applicants and the number of identified critical installations.\ With such a program, society would be better assured that those with permits to carry concealed weapons would be well trained and screened. In addition, critical installations would be under 24-hour guard at no cost to the state or the operators of the installation.\ - Steve Levie, Burnsville.\ Give Watkins a chance\ Regarding your Jan. 31 front-page article: When a car salesman from Texas came to town and bought the Vikings, no one questioned where his money came from and how he got it. When Norm Green bought the North Stars, no one questioned his wealth. When a businessman from Mankato came out of nowhere and saved the Wolves, no one questioned him either.\ Why then is everyone digging into Donald Watkins' past, trying to find some shred of wrongdoing? Some think Carl Pohlad is as shady as they come. How do you think billionaires become billionaires?\ Come on, Minnesota, give the guy a chance.\ - Jonathan W. Howe, New Brighton.\ A cut of our oil addiction\ As we all know, gasoline prices are about the lowest (especially in constant dollars) they've been in a long time. Yet a serious proposal for a nickel or dime increase in the state gas tax to help our government do what it needs to do meets a great chorus of indignant naysayers.\ Why do we not care when energy companies manipulate gas prices over this range, yet our government, where we know rather closely where the money goes, is denied a small cut of our addiction? Meanwhile oil and gasoline, complex chemical mixtures made millions of years ago and nonrenewable, are being consumed without constraint.\ A gallon of drinking water costs about the same in the supermarket as a gallon of gas. The United States is probably the only nation that does not use gas taxes as a major revenue source (not just for highways). Doesn't make much sense to me.\ - John C. Green, Duluth, Minn.\ Priced out of a smoke\ What's up with all of these people feeling so sorry for the poor if a cigarette tax is raised? If you can't afford to smoke, don't do it! In the long run, quitting will put money into your pockets and save the state a ton of money on health care.\ - Al Helgerson, Albert Lea, Minn.\ Individual liberty above all\ Manijeh Daneshpour's Jan. 27 Opinion article ""Covered heads meet unveiled bigotry"" presents interpretations of America that many would dispute. Daneshpour indicates that she can, and does, discuss a range of topics of what is wrong with America. That's everyone's right. But to suggest that others adopt her mission to end bigotry (as she defines it) - she's wrong.\ St. Cloud State University (where Daneshpour is a program coordinator) is awash in political correctness and social diversity initiatives. However, mandatory student sensitivity training will never be enough because you can't ""educate"" (program) everyone to think as you do. Which is what Daneshpour is suggesting: ""to use cultural sensitivity as the ultimate tool to make this world a diversity-loving, stereotype-free place.""\ Former President Theodore Roosevelt said ""there can be no fifty- fifty Americanism in this country. There is room here for only 100 percent Americanism, only for those who are Americans and nothing else."" And ""every immigrant who comes here should be required within five years to learn English or leave the country."" Roosevelt said this at the height of World War I, when the loyalty of German- Americans was in question. Roosevelt didn't ""celebrate diversity."" He led a nation of over 100 million with a developing social and cultural identity as distinct as European countries with less than half the population and more than 10 times the history.\ America is a nation in which democracy and individual liberties flourish, making us unique and equal to, if not better than, any other nation in the world. But only if we are united in our original beliefs that President Bush is repeating today - that we hold freedom and individual liberty above all else.\ - Bart Biernat, Edina.\ In defense of the wolves\ Perhaps we should remind Ron Schara (column, Jan. 27) ) that Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carlson and a host of others were, and in some cases still are, considered environmental extremists. To paraphrase someone else, ""Extremism in the defense of our environment . . . is no vice.""\ Restricting the use of a few bays in Voyageurs Park is a small price to pay for the continued success of the reintroduction of wolves into our crowded, sprawled, ever-encroaching society.\ - Al Gustaveson, St. Paul."
249,"NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS The March 21 editorial cartoon by Mike Lester of the Washington Post Writers Group (http://bit.ly/2neefnQ) mocked the grant process of the National Endowment for the Arts, which is targeted for elimination under President Trump's budget proposal. In response, I've made the accompanying comic/information diagram on how NEA grants and funding actually get distributed (and benefit the art community).Megan Dolezal, MinneapolisMegan Dolezal is an artist and school administrator.ELECTRIC VEHICLESProposed fee is misguided (and, furthermore, a crafty obstacle)To Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington:As a Minnesotan and reasonable believer in free-market economics, I feel the need to reach out to help on your omnibus transportation bill that includes a $75 electric car fee (""Yearly fee on electric vehicles proposed,"" March 22).While electric vehicles do not contribute gasoline taxes to fix roads, I am not proportionately taxed for cleaning the air. My eight-seater SUV is not taxed on whatever happens to keep foreign oil flowing to my nearest station.The negative externalities of my SUV are so great that we've collectively made a push to go electric, even if it means subsidizing such vehicles. If you're going to propose a tax on electric vehicles, make it fair and tax me for everything that I do to pollute the environment for your children.Sam Gavin, Edina- - - Let's do the math on this ""fee"" (read: tax) proposed for hybrid and electric vehicles. At $85 per EV times the 967 such vehicles sold in 2016: $82,195. This insignificant wisp of revenue won't even cover the per diem expenses for the committee members who proposed this new tax.No, this not about the money; it's a thinly veiled attempt to discourage the use of zero-emission and hybrid vehicles.Owners of EVs already subsidize the state through higher registration fees based on value. As noted but poorly explained, the McFarlane study shows that the owner of a LEAF all-electric vehicle pays more to the state through value-based ""fees"" than the owner of a Chevy Malibu, Toyota Corolla or Nissan Versa does through the paltry gas tax. This disparity persists through a 10-year vehicle ownership period. (The full study may be found at http://bit.ly/2mRjXIR.)Setting aside for a moment the lower lifetime carbon footprint of EVs (including manufacturing and disposal) and the reduction in local air pollution, this attempt to discourage use of alternative transportation technology fits into the playbook of so-called ""conservative"" organizations that oppose public transportation, renewable-energy initiatives and other strategies that threaten the hegemony of oil producers.The other glaring irony is that this ""fee"" has been proposed by Republicans who hold themselves out as the party of tax reduction (except, apparently, when they receive marching orders from their sponsors). This whole thing stinks like an overloaded catalytic converter and should be vetoed if presented to the governor.George Hutchinson, Minneapolis- - - How crazy is the proposed tax on electric vehicles? Like taxing ""nicotine patches"" because of lost cigarette tax revenue? Or taxing the smallest cars more than gas-guzzling trucks, to claw back gasoline tax revenue? Or, perhaps you could tax light-rail passengers for loss of gasoline tax revenue? Or Alcoholics Anonymous for reducing your alcohol tax revenue? Are these elected officials living in the Stone Age?In the very near future, electric cars will run on power from wind and solar electrical generation. Xcel is expanding solar/wind faster than most Minnesotans realize. Do the House and Senate wish to tax our clean-energy future as well?Here is my suggestion: Tax coal and natural gas, which accounts for 66 percent of the electrical power used by electric cars. Start taxing the fossil-fuel industry, not the clean-energy future we desire and deserve.The city of St. Paul is working to attain zero carbon by 2050. Everyone should applaud such foresight. By 2050, solar and wind will be nearly free. Such is the power of new technologies and industrial innovation, when left free to flourish.Tax dirty energy, and keep your hands off the clean alternatives and a resulting safer future for our children.Jim Davidson, St. PaulTRANSPORTATION FUNDINGRepublicans opposed to light rail are misreading the populaceMinnesota House Republicans opposed to light rail must assume that Greater Minnesota residents never come to the metro area for anything (""GOP proposes $6 billion road plan,"" March 22). They must not shop here. They must not have family here. They must not visit recreationally. I say that because they must be assuming that Greater Minnesota wants nothing to do with transit -- and that they don't mind the parking fees, the traffic jams and the stress of driving unfamiliar roads. That has to be it, doesn't it?David Mindeman, Apple Valley- - - When my wife and I moved to Falcon Heights from western Minnesota, we chose our neighborhood based on transit availability. Having made heavy use of the Green and Blue lines since then confirms our thinking that Metro Transit light-rail serves ridership needs very effectively. Watching parents with strollers, users of power chairs, bicyclists and the diversity of general ridership underscores our belief that public transit deserves the funding support of the Minnesota Legislature.As Minnesotans, we have been raised to believe in the power of ""working toward the common good."" That is what the Metropolitan Council is designed to do in planning how best to move millions of people, and that is what the Legislature was established to do in guiding our state toward becoming a better place in which to live. It's high time for our senators and representatives to dump petty partisanship in favor of following through in building those long-planned transit lines. It's not going to get any cheaper.Walter James Dunlap, Falcon Heights- - - I write once again as the Legislature drones on about how to repair our roads and bridges without raising taxes. Once again I write to suggest that I would not even notice it if the gasoline tax were gradually raised over the next year by 5 to 10 cents per gallon. Gasoline prices jump around constantly due to the whims of the oil marketplace. I would much rather pay an extra nickel or dime per gallon and know that the Minnesota roads and bridges I use every day are being maintained.Richard Portnoy, MinneapolisCORRECTIONA March 21 letter incorrectly referred to the placement of the story ""Ex-Nienstedt deputy leaves clergy,"" March 18.

250,"Minnesota is beginning to confront what promises to be the biggest shift in urban living since cars arrived in cities a century ago: The moment drivers let go of the wheel for good.\Self-driving cars are leaving the realm of science fiction and creeping into discussions about the future of transportation in the Twin Cities. Researchers say the technology could be required in new cars by 2030, leaving its mark on everything from parking ramps and road design to exurban sprawl and mobility for people with disabilities.\""We know it's coming and it's coming at a pretty rapid pace,"" said Jay Hietpas, state traffic engineer at the Minnesota Department of Transportation. ""And we just want to make sure that we're ready.""\The state will step into the spotlight later this year when MnDOT tests a self-driving bus on snowy Minnesota roads -- possibly even during Super Bowl festivities in February.\MnDOT formed a group earlier this year to examine state laws about driverless vehicles. And planners are already speculating how cities will be reshaped when the technology arrives in earnest.\Many people may choose to abandon car ownership for robust sharing services, summoning driverless vehicles at a moment's notice. Cars could travel closer together with less risk of accidents, boosting the capacity of highways. Commuters napping on their trip to the office may live farther away from work.\""Cities are just starting to figure out that they need to pay attention to this,"" said Frank Douma, director of the State and Local Policy Program at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs.\U researchers say fully autonomous vehicles that can operate without driver interaction may hit the market by 2025. But cars with self-driving features are already on Minnesota roads, such as Teslas equipped with autopilot systems that steer, brake and accelerate in freeway traffic.\The transition may be rocky. Autopilot was blamed in a Central Minnesota crash earlier this month that left a Tesla upside-down in a marsh, but it turned out the driver had disengaged the system by hitting the gas. Once automation is fully implemented, however, U researchers believe it could dramatically reduce car-related deaths.\'Have to start thinking'\The technology behind driverless cars is still evolving, but the latest vehicles navigate using 3-D maps to pinpoint their location within centimeters. Sensors look out for pedestrians and other vehicles, allowing the car to react in real time.\Driverless cars were being tested in nine U.S. cities last year, according to a report from consultant Accenture. But city planners and engineers here are starting to take notice and consider changes.\If people choose to forgo car ownership, there could be less demand for parking in urban areas since the driverless cars would spend more time in use and park closer together in faraway spaces, according to a U report prepared for MnDOT.\In Bloomington, Port Authority Administrator Schane Rudlang said city staff are mulling a recommendation that future parking garages built with city funds be designed for reuse later, perhaps as an apartment or office building, with flat floors and greater load capacities. Planners in Minneapolis and Hopkins said they are also weighing the technology's effects.\University of Minnesota Design Center Director Tom Fisher has been prodding mayors and city officials to plan ahead. They could one day reclaim roadway for sidewalks and green space, for example, since self-driving cars need less room to maneuver. The last thing cities should do is add lanes to existing roads, he said.\""We're putting in roads right now that are going to last 50 years,"" Fisher said. ""So everything we're doing right now is going to go through this transition.""\Advocates for people with disabilities are also tracking the technology, hoping it can reduce mobility barriers for people unable to drive. Minnesota nonprofit Mobility 4 All was founded for that purpose, and has been pressing its case with manufacturers.\""This technology could be transformative for people with disabilities,"" said John Doan, the organization's founder. ""We want to make sure that developers design the physical as well as the software of the vehicles so that it is universally accessible.""\More cars, longer trips\Self-driving cars could also influence development patterns around the metro area, changing demands on freeways and transit.\Urban areas might grow more dense if parking needs drop, but the U report said autonomous vehicles could also encourage commutes to far-flung locales because people could do other things en route. In turn, governments might have to turn to pricing policies -- replacing a gas tax with a per-mile tax, for example -- to rein in sprawl, according to an analysis released by the University of California, Davis.\The technology has also prompted debate over spending money on expensive transit, like the Southwest light rail line.\""We're sitting here fighting about a train -- a billion-dollar train that it tells you when you have to be there and where to go,"" said state Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington, who owns a Tesla. ""Pretty soon here you're going to have cars that can just pick you up wherever you are and take you to wherever you want to be.""\But others like David Levinson, the lead author of the U report, said large cities will still need high-capacity transit to serve busy urban areas.\""Cars, even driverless cars, can't move as many people per hour past a point as trains can,"" Levinson said.\What about winter?\Then there's Minnesota winter. What will happen with self-driving cars when it snows?\Most driverless vehicle testing has been in warm climates like California, but Google, Ford and GM began snow testing over the last year and a half.\University of Michigan Associate Professor Edwin Olson, who worked on the Ford team, said the cars performed reasonably well in a test environment, but recreating snowy driving behavior poses challenges -- like trailing other cars in a snowstorm.\""What you would be likely to see in that snowy scenario is an autonomous car stubbornly driving where the lane actually is underneath the snow,"" Olson said. ""But it could be profoundly stupid. It could be that's where the snowplow just put a deeper pile of snow.""\Douma, of the Humphrey School, said MnDOT's upcoming testing is an opportunity to show they work in winter.\""This would be the chance to show that Minnesota is in the game,"" Douma said."

Banning smoking in all Minneapolis bars and then allowing the majority of St. Paul bars to allow smoking provides an unfair advantage for St. Paul.\ St. Paul is going to be rewarded with increased revenues, while Minneapolis is going to be punished with decreased revenues.

He also failed to show that the well-documented distortions of Bush, Wolfowitz and others in the administration, which were cited by lawmakers as justification for voting for war authorization, were somehow trumped by these quotes as if they never happened.\ If any liar was identified in May's commentary, it was May himself.\ Paul Oman, Brooklyn Center.\ .\ Revive past ideas\ In his March 29 commentary (""Bush is blowing chance to lead on energy, environment""), Thomas L.

252,"Minnesota's schools, its job hunters and the state's finances are better off than when he took office, Gov. Mark Dayton said Wednesday in his final State of the State speech, even as he laid out an ambitious list of goals for his last 10 months in office.The DFL governor, who is not running again, used his annual address to urge state lawmakers to unite to adapt the state's tax code to treat middle-class taxpayers more fairly, suggesting that both the tax bill passed last year by Congress and state tax changes earlier in 2017 disproportionately favored businesses. He also called for more state spending on education and public works infrastructure, emphasizing that he wants to leave the state in stronger financial condition than when he took office at the beginning of 2011.""Restoring fiscal stability to our state budget is one of the most important legacies I can leave Minnesota,"" Dayton said. ""During my final year in office, I will not support any budget, tax, or policy proposals, which would threaten that stability. I urge legislators to do the same.""Taxes are the biggest issue facing Dayton and the 201 lawmakers he addressed Wednesday, with a legislative session that runs just over two more months. Without Minnesota-specific adjustments, the major federal tax overhaul signed by President Donald Trump in late 2017 will leave residents and businesses swimming in a morass of new complexity or tax increases. Dayton will release his detailed tax plan Friday.The Legislature has reduced businesses' property taxes, and the federal bill cut the corporate tax rate, Dayton said.""So, our number one priority -- which will be reflected in my budget on Friday -- should be tax fairness for individual Minnesotans and their families,"" he said, drawing applause from both Republicans and DFLers.House Speaker Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said Republicans agree with that goal.""We want to make sure our tax code is fair, and we want to make sure it is competitive,"" Daudt said after the speech. ""And we want to make sure Minnesotans have an opportunity to prosper and do well for their families, for their small businesses, for their employees.""GOP leaders were not as receptive to Dayton's call for the Legislature to listen to students who are asking for gun restrictions. A bill to expand background checks for gun transfers and purchases, and another measure creating a registry of lost and stolen firearms would save lives, Dayton said in his speech, promising to sign such legislation should it reach his desk.Those comments were ""poking a finger in our eye"" and are not going to happen, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-Nisswa, said. ""We want to focus on the things that unite us.""Dayton and lawmakers have a $329 million projected budget surplus, but they also face fiscal challenges, including an uncertain environment surrounding federal health programs and the sunsetting of a lucrative tax on health care providers at the end of 2019.Dayton also wants a big infrastructure bonding bill -- $1.5 billion -- with significant investments in colleges and universities and water treatment facilities.""It's almost impossible to provide world-class educations in antiquated buildings with leaky ceilings, dilapidated bathrooms, worn-out exteriors, and in classrooms without advanced technologies and other learning aids,"" Dayton said.In addition to higher education infrastructure funding, he said he would include $10 million for both the University of Minnesota and Minnesota State system in his proposal and called for the Legislature's support. University officials recently said they would not increase tuition next year if they got that amount in additional funding.Amid his ambitious agenda and a shrinking window of time, Dayton must grapple with a Republican-controlled Legislature with whom he has clashed bitterly, going so far as to veto money for legislative staff and salaries in 2017. That fight wound up at the state Supreme Court, with Dayton winning the case but relenting on legislative funding in recent weeks.Rep. Dean Urdahl, R-Grove City, chairman of the House Capital Investment Committee, said Republicans will take ""a real good strong look"" at Dayton's higher education request. They will not agree to everything the governor wants but will spend more in that area than in years past, he said.The $1.5 billion proposal includes $167 million for water infrastructure. Urdahl said that investment is key, as cities and towns' water pipes are wearing out. ""That's a down payment essentially on something we will have to continue in the future,"" Urdahl said.When he took office more than seven years ago, Dayton said state funding for elementary and secondary education was in the bottom half of the 50 states, but they are now ranked 18th. That's not good enough, he said.It was one of several rankings that the governor, always fond of statistics, mentioned in his speech to highlight the comparative high quality of life in the state.Dayton also renewed his call for a ""MinnesotaCare Buy-In,"" which would allow all residents to participate in the MinnesotaCare health care program currently available to people with low incomes. It could offer some families better health care coverage at lower costs, he said, noting the recent spike in people without health insurance after several years when that number had trended downward.Senate Minority Leader Tom Bakk said he wished Dayton would have raised one other tax in 2013: the gas tax to fund transportation infrastructure. ""It's the one area that didn't get addressed during his time,"" Bakk said. But he praised Dayton for supporting the construction of a new Vikings stadium, which was not politically popular but has spurred development in Minneapolis.Dayton started the half-hour speech by making light of his dehydration-related collapse near the end of last year's State of the State.""Some people have suggested I conclude my speech now, to make certain I can walk out by myself,"" he said.As he concluded his final State of the State address, the 71-year-old governor referenced the recent, $300 million State Capitol restoration, noting how legislators put aside partisanship to complete it.""Look at what we accomplished, by working together,"" Dayton said. ""Just imagine what more we can do if we continue.""Jessie Van Berkel - 651-925-5044J. Patrick Coolican - 651-925-5042\Credit: JESSIE VAN BERKEL; J. PATRICK COOLICAN; STAFF WRITERS"
253,"Governor holds firm to veto threat over early ed funding\Minnesota legislators came to a messy finish Monday at midnight, scrambling to finalize decisions about tens of billions of taxpayer dollars amid uncertainty about the likely political fallout if Gov. Mark Dayton lives up to his threat to veto $17 billion in education spending.\The GOP-led House adjourned just before midnight, after muscling through a jobs bill over shouted objections from DFLers who said they had not even been allowed to read the bill. The Senate passed a $107 million bonding bill at 12:02, too late for the House to act on it.\Both the GOP-led House and DFL-controlled Senate passed the education budget bill over Dayton's repeated warnings that it shorted funds for his top priority -- expansion of prekindergarten classes for 4-year-olds at public schools.\""I say this very respectfully to the governor: You've had five months to build the support and gain the votes in the Legislature for his number one priority, and unfortunately it didn't pass either body,"" GOP House Speaker Kurt Daudt said. ""That's not my problem.""\Still, Daudt acknowledged he had been working as late as 11:30 p.m. to strike a last-min\ute education spending compromise and head off a veto. He acknowledged the likelihood of a special session and said he hoped Dayton would call it quickly.\Dayton kept a low profile Monday as lawmakers worked to finish up. But that was only after a series of weekend news conferences where he blasted Republicans for not supporting the roughly $170 million he is seeking to allow elementary schools to offer half-day prekindergarten.\The closing hours of the session were confusing and full of uncertainty over how it would finish, with an ironclad midnight deadline to adjourn.\When Republicans suggested that Democrats were trying to slow House debate, Rep. Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, said ""You're already free-falling to the concrete for getting this thing done on time.""\Tensions were running high in both bodies over the knowledge that a veto of the education bill -- one of the two biggest appropriations bills in the state budget -- would make a special session all but definite. When such a session might start was not immediately apparent. Only the governor can convene a special session. The next regular session is set for March 8, 2016.\""I feel pretty good about where we're at,"" Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, told reporters earlier on Monday, despite ending the regular session with no deal on significant tax cuts or a major transportation spending package funded by a new gas tax, which were the main priorities respectively of House Republicans and Senate Democrats.\""Transportation was supposed to be the issue of this session, and this is where we are,"" said House Minority Leader Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, minutes before the House passed a vastly scaled-back transportation funding bill that even its backers described as a ""lights on"" approach.\Still up in the air was the fate of the bonding bill, which includes a $30 million pot for ongoing Capitol renovation. Because the House adjourned without taking it up, the bonding bill may have to wait for a special session if one is called.\Bakk stressed in recent days that he personally supports Dayton's prekindergarten funding request but could not get House Republicans on board. By late Monday, Bakk seemed to consider a special session inevitable. ""The governor's going to do what the governor's going to do,"" he said. His main request was that Dayton not call it immediately.\""People need to go home and recharge and let some of the emotion out,"" Bakk said. But as more days pass without definitive resolution to the next two years of education funding, political pressure is likely to rise. The administration has warned that the Department of Education would have to shut down on July 1, other state educational institutions would also be shuttered, and teachers could start getting layoff notices.\The Capitol renovation project has made holding a special session inside the building most likely impossible. While Dayton on Sunday suggested a special session could be held in a tent on the Capitol lawn, on Monday the possibility of tonier digs surfaced: The St. Paul Hotel issued a news release offering its premises as a possibility.\Also unclear was whether $25 billion in spending spelled out in the remaining half-dozen budget bills, many of which are also threaded with policy changes, would pass muster with Dayton.\The governor has three days to accept or reject budget bills, and Dayton's staff plans to comb through them, looking for possible red flags.\A budget bill funding state agency operations drew the ire of DFL State Auditor Rebecca Otto, as it would allow counties to hire private firms to audit their finances rather than review by Otto's office.\""This is why this work should not be done in the middle of the night,"" Otto said.\Other DFL-aligned interest groups called for vetoes of several of the budget bills, including one that funds agricultural and environmental programs, and another for the courts and public safety.\Dayton's staff said he hasn't yet zeroed in on details of the other budget bills so far, saving his focus in recent days for the education spending dispute. Despite numerous warning shots from their fellow Democrat in the governor's office, Senate DFLers mostly lined up behind the education bill, which increases state spending on schools by $400 million over the next two years. Much of that increase goes directly to yearly state aid increases to schools of 1.5 percent next year and 2 percent the following year.\In a heated exchange at 2 a.m. Monday on the same bill, Rep. Ann Lenczewski, DFL-Bloomington, said during the House debate that it contained $30.5 million in tax increases.\Rep. Jenifer Loon, R-Eden Prairie, said they included a delay of a sales tax exemption as well as the disallowance of a working family credit by Wisconsin residents who worked in Minnesota, and came at the request Senate and House leadership. The House passed the E-12 bill 71-59 just before 5 a.m., with House DFLers lining up behind Dayton and voting against it. The Senate passed it by 52-14 a few hours later, with just a few DFLers and Republicans peeling off.\The final education bill did not include changes to seniority-based school hiring, which had been a major priority for House Republicans.\While the prospect of Dayton's next steps hung over the final-night festivities, state Rep. Nick Zerwas, R-Elk River, said both political parties accomplished enough to call the session a success.\""I think there's enough for both parties to feel like they didn't get everything they wanted, and they got some of the stuff they wanted,"" Zerwas said. ""To me that's balanced government, that's compromise.""\Staff writer Abby Simons contributed to this report.\What was held up: About $1 billion of a projected surplus will remain unspent.\What did pass: Bills on education, social services, public safety, environment and agriculture and National Guard voting. Details, A8.\What's next: Dayton's threatened veto of the E-12 bill would trigger a special session over the bill's exclusion of prekindergarten funding.\Credit: PATRICK CONDON; RICARDO LOPEZ; STAFF WRITERS"
254,"A lottery amendment to the state constitution will appear on the November ballot after slipping through political mine fields and winning passage by the Minnesota House and Senate late Wednesday night.\The lottery bill won House approval on a 77-55 vote, before the House adjourned at 10:37 p.m. It passed the Senate about an hour later on a 37-28 vote. The Senate adjourned at 12:13 a.m. until Monday, when both houses will return to their work for the session. Voting on the bill cut across party lines in both Houses.\Rep. Willard Munger, DFL-Duluth, chief house sponsor, called the bill, which also creates an environment and natural resources trust fund, one of the most important that the Legislature will ever pass.\""This bill sets aside funds for environmental protection and the enhancement of our natural resources, so that your grandchildren and your children will have money to take care of the mistakes we have made during this generation,"" he said.\Legislators planned to recess until Monday to give negotiators on other unresolved issues - including property tax reduction, school spending and workers' compensation - more time and opportunity to find compromises.\The lottery bill passed by the House and Senate late last night is far different from what Gov. Rudy Perpich had called for as the centerpiece of his legislative package this year. Although the proposed constitutional amendments in the bill go directly to the voters, other parts of the bill will go to the governor's desk for his signature or veto. Perpich would not say yesterday what he'll do when the bill reaches his desk. After a day of political maneuvering at the Capitol, it was evening before the Senate and House convened floor sessions to take up the lottery and other bills. In addition to the lottery, major bills passed last night included:\# A 3-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase, to go into effect May 1.\# $134 million in additional funds for state highway improvement and public transit, giving approval to 36 deferred road and bridge construction projects scheduled this summer.\# A requirement that license plates be replaced by motorists every seven years.\# The Senate passed a revised plan to cut employers' workers' compensation costs, in the wake of Perpich's veto Wednesday of an earlier workers' compensation bill. The House adjourned without taking action on workers' compensation. The proposals are designed to win Perpich's approval for some measure to give employers relief from rising workers' comp costs.\The lottery bill actually contains two constitutional amendments - one authorizing a lottery operated by the state, the other creating an environmental trust fund.\It also has statutory language, not the constitutional dedication Perpich had demanded, marking lottery funds for the Greater Minnesota Corporation and the environmental fund if it is approved. And it takes $80.5 million out of the corporation's current bankroll.\The statutory portion of the bill is under a veto threat by Perpich, who ordered legislators to keep hands off corporation funds. Constitutional amendments do not need the governor's signature to go to the ballot.\Word that a lottery bill not to his liking was headed for his desk brought the strongest hint yet from Perpich that he might seek another four-year term in 1990, so that he can put in place the economic development programs that he had tied to lottery funding.\""I guess Roger Moe likes me as governor,"" Perpich said with a laugh. Asked by reporters if he meant he'll seek another term, the governor quickly said, ""I didn't say that."" He refused to elaborate.\Perpich referred to Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, whose ambition to run for governor is widely known. Earlier this session, the governor said that that if Moe wants him to step aside and clear the way for Moe to run for governor in 1990, the Erskine DFLer should help pass Perpich's 1988 legislative initiatives.\Moe and the governor have battled throughout the session over the lottery and other bills. The majority leader said yesterday's lottery bill was the only compromise that could muster enough votes in the Senate to pass.\Moe and House Speaker Robert Vanasek said they expect the governor to sign the bill. But just for insurance, Moe said, a separate tax bill also will provide for the transfer of the $80.5 million from the Greater Minnesota Corporation needed to offset this session's spending.\Perpich has said he wants the long-term, stable funding for the Greater Minnesota Corporation that only constitutional dedication of lottery proceeds can provide. Fund dedication by state law keeps the money within the Legislature's grasp.\Perpich views the corporation as the best tool to stimulate job creation in outstate Minnesota. He eventually wants a $1 billion trust fund for the corporation.\""I've been long-term all my life, and I'm not going to give up. I am determined that we are going to have a one-economy state, and I'm going to stay here until it happens,"" he said, referring to the contention that a farm and mining depression has turned Minnesota into a ""two-economy state.""\""If (funding for the corporation is) not in the constitution, you have to be there to make sure it's there. . . . I have real strong feelings about making this a one-economy state (again).\""I really don't want to leave until I'm sure we're back where we were in the '70s,"" he said yesterday.\The House-Senate agreement that produced the lottery bill, considered essential to breaking logjams on other bills, almost fell apart earlier in the day.\When a conference committee met yesterday morning to finish its report, several House members balked at endorsing the deal negotiated by Moe and Munger, chief sponsors of the bill. At least three members from each side, on a 10-member conference committee composed of five House and five Senate members, must sign a conference committee report. It appeared for several hours there would not be enough House signers.\But Vanasek stepped in and talked with House conferees, and by evening all five had decided to vote for the compromise bill.\Only one of the Senate conferees, Sen. Gene Merriam, DFL-Coon Rapids, did not sign the conference committee report.\Munger, whose original bill covered only the environmental trust fund, agreed to combine it with the lottery a month ago because of the money it would provide for what he calls the best long-range environmental plan in the nation.\The Duluth DFLer had supported the governor and held out for several days for constitutional dedication. Saying statutory dedication ""isn't worth the paper it's written on,"" Munger said, ""I'll never marry again for money.""\But by yesterday, he had no choice but to get an environmental trust fund established this year, he said. Munger promised he'll be back in the future pushing for constitutional dedication.\Two House DFL conferees, Reps. Glen Anderson of Bellingham and Tom Osthoff of St. Paul, said even statutory dedication is meaningless unless so-called enabling legislation is passed this year, spelling out how that will be done. If that is not passed this year and voters approve the lottery amendment, it will be up to the 1989 Legislature to enact such legislation. That could delay the start of a lottery's operation six months or more.\Moe defended the absence of enabling language from the lottery bill.\The Senate wants to take establishment of a lottery one step at a time, he said."
255,"INFRASTRUCTURE\This week looms large for Minnesota's transportation infrastructure as the Legislature's Transportation Conference Committee seeks to find common ground to address our annual funding gap for roads, bridges and transit. As a transportation civil engineer, I worked alongside other engineers for many years providing accurate data so that politicians were aware of funding shortages and the consequences of not taking action. I am proud that a very talented group of civil engineers from the American Society of Civil Engineers Minnesota prepared the 2018 Minnesota Infrastructure Report Card, our state's first report card, which played such an important role in the preparation of the current transportation funding legislation developed by Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota House legislators. Their proposed legislation addresses the needs put forth in the report card and, if enacted, would significantly raise the D+ grade for roads as well as for transit (C-) and bridges (C).\I urge support for a significant gas tax increase and for the other funding proposals to address our transportation funding gap. These will serve Minnesota well for years to come.\We cannot afford to wait any longer. We can do better than a D+.\Randy Geerdes, Plymouth\CLIMATE CHANGE\Species extinction warning is 'overwhelming,' but we can help\The U.N. report on declining biodiversity (""1 million species face threat of extinction,"" front page, May 7) makes clear the implications of human choices on the natural world. We've also been warned for decades that human impacts are changing the climate patterns. Overwhelming, right? What can we do beyond recycling and refusing drinking straws?\We can join organizations working to address these concerns, reduce our personal consumption, buy locally and insist that political candidates factor sustainability in their policies.\Also, we can change our taste in lawns. Personal taste can be altered, and the classic lawn of green velvet should go out of style in the interest of the environment. Biodiverse lawns need to be mowed less often, allow more rainwater to be absorbed and provide for pollinators. I'm grateful for neighbors who accept this perspective.\Janet Mitchell, Northfield\TESTOSTERONE RULING\'Natural advantages' and fair play\The ruling that South African runner Caster Semenya's dangerously powerful body must be chemically handicapped in fairness to her competitors doesn't go far enough in protecting all of us from people who are better at things than we are (""Testosterone ruling hits hard,"" May 2). Every single Olympic athlete is fitter, stronger and more determined than I am. Most are healthier, many are taller and a good many are probably cuter. Some of them probably lack my sweet tooth and ever-growing queue of Netflix series. All of these qualities provide intolerable natural advantages, impermissible in the name of fair play.\Limiting Semenya's natural physical abilities until the runners-up and also-rans can compete with her is only the beginning of fairness; a truly level playing field requires bringing them all down to the level of us never-runs.\Alexander Hindin, St. Louis Park\SENTENCING COMMISSION\A needed voice in the justice system\Kudos to Gov. Tim Walz for appointing much-needed new voices to the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission (""She brings an ex-con's view to state prison panel,"" front page, May 7). As Minnesotans, we like to pat ourselves on the back for having a lower incarceration rate than most other states. However, that frame leaves out the fact that the U.S. is an outlier, and even Minnesota's incarceration rate is higher than most countries in the world. Further, because of extreme probation lengths, we have more people under correctional control than most other states.\Having followed the commission closely over the past several years, I was struck by how it was dominated by people with prosecutorial mind-sets. Walz's appointments will bring some much-needed balance and a path toward making Minnesota a leader in smarter and more equitable criminal justice policy.\Lars Negstad, Minneapolis\VENEZUELA\Why decry involvement in one country and advocate it in another?\Please tell me why folks in the U.S. can't stand the thought of Russia meddling with U.S. presidential elections and yet the same folks seem to think it is OK for us to be meddling in the affairs of other countries (editorial, May 7)? This is the case now with the U.S. thinking it should be in charge of who leads Venezuela, even going so far as imposing sanctions and threatening military involvement. The hypocrisy and arrogance of our leaders and citizens is astounding to me.\Barry Riesch, St. Paul\HEALTH CARE\Expand mental health treatment model to help Minnesotans\With respect to the Star Tribune's recent article on Minnesota mental health care (""Mental health outreach cut short?"" front page, April 28), I'm writing to argue that the expansion of Minnesota's mental health treatment model is essential for current patients and all individuals who are seeking mental health care access.\As the rates of mental illnesses rise, there is a need now more than ever for accessible community mental health services. Individuals who are struggling with a mental illness face enough challenges and shouldn't be presented with another problem of lack of care. According to Mental Health America, 46% of adults in Minnesota who had a mental illness in 2017 did not receive treatment. Individuals with a mental health diagnosis need a wide range of services that are not accessible for most people when care is fragmented.\While some politicians are against the funding for the expansion of this program, it will likely save the state money down the road by reducing expensive hospitalization costs and improving mobile crisis response. If Minnesota residents don't advocate for the expansion of this program and action isn't taken, the result will be devastating for all individuals with a mental illness, as well as their friends and families.\Madeline Nelson, St. Paul\EDITORIAL CARTOON\Where is this $27 minimum wage?\I can't help but imagine the reactions of wealthy conservatives and wealthy liberals to Dana Summers' Obama-Trump cartoon (opinion exchange, May 7) being split finely between smug grins and inelegant sputtering. However, one statistic that I'm sure made the working-class Joes and Janes raise an eyebrow was the purported ""$27 average minimum wage."" Where exactly in America are full-time workers guaranteed such comfort, when few places can even manage to guarantee them a paltry $15? To be fair, I'm sure Summers just meant to cite the ""average wage."" Of course, considering that the average wage can be boosted by the gains of the top 1% alone, maybe the completely inaccurate qualifier had another purpose.\Paul Villerius, Minneapolis"
256,"issues that still need work \BONDING \The issue: How much should the state borrow for a wide range of construction projects? The bonding bill is the traditional method of spurring jobs in the building trades. It's also a bipartisan method for legislators to return home with tangible evidence that they accomplished something for their districts. \What's happened: What hasn't? The Legislature approved a $925 million measure that provided $70 million for the Central Corridor light rail project between Minneapolis and St. Paul, $38 million to remodel the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center, $136 million for the University of Minnesota, and much more. Gov. Tim Pawlenty vetoed substantial portions of the bill to cut it down to $717 million. Among the scratched items were the Central Corridor and nearly every other project proposed for St. Paul. \What now: Republican Pawlenty strongly hinted that the Central Corridor money could be restored if the DFL-controlled Legislature plays ball on a revised state budget. Favorite Pawlenty projects rejected by the Legislature -- including a new state park at Lake Vermilion and a nursing care facility at the Minneapolis Veterans Home -- could also make a comeback. \. \BRIDGE SURVIVORS \The issue: There were 183 people on the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis when it collapsed last August. Thirteen died and scores were injured. The state is considering how to financially compensate the survivors and families of those killed. \What's happened: The House and the Senate have passed victim compensation bills, but the two approaches have substantial differences. The House would set aside nearly $40 million for victims and would not put a limit on individual awards. The Senate would cap individual claims at $400,000 and set aside a total of $26.5 million. \What now: A conference committee is trying to reach a compromise. Gov. Pawlenty is leaning toward the Senate bill but said he would be inclined to provide more money for the most severe cases. \. \BUDGET \The issue: The state faces a $936 million projected deficit for the 2008-09 budget period. \What's happened: The House, Senate and Gov. Pawlenty all propose solutions that include tapping state budget reserves and cutting services. Pawlenty's plan would cut nearly twice as much as the House and would hit health and human services and the state's colleges and universities the hardest. The House would raise more than $200 million in tax revenues. The Senate hews closer to Pawlenty's spending cuts than the House and would rely less on tax increases but still would raise revenues far more than Pawlenty. \What now: The House is the outlier right now, using more money from the state's reserves and cash flow account than the Senate and governor. But the differences are bridgeable. A little give on all sides could produce at least a temporary budget solution, but Republicans have served notice that they will help with no more veto overrides. \. \EDUCATION \The issue: Legislators are mainly trying to keep budget-balancing cuts away from schools. \What's happened: Legislators tucked a small K-12 funding increase into their budget bills, but it may not survive. A DFL initiative to raise from 16 to 18 the age when a student could quit school might also be shelved until next year. \What now: DFLers, in particular, are saving their powder for next year, when they hope to begin a massive funding push for schools. That's likely to involve new or increased taxes. \. \HEALTH CARE \The issue: How to expand health coverage and curb diseases like diabetes without spending a lot of money doing it. \What's happened: Legislators have backed off from their most ambitious plans for universal health coverage. Instead, the House and Senate have passed bills providing for a more modest expansion of coverage and programs to prevent illness. The House bill would rely heavily on the Health Care Access Fund, which finances MinnesotaCare for the working poor, to pay for some of the estimated $100 million in annual costs. The Senate version would essentially tax hospitals and insurers. \What now: The proposals will encounter resistance from Republican legislators and Gov. Pawlenty, who wants to use $250 million from the access fund to make up part of the state's budget shortfall. \. \JOBZ \The issue: Gov. Pawlenty's primary job-creation program was criticized by the Legislative Auditor as giving tax breaks to firms that don't need them. But many outstate DFL legislators have constituents who benefit from the breaks, a reality that tempers any move to kill a program that has given $50 million in tax exemptions since 2004. \What's happened: The Senate voted to curtail the program as part of its tax bill. More than 300 firms already in JOBZ would continue receiving tax exemptions through 2015, but no firms could enter the program after May 1. The House has not passed a tax bill. \What now: Pawlenty defends his program as a key outstate economic development tool and has proposed expanding it. The future of JOBZ could become a bargaining chip in tax talks between the governor and DFLers. \. \on the 'done' list \CAROL MOLNAU \The issue: After the collapse of the I-35W bridge, Transportation Commissioner/Lt. Gov. Molnau was viewed by critics as a symbol of the state's transportation problems. Her gruff personality, and her low profile following the collapse, made her a target of DFLers who vowed to oust her from the MnDOT post by holding a Senate confirmation hearing. \What's happened: Senate DFLers removed Molnau from the transportation job in late February, just three days after overriding Pawlenty on the transportation package. \What now: Molnau was replaced at MnDOT on an interim basis by top aide Bob McFarlin, who is receiving praise from even some of the Transportation Department's harshest critics. Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Steve Murphy, DFL-Red Wing, said he would support McFarlin as permanent department head. McFarlin is one of several candidates for the post. \. \OUTDOORS \THE ISSUE: FOR A DECADE, THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO AMEND THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO HELP FUND OUTDOORS PROGRAMS. \What's happened: Legislators voted to put a proposal on the ballot to raise the state sales tax by 3/8 of 1 percent to help fund outdoor programs, the arts and the environment. \What now: Minnesotans will vote on the proposed constitutional amendment in November. If approved, it would eventually generate about $276 million a year for groups as disparate as deer hunters and public TV viewers. \. \TRANSPORTATION \The issue: The DFL majority started the session with a promise to quickly pass a major transportation package, paying for it in part with the first increase in the state gasoline tax in 20 years. Another provision would let seven metro counties levy a quarter-cent sales tax for transit projects. \What's happened: In what remain the signature moments of the session, the Legislature approved a $6.6 billion bill, Pawlenty vetoed it and the Legislature overrode the veto. The House override occurred when six Republicans voted against the governor, and then faced political retaliation from GOP officials. An angry Pawlenty predicted the vote would lead to a ""tax revolt"" and warned DFLers to ""buckle their seat belts."" \What now: The first two cents of a gas tax increase of up to 8.5 cents a gallon kicked in on April 1, and five metro counties have voted to being charging the sales tax. \. \Staff writers Mark Brunswick, Pat Doyle, Norman Draper, Mike Kaszuba and Patricia Lopez contributed to this report."

This was written while traveling down King's Highway.Kelly Bent, MinneapolisPRIVACYPaulsen, Lewis and Emmer seem to think little of oursOn Tuesday, the U.S. House voted to repeal protections against the sale of web users' personal information to the highest bidder. The Senate passed the measure last week, and President Trump is expected to sign it into law. All Minnesota Republicans in the House -- Tom Emmer, Jason Lewis, Erik Paulsen -- voted in favor of passing this bill; our Democratic lawmakers voted to protect our privacy.Here is a small list of some of the information that can be sold to the highest bidder by your internet service provider: geographic location, children's information, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, health information, financial information, name and address, Web browsing history, your IP address, and what size clothing you wear.I'm just wondering whom our representatives work for. Their constituents, or the corporations that will benefit from this law? I'm curious to know how much money their campaigns were promised for their vote.Jane Conrad, Richmond, Minn.- - - On Tuesday, my representative, Erik Paulsen, made two votes that appear to be a massive contradiction. As a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, he voted against the release of President Trump's taxes. That's the second time he's done so in committee and the fourth overall. His office has explained to me that he votes this way because he does not believe that individuals should be compelled to release their taxes and that he feels the president should do so voluntarily. It's a matter of personal privacy, and the government shouldn't violate that.But then that very day, only a short time later, Rep. Paulsen (Reps. Lewis and Emmer) voted to allow internet service providers to collect and sell data on an individual's online search and browsing history.Why does my representative care so much for President Trump's privacy and so little for yours and mine?I couldn't say if it's the $50,500 in donations he's received from telecom companies. In fact, I called staffers in both his D.C. and Minnesota offices just hours before the vote, and they didn't know Paulsen's position on the second vote, nor could they direct me to anyone who did.So if Paulsen's own staff members don't know what's driving his votes, how can I?Rob Wilcox, Eden PrairiePUBLIC BROADCASTINGIt's not just about PBSBy focusing only on PBS, the writer of the March 30 letter ""Taxpayer support unneeded"" understates the value provided by the CPB (Corporation for Public Broadcasting), which provides critical funding to a variety of ""public media"" outlets throughout the country. In Minnesota, there are 18 AMPERS community- and university-owned radio stations (many in rural areas) providing irreplaceable programming, resources and community services. WTIP in Grand Marais is one of those stations. As a WTIP volunteer radio host and a member of the board of directors, I can attest to the many ways community radio stations like WTIP connect their listeners to the world around them. In some areas, they are the only local source for news, information, and emergency alerts and information, e.g., forest fires, storms, road closures and evacuations. I would also note that federal funding for these stations comes directly from the CPB, while also allowing the station to raise additional funds from private sources. Public media funding represents only 0.01 percent of the federal budget but reaches 98 percent of Americans with free, essential, noncommercial programming. Seems like an excellent value proposition to me.Mike Reeves, Lake ElmoTHE ENVIRONMENTShifting problems downstreamAs a retired Minnesota Pollution Control Agency water research scientist, it was discouraging to read the March 30 article ""GOP seeks to reshape water, air policies."" The nutrients being discussed, phosphorus and nitrogen, are elements, which means they won't break down over time or as they move downstream. So they are not going away. Over the large scale, not preventing them from entering the water is not going to save the economy money. It will save the discharger money, but that cost and then some will be passed on downstream. It is well-established in the economic community that it is always less expensive to prevent pollution than to restore a resource that is polluted.So the Legislature is actually going to increase costs by their actions. But those increased costs will be downstream and to groups not influencing legislators.Downstream drinking water suppliers will have to pay more for nitrate removal and the impacts of excess algal breakdown products. Downstream lakes, such as Lake Pepin, and lake associations will have to deal with the impacts of excess algae from the phosphorus released from community wastewater treatment plants upstream in the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. And the Gulf of Mexico dead zone pollution, threatening the jobs of the fishing and shrimping industry in Louisiana, is directly related to the phosphorus and nitrogen pollution upstream. Because these are elements, they have not lost their potency.Legislators' actions in demonizing and minimizing the MPCA are very shortsighted and un-Minnesotan and are bad for the environment and the economy.Howard Markus, WoodburyROAD USEChamber neutral on truck weightsRegarding the March 30 editorial ""Heavier trucks vs. the rest of us"": To be clear, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce is neutral on the issue of truck weights.We do fully support the work by the Minnesota Department of Transportation in recent years to stretch taxpayer dollars and find efficiencies in project delivery. Since 2014, by its own account and as a result of collaborative work with the chamber, MnDOT has realized savings of roughly $230 million in its annual construction program. That money has been reinvested into projects around the state. It's an amount equal to more than a 2-cent gas tax increase each of the last three years.For example, in 2014, $30 million was saved in the St. Croix River crossing project by managing such issues as advancing parts of the project schedule and enhancing the design of bridges on the Minnesota side, and $20 million was saved in the Red Wing bridge project by adjusting the design to meet future capacity needs. These savings were reinvested in extensive work on Interstate 494 from I-394 to I-94, and on rebuilding 50 miles of pavement on I-90.We will continue our work with MnDOT and other stakeholders to be sure Minnesota taxpayers are getting the biggest bang for every dollar invested into our transportation system.Doug Loon; president, Minnesota Chamber of CommerceCLARIFICATIONA March 30 editorial misstated a characteristic of proposed changes to weight restrictions on trucks in Minnesota. A proposal in the Legislature would allow 50-ton trucks to travel on state and county highways and local roads, but not on interstate highways, where the limit would remain at 40 tons."
258," In moves aimed at boosting gasoline supplies and holding down prices at the pump, President Bush on Tuesday ordered a temporary freeze on oil companies' deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and granted a 20-day waiver of ethanol requirements for refineries.\ Bush directed the Justice Department to investigate possible price-gouging and urged oil companies to reinvest their record profits, which he called ""large cash flows,"" into expanding refining capacity and developing new energy sources.\ He was joined by lawmakers from both parties as they vied to demonstrate their concern over escalating gasoline prices in a barrage of speeches, news conferences and bill introductions.\ Still, analysts predicted that gas prices would remain high through the summer driving season.\ ""We owe it to the American people to be aggressive on price gouging now,"" Bush told members of the Renewable Fuels Association at a Washington hotel. ""We owe it to the American people to be promoting alternative ways to drive their cars so as to make us less dependent on foreign sources of oil. We owe it to the American people to be aggressive in the use of technology so we can diversify away from the hydrocarbon society.""\ Bush, though, rejected more drastic measures proposed by some Democratic lawmakers, such as imposing price controls or levying ""windfall profits"" taxes on oil companies.\ ""Those plans haven't worked in the past,"" Bush said.\ .\ A paean to ethanol's values\ Bush's waiver for clean-air regulations means refiners in the near future will be temporarily exempt from the federal requirement that they include ethanol in gasoline in heavily polluted markets. Because of the logistics of shipping ethanol and blending it with gasoline, the waiver intends to ease supply pressures and avoid shortages, thus keeping prices lower.\ But for the long run, Bush delivered a paean to the value of ethanol, extolling its environment-friendly qualities and ability to be produced in the United States.\ ""It's amazing, isn't it?"" he said. ""Without much cost, your automobile can be converted to be able to burn fuel with 85 percent ethanol, or a product made from corn grown right here in America.""\ Gerald Tumbleson, an ethanol producer in Sherburn, Minn., said Tuesday that he doesn't buy the president's logic in suspending the ethanol requirement, especially long term.\ ""My question is, how does this alleviate the shortage of fuel?"" asked Tumbleson, president of the National Corn Growers Association. ""If you suspend the use of ethanol, doesn't that require more petroleum?""\ Rodney Moe, a producer in Waltham, Minn., was encouraged by Bush's promise that the suspension will be brief. ""The administration seemed very supportive of the renewable energy movement on the whole,"" said Moe, president of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association.\ The change isn't expected to show up at Minnesota gas pumps, said Tim Gerlach, director of Outdoor Air Programs at the American Lung Association of Minnesota.\ ""The clean air rules aren't the reason people are seeing high prices at the pumps,"" Gerlach said. ""If that was the case, wouldn't the oil industry have lower profits than they do? This is disingenuous.""\ .\ Going for $2.86 in Twin Cities\ As Bush's motorcade drove through the streets of Washington, it passed an Exxon station selling gas at almost $3.30 a gallon. The average nationwide price reached $2.96, and the Twin Cities average was $2.86, according to TwinCitiesGasPrices.com.\ And even Bush's aides acknowledged that his proposals are unlikely to provide short-term relief to American drivers.\ ""This is something that has been building for decades,"" said press secretary Scott McClellan. ""It's not something that we got into overnight, it's not something we're going to get out of overnight.""\ Despite the hit at the pump, the U.S. consumer confidence index has risen by 2.1 points in April, reaching its highest level in almost four years.\ More than two-thirds of Americans said the high gas prices have caused a severe or moderate financial hardship for their households, according to a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.\ .\ From the political playbook\ Bush's proposals, a day after GOP congressional leaders urged him to order a probe of possible gasoline price-gouging, reflect Republican lawmakers' concerns entering reelection campaigns already burdened by an unpopular war and several criminal prosecutions of people with close ties to the party.\ ""Few things are less becoming in a political party than desperation, as Republicans are now demonstrating as they panic over rising oil and gas prices,"" the normally conservative Wall Street Journal editorialized Tuesday. ""If blaming private industry for Congress' own energy mistakes is the best the GOP can do, no wonder its voters may sit out the November election.""\ Democrats also scrambled to get ahead of the energy curve. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., announced plans to introduce legislation suspending the federal gas tax - now more than 18 cents a gallon - for 60 days.\ And Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called for Bush's support on legislation making energy price-gouging a federal crime, requiring the manufacture of more alternative-fuel cars and the production of more alternative fuels.\ Staff writer H.J. Cummins contributed to this report.\ James Rosen is a correspondent in the McClatchy Washington Bureau.\ .\ THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE\ What is it? The world's largest supply of emergency crude oil, established to contain enough oil to replace imports for 90 days if the supply of oil to the United States is disrupted.\ Where is it? In five underground salt caverns along the coastline of Texas and Louisiana.\ What is its capacity? 727 million barrels.\ How much oil is in reserve? 687.5 million barrels.\ When has it been used for emergency purposes? In 1991 during Operation Desert Storm and in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina.\ Has oil acquisition for the reserve been suspended before? At least twice: in March 1979, because of the tight international crude oil market, and in August 1990, when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait.\ Sources: Department of Energy; CRS Report for Congress, Apr. 3\ .\ FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS SOAR FOR OIL AND GAS COMPANIES\ - The three largest U.S. oil and gas companies are expected to report combined first-quarter profits this week in excess of $16 billion, a 19 percent surge from last year.\ - The combined earnings expected from ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. will be 14 times greater than the combined first-quarter profits of Google Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and Oracle Corp.\ - The windfall is expected to complicate life for the industry in Washington, where elected officials are scrambling for ways to assuage angry consumers and businesses. Some are renewing calls for a windfall profits tax, and some want federal regulators to investigate industry consolidation.\ .\ WHAT BUSH DID\ - Temporarily suspended environmental rules requiring ethanol blends and oil companies' deposits to the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\ - Ordered federal agencies to launch an investigation into possible price gouging.\ Effect for consumers\ - The changes are not expected to reduce prices much, but could reduce shortages."
259," Ventura's proclamation\ Thank God for Jesse Ventura, and his courage to state in his proclamation what this country is all about - freedom of choice for all of us (""Indivisible Day sets off fireworks,"" July 4).\ As a clergyperson from a liberal tradition, the Protestant Episcopal Church of America, I am sick and tired of all the narrow- minded people who call themselves Christians but don't understand what freedom is all about. Jesus would weep today, as he wept way back when, when people didn't understand his message of love, acceptance and freedom of choice.\ Our country's founders did not create a Christian nation. They did not want religious ideologies to control us politically. Let's keep it that way!\ - The Rev. Kit Reynolds, Minneapolis.\ .\ Gov. Ventura has done it again by pointing out that one doesn't have to be religious to be a patriot.\ Unlike the theist's view, Indivisible Day is inclusive, not exclusive. Whether you wish to live under God or not, the country is big enough for all of us.\ - David Hetterick, Eagan.\ .\ The governor's ""Indivisible Day"" proclamation was the least smarmy evocation of American patriotism I have ever read. It's not an attack on religion; it's a succinct statement about a basic American freedom.\ Today I'm actually proud to have Jesse as my governor.\ - Daniel Pinkerton, Minneapolis.\ .\ Ignoring founders' words\ How sad that Gov. Jesse Ventura ignores the founding document of our nation to declare an Indivisible Day.\ The Declaration of Independence states ""for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.""\ The Founding Fathers pledged everything to become a free nation under God, and no Ventura declaration can change that. He is using the very freedom they established to ignore the God whose protection they invoked.\ - Theressa J. Frost, Bloomington.\ .\ Help for ex-cons\ Thank you to the Star Tribune for its words about the challenges facing ex-offenders when first released from prison. Having been in that position myself and having worked with ex-offenders for the past seven years, I feel qualified to say that our current system of release serves as a greased slide to put people back in prison.\ Prisoners are released without money, identification, housing and employment, and often without the ability to read well enough to fill out a work application. They have lived for years in a highly structured environment where others decided when they would awake, exercise, eat and sleep.\ When released, most ex-offenders are ill-equipped to become self- sufficient, particularly with a criminal record that blocks their efforts to find a job or a place to stay.\ We at St. Stephen's have been working with ex-offenders in our Housing Services program for the past seven years. Those who demonstrate a motivation to change are aided in obtaining state identification, housing, employment and temporary funding while they build a new life.\ Long-term case management is also critical to their success. But we are a small operation and we are doing this work with a minimal amount of funding. At this point there is no government money available for community-based organizations such as ours.\ Corrections Commissioner Sheryl Ramstad Hvass serves us well in her efforts to find funding and an effective plan for successfully transitioning ex-offenders into society.\ There are good people locked up in our prisons, most of them for nonviolent crimes. We would do well to aid them in their efforts to reunite with their families and become contributing members of society.\ I don't know how long I could have tolerated the rejection. I believe Allah opened the door for me. I also believe we need to open the door for others.\ - Richard Amos, Minneapolis.\ .\ Wrong pick for AD\ Joel Maturi, the main candidate for athletic director at the University of Minnesota, is currently the AD at Miami University in Ohio.\ In his first year there he dropped wrestling, men's soccer and men's tennis.\ In 1990, while associate athletic director at the University of Wisconsin, he helped cut men's and women's gymnastics.\ University President Mark Yudof supports Maturi, because he isn't ""afraid to make tough calls."" That is supposedly a good quality, because the University of Minnesota is considering dropping men's gymnastics and men's and women's golf. The tough calls should not be about cutting sports, but rather about thinking of ways to have a successful athletic department with numerous opportunities.\ I am worried that, if Maturi is chosen, programs will again be considered for elimination.\ I am worried that he is being considered because Yudof and Vice President Tonya Moten Brown would like to see the decisions they've made regarding the athletic department continued.\ Let's choose a candidate who is capable of helping the program instead of one who has proven himself capable of harming it.\ - Bob Goss, Minneapolis, Gopher gymnast.\ .\ The square facts\ The June 26 article ""Dare to be Square"" was misleading in several areas. Square dancing is not an activity just for old people. In fact, you need to be in good condition at any age to keep up with the music and the other dancers. At the National Square Dance Convention in St. Paul last month, the youth groups included dancers as young as age 3.\ We are trying to get the message out: Anyone can square dance if they enjoy friendships and music.\ - Jeanne Pearce, Bloomington.\ .\ Make transit a top issue\ The July 1 editorial ""Suburban voters / Traffic is GOP's fault, not MnDOT's,"" places blame for the transportation mess in the Twin Cities where it belongs.\ I can't think of anything scarier than dispatching Republican Carol Molnau, if she is elected lieutenant governor, to shred MnDOT and its plans for transportation. Shewould have a six-lane freeway leading to her home, another six-lane freeway leading to the home of Rep. Phil Krinkie, R-Shoreview, and the rest of us can sit in traffic jams that will only get worse.\ I hope that many people will make transportation a major issue this November. A 6-cents-a-gallon gas tax increase would be a small price to pay for a combination of mass transit and road improvements.\ There is no excuse for a metropolitan area this size to be without light rail, better bus service and improved highways.\ - Peter Sethre, Circle Pines.\ .\ Wrong side of ICC\ The Bush administration's strident opposition to the International Criminal Court (ICC) will be considered the poster child of American arrogance (""Rumsfeld: Peacekeeping roles in doubt,"" July 3).\ Why is the Bush administration afraid of the rule of law and international standards of accountability? We were represented in the development of the ICC by a team of skilled negotiators that built in many safeguards against political prosecution of U.S. soldiers. If Bush hadn't foolishly pulled out of the process, we would still have a strong presence in the final organization.\ We are part of this world community, and if we want to continue to be a world leader, we'll have to exhibit a lot more moral leadership on the ICC and similar issues than we've seen thus far.\ - Terry L. Johnson, Centerville."
260,"THE GREAT RIVER ROAD |\In Minneapolis, West River Parkway runs along one of the most scenic corridors in America, showcasing the great Mississippi River. The Great River Road, following the river from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico, is arguably the longest and most important scenic byway in America. Are we overusing it or underappreciating it?\The parkway has been under reconstruction efforts over the last five years and is showing signs of serious roadway breakdown. It is no longer a recreational drive, but more an auto repair business bonanza. What should be an experience to appreciate nature and showcase Minnesota as the source of the great Mississippi River now has become an area of conflict and embarrassment for our city.\The deteriorated condition has forced cyclists onto the pathways in order to maintain safe travel and accelerated paces for training. This is causing conflicts with pedestrians, recreational cyclists, and families with strollers, Rollerbladers, runners and general users.\St. Paul has been able to accommodate multiuse with a wide roadway, bike lanes and a well-maintained drive surface on its side of the river. It is time for Minneapolis to step up and repair the roadway, accommodate recreational use and mitigate the conflicts.\Michael Bjornberg, Minneapolis\SUGARY DRINKS\Sorry, but all calories are not equal in their influence\The July 9 letter from the president of the Minnesota Beverage Association (""All calories are equal, and beverage firms help you count"") was misleading at best and disingenuous at worst. I grew up thinking all calories were the same, but research shows that is just not true. Calories from sugar do much more harm to our bodies than do other calories. Because sugar causes us to secrete insulin, we end up feeling more hungry, craving more sugar, expanding our waistlines (insulin is the fat-storing hormone), and increasing our chance of obesity and diabetes. One soda a day increases the chance of Type 2 diabetes by 22 percent because of the sugar content. New research suggests that diet sodas are not much better, because our bodies register the sweet taste and ""prepare"" for the sugar surge by secreting insulin.\If you watch the documentary ""Fed Up"" (produced by Laurie David and Katie Couric and available on Netflix) or watch Dr. Mark Hyman, director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, discuss this topic (easy to access on the computer), you will be convinced. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum of six to nine teaspoons of sugar per adult per day. There are more than 11 teaspoons in some sodas. An easy way to get healthier is to limit soda and juice in our diets. The beverage industry would prefer that we believe it is a matter of calorie control; but the truth is that it is the kind of calories we ingest that matters -- and sugar is a food that foils our attempts at weight control and optimal health.\Meri Santos, Richfield\The writer is a registered nurse.\RECREATIONAL DRUGS\Some dangers are more urgent than others, one would think\Heroin use, abuse and deaths are on the rise (July 8), and the focus now (as evidenced by a Minneapolis proposal) is on E-cigs and nicotine?\Brenda Steinberg, Minneapolis\LAKE CALHOUN\To cite American Indian stewardship is generous\A lake core sample can show many things, but stewardship of a lake hundreds of years ago isn't one of them (""Mde Maka Ska: A Minnesota name for a Minnesota lake,"" July 8). In the early 1800s, in the entire area that is now the state of Minnesota, there were approximately the same number of American Indians as there are people in the city of Winona today. Think about that: Spread the entire population of Winona over Minnesota, and how much damage could be done with no technology?\Stewardship had nothing to do with it, as the writers of the July 8 commentary declare, citing their study of sediment at Lake Calhoun. The American Indians used what technology they had to feed, clothe and house themselves, and it wasn't much. Fertilizer for crops came from the remains of fish or other natural sources. There were no commercial fertilizers, no herbicides, no septic systems, no storm drains, no streets or heavy industry; these are the things that destroy water bodies. Not having the means of destruction is not and will never be the same as being good stewards.\The mentality of the noble savage needs to go the way of the Confederate flag. The American Indians acted with far more honor and honesty than the white man, but they scratched out an existence in this state as best they could -- never killing more than their collective need, but totally unable to get ahead as a people because of the lack of technology that affects the environment.\Mark Hayes, Buffalo\MINNESOTA LOYALTY\Sure wish the most talented athletes would stay for college\As much as I admire the talent and ""dogged work ethic"" of young golfer Sarah Burnham, (""Another round of success,"" July 8), I am disappointed that yet another outstanding Minnesota high school athlete chose to leave the state to pursue both her education and athletic career. I certainly wish Burnham well -- but I also wish she were honing those remarkable skills at the University of Minnesota or another fine state school, instead of at Michigan State. I'm tired of reading about all the ones that got away!\Fred L. Klein, Minnetonka\NEW FACES ON CURRENCY\Celebrating writers is not a new idea, but it's a good one\Regarding the July 9 letter proposing that we portray Emily Dickinson on the redesigned $10 bill: It so happens that the idea of celebrating poets on currency is not new. Before my journey to Norway and Sweden recently, I enjoyed seeing the faces of two of my distant ancestors on bills in both currencies. In Sweden, writer Selma Lagerlof can be seen on the 20 kroner bill. The opposite side features geese represented in one of her stories.

He is also a Nobel Prize winner, and he wrote the words to the Norwegian national anthem.

With that investment/sacrifice, they built a national power grid, a national telephone system and a national highway system, as well as many local roads and bridges. That investment released the greatest growth this nation has ever seen.\It was once said in Minnesota: ""Our roads and bridges are pristine and our highways are uncongested!"" What has your generation done with that investment?

261,"MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA |\What a delight it was to read of our Minnesota Orchestra's experiences in Cuba (""Sharing a universal love,"" May 15). The personal interaction between Cuban students and orchestra members will be a life-changing event for many of these young people, and the generosity of the orchestra members in sharing their skills is to be admired. It is not a cliche that ""music is the universal language."" Music is a gift to all who participate in it, and listen to it, regardless of their nationality or culture. A huge thank you to all who made this wonderful opportunity happen.\Rita Juhl, Minneapolis\PROTESTS AND THE POLICE\Questions about participation, but also about the institution\So you took your young son to a protest downtown and he got pepper-sprayed? Was this part of his education to be an ideal citizen when he grows up, or just an excuse to have another complaint against the police? Your child should be home with a baby-sitter while you pursue your adult choices.\Linda Idziorek, Minneapolis\- - - \I am looking forward to the report on why the Minneapolis police used pepper spray on a 10-year-old. I expect it to take about six months, given the previous record of the department and my expectation that almost all of those interviewed will be police. This is based on the situation a couple of years ago involving a fatal collision between a motorcycle and a police vehicle rushing to a crime scene.\Timothy Callaghan, Roseville\- - - \I am 13 and in the seventh grade. My problem is that due to bad law enforcement, I no longer want to be a police officer. It used to be my dream, but that dream is gone unless something changes.\Theo Kronfeld, Golden Valley\THE LEGISLATURE\Headed the wrong way on bees, solar power and the gas tax\I am outraged that the Minnesota Senate has bowed to industry pressure to allow plants sold as ""pollinator friendly"" to contain neonicotinoids and other pesticides (""Senate eases on 'pollinator-friendly' rules,"" May 15). At a time when every schoolchild is concerned about the plight of bees and butterflies; when bee-colony collapse is threatening the very production of our food crops; when U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers have identified the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin as a likely contributor to monarch butterfly declines in North America, and when Heavy Costs, a scientific literature review by the Center for Food Safety of 19 peer-reviewed studies, has revealed that neonicotinoid insecticide seed treatments offer little benefit, do not increase crop yields, and cause widespread environmental and economic damage -- in particular, neonicotinoids have been implicated in bee-population declines and colony collapse -- it is unconscionable that our Legislators and nursery owners care so little about the web of life that they would allow misinformation on plant labeling.\You can ""bee-lieve"" that there is a growing movement of consumers who are demanding truth in labeling and will hold our elected representatives and nursery vendors accountable to get us the information we need to make informed and responsible choices.\Catherine V. Jordan, St. Paul\- - - \I am a business owner of a bike shop in St. Paul, and we proudly have solar on our rooftop. My rooftop system is a benefit to my business by helping me reduce costs. These are costs I no longer must pass onto customers; this allows me to stay competitive as a small business. My rooftop system is also a benefit to Xcel Energy and a benefit to our community. I am adding power to the grid; I am reducing pollution to our environment, and I am helping to grow a local sustainable industry.\Our elected officials are considering harm to essential solar policies that have allowed me and other small-business owners to put solar on our rooftops. The House omnibus energy bill (H.F. 843) includes provisions that will make Minnesota roll back on net metering, a policy that is working in 44 other states. It would be a regressive step for Minnesota as a leader in renewable energy choices for its citizens, and for business owners like me.\Xcel is a willing partner with my rooftop system, along with the state of Minnesota. I would hate to see this partnership be harmed. I hope our elected officials will leave Minnesota's net-metering solar policy as is, and do no harm.\Daniel Casebeer, St. Paul\- - - \Contrary to Peter Nelson's opinion (""Why we need to fix policy on renewables,"" May 15), the House omnibus energy bill will take Minnesota squarely back to the era of dependence on fossil fuels and nuclear power. Minnesotans cannot afford to regress in our aim to solve environmental issues of today and the future energy demands we face. H.F. 843 will gut the incentives that have made the Made in Minnesota Solar Incentive Program so successful. Hundreds of households, including our own, have invested in the solar infrastructure needed to continue to improve the lives of all Minnesotans. If we follow the House GOP plan, Minnesota will be buying coal-generated power from other states. We need clean-energy incentives, not more dependence on fossil and nuclear fuels.\Linnea Tani, Roseville\- - - \Hey, Democrats, gas prices just jumped 15 cents a gallon. Did you really think they were going to be low forever? Remember when the gas prices were almost $4.30 a gallon and how we griped about the oil companies gouging us? Now Gov. Mark Dayton and his tax-and-spend cohorts want to add another 16 cents a gallon tax on us! How does $4.45 a gallon sound to you? You call your liberal politicians and tell them they are to back off this nonsense. They might listen to you. They sure won't listen to me.\Matt Linzbach, Merrifield, Minn.\Amtrak\Incongruous action from Congress following derailment\Amtrak suffered a horrific and deadly derailment last week. Most agree that the excessive speed that caused the catastrophic accident could not have occurred on a truly modern rail system. As is the case in almost all First World countries, the track could have been equipped with automatic train control. The lack of such modern safety devices on Amtrak is a direct consequence of our demanding more speed, reliability and, yes, safety, from the company than we are willing to pay for. To my amazement and disgust, less than 24 hours after this avoidable tragedy, a gaggle of U.S. House members, mostly of the party that claims ""common sense"" as a mantra, voted to cut funding to America's passenger-rail system by $250 million.\Thomas Beaumont, Minneapolis\RELIGION\Many of us do just fine without it\I would like to offer a different perspective from the May 15 letter writer who responded to the May 13 article ""Fewer in U.S. say they are Christian."" I was relieved to read that people are moving away from organized religion. Freethinkers or ""nones"" are becoming the largest-growing group in the category of religion. What a breath of fresh air compared with evangelical Christians who want everyone to believe as they do.\Christians certainly have the right to believe what they want. I would ask for the same respect for those of us who aren't interested in dogma that is based on pagan belief and superstition. I encourage people to read, think and question. Be open to those of us who are good, moral and loving people without the restrictions of organized religion.\Nikki Argos Laliberte, South St. Paul"
262,"Should the role of political party chairmen end at the steps of the Capitol?\The question arises from a letter Republican Party Chairman Tony Sutton wrote to Republican legislators last month.\In the letter, Sutton urged Republicans to ""resist any revenue enhancement proposals like raising taxes, raising fees, expanding gambling, expanding the sales tax or any other such schemes that not only violate our principles, but are also bad politics and bad public policy.""\There also were lines like this:\[bullet] ""People voted for you because they were looking for a different approach to the big government policies of the DFL""\[bullet] ""You remember the environment in which you were elected.""\[bullet] ""When you cut through all the clutter the voters are expecting you to be true to your principles.""\Where's the line?\Was Sutton out of line? Was there an implied threat in the letter that anyone who might compromise with DFL Gov. Mark Dayton would lose support of the party? Was Sutton meddling too much in the business of a democracy, which often is filled with compromise?\Start with Sutton, who says the media -- especially the Star Tribune, which broke the story of the letter -- are reading far too much into his letter.\""The newspaper grabbed it and made a bigger deal of it than it is,"" he said. ""All I was doing was thanking them for what they've done and offering a little rah-rah encouragement to stick to their principles. For whatever reason, there are some who are reading more into it. My intention was to encourage and praise. Nothing more. To read more into it is to buy into the bias of those who buy into the Republican stereotypes that we're inflexible.""\It probably doesn't help Sutton's cheerleading argument that his party has been quick to punish those who have strayed from the party line.\In 2008, Republican legislative leaders and party activists came down hard on six members of the Republican House caucus who voted to override a veto of a transportation bill by Gov. Tim Pawlenty.\In the last election cycle, the GOP ""exiled"" a handful of moderate Republicans who came out in support of Independence candidate Tom Horner instead of GOP nominee Tom Emmer.\But Sutton said there's no correlation between those events and his letter.\In recent weeks, he said, he's been to a number of party activities. In each case, he said, he's repeated the theme of the letter he sent to legislators.\""At every single event, I've said, 'Stand behind your legislator. They need to know you're behind them.' My role is to encourage. They do need to know they're supported because the pressure is going to grow. What's happening in Wisconsin is going to be happening here. There will be people in the Capitol shouting that taxes need to be raised. There are going to be lobbyists, thick as thieves, with their hands out. There's going to be tremendous pressure.""\House Speaker Kurt Zellers does not think Sutton's letter was out of line, or that the party chairman was making implied threats.\""In full disclosure, I endorsed him [for party chair two years ago],'' Zellers said. ""I consider him a friend. I don't think what he did was anything out of the ordinary for any party chair. I don't think there's been a [Republican] party chair who hasn't said, 'Don't let them go raising taxes.' But I don't think there's been a DFL chair who hasn't said, 'Don't let them cut the budget.' ""\Sutton only rarely appears at the Capitol, Zellers said.\""The times I see him are on the weekends at party events,'' Zellers said. ""I appreciate him reaffirming the party's planks. But we [Republican legislators] don't have the party platform sewed into our suit coats.""\(It should be noted, however, that the GOP's deputy chairman, Michael Brodkorb, is a constant Capitol presence. In his full-time job, he works, in communications, for the Republican Senate caucus and attends most briefings by Republican Senate leaders.)\DFL GOP chairmen differ in approach\Ken Martin, the DFL's new party chairman, does believe there is a line separating party business and the work at the Capitol.\""It's not up to the chair of the party to control what happens at the Legislature,'' Martin said. ""The chairs of the parties aren't elected by the people. They're elected by people in the party. Our job is to help people get elected. When we're involved in telling them how to vote, we've gone too far.""\But Martin wouldn't say that Sutton's letter crossed a line.\""I like him as a person,"" Martin said of Sutton. ""He just views his role much differently than how I view my role. He tends to hold his candidates to the party line. I view my job as helping serving their interests, helping them get elected. Neither has to be wrong.""\Laughing, Martin said that nobody should be surprised about Sutton's letter.\""It shouldn't surprise anyone,"" said Martin. ""He booted people out of his party. I think I have a different view. It's my job to advocate and be fiercely loyal to our values, but it's not our job to kick people out of the party.""\That doesn't mean DFL legislators haven't fallen out of favor with party activists. But when that happens, Martin said, it usually happens at the local level.\""A grass-roots process,"" he said.\It does often seem that the DFL has a bigger tent than this generation of Republicans. The DFL does seem to offer individual legislators more flexibility. And, of course, Dayton already is talking about budget compromise.\There are a handful of Republican moderates in the Legislature who refuse to call themselves ""moderate'' for fear of alienating activists back home.\DFL legislators seem to be a little freer to ramble toward at least the middle of the spectrum. There are, for example, a handful of pro-life DFL legislators, and there certainly are DFLers more fiscally conservative than Dayton.\(Aside here: It will be interesting to see, when crunch time comes on big budget issues, whether the DFL minority will vote lockstep in support of Dayton as the Republican minority did -- with the one gas-tax exception -- in support of Pawlenty.)\""We have some [rural] legislators who couldn't possibly win endorsement in the metro area,"" said Martin. "" ... We are fiercely loyal to our values, but we're respectful of disagreements. It's not our job to hold their feet to the fire.""\Not surprisingly, Sutton completely disagrees with the notion that the DFL offers a bigger tent than Republicans.\""In reality,"" he said, ""the Democrats are far more rigid. They don't look at fiscal reality. Raise more taxes, raise more revenue. Anything beyond that is outside their comfort zone.""\Sutton does say he's heard from his spouse that he's been taking another beating from liberal bloggers about his letter.\He doesn't read the blogs himself, he said. But he can't get his wife to stop. Apparently, he said, the newest controversy has led to bloggers harping on two old themes.\""I've discovered, because of the bloggers, that I've got a weight problem, and the second thing is I'm a puppet master, running the entire operation.""\He admits to the former but scoffs at the latter.\Doug Grow writes about public affairs, state politics and other topics.

263,"Timothy J. Walz, a Democrat from Mankato, will be the 41st governor of Minnesota after defeating Republican Jeff Johnson in Tuesday's election.\""Hello, one Minnesota!"" Walz, a congressman from southern Minnesota who served 24 years in the National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and coach, proclaimed in his victory speech. ""Our democracy is strong tonight.""\The victory by Walz, 54, gives Democrats four more years in the governor's office following two terms by Gov. Mark Dayton. With Democrats also winning a majority in the state House in Tuesday's election, the party is poised to expand its power at the State Capitol. Walz, who ran as a uniter, will also have to contend with Republicans, who maintained their one-vote state Senate majority by winning a special election.\Johnson, a Hennepin County commissioner, was making his second run for the governor's job after losing to Dayton four years ago. In his concession speech, he matched the civil tone of his campaign.\""I gave Tim Walz a call a few minutes ago to congratulate him for his victory and I told him, and I meant it, that I don't just wish him luck, but I wish him success,"" Johnson said. ""Because I want to retire in this state, and I want to raise grandchildren in this state.""\Walz's victory also made state history, as he noted in his victory speech.\""Since 1789, no indigenous woman in this nation's history had ever been elected into the executive office -- until tonight,"" Walz said, in reference to his running mate, Lt. Gov.-elect Peggy Flanagan. She is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe.\Voters interviewed Tuesday by the Star Tribune said they connected with Walz's life story, which includes 24 years in the National Guard and more than 20 years teaching and coaching high school before he was elected to Congress in 2006.\Mary Knapp, an independent voter from Golden Valley, said she voted for both Democrats and Republicans but went for Walz in the governor's race. Knapp, 61, called him ""more grounded and I think really concerned about the best interests of everyone instead of being particularly partisan.""\Walz campaigned for the job for more than a year and a half, working to win over more liberal Democratic voters while keeping his appeal with more moderate, greater Minnesota party members who have made up his political base as a congressman.\The two candidates spent the campaign laying out vastly different visions for Minnesota's future.\While Johnson vowed to cut taxes and loosen regulations on business, Walz advocated more spending on education, transportation, aid to local governments and other programs. Walz, whose congressional district is more rural and conservative than the state as a whole, pledged to bring together disparate groups to make progress after years of gridlock in St. Paul.\The stakes of the campaign were big. Walz will be in office during the 2020 census and redistricting, when lawmakers and the governor will have to decide on new legislative and congressional districts that will reshape Minnesota politics and government for the coming decade.\The campaign hewed to standards of ""Minnesota nice"" but also featured sharp attacks on health care. Johnson attacked Walz for saying Minnesota and the United States should move to a single payer health care system like Medicare, charging that Walz's plan would lead to fewer choices, long wait times and worse health care.\But the Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a Democratic-aligned group, spent more than $4 million attacking Johnson with TV ads that argued Johnson's health care agenda would mean vulnerable Minnesotans would lose coverage. He called the ads inaccurate and unfair.\James Schmidt, 19, who was voting in Chanhassen, said he tuned in closely to the race for governor; he voted for Johnson. He liked what Johnson had to say about immigration.\""I do like that rhetoric,"" Schmidt said, saying he'd like tougher laws. ""I think stronger immigration laws get me a little more hyped up to vote.""\But Walz's message of unity carried the day. Walz led the entire way in all the public polling, and raised far more campaign cash than Johnson.\Daniel Fehrenkamp, 39, owner of Iron Door Pub in Minneapolis, had voted as a Democrat since he was 18. He said he supported Walz because he believes he understands the diverse needs of rural and urban residents. Fehrenkamp lived in Rochester, which Walz represented in Congress.\""Walz is a veteran and teacher, and I have a lot of respect for that,"" he said.\Walz reiterated his campaign theme during his victory speech: ""We in Minnesota know we can bridge those gaps and create one Minnesota.""\He reached out to the business community that normally backs Republicans: ""If you run a business and you want to work together to reduce health care costs, build affordable housing and make a difference in your community, I will be there as your governor to make that happen,"" he said.\Sen. Richard Cohen, D-St. Paul, said Walz would bring fresh energy to a State Capitol that in recent years has been beset with partisan rancor. Last year, the Legislature sued Gov. Mark Dayton when he vetoed money for their salaries.\""A Gov. Walz will be someone totally new to the Capitol, and there'll be high interest in him, and his personality will be well-suited,"" Cohen said.\Walz is known for his gregarious personality, an easy fit for the backslapping environs of the military, practice field and political campaign.\But Walz still faces a challenging environment. Republicans drove a hard bargain with Dayton and stymied some of the most significant policy proposals of his second term, like a gas tax increase, universal prekindergarten and expansion of a public health insurance program called MinnesotaCare.\Walz has also proposed those policies, and it's not clear if Republicans would be any more willing to bend to Walz than they were with Dayton.\Walz did craft a few deals with Republicans in Congress, but on two relatively uncontroversial issues: care of veterans and agriculture. As governor, Walz steps into a very different role than a member of Congress.\Walz will take over a government with more than 30,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $22 billion.\And he will face immediate challenges.\The state tax system has grown wildly divergent from the federal tax code, creating a confusing situation for families and businesses next year. Cleaning up the mess will be a first order of business.\Lawmakers were forced to subsidize the individual health insurance market last year with more than $540 million, just to stabilize it. There's no ongoing funding for the program. And a significant source of funding for health care initiatives through a tax on medical providers is scheduled to expire at the end of 2019.\State government's technology systems have repeatedly failed in recent years, affecting the state's driver's license and registration systems, for instance.\Multiple governors have tried and failed to confront the long-standing problem of children of color not performing as well in schools as white children, leaving many unprepared for college or the workforce.\But Walz will take the helm with resources to tackle some these problems, as the state budget outlook is currently bullish and has been in surplus for several years running.\""We know there are challenges ahead,"" Walz acknowledged. ""But Minnesota has always risen to the occasion.""\J. Patrick Coolican • 651-925-5042\Results by county\(See the page PDF or microfilm for the complete chart.)\CREDIT:J.

264," The spring of discontent\ Ah, May: blossoms, baseball, budget cut announcements. There's nothing quite like the disenchantment of one's first spring as a Minneapolis Public Schools parent. I imagine it feels much like the disillusionment of new public school parents across the state, if maybe a bit harsher.\ What does my kindergartner love about his close-knit, scrappy, underfunded community school? His energetic, caring and (we think) brilliant teacher, the mention of whom makes his eyes light up - next year, gone. The beloved assistant principal who knows every single student by name - next year, gone. Art class, where he makes ""cool and beautiful things,"" where kids who struggle elsewhere are able to settle in, engage and proudly create - next year, gone.\ At least he's not aware of all this yet. It'll be autumn before his next lesson in the political realities of Gov. Tim Pawlenty's Minnesota, where every season is open season on kids.\ Susan Maas, Minneapolis.\ .\ A number, please\ It's like a never-ending drum: We're not spending enough on education.\ Please don't get me wrong: Education spending and the benefits of that spending are vitally important to the long-term health of our state. But how much is enough? That's all I ask. And that seems to be all that Judy Schaubach (""The real job killer is lack of education funds,"" May 12) and her cronies can't seem to answer. They never have a number, they just whine that what they have isn't enough.\ My numbers may be off, but they're close. We spend roughly $10,000 per student on education in this state. With an average class size of 30 students, that's $300,000 in funding per classroom. We pay our teachers roughly $40,000 per year (not enough for some teachers, too much for others). Schaubach shouldn't get another dime until she tells us what we're getting for the $260,000 we're already giving her.\ Steve O'Neil, Minneapolis.\ .\ Counselors as educators\ Steve Brandt's May 9 article only told part of the story about the school counselor shortage. In previous rounds of budget trimming, the Minneapolis School District cut all of its elementary counselors.\ Unlike their high school and middle school counterparts, elementary counselors focus mainly on preventive strategies for children. Issues addressed include bullying, racism, abuse, drugs/ alcohol and personal safety. Anger management, conflict resolution and stress reduction skills are also developed.\ Equipping children with these ""life skills"" in the lower grades helps manage or avoid troubles later, thus reducing the burden on high school counselors and staff.\ Zachary Lies, Morris, Minn.\ .\ Always in session\ I have had the privilege of home-schooling all of my children since they became of school age. The next time someone asks me why in the world I home-school, I will show that person a copy of the recent news story about more than 2,300 students in Waconia missing three days of school because of bomb threats, hit lists and suspicious devices, and ask: ""Any other questions?""\ Elaine Sycks, Detroit Lakes, Minn.\ .\ Oh, bother\ I wonder if our legislators, who this session increased ethanol in our gasoline to 20 percent, did any research.\ The Honda engine for my just-purchased pressure washer states, ""You may use gasoline containing up to 10 percent ethanol.""\ Will I have to purchase gasoline in Wisconsin?\ George Haertel, Bloomington.\ .\ Stadium considerations\ I love the Twins and Vikings, but think the legislators have an extremely poor idea of our long-term priorities. Losing either or both teams would not impose the financial impact that our shortsighted Legislature regularly imposes on our education system and natural resources.\ Any Legislature that votes for a stadium in under a month and underfunds education and the environment for decades should be voted out at the next opportunity.\ Bill Tschohl, St. Paul.\ .\ If people in Hennepin County pay for the stadium, maybe the rest of the counties should pay for the roof that will be needed to make sure the games will be played. When that is paid for, maybe the money should be kept in a fund to build and maintain the roads so we can get to the games.\ Lois Lovehaug, Milan, Minn.\ .\ Embrace the rascals\ If the PR elite (and they need to be with this team) at Vikings headquarters are looking for a clever gimmick for Opening Day, I suggest purple and gold Whizzinators for the first 50,000 fans. The kids will love it.\ Christian Johnson, Edina.\ .\ Grieving together\ I would like to thank the many citizens of St. Paul's East Side, Maplewood, North St. Paul and the metro area who stood on the sidewalks Wednesday along the funeral route as we drove by on our way to bury our friend and colleague, Sgt. Gerry Vick.\ Some of you waved flags or banners. Some of you saluted. Your support meant a great deal to all of us, as it did back in 1994 when we had the unhappy task of laying to rest Officers Ron Ryan Jr. and Tim Jones.\ Before that time, grieving an officer's life fell primarily to the officer's family and the law enforcement community. The community at large did not play a part in the process. But in 1994 and continuing Wednesday that changed. This Police Department has come to appreciate that when we hurt, the community hurts, too.\ While this has been a difficult loss, the visible demonstration that these communities care has indeed cushioned a painful blow. For that, I and the men and women of the St. Paul Police Department are grateful.\ Beverly Hall, St. Paul.\ .\ Dime'll make no difference\ A 10 cent gas tax is not going to solve the transportation problem, nor will a 40 cent tax hike. I pay 28 percent of my total income to federal taxes, 7.65 percent to Social Security and Medicare, 7 percent to the state, 6.5 percent on each item I purchase and property taxes and fees in the thousands. All this has not been enough to satisfy the government; will a dime a gallon really make a difference?\ Accountability is the answer. I applaud Tim Pawlenty for sticking to his pledge; it was the reason Minnesotans put him into the governor's office.\ M. Kumar, Chanhassen.\ .\ Maturing opinion\ I was, at first, dismayed to see the Star Tribune's May 10 poll showing a majority of Minnesotans opposed to gay unions. However, closer scrutiny revealed an encouraging trend: a fairly direct correlation of the respondents' age and education level to their acceptance of gay unions.\ The polling data would suggest that as the younger, more tolerant generations mature and are replaced by even more objective and better educated citizens, acceptance of gay unions is inevitable. It is already happening in many other developed Western nations. All the more reason not to rush to amend our state's Constitution to deny basic rights to many of our fellow citizens based on their sexual orientation.\ John Baer, Stillwater."
265,"HILLARY CLINTON I was pleased to see that Hillary Clinton acknowledges that her e-mails from her time as secretary of state belong to the State Department (""Clinton urges State Dept. to speed release of e-mails,"" May 20). It would have been more timely, however, if she'd had this belief from the start of her tenure. When exactly, Madam Secretary, would you have turned over those documents had they not been requested from the State Department? Are we to believe that hard-copy e-mails turned over to the department will contain documents that have not been carefully scrubbed and sorted? Why, Madam Secretary, did you not provide an electronic record of all your e-mails, and why have you not requested a forensic examination of your server by an independent third party?We can only hope that the American media does its job and demands answers to these questions and others about Clinton's time as secretary of state. Maybe they can ask her the ""if you knew then what you know now"" type of questions about Russia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Iran and Iraq among others. Then, and only then, will Clinton have made herself transparent enough for the American voter to make an informed decision.Gary Dreyer, BloomingtonHEALTH CAREOne wonders if our leaders care whether programs are supportiveThe May 19 article ""New task force takes up potential MNsure changes"" misses a key point. According to University of Minnesota pundit Larry Jacobs, the task force will analyze how to change public programs like MinnesotaCare to make MNsure sustainable. But it's not the job of Minnesota health care consumers, especially lower-income MinnesotaCare enrollees making $8 to $12 an hour, to make the ""private individual market viable."" The market should be looking for, and catering to, the needs of health care consumers. And this means prices these consumers can afford and quality plans that provide them with the health care they need, when they need it.Dolores Dunlop Voorhees, Cedar- - - I come to this MNsure/MinnesotaCare issue from an interesting perspective, having been a part of both. For years, I was lucky enough to qualify for MinnesotaCare. I am one of the self-employed, disappearing middle class. MinnesotaCare was great coverage and affordable. When MNsure was ""enacted,"" I suffered through the glitchy (for lack of a better term) sign-up. It took months to get coverage. My premium via MNsure, Minnesota's answer to the Affordable Care Act, was almost five times more than I was paying on MinnesotaCare, and the coverage wasn't as comprehensive.According to MNsure, I made too much money to stay on MinnesotaCare. After being on MNsure for a year, I was told I qualified for MinnesotaCare and could change policies again. I am now back to ""actual,"" affordable health care.How is it possible in a state with a $1.87 billion surplus that losing MinnesotaCare is even a possibility? What is it about those of us who work hard to keep a roof over our heads and pay our bills that makes us so invisible, or worse yet, not even considered worthy to keep an important resource?R.L. Brown, Minneapolis- - - The new health care task force is meant to evaluate the future of our collection of health programs, when research and experience already show that the best overall solution is a unified health care program covering everyone in the state. Such a program provides care to everyone, regardless of economic status, and controls costs. Second, Republican leaders wish to bypass MNsure with subsidies that are essentially vouchers, guaranteeing prosperity for the HMOs but poverty for the rest of us. Third, too many pundits, like Jacobs, voice concern about ""making the private individual market viable"" rather than providing medical attention to all who need it. Finally, legislative leaders want to bolster MinnesotaCare by reducing its budget and demanding that its low-income participants pay more. That is backward. We should bolster our low-income residents by demanding increased funding for MinnesotaCare. Isn't providing affordable health care to low-income Minnesotans just what that program is supposed to do?Joel Clemmer, St. PaulTRANSPORTATIONDayton's wholesale tax would be an unnecessary complicationSteve Sack's cartoon in the May 20 paper was only partly correct. The correction should be that the cracked and pothole-filled road should be leading up to a shiny, new, multimillion-dollar roundabout, complete with sidewalks to no place.In the case of the gas tax, the Legislature was correct in not passing Gov. Mark Dayton's new sales tax on fuel at the wholesale supplier. Why does a new government entity need to be created when an excellent fuel tax system is in place? The fuel tax system at the pump has been in place for more than 80 years and serves us very well. The more miles you drive, the heavier load you haul, the more tax you pay. The Legislature should have increased the tax per gallon at the pump to pay for road and bridge repair and improvements.Bruce Granger, West Concord, Minn.THE ENVIRONMENTAbolishing MPCA citizens board is one big mistake among severalThe 2015 Legislature has delivered a series of blows to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The worst of many setbacks to Minnesota pollution control is the demise of the citizens policymaking board, created in 1967 by the brilliant Little Falls Sen.

House File 846 contains a number of disturbing provisions -- many dubiously added outside of committee review -- that strip enforcement of our water-quality rules, including a rollback of wild-rice protection and exempting sulfide mining from solid-waste rules. Other astounding provisions include gutting the MPCA's citizen advisory board (these are the folks that ultimately protected Preston's citizens from a tire-burning plant) and raiding dedicated funds to clean up dumps and landfills that contaminate ground and drinking-water sources.H.F. 846 also provides polluter amnesty; as a former hazardous waste inspector who saw polluters pour toxic chemicals into pits and onto the ground, I can tell you these folks would never ""self-report"" their contamination of the land and water.Last -- and ironically, as the federal government is stepping up to protect pollinators with pesticide review and increasing habitat (""Feds throw bees a lifeline,"" May 19) -- the Legislature has voted to allow deceptive labeling on plants that can kill pollinators on contact.What a crushing disappointment from our government and our news sources. Our last hope is a veto from Gov. Mark Dayton. Will he deliver the legacy Minnesotans deserve?Catherine Zimmer, St. Paul"
266,"Fees increase, but fewer cross country trails require permits hatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter \By Eric Atherton \TIMES OUTDOORS EDITOR \Should snow ever fall in Central Minnesota, you might want to be aware of some rule changes concerning the Great Minnesota Ski Pass, changes that should reduce confusion and increase convenience for users of state-funded ski trails. \Since 1983, cross country skiers who use ski trails in state or county parks that receive state funds have been required to purchase a ski pass. \Ed Bouffard, past president of the Nordic Ski Club of Central Minnesota, said requiring the pass was a way to improve skiing conditions and increase options for cross country skiers. \""There's a similar program for users of snowmobile trails,"" Bouffard said. ""Their money comes from the gas tax, but in the case of skiing, there was no income source. This was a way to tax the people who use the trails, to create a way for local ski clubs to apply for funding to help pay for the grooming of trails."" \Confused skiers \The problem, however, was that the old law created more than a little confusion and inconvenience for skiers. \""The old law said that any park that received any aid at all from the state had to require this pass, even if it didn't receive any money for grooming their trails,"" Bouffard said. ""And, there were some local governments that decided to ignore the law. Some places required the pass, and some places didn't."" \That kind of confusion sometimes proved costly to skiers. \""I've had friends who were ticketed at county parks,"" Bouffard said. Skiing without the pass is a petty misdemeanor. ""It's a pretty hefty fine."" \The 1999 legislative session, however, took steps to make things better. Now, only parks that receive state funds specifically for grooming of ski trails can require the ski pass. This dropped the number of trails that require the pass from around 220 to 170. \Roxanne Gerads, technical assistant with the Stearns County parks department, said that this change will have an immediate effect on St. Cloud area skiers. \""In the past, skiers needed the passes out here at Quarry Park,"" Gerads said. ""Now, only trails that get state grants can require them. Of trails in the St. Cloud area, only the Wildwood Trail in St. Joseph will require the ski pass this year."" \Hunting for a ski pass \Cross country ski enthusiasts, however, know that confusion about where the pass was required wasn't the only problem with the old ski pass system. \In fact, simply finding a place to buy one was often an exercise in frustration. \""The system for issuing the passes has never been very user-friendly,"" Bouffard said. ""People want to be able to buy the pass where they ski, when they ski."" \For the past 16 years, however, and even now, unless you're skiing at a state park with a staffed entrance, you can't do that. \Instead, you have to find a ski pass vendor, and good information about where to go hasn't always been easy to come by. \""Horror stories of well-intentioned individuals being referred from one place to another across town for hours are all too common,"" Bouffard said. \So, where do you go? If you decide to take a spur-of-the-moment ski trip to an area that isn't a state park but requires the pass, be forewarned: you can't buy a pass over-the-counter anywhere in Benton County. \Things are a bit better in Sherburne County, where you can go to the county auditor's office. In Stearns County, you can purchase one at the Stearns County Game and Fish office, where they will allow you to purchase permits for yourself and others. In other words, you need not appear in person to purchase your pass. \Fortunately, as of March 1, 2000, things will be much easier. Ski passes will be sold electronically at any site that sells hunting and fishing licenses. \Until that time, however, you may want to plan ahead. You can charge your pass to a credit card by calling 1-888-MINNDNR during regular business hours, and the pass will arrive by mail in 7-10 business days. \Or, if you waited until the last minute and needed your pass an hour ago, call 1-888-MNLICENSE. For an additional fee of $$@$!3.50, you can purchase your permit with a credit card, and you will be issued an I.D. number that will allow you to hit the trails immediately. \Price hike \The above changes should make the cross country season a bit more enjoyable and convenient, but there is one bit of bad news concerning the ski pass: the price has gone up almost 50 percent. \A one-year pass, required of anyone 16 or older, now costs @$!5.50. A single-day pass costs $$@$!3. \But, Bouffard said, skiers need to keep the cost in perspective. \""The system hadn't been changed since 1983, so the price was too low,"" he said. ""In the last 10 years, no new trails have been able to get funding. When the county put theQuarry Park trail in, they couldn't apply for funding to groom it, because there were no funds available."" \The price hike, Bouffard said, should make for better skiing in the long run. \""The new law should create more money for the system, and create funding to make more grooming possible,"" he said. \Paul Nordell, of the DNR Trails and Waterways Division, went a bit further in his support of the ski pass price hike. \""People can use the ski pass on about 170 cross country ski trails, totaling about 1,700 miles of opportunity,"" Nordell said. That, according to Nordell, makes the ski pass Minnesota's ""greatest winter bargain."" \Unfortunately, it's a bargain that doesn't offer much satisfaction when there's no snow on the ground. \TIMES FILE PHOTOS \Cross country skiers enjoyed the trails at Quarry Park in Dec. 1998. Under legislation passed in 1999, users of the trails in Quarry Park will no longer need to purchase a ski pass. \Kay Vander Stoep (left) and Pam Otto make a snowman next to the trail in Mississippi River County Park in March 1997. This park and most St. Cloud area ski trails no longer require a ski permit. \Buying your ski pass \A cross country ski pass is required of any skier 16 or older skiing state-maintained trails. \Cost: \@$!10 for one season, and $$@$!25 for three years. \Vendors: \You can buy your ski pass at the Stearns County Game and Fish Office (656-3927). Or, to order your pass with a credit card, call 1-888-MINNDNR. \For an additional $$@$!3.50 fee, you may order your pass by calling 1-888-MNLICENSE. You will receive an I.D. number that will let you hit the trails immediately. Sports; Skiing; Government; State Government; Environment; Land Use; Park Midwest\RECREATION; Pg. 5C"
267," In his fourth and final State of the State speech before he stands for reelection, Gov. Tim Pawlenty described Minnesota in 2006 as ""strong, hopeful and prosperous"" and still near the top in quality-of-life rankings.\ The address in the packed House chamber on Thursday blended several key themes that Pawlenty has developed in recent months.\ He itemized 16 major accomplishments - including solving the state's budget deficits - and ticked off six top state rankings in health, education and the economy.\ ""Our people are working. Our students are learning. And our citizens are healthy,"" he said.\ He also outlined 29 proposals in education, health care, the environment and jobs creation that he would like passed.\ Using the soaring rhetoric that governors perennially bring to the speech, the Republican governor coined the phrase ""lighthouse state"" for Minnesota, using the imagery of Split Rock Lighthouse on Lake Superior. He cited historic ways in which Minnesota had served the nation, saying, ""We are a beacon of hope, optimism and the innovative spirit to get things done.""\ ""I want this historic building to be a lighthouse again,"" he said of the 101-year-old State Capitol.\ In response, DFLers and allied groups focused on themes of taxes and program cuts.\ Despite claims to having balanced the huge deficits with no state taxes, opponents said, Pawlenty actually raised property taxes and fees and seriously damaged middle- and lower-income groups with his program cuts. And the rest of his initiatives amount to creative but trivial window-dressing.\ The Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a coalition of labor unions and liberal groups, contended that Pawlenty had forced local property taxes to rise an average of 32 percent over three years and that he had raised fees by almost $900 million.\ The group also accused him of leaving 77,000 more citizens without health insurance, cutting programs for schools and the elderly, and causing steep hikes in tuition.\ Pawlenty's only reference to the bitter budget fights and deadlocked sessions over the past three years was this: ""While it hasn't always been pretty, we've accomplished a great deal together.""\ Among his top claims to accomplishments were what he called the ""biggest financial turnaround in Minnesota history,"" regaining Minnesota's status as an ""education innovator"" and instituting new state education standards.\ His top legislative priorities in each of four categories - almost all 29 of which had been promoted earlier - include initiatives for early childhood, classroom funding, and math and science standards; directing that providers more aggressively market health insurance plans for less than $200 a month; developing a long- term strategic plan for conservation, including a constitutional amendment to dedicate funds for natural resources, and imposing a cap on property taxes and overhauling the corporate tax ""so we don't punish job creation.""\ Pawlenty also repeated calls for docking the pay of legislators and the governor if they don't meet legislative adjournment deadlines; encouraging legal immigration and ""cracking down"" on illegal immigration and a constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriage.\ .\ A brief display\ The latter two of those again provoked accusations that Pawlenty's agenda was ""divisive"" and designed to build on resentments in the majority culture against racial minorities, gays and lesbians.\ When Pawlenty talked about revitalizing ""the traditional family structure,"" Rep. Karen Clark, DFL-Minneapolis, rose and briefly turned her back to the podium. She was joined by her desk mate, Rep. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park.\ Clark, who is openly lesbian, said the demonstration was unplanned. ""Some things you just can't sit down for,"" she said, adding that she thought the legislation was a form of ""bigotry.""\ Pawlenty's spokesman, Brian McClung, said Pawlenty had no comment on the display.\ .\ Response\ The top leaders of the DFL legislative caucuses, Senate Majority Leader Dean Johnson and House Minority Leader Matt Entenza, dismissed most of Pawlenty's proposals as inadequate and diversionary. They noted that he barely touched on higher education, one of the state's most important functions.\ Although Pawlenty was applauded about 60 times in the 40-minute speech, Entenza said he noticed that many Republican legislators stayed seated or did not applaud his calls for school vouchers and the marriage amendment.\ In general, Republicans roundly cheered the speech. State party chairman Ron Carey said that it showed Pawlenty had ""the right ideas to strengthen our state"" and that DFLers should ""cease their shrill partisan attacks.""\ Charles Kyte, executive director of the Minnesota Association of School Administrators, said he found a lot to like in the education proposals. Raising requirements for algebra, chemistry and digital literacy are ""very good,"" he said. Pawlenty's education record ""has been checkered,"" Kyte said, but he said the current set of proposals has ""a reasonable chance"" of passing.\ Wayne Cox, executive director of Minnesota Citizens for Tax Justice, a group financed by labor unions, said listeners heard ""a very likable Timmy the Dreamer today. Unfortunately, we get his evil twin Trimmy at budget time.""\ .\ Dane Smith - 651-292-0164 Dan Wascoe contributed to this report.\ .\ PAWLENTY'S PROPOSALS\ In his address, the governor outlined several proposals in each of four areas, including these top items:\ Education: 70 percent of school funding to go to classrooms; upgrade algebra, chemistry standards; add Chinese language; early- childhood initiative.\ Natural resources: Constitutional amendment dedicating funds to conservation and clean water.\ Health care: Direct HMOs and health insurance companies to more aggressively market basic health insurance that costs less than $200 per month.\ Job growth: Cap property taxes and overhaul the corporate tax to spur job creation.\ .\ PAWLENTY IS PROUD OF ...\ In his address, the governor listed what he considered his major accomplishments in his first three years. Opponents countered that there's another side to these issues. Here's a look:\ - The state's financial turnaround: From a $4.5 billion shortfall in 2004-05 to a $1 billion surplus in 2006-07.\ Opponents say: Property taxes have climbed while budget cuts hurt the disadvantaged and the state's quality of life.\ - Education reform: New standards have replaced the Profile of Learning; performance pay for teachers has been instituted.\ Opponents say: State has broken promise to relieve local taxpayers of school funding burden; budgets have been strained.\ - Transportation: ""Largest transportation funding package in modern history"" implemented.\ Opponents say: Pawlenty's borrowing plan is the wrong way to fund roads and transit, while he has blocked the correct long-term solution: a gas tax increase.\ .\ REACTION FROM THE DFL CHALLENGERS\ Kelly Doran, real estate developer: ""It was full of rhetoric about initiating new government spending, by a governor who doesn't want to pay for it and who won't tell us what to cut. This mindset of doing more with less has reached a breaking point, especially when you've got 32 kids in the classrooms and tuition shooting up.""\ Attorney General Mike Hatch: ""He [Pawlenty] does very well articulating problems, but he avoids any meaningful attempt to address them ... His forte has been to offer up task forces and then not follow up on their recommendations, to acknowledge problems with teacher ratios and transportation systems but to offer no real solution.""\ Sen. Steve Kelley: ""Good vision, but none of the measures he talked about will ever get us there. ... The education initiatives are half-measures, accounting gimmicks. ... He talked about Minnesota as a 'lighthouse state,' but his puny solutions will make us the 'night-light state.'-""\ Sen. Becky Lourey: The damage done to our schools and accessible health care cannot be repaired by [Pawlenty's] empty proposals. ... His agenda of division and fear [on same-sex marriage and immigration] remains a destructive focus that threatens Minnesota's cultural diversity, economic vibrancy and quality of life.""\ .\ THE FULL SPEECH\ The text and other documents relating to the State of the State speech can be found at www.governor.state.mn.us.\ ."
268,"In the end, the 2017 Minnesota legislative session went out with a whimper and a handshake.\After a weekend full of closed-door negotiations with little progress to report on the state’s two-year, $46 billion budget, DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and Republican leaders of the Minnesota Legislature reached across the negotiating table shortly before a midnight deadline to adjourn the session and shook hands, setting in motion a plan that wouldn’t finish their work on time — but that did result in a tentative agreement.\Under the terms of the deal, Dayton called lawmakers back for a special session starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, one minute after they adjourned the regular session, and legislators will now have until 7 a.m. on Wednesday to finalize the state budget. That includes passing billions of dollars of spending on everything from education and health and human services to a package of tax cuts and construction projects.\The details of that agreement were still unclear — and negotiations ongoing — as lawmakers streamed out of the Capitol in the early morning hours of Tuesday, with plans to return in a few hours and work nonstop until the budget is passed.\Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt acknowledged that the agreement could still “potentially” unravel, but he didn’t expect that to happen. “It really represents true compromise,” he said. “We are getting some things we wanted, I know the governor is getting things he wanted. I think we’re happy with that.”\“Obviously we have very real differences so there’s been a lot of give and take,” Dayton said. “We’ve got the framework, and we’ve got some details to work out in several bills.”\ What’s next? \There’s precedent for such an agreement. As recently as 2010, Gov. Tim Pawlenty called legislators back immediately after the session adjourned to finish work on a budget bill.\But there are still plenty of unanswered questions this year. By the time regular session adjourned, lawmakers had sent Dayton five budget bills to fund jobs programs, environment provisions, higher education, agriculture, public safety and the courts. But more than 70 percent of the state’s budget is tied up in budget bills that still need to be passed: E-12 education, health and human services and state government spending.\As part of the tentative deal, lawmakers will spend $477 million more on education over the next two years, including $50 million more for a pre-kindergarten education program that is a priority for Dayton. The deal also includes a $300 million proposal for transportation over the next two years that doesn’t raise the gas tax or license tab fees. The fate of previously controversial provisions related to the governance of the Metropolitan Council and transit funding was still unclear Monday.\Top leaders also had few details to share about agreements around the state’s health and human services budget, the most complex part of the deal, and state government funding.\Two proposals that are not technically part of the state’s two-year budget — tax cuts and a bonding bill — were also part of the tentative deal. Lawmakers plan to work out the details of a $660 million tax cut bill and a $990 million bonding bill on Tuesday and Wednesday.\Negotiations also came down to the wire on a proposal to pre-empt local governments from setting their own wage and labor standards. Republicans said they still planned to send Dayton the proposal as a standalone bill, but Dayton said he wouldn’t sign it. “I appreciate that they’re sending it to me separate from budget bills,” Dayton said. “But I’ve made it clear that I will veto a bill that has pre-emption.”\The logistical challenges in getting everything passed by Wednesday morning also remain. Several of the bills, like health and human services, are so large that they take hours to simply process the paperwork. \ All quiet on the last day of session \For much of Monday, it seemed like there wouldn’t be an agreement by the end of the night. The state Capitol was eerily quiet, despite the looming midnight deadline. Top leaders weren’t visible all day, and rank-and-file legislators shuffled in and out of floor sessions in the morning and early evening, debating smaller pieces of the state budget.\The jobs and economic development budget had moved out of committees after 1 a.m. and made it to the House and Senate floor for early Monday morning floor votes. Democrats protested a provision in the bill that bans local governments from banning plastic bag in grocery stores. The public safety budget bill, meanwhile, increased funding for the courts and removed a controversial provision that increased penalties for people who blocked freeways during protests.\But the bill still included language that would block drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants, earning plenty of criticism in floor debates. Current law doesn’t allow the state’s Department of Public Safety to issue driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants, but Republicans pushed for language that specifically barred the practice. Dayton said he ultimately agreed to that provision as part of a compromise deal.\“This not only shuts the door but it puts a padlock on it,” Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, said.\After those votes, legislators were in a holding pattern. The House and Senate took a break for dinner — a luxury not usually allowed to lawmakers on a looming deadline. Legislators enjoyed the Capitol loggia, a second-floor outdoor space that faced the Capitol’s front lawn that recently reopened to the public.\For one lawmaker, Carla Nelson, the final day of session was marked by grief. The three-term state senator from Rochester and chair of the E-12 education finance committee was negotiating the terms of the education budget when her father took ill. She returned home to be with him on several occasions, but returned back to St. Paul to continue work and take votes as needed. Senate Republicans have a one-vote, 34-33 majority in the chamber.\On Monday morning, she got the call that her father had passed away. “My father was very proud that I am a member of the Minnesota Legislature, and would want me to be here working for the people today,” Nelson said in a statement. “I’m so thankful for all of your prayers, support, and genuine expressions of love during this difficult time.”\ A quick start, slow finish \It’s a messy ending to a session that got off to a productive start. Even with divided government, Republicans and Dayton managed to strike several major budget deals early in the year, including relief for people who saw their healthcare premiums skyrocket last year.\Republicans also passed a $524 million reinsurance proposal in March, which aims to help health insurance companies cover some of the costliest claims. The proposal passed the House and Senate along mostly party-line votes, and Dayton let the bill go into law without his signature. That month, the Legislature also lifted the state’s 159-year old ban on Sunday liquor sales.\In the week before session ended, Republicans and Democrats also broke an impasse on the federal Real ID Act, which requires enhanced security standards for driver’s licenses. The proposal passed and was signed by Dayton after years-of-back and forth, avoiding a deadline in January 2018 that would have restricted air travel for many Minnesotans.\But despite the often-tense negotiations to finalize the budget, Republicans and the governor had kind words for each other.\Daudt thanked the governor’s staff, and Dayton said he felt they negotiated in good faith. Gazelka said he came into session with a “rap” about Dayton that included “nothing good.” “I’ve found him to be very straight forward, a man of his word, a very tough negotiator and I would say a friend.” Gazelka said as he gaveled out session. “I think we decided we were all in.”"
269,"After several years of skirmishing, a full-scale battle has broken out over the planned extension of the North Shore State Trail in the northeastern corner of Minnesota.\The fight includes a ""stop-the-trail"" lawsuit against a state agency and a similar appeal to the federal government. Both were filed by more than 30 dog sledders and others who own land near the proposed trail, which cuts through some of the most undeveloped land along the North Shore.\The critics contend that extending the trail by 33 miles through Cook County would attract more snowmobiles, more development and more intrusions on their solitude.\""This isn't so much an antisnowmobiling issue as it is antidevelopment,"" said Brian Fredericksen, one of the dog sledders, or mushers, who have sued. ""What we're really objecting to is the potential development of the Tip of the Arrowhead region.""\While not yet involved in the suit, snowmobilers consider themselves its target. They're the chief users of the North Shore Trail, although it also is traversed by mushers, hikers, horseback riders, mountain bikers and cross-country skiers.\""The quest of the Cook County people {who have sued} for total isolation is ludicrous in this day and age,"" said Jeff Mausolf, a Duluth snowmobiler who has long used the trail. ""It's a total not-in-my-back-yard mentality.""\The 20-year-old trail now stretches 146 miles, from Duluth to Grand Marais. The state Department of Natural Resources (DNR), plans to complete the trail by extending it to the Grand Portage Indian Reservation. From there, connecting trails would permit travel to the international border and beyond, linking up with a 500-mile system of snowmobile trails in Ontario.\The extended trail would be over grass-covered soil or gravel. It would require clearing a corridor, generally up to 20 feet wide, through what now is largely dense forest.\""If the extension is built, it will be the most environmentally sensitive, best-designed, best-managed trail in Minnesota,"" said Brian McCann, the DNR's project manager. ""We've done our homework {and} incorporated into our plan the concerns of a lot of people.""\The DNR has gone to great lengths to pave the way for its project. It has held more than 15 public meetings. It has studied several potential trail routes with the U.S. Forest Service before picking the route they both prefer. The DNR has modified that route to comply with the wishes of various groups.\Now it wants to begin work on the extension, which would cost about $350,000, but finds itself being sued and in a race against time.\In their suit, filed in Cook County District Court in Grand Marais, the mushers and other critics charge that the project would harm the environment. They want the court to block any work and to order the DNR to prepare an environmental-impact study.\If the court does, no work could begin until after the study is finished. The study could be completed rather quickly, McCann said, because the DNR already has gathered extensive data about the project's potential environmental, economic and social effects.\The DNR did prepare a less-exhaustive environmental assessment, but the critics say it fails to adequately address potential effects. They have the same complaint about an assessment by the Forest Service and are asking that agency for a more extensive study.\The DNR's race against time has evolved from a series of land transactions along the proposed route.\Almost 90 percent of the project would be on state or federal land, and the DNR has easements that allow it to extend the trail over 2 1/2 miles of private land. However, that land is owned by two of the people who are suing the DNR. Also, if the trail is not built by Dec. 19, the easements will expire.\If that happens, the DNR presumably would try to reach a settlement with those landowners or condemn a narrow strip of their property for the trail. Historically, the DNR has been reluctant to condemn land - it's not good public relations.\Fredericksen conceded that delaying work is part of the strategy being used by trail opponents. He lives in Delano, where he has a kennel with 22 sled dogs. He owns 200 acres of undeveloped land a few miles from the planned trail.\Fredericksen is part of a growing colony of mushers that owns land in Cook County. They have been using, without charge, 170 miles of sled-dog trails located on Forest Service land - a fact that rankles snowmobilers.\""Most of us don't use the North Shore Trail,"" Fredericksen said. ""We really don't need a trail; we can make our own with our dogs.""\Snowmobilers are touting an independent study that shows that their use of the North Shore Trail pumps more than $2.1 million into the regional economy each year. But the mushers also contribute. According to a study done for the DNR, the dog-sled industry generates $520,000 in annual gross revenues in Cook County alone, and that is expected to increase to more than $1.2 million by 2001.\Mausolf, president of the Duluth Association of Snowmobile Clubs, stressed that Minnesota's 218,000 snowmobilers provided the money for building and maintaining more than 12,500 miles of state-designated snowmobile trails, including the North Shore Trail. The money comes from the snowmobilers' license and gas-tax fees.\The DNR's Bruce Highland, who has managed the North Shore Trail since it was built, said it cost about $1.25 million to construct and that $125,000 is spent annually on maintenance. He said the DNR strongly believes that the extension is needed because of increasing use of the trail by snowmobilers and because snowmobiling has changed so much over the past two decades.\""We've gone from snowmobilers who were local, day-only riders who used fairly unreliable machines,"" Highland said. ""Now, snowmobiles are as reliable as a car or small truck, and snowmobilers don't hesitate to drive several thousand miles a week.\""What we're trying to complete are interconnected trail systems, just as our highways are interconnected. We're trying to complete the missing link along the North Shore,"" he said.\Mausolf said the Duluth snowmobile association might intervene in the suit in support of the DNR. A group of North Shore businesses and others who benefit from snowmobiling or support the trail extension may also intervene.\The mushers and other plaintiffs contend that the extension would cause environmental damage. For example, they say, clearing the corridor will require logging up to 110 acres of trees, harming songbirds that rely on large expanses of unfragmented forest for their habitat. They charge that the project could cause erosion along 10 state-designated trout streams and harm habitat critical to such protected species as the bald eagle and timber wolf.\Although conceding that the project will affect natural resources, the DNR disputes many of the plaintiff's claims and says that negative effects will largely be minor and temporary. It says that the trail would not come within 1,000 feet of any occupied dwelling and that snowmobiles aren't apt to cause serious noise problems for residents.\Still, the DNR emphasized that snowmobile-related noise is a potential area of concern and that it will deal with any complaints on a case-by-case basis. It contends that sled-dog and snowmobile trails can coexist without significant negative effects.\Fredericksen doesn't agree.\""The battle lines are drawn,"" he said. ""We have the prodevelopment, businessman type who would like to see snowmobile trails all over northern Minnesota - through the Boundary Waters, through Voyageurs National Park, through the Hovland area where I own property.\""Yet, there are many other users - cross-country skiers, mushers, snowshoers, nature lovers - who want to save some areas where we can enjoy our activities. We're trying to strike a balance."""
270,"Minnesota is beginning to confront what promises to be the biggest shift in urban living since cars arrived in cities a century ago: The moment drivers let go of the wheel for good.Self-driving cars are leaving the realm of science fiction and creeping into discussions about the future of transportation in the Twin Cities. Researchers say the technology could be required in new cars by 2030, leaving its mark on everything from parking ramps and road design to exurban sprawl and mobility for people with disabilities.""We know it's coming and it's coming at a pretty rapid pace,"" said Jay Hietpas, state traffic engineer at the Minnesota Department of Transportation. ""And we just want to make sure that we're ready.""The state will step into the spotlight later this year when MnDOT tests a self-driving bus on snowy Minnesota roads -- possibly even during Super Bowl festivities in February.MnDOT formed a group earlier this year to examine state laws about driverless vehicles. And planners are already speculating how cities will be reshaped when the technology arrives in earnest.Many people may choose to abandon car ownership for robust sharing services, summoning driverless vehicles at a moment's notice. Cars could travel closer together with less risk of accidents, boosting the capacity of highways. Commuters napping on their trip to the office may live farther away from work.""Cities are just starting to figure out that they need to pay attention to this,"" said Frank Douma, director of the State and Local Policy Program at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs.U researchers say fully autonomous vehicles that can operate without driver interaction may hit the market by 2025. But cars with self-driving features are already on Minnesota roads, such as Teslas equipped with autopilot systems that steer, brake and accelerate in freeway traffic.The transition may be rocky. Autopilot was blamed in a central Minnesota crash earlier this month that left a Tesla upside-down in a marsh, but it turned out the driver had disengaged the system by hitting the gas. Once automation is fully implemented, however, U researchers believe it could dramatically reduce car-related deaths.'Have to start thinking'The technology behind driverless cars is still evolving, but the latest vehicles navigate using 3-D maps to pinpoint their location within centimeters. Sensors look out for pedestrians and other vehicles, allowing the car to react in real time.Driverless cars were being tested in nine U.S. cities last year, according to a report from consultant Accenture. But city planners and engineers here are starting to take notice and consider changes.If people choose to forgo car ownership, there could be less demand for parking in urban areas since the driverless cars would spend more time in use and park closer together in faraway spaces, according to a U report prepared for MnDOT.In Bloomington, Port Authority Administrator Schane Rudlang said city staff are mulling a recommendation that future parking garages built with city funds be designed for reuse later, perhaps as an apartment or office building, with flat floors and greater load capacities. Planners in Minneapolis and Hopkins said they are also weighing the technology's effects.""I think it's important that local governments start having that conversation,"" said Jason Lindahl, Hopkins city planner. ""Because as a planner we're hearing more and more about them.""University of Minnesota Design Center Director Tom Fisher has been prodding mayors and city officials to plan ahead. They could one day reclaim roadway for sidewalks and green space, for example, since self-driving cars need less room to maneuver. The last thing cities should do is add lanes to existing roads, he said.""We're putting in roads right now that are going to last 50 years,"" Fisher said. ""So everything we're doing right now is going to go through this transition.""Advocates for people with disabilities are also tracking the technology, hoping it can reduce mobility barriers for people unable to drive. Minnesota nonprofit Mobility 4 All was founded for that purpose, and has been pressing its case with manufacturers.""This technology could be transformative for people with disabilities,"" said John Doan, the organization's founder. ""We want to make sure that developers design the physical as well as the software of the vehicles so that it is universally accessible.""More cars, longer tripsSelf-driving cars could also influence development patterns around the metro area, changing demands on freeways and transit.Urban areas might grow more dense if parking needs drop, but the U report said autonomous vehicles could also encourage commutes to far-flung locales because people could do other things en route. In turn, governments might have to turn to pricing policies -- replacing a gas tax with a per-mile tax, for example -- to rein in sprawl, according to an analysis released by the University of California, Davis.The technology has also prompted debate over spending money on expensive transit, like the Southwest light rail line.""We're sitting here fighting about a train -- a billion-dollar train that it tells you when you have to be there and where to go,"" said state Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington, who owns a Tesla. ""Pretty soon here you're going to have cars that can just pick you up wherever you are and take you to wherever you want to be.""But others like David Levinson, the lead author of the U report, said large cities will still need high-capacity transit to serve busy urban areas.""Cars, even driverless cars, can't move as many people per hour past a point as trains can,"" Levinson said.The impact on freeway congestion is another unknown. MnDOT has been considering the technology as it plans for a future reconstruction of Interstate 94 between Minneapolis and St. Paul. Even if self-driving cars can travel closer together, there could be more of them, including empty vehicles making deliveries or picking up passengers.What about winter?Then there's Minnesota winter. What will happen with self-driving cars when it snows?Most driverless vehicle testing has been in warm climates like California, but Google, Ford and GM began snow testing over the last year and a half.University of Michigan Associate Professor Edwin Olson, who worked on the Ford team, said the cars performed reasonably well in a test environment, but recreating snowy driving behavior poses challenges -- like trailing other cars in a snowstorm.""What you would be likely to see in that snowy scenario is an autonomous car stubbornly driving where the lane actually is underneath the snow,"" Olson said. ""But it could be profoundly stupid. It could be that's where the snowplow just put a deeper pile of snow.""Douma, of the Humphrey School, said MnDOT's upcoming testing is an opportunity to show they work in winter.""This would be the chance to show that Minnesota is in the game,"" Douma said.Eric Roper - 612-673-1732Twitter: @StribRoperA FUTURE OF SELF-DRIVING VEHICLESHere's a look at how autonomous vehicles could change the urban transportation landscape.1. Driverless cars can follow each other more closely and travel in narrower lanes.2. Accessible autonomous cars could give people with disabilities more independence.3. Buses and trains bring people into densely packed areas, like downtown.4. Excess roadway could be repurposed as wider sidewalks or green space.5. Parking ramps with flat levels can be repurposed as office or living space. Shared-use self-driving vehicles wait to be rented.6. Vehicles would see and react to traffic signals, which could ultimately be unnecessary.7. Empty cars share the roads making deliveries or en route to pick up passengers.8. Excess surface parking lots could be converted to housing or other uses.9. Ease of commuting may encourage long drives to exurban locales.Source: MIT Senselab MARK BOSWELL - Star Tribune\Credit: ERIC ROPER; STAFF WRITER"
271,"Mark Dayton has seen it all before.\In 2011, the Democrat was in the governor's office and Republicans had majorities in both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature, just like this session. And, just like now, there was a major battle over the state's two-year budget, on everything from health care to tax cuts.\But for Dayton, there's one big difference between 2011 and 2017. Six years ago, he was a new governor trying to craft his first-ever two-year state budget. This time, it's his last.\At 70 years old, Dayton is serving his final term as governor. In a little less than two years, he'll be leaving public service altogether, ending a 40-year career that included a stint as state auditor, one term in the U.S. Senate and two rounds as the state's chief executive. After winning his the race for governor 2010 -- the first Democrat to do so in two decades -- Dayton charted out a legacy on issues like early education, clean water and a controversial state-run health insurance exchange.\During that time, he's also seen power at the Capitol shift between Republicans and Democrats. ""Politics is a playground where you don't get to pick your playmates,"" Dayton said recently. ""You just deal with whoever shows up.""\Now in the midst of his fourth and final budget negotiations, Dayton has found himself defending much of that legacy -- and pushing to bolster key initiatives before he leaves, free from the electoral pressures during his first several budget debates. ""It's the last opportunity to stamp his legacy,"" said Steve Sviggum, who spent six years at the Republican speaker of the House.\And like 2011, some Capitol watchers are wondering if Dayton's last budget will lead to a showdown that won't be resolved by the time session ends.\'No one's going to be happy'\Looking back, Dayton's first budget battle was one of the most contentious in recent state history. The state faced a $6 billion deficit when session convened in early 2011. To fill the gap in the budget, Dayton insisted on raising income taxes on the richest Minnesotans, a plan that a new Republican majority in the Legislature pushed back on all session.\Republicans said the state books could be balanced through budget cuts, which Dayton argued would hurt the state's most vulnerable citizens. The stalemate stretched past the session's May deadline to adjourn -- and into a government shutdown that lasted for 20 days, the longest in state history.\The final agreement was one both sides detested. It called for withholding $700 million in payments to K-12 schools and selling nearly $700 million in bonds backed by revenue from the state's tobacco settlement for the rest. ""No one's going to be happy with this,"" Dayton said at the time, ""which is the essence of a real compromise.""\The situation changed dramatically two years later, after a sweeping victory by Democrats in the 2012 elections gave the DFL total control of the Legislature. They faced a more than $600 million budget deficit, but even with one-party control at the Capitol, a budget deal was pushed until the final hours of the session. Democrats disagreed over a package of construction projects, known as the bonding bill, and how much to raise in taxes.\In the end, lawmakers passed a small bonding bill and a tax bill that raised more than $2 billion in new revenue, partially through Dayton's campaign promise to raise income taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of Minnesotans. That helped cover the state's deficit and paid for new spending for property tax relief and education, including all-day kindergarten, a priority for Dayton. The Legislature also agreed to establish a state health insurance exchange, MNsure, as part of the federal Affordable Care Act.\In 2015, Dayton returned to the Capitol after being re-elected, despite proposing a tax increase in the previous budget. But the legislative realities had shifted yet again. Republicans had claimed control of the House, creating a divided Legislature for the upcoming budget debate.\There was good news for everyone, however: The state was in the black, projecting a $2 billion budget surplus. But a surplus didn't make negotiations easier. Republicans in the House wanted tax cuts, white Dayton and Senate Democrats wanted more spending on education and a gas-tax increase to pump hundreds of millions into state transportation projects each year for the next decade. They deadlocked until the final weekend of the session, when legislative leaders struck a deal -- without Dayton.\The agreement did nothing on transportation or taxes and left most of the surplus unspent. Smaller deals were worked out to increase spending on education, and Republicans dropped a plan to eliminate MinnesotaCare, a state-run health care program for low-income residents. But Dayton vetoed three of the budget bills after lawmakers went home, including the education deal, which he said didn't increase spending enough. After reaching a deal with legislative leaders to spend more on education, Dayton called lawmakers back for a one-day special session.\'Significant freedom' in final budget\There's still one week left in the 2017 legislative session, but Dayton's already issuing vetoes.\In early May, Dayton and Republican leaders met in closed-door negotiations, trying to work out a single, $46 billion state budget plan. With a $1.65 billion surplus, Dayton wants to increase spending on schools across the state as well as on his signature voluntary pre-kindergarten proposal, which he and the Legislature had agreed in 2016 to spend surplus money on. Republicans want to cut more than $1 billion in taxes and to trim state government across the board.\After five days of negotiations, however, Republicans felt talks were dragging along intentionally, that Dayton was trying to ""slow walk"" a deal. ""The governor gains leverage if he pushes us to the end,"" Republican Speaker Kurt Daudt said in announcing a plan with Republican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka to send Dayton their 10 budget bills without a compromise.\Dayton, in turn, promised Republicans he would ""veto them all."" In veto letters, he has called the cuts to health and human services ""reckless and foolish,"" and said the nearly $200 million in cuts to state government programs ""take our state in the wrong direction.""\But the disagreements go beyond the numbers. Republicans don't put money into Dayton's pre-kindergarten program. In fact, they shift funds currently going to his voluntary pre-kindergarten to school readiness programs instead. Their environment budget rolls back deadlines on a policy to put natural grass buffers between farmland and public waterways to protect them from agricultural runoff, another signature Dayton proposal. And the health and human services budget repeals MNsure, the state exchange Dayton and Democrats set up.\In a press conference, Dayton pushed back on Republican attempts to repeal his buffer law. ""If they don't like it then they don't like it,"" Dayton said. ""It's my job to represent the people of Minnesota, all the people of Minnesota.""\He also promised to veto other bills -- a GOP proposal to pre-empt local governments from passing their own labor and wage laws, and a bill to change the governance of the Metropolitan Council -- speaking in more absolute terms than he had all session.\""I think the last budget, when a governor is not running for election, probably gives the governor significant freedom to make decisions that he wants as opposed to a product that sells to the Legislature or the public,"" Sviggum said.\DFL Minority Leader Melissa Hortman, who has sat in on the budget negotiations, said she hasn't seen a major change in Dayton's negotiation style, despite the fact that it's his last budget. In the past, he pushed for unpopular tax increases ahead of his own re-election, and he's always been willing to agree to make compromises in order to get a deal.\""We saw that in 2011 when the situation was identical; he agreed to things he didn't want to,"" she said. ""He respects the other branches of government's power, and he respects that the House speaker and the majority leader of the Senate have positions they've earned through the voters as well.""\Dayton and Republicans plan to resume budget negotiations on Tuesday, and there's still time for the two sides to agree to a budget by May 22, the constitutional deadline to adjourn.\Former Republican House Minority Leader Marty Seifert doesn't see Dayton trying to push Republicans to the final hours of the session to get a better deal, or to try to make them look bad in the 2018 election. ""I think he'd like to avoid that, "" he said. ""Some people say the 2011 shutdown benefited the Democrats, but there were all sorts of dynamics at play. I don't think Dayton wants that to be his legacy, having his last budget be a shutdown budget.""\Credit: Briana Bierschbach"
272,"Last week on this page I wrote that Minnesota is closer to a conservation and environment crisis than most people understand. Hunter and angler numbers are declining. Yet license sales to these traditional outdoor users fund about 80 percent of conservation nationwide. Kids in increasing numbers relative to their population are turning a deaf ear to these activities. And urban sprawl, heavy industry such as mining and intensive agriculture threaten wild lands. I asked readers for ideas to combat these trends. Samples of the many responses I received are below, condensed and edited for brevity.\We need to teach conservation in our schools -- to educate kids about their connection with land and water, fish and wildlife and their importance in the balance of nature. We need to treat water as an asset, not a curse, and to develop a better policy of water conservation. We also need a strategic plan for land use that has a blend of agriculture and sustainable natural lands that can provide habitat and land and water benefits. Finally, science is our best answer to wildlife diseases and invasive species, and we need to fund research accordingly. Solving these problems is possible.\Lance Ness, Golden Valley\Declines in outdoor enthusiasts are correlated with declines in ecological integrity. Being in an overgrown woods, a eutrophic duck blind or buffer strip dominated by weedy species, bare soils and fouled waters, watching for a sick deer or skinny wood duck while picking off ticks isn't my idea of quality time. So far, our primary solution is acquisition of more land set aside to achieve better land health. This outdated narrative is flawed. The public will never own enough land to offset current land use threats. Also, due to resource constraints, proper management of existing public lands is lacking. One solution is a Working Lands program, both on public and private lands. All lands outside of ""true forest"" need to employ some form of work, or resistance, or they rapidly decline in health. The historic majority of Minnesota lands were worked by grazing animals, which facilitated a diverse biota and healthy soils and water. Whether waterfowler, upland game hunter or wild flower enthusiast, restoration of grazing is critical to obtain and maintain land health.\Steve Thomforde, Minneapolis\Concerning waterfowl habitat management, are there no longer any benefits to ""pothole blasting?'' Many wetlands are too choked with cattails to hold any attraction to waterfowl. It would seem that a method of setting and/or detonating ordnance by land, plane, helicopter or even drones would be plausible. The resulting pockets would create areas for swimming, nesting, feeding and loafing that could be used for waterfowl and other animals.\Russ Eigen, Annandale\Law enforcement must be expanded to achieve progress regulating invasive species. It's too late to keep them out of the state, but we can limit their expansion if we get serious about limiting transport to unaffected areas. The DNR also needs to reach out to nontraditional users by staffing an outreach section and taking seriously its recommendations how to interest nontraditional users and those who don't currently use natural resources. The agency and traditional users need to recognize that the old emphasis on hooks and bullets must change and enlarge to include the new breed of nontraditional. Nontraditional users must be willing to help fund the department either through user fees and/or support natural resources by general tax revenues.\Mike Grupa, DNR Enforcement Division, 1970-1999\In our busy world it's hard to reach people about the importance of conservation. I asked my 12-year-old son to read last Sunday's Star Tribune Outdoors page about our conservation crisis and he said, ""I wasn't aware of this. You can't solve something you don't know is a problem."" When discussing proposed solutions, we should include kids.\Todd Kerkow, Isanti County\The growing sport of trap shooting is a great sign that some of today's youth are finding their way into the field. But if there is no habitat, there will be no game. When you take a kid fishing or hunting and get shut out, even the most enthusiastic parents will throw up their arms.\Gary and Lana Lee, Maple Grove\Nature education in the schools is essential. The folks at Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge offer one such program with the help of their Friends nonprofit support group and in partnership with local teachers. A short video of their program is at https://youtu.be/1emrRTYwEjc.\Bruce Ellingson, Friends of Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge\We need to stop connecting funding of the Department of Natural Resources to the number of hunters and anglers. Too many variables affect fish and game populations and therefore hunter and angler license sales. DNR funding should be independent of this issue, and instead should be funded by a broader tax.\Jean Johnson, Prior Lake\There has been an increase in high school trap shooting, fishing and archery team sports. Perhaps this could be expanded to include upland bird and deer hunting. Getting kids interested in the outdoors is key.\Ron Murray, Staples\I didn't start hunting until I was an adult, and if I didn't have a friend and the couple who bred our hunting dogs to guide me, I never would have stuck with it. Hunting has reinvigorated my passion for the woods and prairies. My dogs have taught me more about woodcock and grouse habitat than I ever would have learned on my own. Yet I realize that if conservation improvements aren't made, I won't have predictable wild bird populations to work my dogs on!\Will Bomier, Mahtowa\What about tapping into the bike and mountain bike riders? With all the trails and parks that have been built over the past 20 years, many more people are riding bikes and enjoying the nature and forests they ride through. Maybe there should be a voluntary, annual permit of $25. I think this group is conservation-minded and if the need was presented in the right way, they would help. I know I would.\Julie Kolbow, Chanhassen\How about a special tax on bird seed, bird houses, feeders and baths? Also, there could be a users fee for non-hunters using wildlife management areas. Those with a valid hunting license would be exempt.\Don J. Dinndorf, St. Augusta\Outdoor recreation should be promoted in the immigrant and non-white population. Recruiting mentors and volunteers to role-model these activities would be a good starting point.\Mark Butala, Stillwater\Governor Walz is advocating legalization of marijuana. I would be in favor of this only if 10 to 20 percent of related tax revenue is dedicated to education and natural resources. The governor has also proposed a gas tax. Add an extra cent toward natural resources. Combating emissions is related to natural resource management, after all.\Michael Jacobson, retired Anoka County superintendent of parks maintenance\Just like a ""State of the State"" message given by the governor each year, there should be a ""State of the State's Resources"" given every five years. This report would contain recommendations on what needs to be done to protect the ""health of the resource base"" the next five years and beyond.\Terence H. Cooper, soil science professor emeritus, University of Minnesota\You have to get to kids early before they become addicted to communication devices. Remember, ""Give a Hoot, Don't Pollute?"" A similar slogan would remind young people about the importance of conservation.\Tom Obst, Forest Lake\Is a tax on camping attire and gear, along with skis and snowshoes, possible?\Loren Brabec, Braham\We should add camping, hunting, fishing, swimming and other outdoor activities to the core curriculum of grade school through high school as well as college. But reversing this trend depends on having fish and wildlife. You have to have something to hunt or fish, or people won't go.\Daniel M. Fix, St. Paul\Why not add an outdoors or nature public service requirement to high school curricula?\Randy Holland, Little Falls\I am the retired director of Eastman Nature Center with the Three Rivers Park District. My colleagues and I have spent our lives trying to get more people interested in and concerned about nature and conservation. Here are my conclusions after 35 years in the field: To increase conservation awareness, we need to meet people where they are, meaning at shopping malls, city and county parks and events and concerts -- beyond the obvious bait shops and outdoor gear stores. We also should post billboards on freeways on the main routes Up North and mandate that all schoolchildren visit an environmental education center. All kids start their lives being interested in nature. Then electronics and organized sports take over. Feed on their early enthusiasm and get them outside doing activities and learning about animals and plants and the environmental issues that exist.\Lee Ann Landstrom, St. Louis Park\COMPILED BY DENNIS ANDERSON\CREDIT:DENNIS ANDERSON; STAFF WRITER"
273,"daeikens@stcloudtimes.com\Rep. Joe Opatz came close this year to running for re-election for House District 15B uncontested.\Rand Olson wasn't going to let him run unopposed.\The St. Cloud Republican read in the newspaper that the six-term Democratic-Farmer-Labor House member from St. Cloud had no opponent.\So he jumped into the race as the filing deadline approached.\His challenge is to topple a moderate Democrat who has easily won re-election five times after winning an open seat in 1992.\The district, which includes north and East St. Cloud and Haven Township, might be considered a swing district.\In 2002, voters narrowly voted for DFLer Walter Mondale for Senate and Republicans Tim Pawlenty for governor and Mark Kennedy for Congress.\The same district has also supported Democrats Al Gore for president and Mark Dayton for U.S. Senate in 2000.\From Page 1B\House\Legislative work\Opatz's 12 years in the House have been like two different terms. The first six years, with Democrats in the majority, Opatz successfully pushed major ininitiatives that include a law requiring insurance companies to pay for 48-hour stays for new mothers and their babies.\He passed a law that provides a guide for regional planning set aside money for St. Cloud-area governments to work together on a plan. He also passed a school testing law that is now the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments.\The past six years, with a Republican majority, Opatz, has spent his time rounding up DFL votes for bills that help St. Cloud.\""I certainly have been effective,"" Opatz said. ""That is the result of having strong relationships with my colleagues in the House.""\Opatz, 52, grew up in St. Cloud and is an assistant to the president at St. Cloud State University.\Olson, 48, grew up in a Democratic household near Alexandria before moving to St. Cloud and graduating from Apollo High School.\He was moved by the work of former President Jimmy Carter and has spent 18 years working in former Soviet republics, Pakistan and Afghanistan, building and repairing homes and administering relief in war zones.\Olson lives in St. Cloud and works for a Bloomington organization that supports mission and humanitarian work.\Olson argues Opatz was part of the problem when legislators did not pass a bonding bill in the 2004 session.\""He talks about his ability to build bridges. He built no bridges,"" Olson said.\Olson says Opatz isn't getting anything done, that he's lost his interest and passion to serve.\Opatz says that's ridiculous.\""I'm proud of my effort at the Capitol. I continue to be productive and am good at serving my constituents,"" he said.\On some of the key issues, they have similar views. Both say they would carry the sales tax bill if local voters approve it in a referendum this fall. The sales tax would pay for a number of regional projects including a St. Cloud library, parks and trails and road projects.\Issues\Both support the Northstar commuter rail project along U.S. Highway 10. Opatz said the project needs to get done. Olson said once its built from Minneapolis to Big Lake, a study needs to be done on potential ridership before extending into St. Cloud.\Both support more money for schools. Olson supports putting slot machines at Canterbury Park, a horse track and card club, as a way of generating more state money. Opatz opposes it as an expansion of gambling.\Olson wants the state to negotiate payments from profits at American Indian casinos. Opatz supports talks in those efforts but wants to make sure the state doesn't do anything to hurt American Indians.\Both support increases to the gas tax to pay for transportation needs. Neither have signed the Minnesota Taxpayers League pledge to oppose taxes.\Both oppose gay marriage. Olson has criticized Opatz for opposing a constitutional amendment banning it.

If you weren't happy with it, what steps would you take to prevent it from happening again?\One of the reasons I decided to run against Rep. Joe Opatz was because of his failure to accomplish anything of significance during this last legislative session and his part in ending the legislative session in a virtual stalemate.\In the process, he failed to support an amendment that would protect traditional marriage, a strong value of the St. Cloud community.\The result was the House and Senate Democrat caucuses decided to engage in costly political maneuvering, costing taxpayers and working families money and jobs.\By running for office, I am taking the first step to remove an incumbent legislator who feels he can act against the citizens of this district without consequences.\Let us make sure that we have legislators who are willing to get the job done!\Joe Opatz\Address: 422 Riverside Drive SE, St. Cloud, MN 56304.\Age: 52.\Phone: 252-1138, 308-5077.\E-mail: rep.joe.opatz@ house.mn.\Political party: DFL.\Education: Ph.D., University of Minnesota; master of education, Kent State University; bachelor of arts, St. Cloud State University.\Occupation: University administrator, St. Cloud State.\Elected experience: Minnesota House of Representatives, 1993-present.\Appointed boards: St. Cloud Charter Commission, 10th Street Bridge Commission.\Family: Spouse, Pamela Steckman; two children.\Top three priorities:\1. Making the necessary investments in our education system and our colleges and universities to ensure that Minnesota maintains its long-standing legacy as a national leader on almost every measure of economic vitality and quality of life.\2. A long-term funding solution to the state's woefully inadequate investment in our transportation system.\3. Passing a significant bonding bill that includes the many important projects for our community, including the Northstar Corridor, expansion at St. Cloud Technical College and St. Cloud State and parks and trails.\*\In budget discussions that are expected to include a shortfall, how important is additional funding to public schools and what, if anything, would you do to ensure more money on the school formula?\The Legislature has not kept its commitment to our schools during the past few years, which has resulted in excessive demands on the local property-tax payers and inadequate resources for the critical job of educating the next generation.\I have supported and will continue to support increased state funding for our schools, including a better balance of the current inequity in funding that exists across school districts.\Property-tax payers in districts with low property values such as ours should not have to pay more for our schools than those from property wealthy districts.\What can and should the Legislature do to combat rising health-care costs and make sure all Minnesotans have access to health care?\No issue faced by the Legislature is more complicated and difficult to fix than the rapid increases in health-care costs.\And Minnesota can only have moderate impact on rising costs if the federal government fails to act on a national level.\What we must do is force down the exorbitant costs of prescription drugs through such efforts as my bill (HF 701) that would require the drug companies to fully disclose their pricing structures so that we have a more competitive purchasing environment.\We should also make stronger the connection between the costs of health care and the behavior of the patient through better prevention programs, and give tax incentives to businesses who provide disease prevention programs to their employees.\Should the last legislative session have ended in a virtual stalemate, leaving the governor to cut the state's budget to make up shortfalls? If you weren't happy with it, what steps would you take to prevent it from happening again?\The failure of the governor and the leadership of the House and Senate was inexcusable.\As a member of the minority party, I am convinced that had I been in a leadership position, I would have been successful in delivering a sensible bonding bill with projects critical to our community such as Northstar Commuter Rail and investments at St. Cloud Technical College.\Too many legislators are unwilling to make the compromises that must be found to meet its obligations to our citizens.\Consensus building requires that we develop better relationships between the House and Senate and across the aisle.\We need something we have not seen in a long time at the Capitol - opportunities for more informal interaction among all of us so we develop an understanding and appreciation for each other's perspectives."
274,"In January, when DFL Gov. Mark Dayton first heard the details of House Republicans' plan to fix Minnesota's crumbling network of roads and bridges, he called a 40-minute press conference to accuse them of trying to solve someone else's transportation problems.\Whose problems? According to Dayton: the citizens of ""La La Land"" and ""Fantasy Island.""\In terms of his own priorities, the second-term governor had reason to be discouraged. The plan he ultimately released calls for a nearly $11 billion investment in the state's roads, bridges and transit systems over 10 years, including $6 billion just for state-run roads and bridges, paid for by raising fees and the sales tax on gas at the wholesale level.\But Republicans in control of the House balked at raising billions in new revenue from taxpayers. Instead, they pitched a short-term fix: a plan to put $750 million over four years into roads and bridges - but not transit - paid for out of a state budget surplus and savings at the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT).\Taken on a yearly basis, the difference between the plans amounted to $200 million of spending versus $1 billion.\Despite those vast differences, little has changed since the opening weeks of session; in fact, both sides seem to be doubling down on their respective plans. Dayton and his administration have started traveling around the state to ratchet up the pressure to pass his proposal.\Meanwhile, though the Republicans' transportation plan won't come out for a few weeks, House Transportation Finance and Policy Chairman Tim Kelly has already made it clear that the plan won't raise revenues and will only focus on the current budgeting period.\""The bottom line: We all agree that transportation needed to be elevated at this point in time because we saw the need,"" Kelly said. ""We just haven't agreed on that 10-year plan, whether you want to call it a $10 billion need or a $50 billion need. We just don't have agreement on that.""\Trying to determine that number, however, could be a fool's errand. Even for the experts, putting an exact dollar figure on transportation needs is no easy task. In a highly politicized environment like the Capitol, it borders on the impossible, since so few trust the information they are getting anyway.\""I always try to give people ranges, but everybody wants a number,"" said David Ellis, a researcher at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute who was asked to try and determine a similar number for the Lone Star State's transportation system back in 2010. ""Once you say that number it becomes gospel, and then it gets politicized.""\'Unmet needs is a political term'\The numbers have already become political in Minnesota. Dayton's figures are derived from a 2012 report from the Transportation Finance Advisory Committee (TFAC), a bipartisan group of lawmakers, union members and business representatives the governor assembled to study the state's transportation needs.\After more than a year of meetings, the group concluded that the state needs at least $250 million per year just to maintain the state-run highway system, which carries the most traffic. Even more would be needed for local governments to patch up their roads.\But the biggest numbers came out of discussions about how to create a system that could handle future economic and population growth in Minnesota. To adequately accommodate those needs, the group recommended spending $21 billion over the next 20 years. Dayton lopped the number in half for his proposal, but even that was tough for some to swallow.\The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which currently opposes new taxes for transportation, is one of several groups that have commissioned a study of Dayton's TFAC study, referred to in St. Paul as the ""Hutchinson Report,"" after its lead researcher, former finance commissioner and Independence Party Candidate Peter Hutchinson.\The problem, said former Republican Rep. Michael Beard, who served on the TFAC, is that the numbers are so big that it's hard for people to wrap their heads around how the money will be spent. ""I've heard $40 billion, I've heard $20 billion; I think someone once threw out $80 billion over 20 years,"" he said. ""Unmet needs is a political term, that usually means the unmet needs in the eye of the beholder.""\For his part, Dayton and his administration are defending the TFAC numbers. ""I didn't try to influence that report,"" the governor said. ""These are the experts from a variety of transportation related sectors who met continuously over the year and that was their report and their analysis. I understand now some groups are coming in and having someone do a quick analysis to try and discredit this. If you hire a consultant to tell you what you already know...that's typically what you get.""\MnDOT Commissioner Charlie Zelle said engineers in the department used models looking at pavement conditions that affirmed much of what the TFAC report found. ""This is what we see; this is what is needed,"" he said.\The trouble with setting a number\But transportation networks are complicated, and there are a lot of challenges in trying to pinpoint an exact dollar figure to meet all the needs.\For starters, Minnesota's transportation system is massive. It's the fifth largest in the nation, with more than 142,000 roadway miles and 20,000 bridges. And that doesn't include the growing network of train lines, bus routes and bicycle lanes in the seven-county metro area.\The network of entities that take care of the transportation system is also complex. When a road is broken, government pays for it, of course, but which government? Some roads are paid for by state dollars, and others are funded completely by local governments. Still others get money from both.\It doesn't help that funding streams for transportation are increasingly unpredictable. The amount of transportation dollars states get from the federal government is shrinking, and so are revenues from Minnesota's 28.6-cents-per-gallon gas tax, thanks to the increasing popularity of public transportation and more fuel-efficient vehicles. It's also difficult to predict the cost of road construction materials, which can be volatile.\""That's where a lot of professional judgment is involved and looking at trends, what has happened in the past is a good indicator of where things are going,"" said Ken Buckeye, the TFAC project manager for MnDOT. ""We didn't try to create an alarming picture. We were just trying to lay it out there using data and experts looking at the trends.""\There are other factors that are hard to anticipate, too: floods or other natural disasters that can destroy roads; how much population will swell over time in certain areas; and how technology changes the way we travel. For instance, less people are driving to movie theaters or video rental stores with the advent of television streaming. And where most people had to take individual trips out of their homes to go shopping, online retail allows a handful of delivery trucks to cut back on some of that travel, says Texas A&M's Ellis.\""Predicting the future is hard to do,"" he said. ""Last September, when oil was $100 a barrel, would any of us have predicted it would be $52 dollars a barrel?""\The pressure is on\To make the case for his numbers, Dayton released a list of more than 600 projects that his plan would fix, and members of his administration are traveling around the state to highlight some of the major projects. The move has irked Republicans, who say the governor is trying to earmark projects to put pressure on individual lawmakers.\""Transportation is always very political, because everybody uses the transportation system every day and there is an expectation that that system is going to work for you,"" said Lee Munich, a transportation policy and finance fellow at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs. ""Legislators hear about the roads in their district so every legislator is sensitive to this subject. The governor is saying, let's go and fix everything, and here is what those things are.""\In Texas, Ellis said the numbers were just too big for legislators to tackle all at once. ""Transportation went into the 'Too hard' box,"" he said. Over time, Ellis said, the Texas Legislature has started to address transportation needs by biting off small chunks of the funding a need at a time. In Minnesota, Kelly is asking the Democrats to give his caucus time to digest the problem and determine the need.\""If it ranges from $2.5 billion to $10 billion, then for me, that's really hard to go to my caucus to raise revenue for some need that we don't even agree on,"" Kelly said. ""We've suggested from the start, just give us time to reach agreement with the governor and the Senate, but let's not forget our responsibility in the short term, which is this year's budget and the next four year's needs.""\But Dayton and Democrats have little interest in doing that. MnDOT says more than half of state-run roads are 50 years old, and in the next three years, one out of five state roads will pass their useful life. In the next 10 years, that will swell to nearly 40 percent. Next session it will be even harder to pass new money for roads and bridges, with legislators facing the voters that fall.\""I think there should be a collaborative effort with the four caucus transportation leaders to sit down and look at the facts,"" said Dayton. ""I have no desire to raise $6 billion in revenues if $6 billion is not needed to do what we say it's going to do here. On the other hand, I'm not going to willingly allow others to grossly underestimate the cost so they can avoid the tough decisions.""\Credit: Briana Bierschbach"
275,"The chart that appeared with this article was not available electronically - please refer to the microfilm for the complete chart.\Before the military confrontation in the Middle East, some of the biggest headlines coming out of Washington, D.C., were whether to raise taxes.\ Compared with matters of life and death in the sands of the Persian Gulf area, the topic may seem prosaic today. But U.S. budget deficit and economic woes - like the standoff in the Middle East - demand immediate attention and won't go away soon.\ The seven members of the Star Tribune's Board of Economists were asked to play the role of presidential adviser. If they had an office down the hall from George Bush, what would they tell him to do about taxes?\ Peter Glanville, senior vice president and research director at Dain Bosworth, Inc., and Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest Corp., said the best course is to do nothing. Raising taxes in the midst of a weak economy and uncertain peace, they said, is foolhardy.\ However, Arthur Rolnick, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; William Melton, senior vice president and chief economist at IDS Financial Services; Paul Anton, president of Anton Financial Economics; and Tom Stinson, Minnesota state economist, opted for gradual tax increases, some aimed as much at improving tax equity as at improving the federal deficit.\ But University of Minnesota economist Wilbur Maki called for the largest tax increase in more than a decade, implemented in hikes in a wide array of existing taxes and in the implementation of some new ones, including taxes on medical insurance coverage, mortgages, and old age survivor benefits. In fact, Maki, whose proposal called for $71 billion in tax increases and $71 billion in spending cuts next year, was the only member of the panel who sounded enthusiastic about tax increases.\ ""The problem is we have the lowest taxes of all developed countries - lower than Japan, much lower than West Germany,"" Maki said.""We have a terrible underinvestment in our public infrastructure (roads, bridges, airports, sea ports). That's highly correlated with the net earnings we get in the private sector.""\ Among Maki's proposals: Raise the lowest income tax bracket from 15 percent to 16 percent and raise the bracket on the highest income earners from 28 percent to 32 percent. Tax 85 percent of Social Security benefits, instead of 50 percent, for the most prosperous elderly who pay taxes on these benefits. Cut tax breaks on a wide range of beneficiaries - from workers who aren't taxed on medical insurance coverage to inheritors of money and property who now get special treatment on capital gains.\ ""These proposals all make sense economically,"" Maki said. ""Politically, there's a quid pro quo: No tax increases would be passed without spending cuts.""\ At the other end of the spectrum on tax increases, economists Glanville and Sohn stood firm. They opposed any new tax increases - at least for the next year.\ ""I think we're at a fairly precarious point in time as far as the economy's concerned, and I would make the case that solving the deficit issue should not be the No. 1 priority,"" said Glanville.\ If the nation is heading into a recession, the budget deficit will rise no matter what tax bill is passed, Glanville said.\ ""In the previous recessions of 1973-74 and 1982, you had a quadrupling of the budget deficit,"" he said. ""I think it's an open game on guessing what the number's going to be next time, but I think the number is going to surprise a lot of people.""\ Some economists have said that the deficit, estimated to be at about $165 billion in the current fiscal year, could balloon to more than $300 billion during the next recession. In an economic slump, the government spends more on unemployment payments and other benefits even as tax revenues decline in line with lower corporate profits and reduced payrolls.\ Sohn said rising oil prices and a slowing economy make a tax increase the most unwise way to try to balance the federal budget deficit in the year ahead.\ ""I'm absolutely opposed to increases in taxes,"" Sohn said.\ Indeed, Sohn urged a cut in the capital gains tax rate - from a high of 33 percent down to 21 or 22 percent - in order to boost investment and economic activity. He estimated the move would raise $50 billion over the next three years. Such estimates are controversial, however. Some economists say the government would raise more revenue in the short run but lose over the long run.\ Nevertheless, Sohn said most economists back a cut in capital gains taxes and fear the consequences of raising other taxes in the current economic environment.\ Interest rates have been climbing in the weeks since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and those hikes threaten to weaken the economy further unless something is done to ease inflation fears spurred by higher oil prices, Sohn said. His solution: Pare $50 billion from the federal budget deficit through spending cuts rather than tax increases.\ ""If we did cut budget deficits by $50 billion or more and did it by a cutback in spending, I think the value of the dollar would appreciate and that would contribute to lower inflation and lower interest rates,"" Sohn said.\ The only long-term tax increase Sohn would favor, albeit reluctantly: A gas tax hike that would take effect when pump prices started to fall. For example, if gasoline prices fell from $1.50 a gallon to $1.30, Sohn said he might go along with a 20 cent-a-gallon tax increase that would be almost invisible to the motorist grown accustomed to steep fuel prices.\ Rolnick said he'd be in no rush to raise taxes to ease the budget deficit because he doesn't think that federal red ink has hindered the economy severely.\ ""The premise that we start with - that the budget deficit is a major problem - I'd say isn't a major problem,"" Rolnick said. The economy, he said, has grown for eight years with the budget deficits claiming 3 percent to 5 percent of the total output of the economy.\ As it stands, the deficit today is about 3.5 percent of the Gross National Product (GNP), and even if its share climbs higher, the deficit will be within range of where it's been during the economic expansion of the 1980s.\ ""I think this economy is strong enough, healthy enough, that we can live with a 3 percent to 5 percent (of GNP) deficit,"" Rolnick said.\ Still, when pressed, he said the economy might fare better in the long run if Congress raised taxes on consumption, including a $5 tax increase on a barrel of oil, and lowered levies on investment, such as the capital gains tax.\ Melton said the economy should be able to withstand $25 billion in federal tax increases and $25 billion in federal spending cuts next year. Waiting to act when the economy is stronger wouldn't be smart, Melton said.\ ""The time for doing a virtuous act is never right,"" Melton said. ""This certainly has been true of dealing with the budget deficit.""\ In Melton's view, the key to raising taxes for 1991 will be in reaching a deal soon, gauging the cost and giving the Federal Reserve Board enough warning to ease interest rates as a stimulus to the economy well in advance of the tax increases.\ ""In principle, it can be done,"" Melton said. ""In practice, it's always a lot dicier.""\ He would raise $25 billion by higher federal taxes on gasoline and ""sin taxes"" on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. In the longer run, he'd like those tax increases to be replaced by broader-based energy taxes, which would tax home heating and commercial fuel use along with gasoline. Melton also advocates a national value-added tax - a sort of national sales tax - that would take about two years to implement.\ Other economists on the panel also offered quick-fix and longer-term solutions to the dilemma of how to raise taxes.\ Writers of tax laws should look beyond the budget problems of 1991 and try to adopt tax reforms that will raise revenue over many years in a more equitable way, said Anton.\ Anton would raise $20 billion next year by raising sin taxes and adopting new taxes on air and water polluters.\ ""I would put off energy taxes until 1991,"" he said. ""I think you'd raise too big a risk (to the economy) by raising more right away.""\ But after 1991, Anton said he'd propose a 5 percent value-added tax that excluded levies on food, housing and medical care. He'd also favor energy taxes - a 25-cent tax on a gallon of gas or a $7.50 tax on a barrel of oil. But Anton would earmark half the $24 billion raised to highway repair and construction rather than putting all the money into deficit reduction.\ ""Politically, people are willing to pay increased taxes if they think there's some increased benefit,"" Anton said.\ Stinson said he'd use a bit of sleight-of-hand to raise taxes only modestly in the next year but much more in the years that followed.\ His idea: A one-year interruption in inflation-adjustment of income tax brackets, standard deductions and personal exemptions.\ ""The wonderful thing about compound interest rates and compound growth rates is that if you put some things (such as an inflation-adjustment interruption) into effect, five years from now, suddenly you get a lot of money out of them.""\ For instance, he said a one-year suspension of inflation adjustment on income tax brackets, standard deductions and personal exemptions would raise $5 billion in 1991 but could raise $50 billion by 1996, as incomes rise in tandem with inflation.\ Stinson also would eliminate tax breaks granted to beneficiaries, who now avoid almost all capital gains on inherited assets, and would raise the tax rate on the highest income earners from 28 percent to 33 percent. A small tax on the purchase and sale of stock and higher sin taxes are good ideas, he said.\ ""We sneak in $20 billion in new revenues in year one,"" Stinson said of his proposals. ""In 1995 or 1996, they would raise $200 billion.""\Is this the time to raise taxes?\If you were the president's chief economic adviser would you agree to tax hikes, when the nation is threatened with a possible recession and a possible war? In answer to those questions, two of the seven members of the Star Tribune's Board of Economists oppose raising taxes this year, arguing that the nation's economy is too fragile. But all seven economists agree that a stiffer tax bill next year or later could help reduce the federal deficit, lower interest rates and perhaps invite a fairer distribution of tax burdens among rich and poor, consumers and savers.\ (This chart was not available electronically - please refer to the microfilm for the complete chart.)"
276,"As hope of a gas tax and other revenue increases evaporated in negotiations, advocates who spent the legislative session lobbying for leaps in education spending had to settle for a final budget described as incremental. They used the lull at the Capitol last week ahead of the special session to sort through what, exactly, was left in the education bill after leaders stepped in to make the final call. At a pair of information meetings held by the House and Senate education committees, those advocates took one last chance to say their piece.\Paul Spies, head of the legislative action team with the Coalition to Increase Teachers of Color and American Indian Teachers, skipped the usual offering of thanks and congratulations to legislators on securing substantial funding for general and special education aid for the next two years. He was too frustrated.\A suite of coalition-backed proposals got a little more than a tenth of the $80 million in funding outlined in the original bill introduced this session, and most of that was base-level funding for existing programs. Of the $543 million in new E-12 spending, the bill includes just $2.5 million in new funding for efforts that the coalition – which unites education advocates often at odds with one another – says would improve outcomes for students of color.\“We started the session with hope. Today, I’m here devastated and disillusioned,” Spies told legislators. “Crumbs won’t feed starving children. We have to do more.”\The education budget bill was among the last to come up in each chamber early Saturday morning during the 21-hour special session. It passed the Senate unanimously, 67-0, and cleared the House 112-13. It excluded a number of policies, not all of them controversial. With a more modest bump in spending than DFLers wanted, funding for programs their allies wanted to see enacted was cut in the final version. In all, it spends $20.1 billion on education over the next two years.\It was a lackluster year, Josh Crosson, senior policy director with EdAllies, told MinnPost. “[Lawmakers] avoided making necessary improvements to our education system. It’s that kind of transformational change that our students need, especially our most underserved students. I think, all in all, the direction was more of the same.”\ Victories and compromises in spending plan \Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle held up the four of the biggest funding areas – general and special education aid, preschool, and school safety grants – as victories, even though each made significant concessions to reach a deal.\For example, Gov. Tim Walz and DFL leaders held on to their demand to continue funding 4,000 preschool seats in low-income school districts. The program was set to expire after this year. But the bill only extends that funding for another two years, meaning the issue will come back in 2021.\All sides took credit for the 2 percent increase in general education spending in each of the next two years. Republicans called it “historic.” Education Commissioner Mary Cathryn Ricker told members of the House education committee Wednesday, “This formula increase that we worked toward, combined with the special education increase, is the largest investment in eight years in formula and special ed increases – in at least eight years.”\School advocates were quick to remind legislators that while 2 percent is better than the 0.5 percent initially proposed by Republicans, it is below the 3 percent annual increase they wanted, and it just keeps up with inflation. The governor and House DFL had proposed a 3 percent increase for 2020 and 2 percent increase for 2021.\Walz succeeded in his quest to chip in enough toward special education over the next two years to prevent schools from dipping further into their general funds to cover rising costs. The cross subsidy costs the average district $820 per student this year, though the cost varies widely throughout the state.\The funding boost comes with some policy changes, as well. The formula for special education funding will include aid to reduce the cross subsidy for school districts by 2.6 percent in 2020 and 6.43 percent in 2021. Other changes to the formula include phasing out a cap on the amount of aid a district can receive from the state, shifting to focus more on current-year costs instead of the level of aid received in previous years, and updating funding rates that take student characteristics into account.\It also reduces the amount that charter schools or other districts where open-enrolled special education students attend can bill back to the students’ home districts to cover unfunded costs. Previously, home districts would bear 90 percent of those costs for students not attending their schools. That rate will fall to 85 percent in 2020 and 80 percent in 2021. Charter schools will get more special education aid from the state to make up some of the loss.\In the tax bill, legislators gave more aid to property-poor districts that can’t raise as much revenue through property taxes and increased a tax credit for agricultural landowners. Under that tax credit program, the state pays a portion of the property tax ag landowners would pay to their school districts.\ Reminder: This was not a policy year \The bill was light on policy – a sore spot for advocates as well as lawmakers, including Rep. Cheryl Youakim, DFL-Hopkins, who chairs the House Education Policy Committee.\“Unfortunately a lot of our policy that might have been differing on both sides, we never really got to in the timeframe,” Youakim said during the House information hearing Wednesday. “We kept hearing the refrain, ‘But it’s not a policy year,’ so I am really looking forward to doing a lot of policy next year.”\It means the 2020 session, which starts in February, will be a bit of a rerun of the debates heard this year. Education Minnesota, the state teachers union, already said as much. “We heard loud and clear this is a budget year, not a policy year,” Education Minnesota President Denise Specht told MinnPost. “We believe there are missed opportunities for policy and we do plan to bring those conversations back.”\The bill makes some changes to paperwork requirements for special education teachers. It also encourages school districts to require students to take civics during 11th or 12th grade; requires them to screen for dyslexia; moves Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments as late as possible each year; requires that teacher preparation programs include best practices for teaching reading; and allows students to have and use sunscreen, among other additions and changes. MDE quickly published a list of which of its priorities made it (including the nitty gritty technical changes) and which didn’t.\More than a couple dozen policy measures didn’t make the cut. Some of them were controversial, including changes to the tiered licensure system, new requirements for comprehensive sex education, and tax breaks for individuals who give toward scholarships at private schools.\Changes to the way school districts approach student discipline also weren’t included. A coalition of advocates called Solutions Not Suspensions want lawmakers to require districts to use nonexclusionary practices for nonviolent behavior. They also want to ban the use of suspensions and expulsions for preschool children.\Students of color are suspended or expelled at higher rates than their white classmates, and that disparity adds to persistent opportunity gaps in Minnesota schools, said Madaline Edison, executive director of Educators For Excellence, which is part of the coalition trying to change discipline practices.\She was disappointed with the proposal being left out at the end, but the coalition will be back. “I am hopeful that it seems as though legislators across both parties are looking at this issue more seriously than in the past.”\ A hard sell; coalition hopes dashed \It was clear early in the session that the Increase Teachers of Color Act would be a hard sell at $80 million, especially when the Senate Education Committee didn’t grant a hearing on the bill. But the governor included $16 million toward the mix of new and expanded programs. Then the House allocated $37.4 million.\Combined with bipartisan co-authors of the bills in each chamber, the coalition held on to hope. But in the end, there wasn’t enough money, and it didn’t rank high enough on the priority list.\This year’s budget won’t make a difference, Spies said, so the portion of students of color will continue to increase – as it has from 25 percent to about 34 percent over the last decade – while the portion of teachers of color is stuck at 4 percent. Without addressing it, the state doesn’t meet its own standard to provide students with equitable access to effective and diverse teachers.\“Our state has not done enough to address opportunity and achievement gaps,” Spies told legislators.\The E-12 and higher education bills each have provisions that fund parts of the Increase Teachers of Color Act, with a total investment of $11 million. It maintains current funding for teacher shortage loan forgiveness, Grow Your Own teacher preparation, American Indian teacher preparation, and “intro to teaching” concurrent enrollment for high schoolers.\Two existing programs got new money, though less than proposed: $750,000 more per year for student teacher candidate grants, totaling $2.5 million over the biennium; and $99,000 more in 2020 only for another grant program to recruit people of color and American Indians to teacher preparation programs.\One new program puts $750,000 a year toward grants school districts can use to support mentoring and retaining teachers of color.\ ‘Minor outcomes’ \Lawmakers treated the proposal like a menu of options instead of a full-throated assault on the lack of teacher diversity in the state, Violeta Hernández Espinosa, a legislative and policy liaison with the Minnesota Council on Latino Affairs, told MinnPost.\“We thought we were on track to do some serious work on this issue,” she said. Instead “we have some minor outcomes for our work this session. They won’t move the needle even a little bit.”\The state’s ethnic councils, including the Council on Latino Affairs, the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council, Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans, and the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage, back the proposal. It’s an alliance the current leaders haven’t seen before, Hernández Espinosa said. They share a desire to improve the school environment for children in their communities who face some of the worst achievement gaps in the country.\Those gaps have lingered and widened for decades. She said it’s wrong to assume that general education aid or a piecemeal approach will fix it.\“We have this sense of urgency because we see the daily impact on our communities,” she said. “Others have thought of this as a long-term project. It’s hard for me to do that – to think of it as long-term. … We have a significant issue that requires serious investment.”"
277,"Charles Marohn's professional epiphany came with equal doses of clarity and guilt.\The University of Minnesota-trained civil engineer had once been proud of a project he helped build in Remer, a town of a few hundred people between Brainerd and Grand Rapids. A sewer line that ran beneath a highway had been damaged, but the small town couldn't afford the fix, and state and federal government agencies couldn't be bothered with a grant request so small.\So Marohn got creative: He expanded the $300,000 repair into a $2.6 million plan that would not only fix the sewer line, but extend it for future growth. State and federal funders were happy to pay the costs, save the $130,000 the city pitched in (which was met with a matching low-interest federal loan).\Marohn was a hero. And yet, when he later returned to the area for other projects, he realized he hadn't helped as much as he thought. The town had added water service to go along with the sewers, but it still wasn't generating enough new revenue to pay off the project loans, let alone fix the systems when they needed repairs.\""Thanks to the leaky pipe he fixed, the town now had to bear the maintenance costs of a system that was double the size of the one it had before,"" wrote Leigh Gallagher in her 2013 book ""The End of the Suburbs.""\""I bought them time,"" Marohn told her, 'but I gave them a giant unfunded liability.""\Marohn, who goes by ""Chuck,"" grew up on a farm in Baxter, graduated from Brainerd High in 1991 and still lives in the area with his wife, St. Cloud Times reporter Kirsti Marohn, and their two daughters. He said Remer made him begin to question his own profession -- how it was offering solutions that not only encouraged sprawl, but also created places that were financially unsustainable.\""It was actually a depressing kind of feeling,"" he said. ""It made me feel guilty.""\So in 2009, Marohn created a blog (strongtowns.org) to share his observations about land use, sprawl and how to make existing communities economically stronger. One of the early posts was titled ""Confessions of a Recovering Engineer."" He is not particularly popular among his former colleagues.\""I am a guy who started out writing a blog and felt like I was a voice in the wilderness with maybe some crazy ideas that people around here certainly weren't buying,"" Marohn said. ""What I found is there's a nation of people hungry to do something different, share our message and support us.""\""Us"" is Strong Towns, the nonprofit that grew out of Marohn's blog and that now has a small-but-growing national membership. As part of his work for Strong Towns, Marohn publishes frequent blog items, records podcasts and travels (a lot) -- he's spent 64 nights on the road so far this year -- delivering ""Curbside Chats"" to groups and working with cities. He had just returned from taking part in a White House conference on rural placemaking.\""If you had told me five years ago I would get invited to the White House to talk about things I think are important, I'd have said no way in heck was that going to happen,"" Marohn said. ""But we're getting attention from the right people for the right reasons.""\'Woodbury is going away, no matter what'\While much of the Strong Towns agenda sounds like typical New Urbanist catechism -- suburbs and sprawl = bad; cities and density = good -- there is a difference informed by Marohn's background. For one, he describes himself as a fiscally conservative Republican; most of those who share his philosophy are liberal Democrats. Also, he was a civil engineer first, not a city planner (though he later returned to the University of Minnesota to get a master's in urban and regional planning). All of which means that he sees many of the issues he writes about through an economic lens, rather than from the perspective of the environment or politics.\It's a perspective that has led Marohn to conclude that the nation's 70-year experiment with suburban development is a failure -- because it is economically unsustainable. That is, the lack of density does not produce tax revenue necessary to cover current services, let alone the long-term costs of maintaining and replacing those services. And because suburbs were built as fully developed places, they don't have the flexibility to adapt, to become more dense in response to fiscal realities.\In fact, according to the gospel of Strong Towns, the life cycle of a suburb includes a generation of growth, a generation of stagnation and then a rapid decline. Or as Marohn memorably put it in a recent talk at the U of M: ""Woodbury is going away, no matter what. There is no renewal process. There is no next step in its evolution.""\'A tremendously boring approach'\One of the first writers for Strong Towns -- and its very first paying member -- says what makes the organization different is that it truly is bipartisan. ""The smart growth movement leans left,"" said Nate Hood, a professional planner who lives in St. Paul and also is a founding member of the Streets.Mn blog. ""It's hard to be bipartisan, but Strong Towns does a good job.""\The importance of that approach dawned on Hood while taking part in a meeting in rural New Hampshire. The audience mostly consisted of small-town residents and farmers. A green building advocate was speaking about sustainable development, but as soon as she spoke those words the audience ""left the presentation, even if they were still in their seats.""\Coming up with ways to talk about issues like New Urbanism in ways that reach beyond true believers is one mission of Strong Towns. Not that the organization has a message that tends to bring people to their feet, anyway, no matter how interested they are in the issues of growth, development and transportation. That is partly due to group's belief that cities improve incrementally, with many small changes, rather than via huge projects and major investments.\""It's the equivalent of saving for retirement,"" Hood said. ""Do you put away $100 a week for life or bet it all on black? What hurts this organization is it's a tremendously boring approach. It just happens to be the right one.""\Another thing that sets Marohn apart from the standard issue New Urbanist is that he doesn't seem to hate cars. ""We are not going to abandon the automobile,"" the Strong Towns website says. ""But we must urgently begin the process of stitching our communities back together at a human scale.""\He doesn't hate freeways either. He does believe, however, that cities should not be built primarily to accommodate cars, and that high-capacity, high-speed roads are better off connecting two places to each other, not running through the center of those places.\At his recent U of M lecture, Marohn repeated several phrases that have become part of the core to the Strong Towns message:\""People are the indicator species of success.""\""Streets are a platform for building wealth.""\And this: ""If you need a sign to tell people to slow down, you designed your street wrong.""\Stroad to ruin\In his recent blog post on the urban planning site Planetizen, Michael Lewyn looked at the types of places this year's presidential candidates live. Do they live in sprawl or do they live in cities? And how might that influence their policies?\While most of the candidates live in the suburbs, Ted Cruz prefers urban life in a condo that offers a Whole Foods close by. ""On the negative side,"" Lewyn wrote, ""the Whole Foods is on a stroad, as one might expect given Houston's reputation for car-oriented design.""\A stroad? The fact that Lewyn didn't have to define ""stroad"" for his audience shows how ubiquitous the term -- which was coined by Marohn -- has become in the world of urbanists and planners.\""A STROAD is a street/road hybrid,"" wrote Marohn for Streets.Mn in 2012. Marohn explains that stroads are the ""futon of transportation alternatives. ""Where a futon is an uncomfortable couch that also serves as an uncomfortable bed, a STROAD is an auto corridor that does not move cars efficiently while simultaneously providing little in the way of value capture.""\Stroads are one of the villains in the Strong Towns narrative, largely because they don't encourage development in places where people want to be -- and they don't serve to move cars rapidly.\""Cities wishing to be Strong Towns should have an active policy for reducing the amount of STROADS within the community,"" Marohn wrote. (Marohn says he spelled the word with all caps early on as a joke on engineers who would assume it was an acronym and spend time searching for what it stood for. He now spells it ""stroads."")\Engineers create stroads, he said, by following the manuals that say safety comes from wider lanes with rights of way cleared of trees and other obstacles. Such designs are forgiving to drivers, but they also send drivers a message that they can -- and should -- go fast. Cities, therefore, need to transform their stroads either into a road or a street, Marohn preaches: slowing speeds, prioritizing pedestrian, bike and transit uses over cars as well as intensifying adjacent land use.\""When we bring the lanes in, when we constrict, when we keep the trees, we signal to drivers that there's a cost to pay if you go too fast,"" Marohn said. As a result, they slow down.\Marohn admits that while engineers know how to build good and effective roads, there is less known about creating great streets. ""Building a productive place, building a truly great street is more an art than a science,"" he said. ""We build them slowly and collectively over time.""\Taking on the 'infrastructure cult'\Yet it is in the area of transportation that Marohn and Strong Towns ruffle the most feathers. In his ""curbside chats,"" he cites estimates by the American Society of Civil Engineers that the nation would need to spend $94 billion a year to meet its highway needs alone. While he questions the data, he also notes that reaching that figure would require a federal gas tax of 78 cents per gallon, up from the current 18.4 cents.\Politically, such a tax hike isn't feasible, and Marohn said he wouldn't support it even if it could pass Congress. He also opposed the transportation program pushed earlier this year by Gov. Mark Dayton and Move MN, a coalition of business and labor groups, contractors and local government, transit and bike advocates. Putting more money into anything more than maintaining the current system is a bad idea, he argues, and simply postpones the need to rethink how government spends money on transportation.\Marohn isn't a big fan of the current regional transit plans much either. A Twins fan, he uses a baseball metaphor to critique the plan to finish the Southwest and Bottineau extensions of the Green and Blue lines as the ""Metrodome of transit solutions.""\""At Strong Towns, we don't believe in build-it-and-they-will-come transportation investments,"" he says of the current light rail plans. ""That holds for both highways and transit. We need to invest in making places stronger first.""\Marohn refers to politicians of both parties, as well as the interest groups that push for transportation tax hikes and the news media that writes about it, as the ""infrastructure cult."" Democrats, he says, are for big, top-down transit projects and Republican are for big, top-down highway projects. ""No one is willing to support small, bottom-up projects.""\The suburbs as Ponzi schemes\While suburbs dominated land use in the second half of the 20th century, Marohn says, they still don't produce as much tax revenue per unit as the old, often rundown cities that were abandoned in their wake. And since there are few ways to intensify land use in traditional suburbs, the only way they can add revenue is to continue to sprawl: that is, find new taxpayers to cover costs, Marohn argues, similar to how the operators of a Ponzi scheme must always find new suckers to pay off earlier investors. In both cases, Marohn says, the supply of new money eventually runs out.\""Minnesota has 854 small cities, and half are wards of the state,"" he said. ""They don't have enough money to maintain what they have.""\But if not suburbs, what then? For Marohn and Strong Towns, the answer is, again, all about economics. Helping cities become more successful is vital, he said, not just to make them great places to live but to increase their potential for creating wealth.\What does that look like? Probably a lot like the towns that were built before the postwar suburban boom, Marohn says -- places that began small and adapted to changing economics and population, growing taller and denser and, often, more wealthy.\It's a realization that followed from that first epiphany in Remer, Marohn says, one of many he expects to have over the coming years.\""A year without two or three epiphanies isn't well spent,"" he said. ""I hope to have a lot more because I still haven't figured it out.""\Credit: Peter Callaghan"
278,"Tim Walz was an enlisted soldier in the Minnesota National Guard in 1999 and defensive coordinator of the Mankato West High School football team. A student at the school, where Walz taught geography, wanted to start a gay-straight alliance.\This was three years after the president, a Democrat, signed a law forbidding same-sex marriage. Soldiers suspected of being gay in Walz's own unit could be discharged from the military. But Walz, now Minnesota's Democratic candidate for governor, had seen the bullying some students endured and agreed to be the group's faculty adviser.\""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married,"" Walz said. In other words, he would be a symbol that disparate worlds could coexist peacefully.\A southern Minnesota congressman, Walz, 54, has won six elections in a mostly rural, conservative-leaning area. The theme of his campaign -- ""One Minnesota"" -- reflects a politician who firmly believes he can straddle entrenched political divisions. Growing up in a small Nebraska town, steeped in the Catholic social justice traditions of his parents and expectations of service to country, Walz said he saw firsthand how government can help families.\""I never went to the Democrats. They came to me,"" Walz said, mentioning the GI Bill that funded college educations for him and his father, and the Social Security survivor benefits his mother lived on when his dad died young.\""There's a collective good,"" Walz said. ""We all benefit from programs like that.""\Walz is a college graduate who passed up the officer corps for enlisted life. He revels in a Norman Rockwell family life, beaming as he watched his daughter play soccer at Mankato West's ""Senior Night"" in September. But in an interview, he talked about his own ""white privilege,"" echoing a term young progressives use to discuss race relations. He's a veteran who stands ramrod straight and hand over heart during the national anthem, and a man whose political career was born after he was blocked from entering a political rally for former President George W. Bush.\Walz, facing Republican Jeff Johnson for governor, said his experience crossing cultural and political fault lines positions him to rise above the partisanship that has stunted progress at the State Capitol. He hopes to forge unlikely coalitions to boost spending on schools, improve the health care system and accelerate repairs to the state's aging transportation system.\While Walz sells himself as a uniter, critics see an opportunist.\""Walz has campaigned for years in southern Minnesota as a moderate, but during this campaign for governor, he has abandoned any hint of moderation,"" said Gina Countryman, executive director of Minnesota Action Network, a Republican fundraising group trying to stop Walz. ""He's run to the left on spending promises, tax increases, environment, mining and immigration issues, and Minnesotans are left to wonder where he stands on anything. If you ask him, he's apt to ask where you're from before answering you.""\As a congressman, Walz has been hard to categorize. He voted for the Affordable Care Act and a failed cap-and-trade system that aimed to reduce emissions, but against bailing out the nation's banks and auto companies that many Democrats supported. He voted for tighter vetting of refugees into the U.S., then as candidate for governor said he regretted it. He once earned an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association and its endorsement as recently as 2012, but now denounces the group.\""In my core values of equity, and in freedom, those remain the same. But a rigidness in all situations? That's weak leadership,"" Walz said. He added: ""If you can't change your mind you're never going to change anything.""\•••\Change and disruption are a theme in the life of Timothy James Walz, born in 1964 in West Point, Neb., to a stay-at-home mom and a school administrator. In the summers between school years, they farmed.\Driving in rural southwestern Minnesota recently, Walz spotted two turkeys bounding on the side of the road. ""Big ones,"" he said, recalling how he and friends would bring their guns to school so they could hunt after football practice.\At 17, Walz joined the National Guard. ""The path seemed like it was supposed to be kind of set,"" he said.\Then, when Walz was 19, his father died. Feeling life had been ""ripped up,"" Walz meandered from Nebraska to Houston to Jonesboro, Ark., where he worked in a factory building tanning beds. He returned to Nebraska and earned a teaching degree at Chadron State College.\His father's death and the years that followed led him to live life with some risk, Walz said. Soon after graduating college, he was bound for China. It was just his second trip on an airplane, following his journey at 17 to Fort Benning, Ga., for basic training.\Through a Harvard program, Walz taught high school for a year, one of the first government sanctioned educators in the country. It was 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre. He still speaks a little Mandarin.\Back home and working full-time for the Nebraska National Guard, Walz was also teaching and coaching about an hour away from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. There he met Gwen Whipple, a fellow teacher and a Minnesota native. On their first date (to the only movie theater in town, then Hardee's), she refused a kiss. He said they'd be married someday. Their honeymoon was a trip to China with 60 kids in tow.\After fertility treatments at the Mayo Clinic, the Walzes had a daughter, Hope, in 2001. Gus arrived in 2006, three weeks before Walz was elected to Congress.\•••\In the fall of 1995, Tim Walz, then 31, was pulled over for going 96 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone. He said he'd been watching college football with pals. Walz failed a sobriety test and a breath test and later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.\""You have obligations to people,"" Gwen Walz said she told her husband. ""You can't make dumb choices.""\It was a gut-check moment, Walz said, an impetus to change his risk-taking ways. He no longer drinks alcohol; today his beverage of choice is a seemingly bottomless can of Diet Mountain Dew. At times, it seems to fuel Walz's dizzying conversational style, as he moves from education policy to football, words tumbling out like coins from a slot machine.\The Walzes ended up in Minnesota after Gwen Walz, who grew up in the Lincoln County town of Ivanhoe, decided she wanted to move home. They both got jobs at Mankato West and found a house within walking distance.\Settled into a life of teaching and coaching, Walz led the football team's defense, culminating in a state championship. And he was helping gay and lesbian students deal with bullying.\""There was no mandate to do this,"" said Jacob Reitan, a Mankato West student at the time who is now a Minneapolis attorney. ""It was one teacher saying I know kids are suffering in the silent closet of fear and misunderstanding. What an important moment that was for me.""\Walz retired from the National Guard after 24 years; in 2003 he served with his Guard battalion in Italy in support of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\Three years later, the second President Bush was running for re-election, and Walz tried to bring a group of students to a Bush rally in Mankato. The goal, he said, was to show them politics up close. But one student was carrying promotional materials for Democratic challenger John Kerry, and the group was barred.\""It just seemed so wrong that there would be a gatekeeper, especially stopping young people from seeing the president in their hometown,"" Walz said. He signed up to volunteer for Kerry.\•••\The 2006 midterm election saw Democrats elected in huge numbers nationwide, driven in part by the unpopularity of the war in Iraq. Initially viewed as a long shot, first-time candidate Walz went on to unseat Gil Gutknecht, a 12-year Republican incumbent.\The highest-ranking enlisted military member in the history of Congress, Walz took up veterans' issues when he got to Washington. Former Rep. Chet Edwards, a Democrat from a similarly conservative-leaning Texas district, said Walz paid attention to overlooked problems of military life, such as day care on military bases, mental health and suicide among soldiers and veterans, and pain management.\""He didn't take credit. His name wasn't out front,"" Edwards said. ""But as one member of Congress, I can attest to his impact.""\Walz held the seat through five more elections, including two in which Republicans made big congressional gains around the country, especially in rural districts. In 2016, Walz was narrowly re-elected even as President Donald Trump won his district by more than 15 points.\In 2011, Walz invited Julie Rosen, a longtime Republican state senator from southern Minnesota, to be his guest at the State of the Union. ""I hope the amiability, respect, and dedication that Congressman Walz and I share will continue in the future,"" she said in a news release at the time.\Many Republicans saw Rosen as well-positioned to challenge Walz and win, but she never ran against him. Rosen now said she suspects Walz wanted to give her an up-close look at the difficulties of life in Washington.\•••\""Pull!"" Walz growled at a recent stop to shoot sporting clays at Caribou Gun Club and Hunting Preserve in Le Sueur, as he aimed his Beretta A400 12-gauge skyward. Commended for marksmanship in his military years, Walz used to visit the club twice a month.\The raw state and national debate over guns is one Walz said he's well-positioned to mediate. He said he can unite ""responsible"" gun owners with gun control activists behind legislation like red flag laws -- letting law enforcement take guns from someone determined mentally unstable by a judge.\His shift angered many gun activists in Minnesota. Bryan Strawser, chairman of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, said his group is impatient with elected officials who retreat from gun rights, and that Walz would pay dearly at the ballot box.\Despite losing the party endorsement at the DFL convention, Walz won the DFL primary. He has continued to court Democratic constituencies. Always capable of a fiery stemwinder, at a recent carpenters' union meeting he castigated Johnson's support for a right-to-work law.\""With us, that bill won't come to our desk. But if it does, we'll tear it up!"" Walz said to thunderous applause.\At a recent debate, Johnson ticked off his case against Walz.\""I believe Minnesotans and Minnesota businesses are overtaxed, and Tim Walz believes we are undertaxed,"" Johnson said. ""I believe that you should have more control over your health care. And Tim has said we need to move to a single-payer system. I believe we should cooperate with the federal government when it comes to illegal immigration enforcement. Tim believes we should become a sanctuary state.""\Walz said he thinks the state can afford a more active government but would consider raising taxes on upper incomes. He's said he'd sign a gas tax increase to pay for transportation improvements. He defends sanctuary policies by arguing that state and local law enforcement should focus on state and local issues, not immigration. And he said ""Medicare for All"" -- as Democrats call their plan to expand government health insurance -- is a federal, not a state priority. But he does agree with it.\Joseph Eustice, a fellow command sergeant major who lives in Ortonville, served under Walz in the Guard. He said he's been voting mostly Republican these past few years but has faith in Walz.\""I don't always agree with Tim. I've disagreed with him about politics and other things,"" Eustice said. ""But if you get a chance to talk to him, you'll have an exchange of ideas, and at the end, he'll either convince you, or he'll understand your viewpoint. And I think then he'll make a decision that he thinks is in the interest of everyone.""\J.

279,"See microfilm for some charts.\Though charged with enforcing significantly more fish, wildlife, recreation and environmental laws than ever before, Department of Natural Resources conservation officers since 1991 have issued a declining number of citations to Minnesota outdoor enthusiasts.\From 1991 to 1994 - the last year for which complete data is available - total citations fell 28.2 percent.\Low morale, limits on miles officers can drive their patrol vehicles, a rift between field officers and enforcement division director Leo Haseman and a contentious relationship with Gov. Arne Carlson's administration are among reasons cited by some officers for the declining apprehension rates.\Hunting and fishing license sales remained fairly constant during the period, but citations and warnings given to hunters and anglers by DNR officers fell 32.6 percent from 1991 to 1994.\This calls into question whether Minnesota fish and wildlife are being protected as demands to enforce environmental and recreation laws escalate dramatically, taking more of the officers' time.\In 1987, 63.1 percent of citations and warnings given by the DNR were for fish and game violations; by 1994, that percentage dropped to 47.5 percent.\""When the enforcement division has to write what was essentially an unfunded check this past winter to crack down on snowmobilers due to a public outcry, we're concerned,"" said Gary Botzek, executive director of the St. Paul-based Fish and Wildlife Legislative Alliance, a consortium of outdoor groups.\Botzek said his members worry that officers are being asked to perform non-traditional duties - such as feedlot oversight and snowmobile enforcement - paid for by hunters and anglers.\""You know who's paying for a portion of snowmobile enforcement?"" said Tony Cornish of Northome, president of the officers' union. ""Hunters and fishermen.""\The findings of declining apprehension rates are part of a Star Tribune computer-assisted analysis of DNR enforcement activity from 1985-1996.\The apprehension rates are particularly important this spring, when more than a third of the state's approximately 140 DNR field officers might be assigned to enforce Indian treaty-rights harvests in east-central Minnesota.\The transfer of so many officers could further reduce their ability to enforce fish and wildlife laws in their home regions - a rub among law-abiding hunters and anglers who pay for about 65 percent of the DNR enforcement division's budget through license fees.\Additionally, the enforcement division might be asked to increase snowmobile-law enforcement next winter in light of the near-record number of snowmobile-related fatalities this year and last. Laws and regulations governing all-terrain vehicles and personal watercraft also have multiplied in recent years.\Yet the DNR plans to hire no additional field officers to supplant an enforcement corps that has stayed nearly constant in number since the 1940s.\In fact, the Carlson administration has proposed to cut $500,000 of the officers' overtime, perhaps further reducing their ability - and incentive - to enforce fish, wildlife and recreation laws. The money would instead be used to fund new supervisors and support staff for the officers.\Haseman agrees morale among some officers is a problem, and might result in fewer citations being issued.\""But there are other reasons,"" Haseman said. ""The weather was bad in one of those years, resulting in fewer people fishing. Also, there was a period when the minimum ticket officers could write cost $265, and for that reason officers cut back. And some officers are spending less time writing tickets because they're spending more time working with the public, trying to get voluntary compliance.""\Haseman also said that fish and wildlife benefit from activities such as feedlot enforcement.\Not all officers' citation rates are down. Many, in fact, enjoy their work, and most relish the relative freedom the job offers. Some even enjoy their newfound responsibilities. ""If all I did was check hunters and fishermen I'd be bored,"" said conservation officer Joe Frear of Waseca.\But no one in the DNR enforcement division denies that a deeply troubled relationship exists between many officers and Haseman and other DNR leaders, including commissioner Rod Sando. Fearing reprisals, in fact, some officers would speak to the newspaper only on condition of anonymity.\Most officers who were contacted, however, agreed with Cornish that the decline in citation rates is tied to morale problems. ""There are more users of the outdoors now than ever, from cross-country skiers to bikers, to boaters - everything,"" Cornish said. ""So it has to be morale. There's absolutely no other reason for arrest activity to go down.""\Officers stretched thin\Haseman says his workforce is stretched too thin, and his staff has had to reprioritize officers' duties, in some cases forgoing traditional fish and wildlife protection activities.\""Some years ago, we looked at the effort we were putting into catching deer shiners {poachers}, for example, and we decided to cut back there,"" Haseman said. ""We're doing similar things in other areas, trying to make officers more efficient.""\Bill Spence, who oversees field operations, said his division's recently completed ""2001"" study recognizes that additional field officers probably won't be hired - given the Legislature's historical reluctance to do so. But the study calls for adding more area supervisors, as well as computer-support experts for field officers.\""We haven't provided as much support to the officers as we would like,"" said Spence. ""We think these additions would make their jobs easier, and the officers more efficient.""\In the budget it sent to the Legislature, the Carlson administration declined to fund the new positions. Instead, the DNR was told to pay for them by cutting about a third of the approximately $1.6 million spent annually on conservation officers' overtime.\Cornish, the officers' union president, said his members are livid at the proposal, and are lobbying in the Legislature to defeat it. ""There are already seven or eight officer stations unfilled, and there might be 20 open positions by year's end,"" Cornish said. ""Even if we were at a full complement of officers, we would have too much to do. It's that much harder when stations go unfilled. Yet what do they propose? To add more supervisors.""\Bad blood between the officers and the governor dates back to 1992, Cornish said, when the state's contracts with DNR conservation officers, as well as those with State Patrol troopers and Bureau of Criminal Apprension agents, were arbitrated in favor of the officers. A legislative commission failed to ratify the arbitration, for which the officers in part blame Carlson.\Said one officer: ""As {the newspaper's} data show, there was an increase in {DNR} citations issued in 1991. I'll tell you why: Our contract expired in June of that year, but we hadn't yet gotten the shaft by the state and Gov. Carlson. Then in December 1991, the negotiations went to arbitration.\""We won the arbitration. But Carlson came into office, and it was under his watch that our relationship with the state began to deteriorate. He could have supported the arbitration decision, and he didn't. Things have been going downhill ever since.""\Funds are short\The enforcement division is primarily funded by hunting- and fishing-license sales (about 65 percent); the general fund (20 percent); and boat, snowmobile and all-terrain-vehicle registrations and fines, and a gas tax (about 10 percent).\Shortfalls from these sources, and retirements, have left unfilled about eight field officer positions and about six enforcement division management and support jobs in the 1990s. Funding shortages also have limited field officers to driving their patrol vehicles about 19,000 miles a year.\""Some days I don't leave the house,"" one officer said. ""I know I'm going to get calls from the public, and I've got to be in a position to tell them, `Yes, I'll be right there.' That's why we bank our mileage. We don't want to pick up the phone and tell someone, `No, I can't go catch a deer poacher because I'm out of mileage.' ""\Leaders of some state conservation groups say that fish and wildife might be imperiled by constraints placed on the officers.\""I'm 78 years old, fish 100 days a year, and have never been checked on the water by a Minnesota conservation officer,"" said Frank Schneider, past president of the Minnesota Sportfishing Congress. ""Without proper enforcement - and I don't think fisheries is getting its fair share - the resource will suffer.""\Some enforcement division managers say they, too, are severely shortstaffed - which in part, they say, contributes to the rift between Haseman and the officers.\""Leo {Haseman} needs support to run the division the way it should be run,"" one manager said. ""But when the administration came back and said we should fund the new supervisor positions out of officers' overtime, that was like cutting Leo's throat.""\The Legislature in recent sessions has significantly upgraded the division's vehicles, computers and some other equipment, officers say. And field officers' pay - about $41,000 annually after 10 years - coupled with the approximately $8,000 field officers at top scale earn in overtime, is generally acceptable to the officers.\But other equipment, including snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and personal watercraft, is sorely lacking, officers say. Improvements aren't likely this legislative session: Carlson, in his supplemental budget, asked for $200,000 to pay for walkie-talkie helmets, radar guns and alchohol-consumption-testing equipment - all for snowmobile enforcement. But no money was sought to purchase or lease more snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles or personal watercraft.\Sen. Steve Morse, DFL-Dakota, chairman of the Senate Environment and Agriculture budget division, said the Legislature might side with enforcement managers this session and remove field officers' annual ""guarantees"" of 400 hours of overtime - a move the officers strongly oppose.\Haseman, Spence and DNR deputy commissioner Ron Nargang have told Cornish they would support a continuation of the overtime in the Legislature if the officers' union would agree the overtime could be pooled so supervisors could distribute it as they wished.\Such an overtime ""bank,"" the managers say, would, for example, allow them to shift officers more readily to the Mille Lacs region if treaty-rights conflicts arise this spring.\In return for their support on overtime - albeit banked overtime - Haseman, Spence and Nargang wanted the union to back the addition of four field supervisors and a new enforcement division manager.\""We're trying to make this outfit better - we will make it better - and we believe this would make it better for everyone,"" Spence said. ""We feel if we could get these fixes, we could build our division into one that others would want to emulate.""\The officers' union rejected the offer.\Cornish said more supervisors won't improve officer morale - or increase the number of citations officers issue.\""We don't think we need more supervision,"" Cornish said. ""We think we need more quality supervision."" Data analysis for this story was done by Bill Loving, computer-assisted reporting editor.\Number of conservation officers vs. workload\Conservation officers' responsibilities have increased significantly in recent years, but the number of officer stations in Minnesota has stayed fairly constant since 1940. Traditionally, conservation officers - ""game wardens"" as they once were called - enforced only hunting and fishing laws. But today's conservation officer also is responsible for firearms safety training, snowmobile enforcement and training and enforcement of state trail and off-road vehicle laws. Additionally, conservation officers must enforce laws governing livestock feedlots in Minnesota. While most officers enjoy the variety, many believe their ranks are stretched too thin.\Early 1980s Recreational vehicle alcohol enforcement begins.\ATV enforcement.\Trail enforcement increased.\Environmental enforcement begins. 1992 148# field officer stations.\Civil citations added.\Hunting while intoxicated added.\Environmental enforcement increase. 1996 148# field officer stations.\# Because of funding shortages and retirements actual number is 140.\A drop in DNR enforcement\After a steady rise in enforcement levels in the late 1980s and early 1990s, arrests by DNR conservation officers have declined during the past five years. From 1991 to 1994, the last year with complete data, arrests dropped more than 28%. When written warnings are included in the total, there has still been a decline in enforcement activity since the peak year of 1991. This dropoff in enforcement comes despite the fact that Minnesotans' use of natural resources has been growing, and the number of conservation officers is up slightly since the 1980s.\Total arrests by year\(See microfilm for chart.)\Less attention to fish and game\Fish and game\While fees from fishing and hunting licenses provide about 65 percent of the DNR's enforcement budget, those popular outdoor activities are getting less attention from DNR conservation officers. The number of arrests and warnings handed out for fish and game violations have been steadily declining since 1991, as has their percentage of overall enforcement activity.\(See microfilm for chart.)\Boat, snowmobile and ATV\On the other hand, arrests and warnings handed out to boaters, snowmobilers and other recreational vehicle operators has grown sharply over the same priod as the DNR has stepped upenforcement in these areas.\(See microfilm for chart.)\Source: Star Tribune analysis of Department of Natural Resources enforcement data.\Most common outdoors violations\Among people who have been arrested, ticketed or given a written warning by DNR conservation officers since 1985, here are the most common activities they were undertaking and the most common violations that were cited.\Activities\Forest resources 1.8.\By violation"
280,"See microfilm for chart.\This is not the way they wanted the Twin Cities area to turn out.\When metropolitan-area planners in 1971 looked ahead to 2000, they proposed big, compact clusters of stores, offices, theaters, high- rise housing and research centers. The clusters, they said, could be linked by high-speed transit.\The idea was to encourage high-density centers to organize growth, retard sprawl and head off congestion, pollution and exorbitant public spending on sewers, highways and public services.\But with 2000 upon us, the low-density development that planners hoped to avoid has spread across much of the seven-county area - and beyond. And they say rush-hour freeway congestion will only grow worse.\Today's fallback position is not a regionwide network of ""major diversified centers"" but much more limited high-density alternatives to auto-induced sprawl. Examples include the neighborhoods being planned around proposed light-rail stations along Hiawatha Av. in south Minneapolis.\A vestige of yesteryear's vision survives in the ""smart growth"" buzz phrase championed by Gov. Jesse Ventura and Metropolitan Council Chairman Ted Mondale. That's shorthand for clusters of mixed development that planners hope will reduce overall travel and boost transit ridership.\Under the smart growth banner, the governor and Met Council are backing the proposed 12-mile Hiawatha rail line, which has received state funds but needs crucial approval this year by the Federal Transit Administration.\Even supporters of the Hiawatha line say rail transit has no chance to end congestion or reshape metrowide growth. At best, they say, rail might trigger denser development around stations, providing a lifestyle choice for those who don't want to fight traffic.\To some critics, however, even providing choices raises fears of steering people reluctantly into denser living conditions.\Mondale tried to allay such concerns last year: ""This is a free country, and no one can tell you where or how to live, or whether you should take a car, bus, train or bicycle to work."" Instead, the council wants to ""lead the way towards building a region that offers all its residents choices and opportunities"" for working and living, he said.\Unforeseen forces\James Hetland, the first chairman of the Met Council in the late 1960s and early '70s, oversaw the agency's first attempts to control sprawl. Looking back, he cites several forces that blunted those efforts:\- Developers. The council had counted on controlling extension of major sewer lines to shape development clusters that transit could serve, he said. But while the appointed council had some leverage with local governments, he said it had ""no authority to control the critical element, the subdivision developers.""\Some builders, seeking cheaper, outlying land, built houses using septic systems instead of sewers. The resulting neighborhoods led to schools, stores and other suburban trappings that prompted construction of temporary sewage treatment plants, bypassing the sewer lines.\The council did identify a growth boundary to frame what it called the metropolitan urban service area (MUSA), hoping to keep development from accelerating into expensive sprawl.\But Hetland, referring to the famously ineffective French defense barrier against invasions, said that ""the MUSA line, like the Maginot line, collapsed.""\- Lack of consensus. Neither a rail system nor exclusive busways got built because of a lack of political consensus. The agency that ran the public bus system and promoted other forms of transit was not under the Met Council's control until mid-1994, and Hetland said it ""in many ways was an adversary"" by advocating rail while the council backed exclusive busways.\- Working parents. The unforeseen trend toward two working parents in many households complicated the area's spaghetti-like web of travel patterns, he said. Scattered trips for work, recreation and child care cut into the critical mass of trips needed for efficient transit routes.\Narrower focus\Thirty years after planners thought that controlling sewers and highways would contain sprawl, they now talk of using more precise tools such as zoning and tax incentives to boost density in prescribed zones.\Curt Johnson, chairman of the Met Council under former Gov. Arne Carlson, said he will be ""deeply disappointed . . . if the city of Minneapolis does not do what Washington, D.C., and the Virginia and Maryland suburbs have done - change land-use policy to permit high- density development [around transit stations]. The Hiawatha corridor sits there as a yawning invitation to do this stuff.""\Planners already have organized neighborhood discussions about how to redevelop areas around light-rail stations.\Such efforts reflect planners' recognition that clustering of households and jobs around stations is not automatic. Take this example from Twin Cities-area history:\As early as the 1890s, the extension of streetcar lines to St. Louis Park, Robbinsdale and Hopkins opened up undeveloped areas, discouraging concentrations of ""tenements and large flats with concentrated masses of population,"" said Stephen A. Kieffer in ""Transit and the Twins,"" his 1958 historical account of transit growth.\""In this way, the Twin Cities became known as cities of homes, with very high percentages of self-owned dwellings"" instead of neighborhoods dominated by high-rise apartments.\In other words, rail transit helped spread growth into what would become first-ring suburbs instead of focusing it on the core cities.\The result was a transit boom. In the early 1920s, before the full impact of the car and decades before the first freeway, Twin Cities streetcars carried 220 million passengers on about 530 miles of rails. At the time, the area's population was about 800,000.\The auto's popularity led to a slow decline in transit ridership, but gas rationing during World War II sparked a rebound to 201 million by 1946, when the area's population exceeded 1 million.\By paltry comparison, Metro Transit last year celebrated a fourth consecutive bus ridership increase to 71.9 million in a metro area that now exceeds 2.5 million people and has 2,653 miles of routes.\Peak ridership in the all-bus era was 93.7 million in 1979.\Experts say that the convenience, status and privacy of the car gave those who could afford it less reason to ride public transit. And the gas tax, starting in 1925, assured growing revenue to build freeways.\The resulting mobility helped make spread-out development on less expensive suburban land convenient and affordable for many residents. By 1990, the Twin Cities area ranked 24th among the 25 largest metro areas in housing units per square mile - 799 compared with 2,167 in the No. 1 Miami-Hialeah metro area in Florida.\And the Minneapolis-St. Paul area ranked 23rd in population density, with 1,956 people per square mile, compared with 5,801 in No. 1 Los Angeles-Anaheim in Southern California, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau's definition of the metro area includes nine Minnesota counties and two in Wisconsin. The Met Council's jurisdiction includes only the seven Minnesota counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington.\Robert Einsweiler, a former key planner for the Met Council, said excess capacity on Twin Cities freeways delayed serious attention to transit: ""People could not envision a day when things would get all choked up. . . . There was virtually no congestion at a time when we were trying to make a [transit] decision based on that.""\What transit can't do\The increasing prospect of severe congestion and the Met Council's projection of 3 million people in the metro area by 2020 helped Johnson, the former chairman, change his mind about rail transit and endorse the Hiawatha project.\Since his about-face in early 1998, front-page attention to rail has reinforced his view that trains can energize people and politicians to debate transit in ways that buses can't.\Even so, he and the Met Council still say busways should dominate the Twin Cities area's transit system by 2020. That's because ""if you tried to make a whole system of light rail, it probably would cost more money than people are willing to pay,"" he said.\For all his passion about transit, however, Johnson is not sanguine about its ability to contain sprawl.\""I'm not sure . . . how much realistic chance we have of enforcing anything like an urban growth boundary,"" he said. ""I'm redefining sprawl as overrunning things you don't want to see developed and [the spread of] homogenous places.""\By drawing protective rings around valuable resources - scenic open space, water, forests and the best farmland - public and private agencies can lend character to nearby developments, he said.\What's next?\Looking ahead, prospects for higher density in housing and mixed land use could be increased by the aging of baby boomers, said Peter Calthorpe, a Met Council land-use consultant.\Golden Valley and St. Louis Park, which scrambled to provide basic services to new households in the late 1940s and early '50s, now are trying to develop cohesive city centers and housing appropriate for their many aging, empty-nester residents. Richfield is redeveloping in hopes of attracting younger residents and tax-generating businesses.\""We're a completely different world demographically,"" said Calthorpe, who favors compact neighborhoods that encourage walking and transit that efficiently takes people from doorstep to doorstep.\Even efficient transit, however, won't solve congestion, he said. ""The point of transit is not to create free-flowing freeways but to give people choices - to save money, to save the environment.""\Calthorpe and his associates have led workshops in Washington County and south Minneapolis to ""find out what's sacred"" to residents, business owners and local officials. His firm will suggest ways of incorporating their ideas into redeveloped areas around Minneapolis transit stations and in communities near the planned bridge over the St. Croix River near Stillwater.\Another alternative to auto travel, said Hetland, the first Met Council chairman, might be the ability of computers to let people work at home. Even more helpful, he said, would be to eliminate local governments' dependence on the property tax. That would reduce pressure to recruit tax-generating development.\Even so, if population and households grow as projected, people and their buildings will have to go somewhere. While Ventura and legislators are proposing more spending to unclog freeway bottlenecks, many officials say it won't be enough to keep up.\If they're right and congestion worsens, pressure could resume to constrain outlying growth, encourage clustering and boost transit use.\During a well-publicized bus ride last year to promote transit, Ventura predicted car users eventually would switch ""when they're sitting dead in traffic.""\Mondale, meanwhile, said that tax breaks and other incentives for developers could help jump-start the kind of clustering around light- rail stations that Met Council planners envisioned in the early '70s.\But there's a difference: Yesterday's vision was a grand, ordered plan of things to come. Today's strategy is to offer transit as a limited option and small-scale clustered development as a defensive choice of last resort.\- Staff librarian Sandy Date contributed to this report.\Decades bring changes in how Twin Citians get around\From horses to autos, streetcars to steamboats, rail lines to freeways, a variety of transportation has abetted the Twin Cities area's outward push to handle increased population and business. Planners are trying to encourage more dense housing, offices and stores around proposed light-rail stations in Minneapolis as an alternative to low-density sprawl in other parts of the seven-county area.\1885: When a horsecar came upon a steep hill, an extra team was stationed at the bottom to aid the other team in the upward climb. Muddy streets that often mired horsecars led city officials to consider paving streets.\By 1953, buses and streetcars were a familiar sight, having shared the streets for three decades. On the last day of streetcar service, June 18, 1954, a luncheon of chicken and shrimp salad, apple pie and coffee was served to the 320 last riders.\The demise of streetcars was followed by the rise of freeways and ramp meters, such as this one in Richfield.

281,"
Throughout the 2012 campaign, Gov. Mark Dayton promised Minnesota voters he would end the gridlock in St. Paul and put the state on a path to fiscal stability and job growth if they would just give him Democratic-Farmer-Labor majorities in the House and Senate.
\
""It's gridlock versus progress,"" Dayton said of the choice between a Legislature controlled by Republicans, as it was during his first two years as governor, or one run by his fellow DFLers.
\
Voters granted his wish. DFLers will control both houses when the 2013 Legislature convenes Tuesday, Jan. 8, marking the first session with undivided Democratic control of state government since 1990.
\
They will be under pressure to keep promises many of them made to overhaul taxes, create more good jobs and improve Minnesota's schools.
\
They also created voter expectations that they would ""get things done."" Many campaigned on a pledge to end the bickering at the Capitol and work together to fix the state's problems.
\
Their first task will be to plug a projected $1.1 billion hole in the next two-year budget. That won't be easy. But after making spending reductions to close a $5 billion budget gap in 2011, lawmakers will be harder pressed to find fat to trim.
\
In addition, they will try to start repaying the remaining $1.1 billion the state borrowed from schools to balance previous budgets, while pumping even more money into education and holding down property taxes.
\
They also face a pent-up demand from interest groups for more spending on health care, roads and bridges, trains and buses, and government building projects. Other organizations will push for legalizing same-sex marriage and implementing stricter gun-control laws.
\
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, warned those groups to ""restrain themselves."" Legislators, he said, must balance the budget before they look at new spending requests or delve into social issues.
\
Here's a look at some of the issues facing the Legislature:
\
TAXES
\
Dayton and DFL legislative leaders say Minnesota's tax system is broken, and they hope to fix it with what could be the biggest overhaul in decades.
\
The governor says he plans to propose changes to make the tax system simpler and fairer, encourage economic growth and provide stabler revenue sources in order to get state government off the roller coaster that has resulted in eight budget deficits in the past 12 years.
\
The new leaders of the House and Senate DFL majorities share his goal, but they acknowledge it won't be easy. Tax changes produce winners and losers, and potential losers will fight plans that increase their taxes.
\
While he hasn't released details, Dayton has said he wants to provide property tax relief, lower a corporate income tax rate that is the third-highest in the nation and reduce the sales tax rate.
\
He could do that by eliminating some corporate and individual income tax breaks, broadening the sales tax base to include more consumer services and keeping a 2010 campaign promise to increase income taxes for the highest-earning 2 percent of taxpayers. He also wants to require Internet retailers to collect state sales taxes, eliminating their advantage over in-state retailers that currently collect those taxes.
\
Republican leaders have warned that the DFL proposals will mean tax increases. As the state continues to slowly emerge from the Great Recession, ""this is not the time to raise taxes,"" said incoming House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown.
\
EDUCATION
\
Advocates for Minnesota's littlest minds and adult learners are lining up for more money as well.
\
Debate on overhauling Minnesota's tax system will be paired with discussions about changing how schools are funded so it's simpler and more balanced for schools around the state.
\
A working group has a plan that would cost the state an extra $634 million a year -- a 7 percent increase in funding for preschools through high schools. Supporters say it can be phased in over four to six years.
\
And advocates for early-childhood education want $150 million more a year to help disadvantaged preschoolers.
\
Business leaders will focus on performance goals for the state's two higher-education systems to make sure they're better aligned with the state's K-12 system, more affordable and producing graduates with the skills needed to compete in a global economy.
\
Minnesota State Colleges and Universities are asking for $97 million more over two years, with promises to cut administration costs and cap tuition increases at 3 percent. The University of Minnesota wants an additional $91.6 million over the biennium, tying the increase to an undergraduate tuition freeze and setting performance goals for some funding.
\
GUN CONTROL
\
After a mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school that killed 26 people, expect legislators to take a closer look at gun laws.
\
The incoming heads of the House and Senate public safety panels have said an examination of tightening gun codes is only appropriate, whether it is plugging loopholes that allow people to buy firearms at gun shows without background checks or tougher screenings for gun owners.
\
One Republican legislator has also suggested allowing teachers to arm themselves in the classroom. And the National Rifle Association called for every school to have an armed officer or guard. Both proposals are unlikely to gain traction in the DFL-controlled Legislature, given opposition from law enforcement and educators.
\
PUBLIC SAFETY
\
State lawmakers also will need to look at a program for Minnesota's most dangerous sex offenders. A task force last month recommended the Legislature create a network of regional treatment facilities rather than housing all 669 civilly committed sex offenders at the state's high-security treatment center in Moose Lake.
\
Minnesota has yet to treat and fully discharge a sex offender from the program in two decades, leaving it vulnerable to legal challenges like a class-action lawsuit filed by several sex offenders last summer.
\
The program is also expensive, costing about $120,000 per patient -- three times higher than the average prison inmate cost.
\
And expect legislation requiring all state crime labs to be accredited. The move comes months after top prosecutors in three metro counties asked the state to retest evidence in hundreds of drug cases in which the troubled St. Paul crime lab was initially used to process evidence.
\
Experts and crime lab workers testified, starting last summer, about substandard work spanning years at the unaccredited crime lab.
\
St. Paul Police Chief Thomas Smith suspended drug testing and fingerprint analysis at the lab. Minnesota has about 20 unaccredited crime labs.
\
GAY MARRIAGE
\
State Sen. Scott Dibble of Minneapolis will take the lead on a bill to legalize gay marriage, but the incoming leaders of the Senate and House DFL majorities have preached patience on the issue, citing the state budget as first priority and saying Minnesotans need more time for conversation about marriage.
\
Dayton supports legalizing gay marriage but has taken a similar go-slow approach. He says he will renew his push to include benefits for same-sex partners in future state employee contracts.
\
The U.S. Supreme Court recently announced it will hear two gay marriage cases, which could have implications for Minnesota and other states.
\
Despite the go-slow message from DFL leaders, Minnesotans United for All Families, the organization that led the campaign against the defeated marriage amendment to the state constitution in the November election, announced last month that it will push for legal gay marriage. Dibble, who is gay, said they would wait about a month before introducing a bill to allow economic issues to be heard first.
\
ENVIRONMENT
\
""Frac sand mining is going to be huge"" as an environmental issue, Dayton said last month.
\
Southeastern Minnesota is loaded with silica sand, the mineral used in hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock in other parts of the country.
\
Frac sand mining could boost that region's economy, but lawmakers will likely analyze its impact on truck traffic, groundwater and property values. Dayton hopes to propose a package of legislation to deal with those issues.
\
HEALTH CARE
\
With the Legislature expected to focus on balancing the budget, insurers, doctors and hospitals are bracing for cuts in state spending on health and human services.
\
Health care is one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget and has been a target for cuts at the Capitol for several years, said Sen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, who will chair the Senate Health and Human Service Committee.
\
Lourey wants to push back against the trend, saying cuts are getting ""increasingly difficult"" for the health and human services budget to take.
\
The state's largest health program is Medicaid, which is jointly funded by the federal government to cover long-term-care costs and provide health insurance for low-income and disabled Minnesotans.
\
While searching for savings in the health care budget, legislators also will face calls for the state government to do more.
\
Legislators this session will debate whether to expand Minnesota's Medicaid program -- called Medical Assistance -- to thousands more residents. The expansion is made possible by the federal Affordable Care Act, which Congress passed in 2010 to overhaul the nation's health care system.
\
The health law calls for the creation of state-level health insurance exchanges, where individuals and small employers can begin buying coverage in late 2013. The Dayton administration has been developing plans for Minnesota's own exchange -- rather than adopting a federal model -- but the Legislature has yet to pass a bill on the subject.
\
Many lower- and middle-income people will receive federal subsidies to buy coverage on health exchanges. As a result, one question before the Legislature is whether to continue the MinnesotaCare program, which the state created in 1992 to provide access to health insurance to lower-income Minnesotans in jobs that lacked benefits. Some want the state to create a new program called a ""Basic Health Program"" for current MinnesotaCare beneficiaries.
\
BONDING
\
The Legislature traditionally passes relatively modest public works funding bills in odd-numbered ""budget"" years, averaging around $140 million over the last 10 years in such years as this one; and larger bills -- $775 million on average -- in even-numbered ""bonding"" years.
\
But this year, Dayton and at least some legislative leaders want to pass a big construction package, called a bonding bill because it borrows money through the sale of general obligation bonds. The state could borrow up to $1.3 billion under current guidelines, but lawmakers would have to find extra cash to pay the debt service, and no one has yet put a price tag on a proposal.
\
Last year, lawmakers made a $44 million down payment toward restoring the deteriorating state Capitol, and Dayton wants to finish the project, which would cost about $100 million in each of the next two years. He also wants to fund civic center projects in Mankato, Rochester and St. Cloud with about $60 million in state subsidies.
\
House Capital Investment Committee Chair Alice Hausman, DFL-St. Paul, supports those proposals but said the greatest need is to clear up a backlog of ""asset preservation"" projects to repair and maintain facilities the state already has. They include college buildings, parks, trails and wastewater-treatment plants. She also favors expanding transit systems.
\
""We're guaranteed better prices if we do it now,"" Hausman said. The interest rate on the last bonds the state sold was 2.05 percent -- the lowest rate she recalls -- ""and we ought to take advantage of that."" Moreover, she said, a bonding bill would create much-needed construction jobs.
\
DFLers will need Republican help to pass a bonding bill. A 60 percent ""super majority"" is required to increase the state's debt, so the DFL will need at least two GOP votes in the Senate and eight in the House.
\
TRANSPORTATION
\
Last fall, a transportation task force appointed by Dayton called for a 40-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase and increases in other fees to raise at least $50 billion for roads, bridges and transit over the next 20 years.
\
Faced with a budget deficit and committed to overhauling other state taxes, the governor hasn't endorsed those recommendations. But he said the report puts Minnesota's transportation needs on the radar screen.
\
Lawmakers will take a hard look at finding ways to pay for moving us around, predicted Dibble, the new Senate Transportation Finance Committee chair. ""The (task force) made a solid argument that other regions are ahead of us in terms of building economically competitive transit and transportation systems. If we're going to keep up, we have to do something.""
\
In the past, it has taken broad coalitions of urban, suburban and rural lawmakers plus business organizations, labor unions and local elected officials to pass bills providing more transportation revenue. Such a coalition isn't evident yet, but Dibble said support is building.
\
CAMPAIGNS AND ELECTIONS
\
With DFLers controlling both houses, they could ram through changes that give them an edge in future elections. But DFL leaders say that won't happen.
\
Dayton said he will demand broad bipartisan support before he signs any election law changes, and the new leaders with jurisdiction over such laws pledge to abide by his demand.
\
Nonetheless, they have long lists of possible changes to campaign and election statutes.
\
After some voters had to stand in line for three to four hours to cast ballots on Election Day, they will consider ""some form of early voting,"" said Assistant Senate Majority Leader Katie Sieben, DFL-Newport, who chairs that chamber's Elections Division.
\
House Elections Committee Chair Steve Simon, DFL-St. Louis Park, said the options include creating an early voting period or allowing voters to cast absentee ballots ""for any or no reason at all.""
\
Outside interest groups outspent legislative candidates in many districts last fall, and Sieben and Simon both support raising candidates' campaign contribution and spending limits in order to, in Simon's words, ""give them a megaphone that more closely approaches the size of the ones that outside groups have.""
\
They will consider ""electronic poll books"" as an alternative to the Republican-backed photo ID requirement that voters rejected last fall. Poll books could match voters to photos already in the state's driver's license system or take new photos at polling places.
\
Other potential changes include moving primary elections to June, requiring lawmakers to disclose more information about their sources of income to reveal conflicts of interest, allowing online voter registration, enacting new ways to replace candidates on the ballot who die or resign, awarding Minnesota's electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the most popular votes in all 50 states and raising the threshold for putting constitutional amendments on the ballot.
\
PUBLIC PENSIONS
\
The Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA) is expected to ask legislators for changes to the pension fund for police officers and firefighters in order to stabilize the troubled plan. Proposals include contribution increases from employee paychecks and the local governments that they work for, increased penalties for retiring early, reductions in cost-of-living increases for retirees, vesting changes for new hires and a benefits cap for new hires.
\
The Minnesota State Retirement System (MSRS), a pension fund that covers state government employees, plans to ask the Legislature to increase contributions to its judges' pension plan, lower the benefit formula and set lower cost-of-living increases for retirees until the fund's financial picture improves. A proposal for changes to the State Patrol plan is also possible. At its Jan. 17 meeting, the MSRS board of trustees will decide whether to ask the Legislature to increase contributions, raise penalties for early retirement and reduce cost-of-living increases for retirees.
\
UNIONS
\
With labor-friendly DFLers in control, unions are likely to push to allow personal-care attendants, who provide in-home health care, and state-subsidized child care providers to join collective bargaining groups.
\
Megan Boldt, Doug Belden and MaryJo Webster contributed to this report.

282,"THE CLEAN WATER, LAND AND LEGACY AMENDMENT\Lobbyist Brian Rice had a pounding migraine. State Sen. Bob Lessard was royally ticked off.\Minnesota's state Constitution was about to be fiddled with ... again.\This was eight years ago, long before the hunters and anglers, the environmentalists and the artists -- all with their own needs -- group-hugged and ended up giving voters a complex decision to make on Tuesday:\[bullet] Vote ""yes"" to raise the state sales tax by three-eighths of 1 percent to underwrite programs for the outdoors, clean water, parks and the arts for the next 25 years.\[bullet] Or vote ""no,"" because using the Minnesota Constitution for such funding could push this state to an abyss of initiative and referendum, and because, all things considered, taxes are high enough.\A coalition forms\The strange-bedfellows politics of ""The Clean Water, Land and Legacy Amendment,"" can be traced to Rice's headache and Lessard's frustration in 2000.\Its deepest origins, two years earlier, are rooted in Lessard's first constitutional victory.\In 1998, the animated and plain-spoken lawmaker from International Falls led the charge that won overwhelming approval by state voters to include an amendment in Article XIII of the state Constitution. It declared hunting and fishing ""a valued part of our heritage that shall be forever preserved for the people and shall be managed by law and regulation for the public good.""\It was designed to fend off what Lessard and others saw as a growing anti-hunting constituency in the state ... you know, the PETA-types.\It may have been harmless enough, a sort of gun-toting-ice-fishing macho manifesto. But, under the surface, some liberal lawmakers came to believe the amendment drove a voter turnout that aided independent Jesse Ventura in winning the gubernatorial election and caused the DFL to lose control of the House of Representatives.\The turnout among the so-called ""hooks and bullets"" crowd was high because of Lessard's amendment. It mixed with the other ""angry white male"" demographic that voted for Ventura to push the former wrestler into the Capitol's corner office.\The hunting-fishing amendment garnered 75 percent approval.\Pro: A Vote Yes commercial\Two years later in 2000, Lessard was pitching a related amendment to the Minnesota Constitution: take one-eighth percent of existing state sales-tax proceeds and dedicate them to support habitat for the hunters and anglers whose rights were now imbedded in the Constitution.\There was a late-night hearing on his bill. Lobbyist Rice, a longtime advocate for parks in the metro area representing the Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board, was there attempting to monitor the session.\But he was battling his pulverizing headache. A friend of Lessard, Rice escaped to the senator's long, leather office couch in the north wing of the Capitol to lie down and wait for the aspirin to kick in.\Soon, Lessard broke the dark silence, storming into his office after another defeat in committee of efforts to dedicate the tax slice to the outdoors gang. That committee was balanced between Greater Minnesota conservatives and Twin Cities-area liberals.\""Lessard comes in cussing and swearing,"" Rice remembers.\""$%&-ing, $*#-ing liberals!"" Lessard ranted. ""... damn it, I can't get my $%#-ing bill out of this $#*#-ing committee.""\""Well, Bob,"" Rice said, his head pounding, but his lobbyist ingenuity kicking in, ""I can get this bill out of committee.""\""What? What do you mean?"" Lessard barked.\""Bob, you got nothing in here for the metro liberals,"" Rice said.\Lessard had modeled his outdoors amendment after a similar law passed in Missouri in 1976. But Rice told Lessard that another amendment passed soon after in the Show Me State; it was one to fund parks and soil and water conservation.\""So, I'm on the couch and I say, 'Lessard, I'll tell you what, if you put us in the bill, we'll get this thing going.""\Parks, zoos and trails were added to a bill to use the state sales tax. A path was paved that leads to today. Strangers were about to spoon together on the lumpy mattress of politics. Pragmatism trumped cultural and political differences.\Con: A No Constitutional Tax Increase commercial\Soon, environmentalists, who had been seeking more funding for their causes, joined forces with the likes of Ducks Unlimited. Upon Lessard's retirement from the Senate, DFLer Dallas Sams of Staples led the charge, with clean-water funding added to the evolving package.\""That energized the bill,"" said Rice. And the potential new tax hiked up to 5/16ths of a percent, with the outdoors, clean water and parks sharing the potential pot of cash.\Still, DFLers were among its harshest critics. Dedicated taxes, they said, are no good. They tie the hands of lawmakers when global funding decisions are made; a tax that's dedicated can't be undone and its funds can't be moved around for immediate needs in times of financial stress ... like right now.\And the no-new-taxes constituency on the Republican side was growing.\Enter Gov. Tim Pawlenty in 2002. No increased sales tax was going to get past his desk, and certainly not as the state faced a massive deficit.\New allies\The outdoors/environmental amendment languished until later, in 2004, when in a stroke of genius, arts and cultural groups, led by longtime arts lobbyist Larry Redmond, hitched their wagon to the journey. For years, under Ventura and Pawlenty, the State Arts Board's budget had gotten whacked big time.\Before long, the guys with the earflapped orange-hats and the guys and gals with berets were fam-i-lee.\After all, the argument went and goes, the outdoors, the sky blue waters and theater, galleries and music are core statewide values, elements of Minnesota's ""brand."" From a sales pitch point of view, they all contribute to the state's massive tourism industry.\The arts piece tipped powerful Minneapolis Sen. Larry Pogemiller, who chaired the tax committee, and finance committee chair Sen. Dick Cohen, a huge arts supporter.\""We needed some accelerant,"" Rice said. ""The arts added enough flavor to it, so this amendment would not be perceived as being all hunting and fishing ... The parks made it palatable to some metro legislators. The water issue addressed some long-term needs. The arts were saying, 'If this is about Minnesota, this has got to be comprehensive.' ""\The sportsmen initially saw adding the arts as an attempt to kill their years-long effort. They thought it would further muddy the Minnesota political waters.\Au contraire. What was created was the perfect storm to get the amendment -- finally last session -- on the ballot and then help fund a constitutional amendment campaign.\As Joe Duggan, vice president of Pheasants Forever, said: ""As time went by, the nature of this process became one of compromise and coalition building. It became advantageous to have more coalition members.""\Who-da thunk that the Deer Hunters Association, the James Sewell Ballet and Women in the Wilderness would be members of the same coalition?\""You play with the hand you're dealt,"" said Lessard, who has watched his initial bill morph into all this.\As someone said the other day at a news conference of amendment supporters, if any political candidate could muster such a coalition, he or she would be a shoo-in for statewide office.\The support effort has raised about $ 3.6 million so far, said Vote Yes for Minnesota campaign director Ken Martin. According to reports at the Campaign Finance Board, the largest contributor through August was Minneapolis philanthropist Alida Rockefeller Messinger; she donated $1 million.\At its most recent available filing, No Constitutional Tax Increase, which is chaired by former U.S. Sen. Rod Grams, had raised about $3,000, all from the Taxpayers League of Minnesota.\The Constitution\Critics have called it ""a Christmas tree"" amendment with disparate ornaments mixed and matched simply to garner votes ... as if that's not the way things work in the halls of politicking.\Critics argue that taking such a specific constitutionally mandated funding initiative undercuts the pillars of representative democracy.\Indeed, an exact sales tax percentage -- the three-eighths of 1 percent, in this case -- has never been included in the Constitution. Such specificity appropriating statewide funds in the guiding document is a departure.\""Obviously, everyone supports clean water,"" said Phil Krinkie, president of the Taxpayers League of Minnesota and among the amendment's harshest bashers. At a time of declining incomes and mounting debt, higher taxes aren't the answer, the former state representative from Shoreview said.\But it's the decision-making method and dedication of the added sales tax that gets anti-tax advocates and some public-policy wonks' blood boiling.\Editorialists at the Star Tribune, Pioneer Press, St. Cloud Times and Rochester Post- Bulletin have told their readers to vote ""No.""\Said the Post-Bulletin: ""When we start legislating through the Constitution, we start down a very slippery slope.""\It echoes the sentiments of the Civic Caucus, a policy group, which recently wrote at MinnPost, that the amendment ""represents an abdication of legislative responsibility; it dangerously reduces budgetary flexibility; it enhances influence of special interests; it sets a bad precedent; it can't guarantee what its advocates seek, and its combination of outdoors, water, and the arts is little more than logrolling.""\The fact is, though, that state constitutions nationwide aren't nearly as sacred as the U.S. Constitution. They are more detailed and more amended, by far, than the national document. State constitutions nationwide often wander into areas that seem like legislation.\""It's not unusual to see state constitutions amended for all sorts of reasons,"" said Professor Mike Steenson of William Mitchell College of Law, an expert on Minnesota's Constitution. ""There are a greater number of issues that have to be dealt with at the local level by states, and there is, I would suppose, a populist notion to it. Ultimately, what it does is take the heat off the Legislature and bring it straight to the people.""\State Constitution amended early and often\History shows that amending the Constitution is as Minnesotan as nabbing a walleye, shooting a duck or sipping white wine at the Guthrie. Since 1858, this will be the 213th time the Legislature has placed a constitutional amendment on the ballot, with 119 of them getting voters' approval.\The amendment votes have ranged from authorizing ""Negroes"" to vote -- which was rejected by voters in 1865 and 1867 before passing in 1868 -- to establish a state rural credit system to aid agricultural development, passed in 1922. Voters in 1928 decided to dedicate a ""motor fuel tax"" to highway and bridge funding and, in 1990, to dedicate 40 percent of lottery proceeds to an environmental trust fund. (That fund, which used to be raided by the Legislature for other causes, has never generated enough funding, say environmental groups.)\Noteworthy: In 1916, 1918 and 1980, efforts to create a system of initiative and referendum were defeated. It is argued by some that this year's effort is an attempt to circumvent the will of the people in those three cases.\""Look, there's probably a lot of worthwhile projects that this new money can be used for,"" said Chris Radatz, public policy director of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, whose members have come out against the amendment. ""But let's go through the legislative process every two years. Let projects rise and fall on their merits. The Legislature has to have the flexibility to respond when crises arise.""\Like the Taxpayers League and Krinkie, Radatz and his organization have supported referenda, or ""letting the people speak,"" on other matters, be they stadium questions or gas tax matters. But, generally, those votes get pushed off to the county commissioners or local voters who are affected, not to a statewide electorate whose approval can't be reversed ... except for another constitutional amendment.\Said Radatz: ""Agricultural programs that we feel are important, we have to make our case at the Legislature every two years.""\But Paul Austin, executive director of Conservation Minnesota, said the time for banging his head against the committee room wall is over. He and particularly the outdoors lovers seeking to protect habitat have been at this for more than a decade.\""When the state Legislature is sitting down every two years, these problems -- take water quality -- are important problems, but not always the most immediate,"" Austin said, comparing environmental issues to education, social services or health care. ""People put them off for one year, for two years and, pretty soon, it's many years later. You're investing in resources that are going to pay off in the long term.""\Right now, the stage budget sets aside less than 2 percent of taxpayer dollars for conservation and water quality issues.\Austin noted that he was 6 years old in 1972, when Congress passed the Clean Water Act. That law said that within 10 years every state needed to test and clean up its water.\""It's 36 years later now,"" Austin said, ""and we've missed an entire generation and we still have tested only 15 percent of our water. ... Soon, I've got grandkids and they'll have to deal with this if we don't.""\Under the amendment, the clean water slice of the tax will generate about $75 million a year, enough, Austin said, to test the other lakes and begin to clean them up; 40 percent of those tested are polluted.\What you'll be voting for or against is a tax increase, to be sure. But from the Vote Yes ads, you'd never know it. The word ""tax"" isn't uttered in its commercials. In the most recent TV spot, there is acknowledgement that passage of the amendment will cost the average family ""less than $5 per month."" But the ""T"" word isn't uttered.\""People know there's a sales tax,"" said Ken Martin, who is leading the Vote Yes campaign. ""We're not purposely trying to deceive anybody. People know.""\Of course, the Taxpayers League and the No Sales Tax Increase. group, fronted by former U.S. Sen. Rod Grams, emphasize the tax over the content of the amendment.\In his ad, Grams talks about an $11 billion tax increase. Over the 25-year-life of the increase, that's what's projected to be raised.\But on its Web site, the Taxpayers League and Grams' Vote No group add this: ""If you're sick of paying more and more taxes, join us in telling the liberal tax-and-spenders 'enough is enough!' ""\When the Legislature passed the law to allow the amendment, the House approved it 85-46 and the Senate 46-17, in a very bipartisan vote.\How the amendment would work\If this amendment passes, for everything you purchase that is covered by the state sales tax, an additional three-eighths of a cent will be added at the cash register. It will bump up the current statewide 6.5 percent sales tax to 6.875.\On a $100 purchase, your tax will increase 38 cents.\That additional tax -- which would generate about $273 million by 2011 -- will be siphoned from the state's general fund and deposited into dedicated pots of cash for the causes imbedded in the amendment: 33 percent to outdoors habitat and issues ($90 million), 33 percent to clean water remediation ($90 million), 14 percent to parks and trails ($39 million) and 20 percent to the arts statewide ($54 million). This would be the sales tax gift that keeps on giving for 25 years.\In the end, the Legislature gets back into the picture, too.\""Citizens councils,"" composed of experts and average Janes and Joes will be appointed by the governor and the Legislature. In the case of the arts, the State Arts Board already has committees statewide to evaluate grant proposals. That mechanism is expected to stay in place.\Once the new dollars are collected, the councils/committees will make recommendations to legislators. All grants and spending allocations will be approved by the Legislature.\Voter 'drop-off' factor in election\Amid the campaigns of Obama and McCain, Coleman and Franken, ""Our biggest problem has been awareness,"" said Martin, a political pro, who ran John Kerry's Minnesota presidential campaign in 2004.\So, phone banks have been in place. Fly-arounds have been undertaken. Van tours across the state were conducted.\The key for any amendment is this: It's not a game of getting the majority of the votes. Rather, it's a game of getting a majority of the voters.\If someone votes for president or Senate or dog catcher Tuesday but doesn't vote on the amendment, that's considered a ""No"" vote.\Some Vote Yes proponents are concerned that with an expected crush of new and energetic voters, many will whiz into the polling place, get their ballot, fill in the space for Obama or McCain and then rush out.\If there's a significant ""drop-off"" rate -- and generally it's in the 6 to 10 percent range -- that could hurt the ""Yes"" advocates big-time.\Martin, in an interview, suggested that Tuesday's vote is as much a referendum on voters' willingness to increase taxes as it is a plebiscite on the outdoors, clean water or the arts.\""This is, in many ways, a proxy on the tax debate in this state,"" Martin said. ""If this loses, you can be sure that the anti-tax crowd -- and notice I didn't say Republicans -- but the anti-tax crowd will be able to own the tax debate for the next generation.\That is, should this lose, then the Krinkies of the world can say: ""A-ha, even when it comes to easy issues like the environment and culture, this state is opposed to increasing taxes.""\Krinkie said, should the amendment be defeated, he won't declare it an overarching victory for no-tax sentiment, but a vote on this particular issue.\Others say this is a referendum on preserving the ""old Minnesota,"" when the outdoors trumped the urban core and suburban sprawl, when life was simpler and safer and more idyllic. This is a vote to retain the Minnesota we knew before freeways dominated, when almost everyone's name was Olson and when Tyrone Guthrie roamed our streets.\But for Bob Lessard, now 77, the vote is still about what he wanted a decade ago: honoring the outdoors, protecting the places where hunters and anglers recreate, keeping Minnesota clean.\""Look, I'm not an initiative-and-referendum guy either,"" said Lessard, who bolted the DFL late in his career because it was too liberal. ""But I tried every other method outside of a constitutional amendment I could. Even when we had a surplus, I couldn't get this funded. ... It won't get funded by the Legislature. I know it. I've been there.""\What if voters say, ""No,"" come Tuesday -- for all sorts of reasons. What then?\""We'll never have another opportunity again,'' Lessard, the creator of all this, said. ""For me, it's now or never.""\Jay Weiner writes about off-the-field sports issues, such as sports business and sports and public policy, and other issues.

283,"The last name of Suzanne Thorne was misspelled in this article.\Editor's note - Change was the theme that made Bill Clinton president. To see how ordinary Americans' lives change under his leadership, staff writers Kim Ode and Kay Miller sought out people across Minnesota who could offer insight into the impact of public policy.\ Over the next four years, this panel of 15 Minnesotans will share with us their experiences of the Clinton era. They represent no one but themselves, but reflect a range of economic circumstances, lifestyles and political perspectives.\ Three or four times a year they will tell us how the administration's actions have affected them, their communities and the nation.\ In today's article, panel members talked in individual interviews about their expectations for change under Clinton.\Two weeks before the election, Bob Schmitt took his 12-year-old daughter to ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" and was startled by the ardor of the standing ovation.\ ""I realized that this was a redemption play about looking for a savior in bad economic times,"" Schmitt said. ""That's my sense of why Clinton won the election: We have been starving in this desert for years and we want to be led out of it.""\ Schmitt knows that pinning our hopes for national salvation on any one guy practically guarantees disappointment.\ ""What is exciting, though, is that Clinton is, at least so far, calling more people to the table than ever before,"" said Schmitt, a gay graphic designer in Minneapolis who for 12 years felt like an unwelcome participant in the national dialogue led by former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.\ More than ever, Americans measure their presidents' tenures in personal terms: Can I make a decent living? Will my children go to war? Will I have a job? If I need an operation, can I get it? Am I really better off since this guy took office?\ Only 43 percent of the Americans seated around the national table voted for Clinton. And to the fellow at the head of the table, that reality represents a challenge: to create consensus on how to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number.\ We the People panel members discussed their responsibility to make the country work. If individuals won't change, then society as a whole can't change, said Ken Morris, a conservative lawyer who favors a return to self-reliance. The panelists agreed about the country's needs - healing the economy, reforming health care and welfare systems, restoring our sense of national well-being - but they are divided on how to achieve those goals. None believes in quick fixes. Each wants a place at the table.\ As Schmitt figuratively scooches his chair up to the table, Cy Laurent feels he's being pushed aside. What goodwill the Bloomington entrepreneur had for this new president was sorely tested Jan. 22 when Clinton removed Bush's restrictions on abortion counseling at federally funded clinics and returned to overseas U.S. military hospitals the permission to perform privately funded abortions.\ ""For Clinton to sit down in the first few hours of his presidency and do {that} is telling a majority of U.S. citizens, `I'm not concerned about you.' "" said Laurent, an abortion opponent. ""He's not going to be the president of everybody. That is clear.""\ Ann Boyd, a homemaker in Savage and a member of the religious right, also opposes abortion but expects Clinton's actions to galvanize the opposition. She pointed to news media coverage of demonstrations on Jan. 22, the 20th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.\ The news media, she said, ""never used to show the huge crowds at these rallies, and suddenly the whole day was devoted to prolife because now we're the underdog. Bill Clinton helped us out. It will completely mobilize the prolife movement.""\ If Clinton underestimated the symbolic power that abortion opponents would derive from his actions, even his supporters nervously wondered whether his quick action was decisiveness or political miscalculation.\ Michele Dunn, a teacher in the Minneapolis schools and a strong liberal, supports Clinton's efforts to rescind the ban on gays in the military. Still, she added, ""I wonder why he would choose this as his first fight, when it's something that people clearly feel so strongly about.""\ The news from Clinton's first week in office somewhat dampened Dunn's enthusiasm for an administration she had greeted with great hope. She remains bothered by the fumbled nomination of Zoe Baird for attorney general.\ ""I do feel he should have done a little more checking, and the fact that there were two stories - that {Clinton} knew, and that his advisers knew - bothered me,"" she said.\ ""People don't want to see anyone put above the law in any way. Me, too.""\ The Clinton-Bush-Perot campaign drew more public attention and more people to the polls than any presidential election since 1968, with 56 percent of the voting-age population casting ballots. Such interest probably translates into more people watching the president and checking his promises against reality. Do they measure up against the man we think we elected?\ Paul Hesterberg is pastor of First Lutheran Church in Winthrop, about 75 miles west of the Twin Cities. He voted for Clinton but is ""mildly apprehensive"" about him now. He said he hopes that Clinton can resist corporate America, which wooed him with its largesse for the inauguration.\ Hesterberg's prime policy concern is social justice - that aid be given to people in need and that the government help people to avoid becoming needy. ""The big immigration to this country happened when European countries totally failed in population control and social justice, so huge numbers of people saw no hope, and America was open to `The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,' "" he said.\ ""They came over here. They got land. Now what is happening is the corporatization of the American farm. The land is being taken away again. The human race is too stupid to avoid making the mistakes of the past over again. The difference is, now there's no new world.""\ As the conversation wore on, Hesterberg's concerns about Clinton grew more obvious.\ ""I'm scared,"" he said. ""I'm scared because he has a lot of power, and as smart as he is, he's not smart enough to do everything right."" Then he smiled. ""But the Bible says we're not to put our trust in princes in the first place. I trust in God, and I think God can use Clinton to help pull it off.""\ Hesterberg is concerned about Clinton's ""seeming reneging on his campaign pledges,"" he said. ""It's too soon to judge him, though. On Haiti, for instance, I don't think it would be good for the U.S. or for Haiti to have 200,000 people in little boats coming over here all at once. I think he recognizes that, and it was to his political advantage to placate the Republican types whom he has to work with as well.""\ Laurent, the Bloomington entrepreneur, also is concerned about the president's backpedaling, particularly on the middle-class tax cut, one of the few pledges that brought him to common cause with Clinton. Laurent now expects a sucker punch: ""This idea of sacrifice - that means taxes. Make no mistake about it. That means a lot of taxes.""\ Laurent looks every inch the prosperous Republican: gray hair going white at the temples, well-cut chalk-striped suit and a big square jaw. In the early 1980s, he started a number of businesses that led to the formation of Corporate Reliance Inc., an association of nine consulting companies.\ Laurent isn't the kind of guy who just talks about boot-straps mentality; he has lived it. He pulled himself out of a series of natural disasters. A fire when the Laurents were on their honeymoon wiped out everything in their mobile home except a box of wedding photos. There were two floods. The first destroyed two cars and the bottom half of their Bloomington home. Experts assured them that another such storm wouldn't reoccur for 250 years. Laurent rebuilt. Ten years later, the house was hit by a storm twice as bad. Except this time, Laurent had taken out a large loan - based on the house's value - to buy out his business partner. Laurent was living on plywood floors and working himself out of debt when the bank called the loan, throwing him into personal bankruptcy.\ Laurent said the low interest rates and mild inflation of the Reagan-Bush era allowed him to pull himself out of that financial hole. He said he doubts he could have recovered otherwise. He's wary of higher taxes and inflation.\ ""I wish I could tell you that I am hopeful about Clinton's presidency,"" he said. ""I am not. . . . The problems this country faces . . . are far too complex, and the president does not have the power to solve most of it.\ ""Ever see that movie {""Little Shop of Horrors""} where the plant keeps demanding, `FEED ME, FEEEEED ME'? The fact is that our government is so large, it grows on itself. It's going to take more than a president to change. It's going to take a national commitment.""\ Dave Anderson also said that he doubts that the country will see dramatic change in a single presidential term, given the scale of our problems. ""But if within four years the problem is at least turned around and headed in the other direction, that'd be great,"" he said. ""Everyone says something should be done and it will be painful, but we have to wait and see who feels the most pain.""\ Anderson and his wife, Lois, own Anderson Diesel Truck Service Inc. and Bay & Bay Transfer Co. in Burnsville, companies that between them employ 30 people. For them, the main issues will be a gas tax and health care.\ Anderson voted Republican but felt ""that I didn't have any choice. I think we've all got our heads turned and we're looking in the same direction,"" but he still expects skirmishes in Congress, and in society.\ Schmitt, the graphic designer, first joined in the discussion around the national table in the years of the Great Society, when he got a job as cook in a Model Cities day-care center. It was considered a time of social investment in people, yet he sensed that too little money had been allocated to make a good idea work.\ Now, he said, ""We've lived under 12 years of Reagan and Bush saying that people aren't worth investing in. At the same time we were expanding the military while our cities were going to hell. . . . We've defended ourselves from an enemy that we said was on the outside when, in fact, the enemy is within.""\ Schmitt says that conflict is manifest in public education. He says he couldn't buy his daughter a better education than what taxes provide for her at Ramsey International Fine Arts in Minneapolis, yet it rankles him to see teachers and staff stretched to the limit to maintain that level of service.\ ""We should not have to have so many bake sales and readathons to raise money for musical instruments, computers,"" he said. ""My tax dollars should pay for that.""\ Schmitt said he thinks government can be a benevolent force in society. He says he would like to see a deep commitment to ""people being taken care of"" - perhaps through New Deal-style employment programs to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.\ But that's precisely what Ken Morris doesn't want for himself or other blacks. ""If Clinton pursues the old notions of, `We, the federal government, have to take care of African-Americans because they can't take care of themselves,' that's something I object to strenuously.""\ Growing up in the ghettos of Alameda and Oakland, Calif., Morris became convinced that liberal policies, though well-intentioned, only made segments of the black community dependent on welfare: ""I saw our people building our own prison cells from the inside out,"" he said.\ His older brother was one of those. And though the cause listed on his brother's death certificate was congestion of the lungs, Morris said he believed the real cause was poverty and wasted potential.\ Morris, who calls himself a compassionate conservative, says that the central cultural tragedy of America is the number of children without fathers. He and his wife have made economic sacrifices to ensure their family's cohesiveness.\ ""Racism remains an issue,"" he said. ""It's naive to say that it doesn't exist. However, one of the things we haven't done as a community as a whole is to look internally. Each one of us has to adopt the position that, come hell or high water, we will do what is necessary to succeed.\ ""I may never, in spite of my talents, succeed to the degree that my white counterpart would. But I'm willing to live with that as long as I know I got a few steps closer for my children and my children's children.""\ Trudy Stechman of Golden Valley also looks more to how the Clinton years will affect her children and grandchildren than herself. She's a Depression-era Democrat, and her perspective of the decades has made her impatient with those who want their fixes quick, simple and painless.\ ""The family leave bill - that was a crime that that was vetoed,"" she said. ""They didn't want money; all they wanted was their jobs back. That veto said, `Let's throw them out to the wolves.' If {Clinton} signs a like bill, God bless him.\ ""I'm a realist. . . . Bill Clinton {has} a hard job ahead of him. It's not something that will be taken care of today or tomorrow, or in 100 days. But I'm very optimistic. I have faith, if he is allowed to do what he wants to do.""\ Interwoven through many of these conversations was a concern about health care. For some, it's an issue of cost; for others, it's a question of access.\ David Seeger would be 10 now, had he lived. His mother, Diana Seeger, said he was born with irreversible brain damage because she couldn't pay for treatment at the full-service hospital in Grand Rapids. Seeger, an American Indian, said she could have sought treatment through Indian Health Services, but the nearest center was equipped only with tongue depressors and adhesive bandages. The state spent $300,000 caring for David until he died at 3 1/2. Good prenatal care and delivery could have saved her son and would have cost a mere $3,000, Seeger said.\ For Seeger, health care is a very personal issue. When she hears the words, she sees David's face. Or the faces of hundreds of children under her care as director of the Kooch-Itasca Head Start in Grand Rapids.\ She voted for Clinton, hoping he would fight to improve welfare, employment, housing and health care programs.\ ""If we get just one thing in the next four years - national health care - it would change the lives of people in this county,"" said Seeger. She estimates that of the 220 Head Start families she serves, half could leave welfare if they had health care.\ Tom DiNanni of Minneapolis almost died two years ago from a massive bladder infection. The second of his operations coincided with a hysterectomy that his wife, Sandy, had. The family doctor had urged that operation, fearing that Sandy DiNanni had cancer. The cysts were benign.\ For 18 months, DiNanni was covered by insurance through the radio station where he worked, but his policy was canceled along with all other employees' policies when the station was sold.\ People talk about being one paycheck away from being poor. In DiNanni's case, that paycheck has come and gone. In the space of a few months, DiNanni joined the legion of the working poor.\ DiNanni also has Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel syndrome. The DiNannis have their own public relations business; most of their clients are nonprofit organizations and churches. They have never carried their own insurance, because his risk factor makes it too expensive. They just prayed that they wouldn't get sick.\ ""We're living on the edge, but we're doing what we like to do,"" said DiNanni, who calls himself a knee-jerk liberal. ""And this isn't Bosnia. I can't picture myself getting sick and not having some kind of support system.""\ Bob Duban, who farms near Dundas, has similar concerns. His wife, Sylvia, works part time at St. Dominic's Church in Faribault, and when he looks around at the neighboring farmers, he said, ""I guess that 90 percent of them {who are} under 40, their wives work, too, and the first reason they give is to have health care.""\ When his wife was ill last year, they made their first claim in eight years on their health insurance. He recently received notice that his premiums will rise 25 to 40 percent, ""so we've got to start looking at another carrier,"" he said.\ Duban considers himself an independent-thinking conservative, a man who attends the IR caucus but voted for Clinton, despite concerns about his position on abortion. He was greatly disappointed that none of the three candidates spent time addressing farm issues.\ Still, he said, ""the Clinton campaign was very much built on change. I have felt that home turf has been really neglected, especially in the . . . last 12 years. We've let America here float by the wayside.""\ Suzanne Thorpe also is concerned with the home front. She describes herself as a ""compassionate Republican"" and active community volunteer, working with Meals on Wheels, food shelves and a local women's resource center. ""I like to help people, but I like to help people who want to help themselves,"" she said.\ Last year, her husband lost his job as a vice president for Northwest Airlines - or, as she said with a sweet grimace, ""left to pursue other interests."" He's working in Phoenix now with a fledgling airline. Their future is in doubt.\ They're considering starting a small business, ""so the state of the economy would certainly play a role in that,"" she said. ""If the government was helpful in starting a small business that employed a few people, that may be one answer"" for people idled by the recession. ""I think people have lost sight of what `small' means when starting a business. It takes a couple hundred thousand dollars. Government should should make that risk worth taking.""\ One way to start would be putting a lid on the pork barrel. ""I'd like Clinton to start some cutting. He said he was going to cut the White House staff by 25 percent, and now says he can't do that. Well, how about by 5 percent? I'd rather see him fulfill some of the promise."" Karen McLaughlin has her own concerns about government's fiscal management. When she worked at the CIA analyzing Latin American policy, she said, she was constantly amazed by the overlapping jurisdictions, bureaucratic infighting and governmental waste.\ McLaughlin says that most problems are best handled by the private sector. She's a self-confessed public affairs junkie who four months ago quit her year-old consulting business to stay home full time with her 13-month-old son, Michael. She chairs Friends of American Experiment, an adjunct to Center of the American Experiment, a Minneapolis-based conservative think tank, and she worries about Clinton's propensity - in this global economy - to separate foreign and domestic matters.\ The stock market rise of the Reagan-Bush era was good to McLaughlin, whose family just moved to a new home in Minnetonka. ""When we bought this house, we saved a lot,"" she said. ""But we also cashed in some of our stocks and they had done very well during those years.""\ While she's grateful for their prosperity and wants to give back to society, McLaughlin sometimes is angered by how tax dollars are spent, ""especially when you see people on welfare who don't anticipate getting off."" She doubts that Clinton ""has the chutzpah or the conviction to really look at our welfare system.""\ Kelly Sullivan, a 19-year-old single mother who gets AFDC (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) benefits, wishes it were a simple matter to get off welfare. It stings when people glare as she pulls food stamps out of her wallet at the grocery.\ ""My brother's roommate said to me, `Are you still on welfare? Are you taking my money that I give to taxes? I said, `I wouldn't be on welfare if it wasn't for men like you: men ditching out.' ""\ For a long time, Sullivan felt rootless. Now her daughter Cori is the force that drives the decisions in Sullivan's life, including her decision to vote for Clinton.\ ""I liked the way he wants to get women off welfare by helping us go to school,"" she said. ""He'd be a little harder on us. But, heck, it's worth it. He wants to rebuild for our children.""\ Sullivan left high school eight credits shy of a degree. She decided in January to return to school for her GED (general equivalency diploma). Sullivan knows that Clinton's welfare plan would limit payments to two years. She estimates it will take her another five years on AFDC to reach her goal of a career in the medical field.\ Ellen Arnold's educational path has been more conventional. She's a freshman at the University of Minnesota.\ Arnold is excited about the Clinton administration. Yet the last few years have convinced her that she can follow all the rules and still end up unable to support herself - this from a child of the middle class, with two well-educated parents who constantly encourage her and pay her tuition and books. Arnold's mother pressed her to consider nursing - seemingly a sure thing in an unsteady economy, but far from Arnold's interests in music, film and photography. Though she has yet to declare a major, educational costs remain her biggest worry, and she favors Clinton's plan for tuition in exchange for service.\ Arnold wore a black Pearl Jam T-shirt and her cheeks were still flushed from a morning's work in the cold hoisting recycling barrels at the University of Minnesota, earning money to pay for living expenses. The volume of recycled material has given physical dimensions to her concern for the environment.\ Arnold says she'd be willing to sacrifice - to see more tax taken from her meager paycheck - if it meant the economy would improve. Her willingness to sacrifice is echoed by others - though what each is willing to sacrifice varies.\ Others, such as Ann Boyd, ask only that government allow them to live unfettered by state intervention and crippling taxation:\ ""The government should protect the general welfare, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility - what we're talking about is the preamble to the Constitution,"" Boyd said. ""As citizens, we are supposed to change the government, decide what our lives should be like.""\ But it seems clear that few lives will be left untouched by the promised changes of Clinton's presidency.\ Schmitt said, ""The possibilities lie not only in what Bill Clinton will or will not do, but in the sense of hope that surrounds him. If that hope is contagious enough, he will succeed in spite of himself. This country is ready to change. He's providing an open door. He may just have to get out of the way and let it happen."""
284,"Solar power is booming across the country. Panels are showing up on homes, businesses and schools. It has become clear the power of the sun is a readily available and popular option to harness energy for cities nationwide.\Yet with the consequences of global warming felt by Americans coast to coast, we can't afford to stand still. Minnesotans already are feeling the impacts of climate change, such as long droughts interrupted by heavy rains that cause flooding. It's critical we build on this progress and continue growing this limitless, pollution-free energy.\Earlier this month, Environment America released a new report, ""Lighting the Way."" The report ranks states based on the amount of solar capacity installed through 2013. Though Minnesota found itself lagging on the ladder, ranking 21st in the nation for total solar capacity, with the right policies and programs in place, we're confident that Minnesota could quickly rise in those rankings.\""Lighting the Way"" highlights that it's not necessarily the amount of sunlight a state gets, but strong programs and policies that make the difference.\Recent legislation will help Minnesota see a dramatic growth in clean renewable solar energy. The Minnesota Solar Energy Industry Association and Environment Minnesota have worked hand in hand with the development of policy and key legislation resulting in the Solar Energy Jobs Act of 2013. This bill creates Minnesota jobs and stimulates local manufacturing of solar products and goods.\Much of Minnesota's solar progress is attributable to programs such as the 2013 solar energy standards and value-of-solar tariff, which sets a fixed price for solar that accounts for all benefits customers provide to society.\Environment America's report identified that states in the top 10 are far more likely to have strong net metering policies, strong statewide interconnection policies, renewable electricity standards and solar carve-outs.\Minnesota can catch up. Not only can we improve on existing programs to make solar energy more widely available, but Minnesota can look to improving additional practices, such as tax credits, virtual net metering for community solar or installations on public buildings.\From 2011-13, the price of installed solar systems fell 60 percent. As the industry continues to expand, the cost of installed solar will fall even further. This makes solar energy more accessible to home and business owners across America and makes it continually more competitive with older, dirty energy sources such as natural gas or coal.\The solar industry also employed 864 workers who can't be outsourced in Minnesota in 2013, which is included in the 140,000 jobs in solar nationwide.\Solar also is key to helping states meet the carbon pollution emission reduction goals set by the Environmental Protection Agency this June. According to SEIA President Rhone Resch, ""The 14,800 megawatts of solar installed in the United States can generate enough pollution-free electricity to displace 18 billion pounds of coal"" -- that's a win for state economies, Americans' health and our environment.\Together, we must keep pushing ahead with solar for Minnesota. Minnesotans want clean air, job growth and a safer climate.\Having solar play a larger role in our energy infrastructure can help us meet these goals.\We're ready to build on the progress Minnesota has made thus far to climb even further in the rankings -- when it comes to solar in Minnesota, the sky is truly the limit.\This is the opinion of Tatiana Hakanson, Environment Minnesota, and Dustin Denison, president of Minnesota Solar Energy Industry Association."

It used to be my dream, but that dream is gone unless something changes.\Theo Kronfeld, Golden Valley\THE LEGISLATURE\Headed the wrong way on bees, solar power and the gas tax\I am outraged that the Minnesota Senate has bowed to industry pressure to allow plants sold as ""pollinator friendly"" to contain neonicotinoids and other pesticides (""Senate eases on 'pollinator-friendly' rules,"" May 15). At a time when every schoolchild is concerned about the plight of bees and butterflies; when bee-colony collapse is threatening the very production of our food crops; when U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers have identified the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin as a likely contributor to monarch butterfly declines in North America, and when Heavy Costs, a scientific literature review by the Center for Food Safety of 19 peer-reviewed studies, has revealed that neonicotinoid insecticide seed treatments offer little benefit, do not increase crop yields, and cause widespread environmental and economic damage -- in particular, neonicotinoids have been implicated in bee-population declines and colony collapse -- it is unconscionable that our Legislators and nursery owners care so little about the web of life that they would allow misinformation on plant labeling.\You can ""bee-lieve"" that there is a growing movement of consumers who are demanding truth in labeling and will hold our elected representatives and nursery vendors accountable to get us the information we need to make informed and responsible choices.\Catherine V. Jordan, St. Paul\- - - \I am a business owner of a bike shop in St. Paul, and we proudly have solar on our rooftop. My rooftop system is a benefit to my business by helping me reduce costs.

I am adding power to the grid; I am reducing pollution to our environment, and I am helping to grow a local sustainable industry.\Our elected officials are considering harm to essential solar policies that have allowed me and other small-business owners to put solar on our rooftops. The House omnibus energy bill (H.F. 843) includes provisions that will make Minnesota roll back on net metering, a policy that is working in 44 other states. It would be a regressive step for Minnesota as a leader in renewable energy choices for its citizens, and for business owners like me.\Xcel is a willing partner with my rooftop system, along with the state of Minnesota. I would hate to see this partnership be harmed. I hope our elected officials will leave Minnesota's net-metering solar policy as is, and do no harm.\Daniel Casebeer, St. Paul\- - - \Contrary to Peter Nelson's opinion (""Why we need to fix policy on renewables,"" May 15), the House omnibus energy bill will take Minnesota squarely back to the era of dependence on fossil fuels and nuclear power. Minnesotans cannot afford to regress in our aim to solve environmental issues of today and the future energy demands we face. H.F. 843 will gut the incentives that have made the Made in Minnesota Solar Incentive Program so successful. Hundreds of households, including our own, have invested in the solar infrastructure needed to continue to improve the lives of all Minnesotans. If we follow the House GOP plan, Minnesota will be buying coal-generated power from other states. We need clean-energy incentives, not more dependence on fossil and nuclear fuels.\Linnea Tani, Roseville\- - - \Hey, Democrats, gas prices just jumped 15 cents a gallon. Did you really think they were going to be low forever? Remember when the gas prices were almost $4.30 a gallon and how we griped about the oil companies gouging us? Now Gov.

They sure won't listen to me.\Matt Linzbach, Merrifield, Minn.\Amtrak\Incongruous action from Congress following derailment\Amtrak suffered a horrific and deadly derailment last week. Most agree that the excessive speed that caused the catastrophic accident could not have occurred on a truly modern rail system. As is the case in almost all First World countries, the track could have been equipped with automatic train control. The lack of such modern safety devices on Amtrak is a direct consequence of our demanding more speed, reliability and, yes, safety, from the company than we are willing to pay for. To my amazement and disgust, less than 24 hours after this avoidable tragedy, a gaggle of U.S. House members, mostly of the party that claims ""common sense"" as a mantra, voted to cut funding to America's passenger-rail system by $250 million.\Thomas Beaumont, Minneapolis\RELIGION\Many of us do just fine without it\I would like to offer a different perspective from the May 15 letter writer who responded to the May 13 article ""Fewer in U.S. say they are Christian.""

286,"Gov. Mark Dayton vetoed two more budget bills over the Memorial Day weekend, which will further complicate a coming special session of the Legislature.\On Saturday, he vetoed the omnibus agriculture, environment and natural resources bill and the omnibus jobs and energy bill.\No date has been scheduled for a special session, but planning was already in the works because Dayton previously vetoed the K-12 education bill because it didn't have enough funding for pre-kindergarten.\Dayton vetoed the omnibus agriculture, environment and natural resources bill even though it included one of his priorities: a requirement for buffers between farmland and waterways. But he and environmentalists didn't like many things in the bill, including the elimination of a citizens' board that oversees some decisions at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\Republican state Rep.

287,"
Gov. Mark Dayton on Monday moved a shutdown-avoiding special legislative session both closer and further away.
\
The governor said he was dropping his insistence that lawmakers change language dealing with county audits but cited three new objections to the Legislature's special session plans.
\
The Minnesota Legislature needs to meet in a special session because Dayton vetoed three of the budget bills it approved in May. Without those signed budgets, Minnesota would face a partial government shutdown July 1 and nearly 9,500 state employees would be laid off.
\
As recently as Thursday, the DFL governor said he and the House's ""major remaining difference"" had to do with the state auditor. But Monday, he said he and the House were still in disagreement over three other issues: funding for programs for the disabled and mentally ill, energy net metering and scaling back a provision to offer large businesses lower electric rates.
\
On Monday morning, House Speaker Kurt Daudt said the Legislature would not accede to the governor's demand that altering the provision, just signed into law, on the state auditor be part of a special session agenda.
\
""There will be no action taken on this issue in special session,"" Daudt, R-Crown, said. ""Period.""
\
The governor relented on that issue.
\
In a letter to Daudt, Dayton said that ""with great reluctance"" he would let go of his desire to immediately change the auditor language. As part of the state government budget plans, the Legislature approved a policy change that would let the state's counties use private accountants, rather than the state auditor, to check their finances starting next summer.
\
Dayton had said that until the Legislature agreed to repeal that policy or delay it a year, he would not call a special session.
\
""We are very near final agreements on almost everything necessary to convene a special session and conclude the 2015 legislative session. Our major remaining difference is the House's insistence to privatize the state auditor's principal responsibility to audit most Minnesota counties,"" the governor said in a statement last Thursday.
\
But Monday, the governor said he ""probably misstated"" it when he said that the auditor issue was the last sticking point.
\
Now Dayton said three issues still loom large. Those three issues are:
\
-- Adding $5 million to fund a program to help people with disabilities find jobs and one that helps mentally ill Minnesotans avoid homelessness.
\
-- Elimination of a cost savings measure for people who use alternative energy sources.
\
-- Limiting an electric rate break to northeastern Minnesota mining and foresting industry, rather than offering lower costs to other large businesses.
\
""Before I can call a special session, it remains necessary for us to reach agreements,"" on those, Dayton wrote.
\
Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, who spent last week as Dayton's proxy in face-to-face-negotiations with House leaders, said she and lawmakers have long talked about those issues during their meetings.
\
""We haven't come to agreement on these things, but they're not new things,"" Smith said.
\
In a statement, Daudt, the House speaker, said only that he looked forward to working with the governor to finalize the special session agenda, ""so that we can provide relief to farmers affected by avian flu, communities damaged by flooding, and miners facing unemployment on the Iron Range as well as providing job certainty to 9,400 state employees.""
\
The governor and the Legislature have already agreed on major parts of the plans for a one-day special session.
\
They will approve an education funding measure that increases early childhood through high school spending by $525 million over the next two years, an environment and agriculture budget to fund avian flu recovery and other programs and pass a $373 million public works measure.
\
In Minnesota, only governors have the power to call lawmakers back to work outside of their regularly scheduled sessions. This year's regular session ended May 18.
\
The uncertain resolution has made it difficult for lawmakers to set their schedules. Some, like Daudt, have canceled other plans. The speaker had hoped to be in Italy this week as part of a delegation pitching Minnesota as the site of the 2023 World's Fair.
\
""Here I am,"" he said Monday, standing outside of his St. Paul office.
\
But others have worked to stick to their pre-arrangements. House Minority Leader Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, went to Italy on Sunday as part of the World's Fair trip. He also plans to go to France with the delegation.
\
He said in a statement that the trip is important to woo the Fair but that he would return to Minnesota as needed.
\
""I will remain in close touch with both the governor's offices and legislative leaders as needed to reach final agreement on these budgets and I will return when special session is called,"" Thissen said.
\
When that will be remains unclear.
\
""I believe that this special session could be held later this week,"" Dayton said.
\
But leaders also said June 1 that they expected it by the end of last week.

288,"Energy purchases took less than 4 percent of American household budgets last year — the lowest share ever in government statistics that go back six decades, according to analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\And that’s for all energy payments, whether to the electric company or the gas company or the corner filling station, so it reflects unusually (and temporarily) low prices for natural gas and petroleum fuels.\But rising use of ever-cheaper renewables is playing a role, too, according to BNEF’s Sustainable Energy in America Factbook, a respected annual report now in its fifth edition. So are conservation and efficiency efforts. And one place these factors are showing up is in electricity demand and pricing:\Retail electricity prices across the country fell 2.2% in 2016 in real terms from 2015 levels. On average, consumers now pay 4% less per kilowatt-hour for electricity than in 2007, when removing the impact of inflation. In some regions, falling wholesale energy costs and energy savings have had an even larger impact: in New York, average retail rates are now 19% below 2007 levels, and in Texas average rates have fallen 30% in real terms. \Overall electric demand is also falling, but more slowly, and it no longer moves in lockstep with economic activity. Demand slipped by 1.1% in 2016, the factbook reports, even as gross domestic product went up 1.6 %.\Over a slightly longer time frame, going back to the consumption peak set in 2014, demand has fallen 1.2% while GDP has grown 4.2% after adjustment for inflation. (An even longer timeline, and one that includes a serious recession: power demand is now 3.6% below the levels of 2007, and GDP is up 12%.)\Efficiencies are showing up in the natural gas usage, too:\Within the residential sector, natural gas consumption has held steady as the number of customers has risen, even when accounting for recent mild winters: gas consumption per customer has fallen from an average of 210 cubic feet per day (cfd) from 2002-06 to 188 cfd from 2012-16. Natural gas utilities invested an estimated $1.4 billion into the efficiency programs in 2015, a 350% increase over 2007’s levels ($300 million).\Also, by one measure, in natural gas production. As gas prices overall approached record low levels last year, companies shut down their less productive rigs and shifted effort to places where outputs per rig were higher; and production overall was 24 percent above the levels of a decade earlier.\ The role of new systems \As you’d expect, a key focus for BNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, its partner in the factbook project, is the sector variously described as zero-carbon, clean, sustainable and/or renewable. Prices are falling there as well — a generally good thing for consumers, and for progressive change in the energy system, but not entirely problem-free:\Utility-scale photovoltaic capex (the cost of constructing a project from start to end) has fallen from $2.65 million per megawatt in 2011 to only $1.14 million in 2016. The cost for wind turbines specifically has also declined, from $1.34 million per MW to $1.12 million over the same five-year timeframe. \At the same time, the performance of the equipment has also improved. Combined, this has allowed utilities and corporate buyers to sign long-term power purchase deals at under $40 per megawatt-hour for solar power in Nevada and California. For wind, offtake prices continued to fall, with some projects fetching below $20/MWh in Texas and Oklahoma.\Declaring that renewables have moved from “alternative” status to “the new normal,” the report lists these benchmarks from 2016:\* A new record for additions to generating capacity, with 22 gigawatts overall: 12.5 GW in solar, 8.5 GW in wind, 279 megawatts in hydro and 132 MW scattered among biomass, biogas and waste-to-energy operations. Stationary fuel cells added another 47 MW.\* In the past 10 years, the report calculates, renewables have accounted for 54 percent of total additions to generating capacity, and their share of total capacity has almost doubled since 2007, from 8% to 15%.\* Natural gas has grown even faster, from 22% to 34%, making it the No. 1 source of power generation as coal continues to contract.\* Coal-plant takedowns in 2016 amounted to 7GW, after the record-setting 15GW in 2015; another 12GW in coal capacity is scheduled for retirement in the next five years. As of last year, coal-fired turbines produced 30 percent of U.S. electricity, down from 48 percent in 2008.\ Support coverage of critical environmental issues on MinnPost \Donate today!\However, the report also notes a modest slowdown in renewables investment last year: $59 billion, down from $63 billion in 2015. The decline was largest in solar, in part because of falling costs; wind and smart-grid technologies saw investment rise last year, as did electric vehicles, but not enough to push the total upward.\And for those readers hungry for technical details at the intersection of public policy and private investment, this excerpt on the sheer complexity of the system’s workings may be of interest:\Asset finance — which tracks money flowing into new utility-scale projects only — totaled $31.6 billion, a small drop-off from 2015’s $32.2 billion. Financing in 2015 had surged 46% from 2014 levels, as market participants sought to lock in federal tax credits which were due to expire or step down at the end of 2016. In the eleventh hour of the 2015 Congress, the Production Tax Credit for wind and the Investment Tax Credit for solar were extended for five years apiece, effectively giving the market more time to invest, and, accordingly, 2016 declined.\Almost all of the funds were directed into solar and wind, which each captured $14.7 billion. Biomass financing amounted to $196 million, down from $286 million in 2015. Small hydro saw its first significant investment since 2011, with $77 million in asset financing, and biogas received $24 million. There was virtually no new financing tracked for waste-to-energy, geothermal, or carbon capture and storage in 2016. \ What about Trump? \The report is essentially silent on the outlook for national progress under President Donald Trump; he is mentioned only three times, in neutral references to the reality that policies like the Clean Power Plan and fuel-economy standards could change.\However, it also notes that not all the important action is inside the Beltway, and cites examples of noteworthy action “driving the sustainable energy transition” in such states as:\*\Illinois, which through a major new energy bill supplemented its existing renewable portfolio standard with requirements for utilities to source at least 2 terawatt-hours of new wind and solar each, by 2020. \*\Michigan, whose legislature raised its RPS from 10% in 2015 to 15% in 2021 and expanded the program’s eligibility to include geothermal heating systems. The new law also removed a cap which prohibited utilities from spending more than 2% of annual revenues on efficiency programs. Finally, it requires electricity providers to give consumers choice in selecting green programs, while directing the state’s Public Service Commission to begin the process of developing a tariff for distributed generation. \*\Massachusetts, which set a mandate for 1.6GW of offshore wind by 2027, along with a requirement that the state’s utilities procure 9.45 terawatt-hours of clean energy through long-term contracts and an authorization for the state to set a storage target. Meanwhile, the state Supreme Court ruled that Massachusetts has not taken enough action on greenhouse gas emissions. In response, the state’s Republican governor has proposed to raise the RPS target to 80% by 2050 and limit emissions from the transportation sector for the first time, among other recommendations.\* * *\The full 2017 factbook can be downloaded here without charge, but registration is required."

The residents of President Obama's home state of Illinois sweltered along with the rest of us as the Midwest experienced record high July temperatures. Power demand soared as all ACs were on full. Fortunately (?), the Illinois legislature has enacted strong renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and 3,000 megawatts of wind power (same as Minnesota) were standing ready with electrons. And that's just what they did -- stood by with motionless turbine blades.
\
As usual on those hot muggy days, there wasn't a ""breath of air."" Chicago temps were high on July 6, and wind turbines managed 4 megawatts, enough to power a very small Chicago neighborhood. For the week, Illinois wind turbines averaged about 10 percent of rated capacity. Fortunately, Illinois nuclear plants at Braidwood (2,300 megawatts), Dresden, La Salle, etc. ran round the clock, and all ACs stayed on as demand reached 22,000 megawats.
\
Our Minnesota legislators get tennis elbow from self back-patting for passing those ""tough"" RPS laws. Unfortunately, the Laws of Nature and Physics are more difficult to control.

Not safe
\
The tragic slaughter at Columbine, Colorado, showed us that American children are not safe from gun violence in their schools.
\
The senseless shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others in Arizona, makes it clear that ordinary Americans are not safe from gun violence in supermarket parking lots.
\
The massacre last week in Aurora, Colorado, in which 12 were killed and 71 injured, now makes it obvious that Americans are not safe from gun violence in movie theaters.
\
The simple truth is that we Americans are unsafe virtually everywhere. This nation is inundated with guns, and they are easily available to criminals, children, illegal immigrants, terrorists and the mentally ill.
\
Ironically, those who could greatly solve the problems of gun violence in America, operate in a safe and secure environment: the Congress of the United States. Our elected representatives meet in gun-free surroundings, protected by the Capitol Police. And maybe that is part of the problem. I'll bet that if we removed all security protections and allowed loaded guns and automatic assault weapons in the Capitol building and congressional offices, we would have effective gun legislation in about 15 minutes.

Joe got it right
\
Columnist Joe Soucheray correctly questioned any wisdom in the St. Paul Schools wanting more money to throw at ""harnessing technology ... learn more independently in the classroom and at home."" This reminds me of my education, 7-12th grade in the Robbinsdale School District, 1966-71. In the liberal '60s we had ""Modular Scheduling,"" which gave us two-thirds of our time to learn ""independently"" in the ""Resource Centers"" (library, classrooms with books and a ""monitor"" not a teacher). How many 13-year-olds do you know mature enough to take all that time to learn independently? 16-year-olds? 18-year-olds? Even though I was a good kid and a good student I spent most of my time writing notes and hanging out in the band practice rooms. So did my fellow students. As an adult I look back and feel cheated out of an education. I was thrilled when my daughter went to junior high and high school and did not have ""modular scheduling"". She actually got an excellent education in the Roseville School District with seven hours of classroom teaching a day, graduating in 1996.
\
I hate to think of my experience repeated, thinking that ""technology,"" AKA an internet connection, is going to educate our kids. Very sad.

Right and wrong
\
I cannot believe that letter writer Jane Thomson is serious concerning photo IDs for the ACT test. Poorer students wil be left behind because they can't get an ID? Please. A Minnesota state ID is hardly a financial burden or that difficult to get. The student is likely to have a student ID already, and most of the teenagers I know are quite capable of getting around the city by many different means of transportation.
\
I don't know when being poor became a disabilty -- it is an economic situation. Most of us are poorer than some other people -- it doesn't mean we give up -- it gives us the motivation to work hard and succeed. To suggest that students will cheat because they must succeed at any cost? Baloney. The choice of right or wrong has nothing to do with being poor or rich.

A van ban?
\
There was an outrage in Aurora, Colorado, involving a deranged man who shot up a theater and killed a dozen and wounded scores. It took less than a week for some Democrat congresspeople (Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, and Reps. Diana DeGette of Colorado and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York) to begin the call for gun control, specifically high capacity magazines.
\
The same day in Victoria, Texas, a van, transporting illegal aliens, crashed and killed 14 occupants. Where is the call to ban high capacity transport vans?

Bad things happened
\
In reply to letter writer John H. Driggs' scathing remarks on current Americans ... good grief! Moral bankruptcy? Sold our souls to the devil? Oppressed? (""Fooling ourselves,"" July 23).
\
This country has always had some troubles but the majority of this country is filled with good people and good deeds. Personally, I don't know anyone alive who dishonored Native American treaties or enslaved African Americans. It seems they are all dead. Does he think slavery is still allowed here? Or genocide of Native Americans still exists? Bad things happened in the past. The present is to move on and embrace what knowledge we have gained from those times. Let's not hold onto avid resentment of something the current population did not participate in. I'm sure we would not allow it again. Let's not repeat the hatred we have overcome by placing blame on the blameless.

We need to own up
\
The July 22 Pioneer Press published several letters concerning the Dakota wars. One letter criticized a previous letter suggesting it picked a point in time which benefited that writer's argument, while another waxes eloquently about healing, dignity and equality. Both writers make valid points. However, the point that is totally missed is the raw fact that the ""settlers,"" from the beginning, drove the natives off their land and if they did not leave willingly, murdered them. One writer suggested this was justified since the natives had been doing so to themselves for hundreds of years. This hypothesis is absurd, but is still being applied by Americans worldwide.
\
What would we do if Russia decided to ""settle"" America and began an invasion? We would try to kill the invaders, which, by using one writer's logic, would entitle them to annihilate us. We need to own up to the tragic treatment of Native Americans and stop making excuses for our ancestors' abhorrent behavior. Our treatment of these peoples closely parallels the treatment of Holocaust victims during WWII. Before you become too upset over this statement, study what actually took place during these two tragic events, not the politics behind them. Chilling, isn't it? Trying to justify what the white ""settlers"" visited upon the Native Americans is a fool's errand.
