0,"Democrats in Congress think they are on a roll after passing the stimulus bill. But we can't let the urgent economic needs create a snowball effect of bad legislation.\One example is the push for a cap-and-trade carbon policy. This would create an artificial market open to manipulation and speculation, without the assurance of doing anything for the environment.\I don't know how legislators can even bring up such a scheme at a time when millions of Americans are out of work and businesses are struggling to survive. A cap-and-trade policy would add billions of dollars in energy costs, without reducing emissions. In addition, it would require the creation and funding of a government bureaucracy to try to regulate against speculators.\When there aren't real market forces to contain prices, regulation and oversight are the only options. But as we have seen with recent financial scandals and the speculative run-up in the price of oil last summer, regulation and oversight don't work. Investors lost their entire life savings in the case of financial scandal. Instead, we need a simple, transparent carbon tax that will reduce our emissions, without the political ""gaming.""\We cannot afford the additional costs and resultant loss of jobs the cap-and-trade scheme would bring. Congress must stand firm against this bad idea.\Paul Hoffman\Indianapolis"
1,"In response to ""Reckless warnings on warming"" by George Will, published April 12:\There is no question that the U.S. government should set national policies to fight global warming. In the absence of federal action, however, states have both the obligation and the opportunity to ""act locally.""\In California -- the world's 13th-largest greenhouse gas emitter -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is enacting groundbreaking policies, including emissions reduction goals that are more aggressive than Kyoto, a new emissions cap-and-trade program, and a first in the world low-carbon fuel standard.\These policies will have profound environmental and economic effects. The governor's emissions goals will clear more than 170 million tons of emissions from California's skies by 2020. That's equivalent to taking more than 32 million passenger cars off the road for one year. Experts predict that his goals will also result in more than $60 billion in new investments. That means new business, more jobs and a stronger economy for California.\Dan Dunmoyer\Deputy chief of staff\Office of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger\Sacramento, Calif."

Just because U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, has taken a stand against the Environmental Protection Agency, don't think he's anti-environment, he says.
\
""Sure, I care about the environment. We all do. ... but this impacts all segments of the economy,"" he said, referring to the EPA's recently enforced limitations on carbon-dioxide emissions at power plants and refineries. ""It raises the price of gasoline by 20 cents a gallon.
\
""This really is a jobs issue. China and India, they're not going to impose the same regulations on air. We can't afford to lose any more (jobs overseas).""
\
As the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Upton's standing in Congress has been considerably enhanced. So his criticism of the EPA hasn't gone unnoticed, creating a backlash by the Sierra Club and other high-profile environmental groups that have targeted Upton in a billboard and telephone campaign.
\
Upton said the ball began rolling with his opposition to President Barack Obama's cap-and-trade legislation, which was intended to slow down climate change by imposing caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Upton opposed the bill, arguing the requirement to have companies pay up for each ton of carbon emitted was too high a price for Michigan based on its greater dependence on coal-fired power plants.
\
Upton pointed out, too, that when he toured the Niles Steel Tank Co. prior to the 2009 vote on cap-and-trade, the plant manager told him layoffs would be inevitable should the bill become law.
\
""He said the only way they could compete would be to operate only with a night shift, when utility costs are less,"" he said.
\
Cap-and-trade passed in the House but stalled in the Senate. To get around the legislation's failure, the EPA ""went through the back door,"" Upton said, and early this year began enforcing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions.
\
""What they couldn't legislate they decided to regulate,"" Upton said.
\
Arguing the EPA's enforcement would drive up electricity prices and eliminate jobs, Upton then introduced a bill to repeal the EPA's authority to regulate such emissions. It passed the Republican-controlled House but four similar measures, including one offered by U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, failed in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
\
The amendments' defeat in the Senate was expected but Upton said he was buoyed that 64 of the Senate votes were in favor of no less than a two-year moratorium on the EPA's restrictions. The votes would seem to indicate Upton has some support even in the Senate in his belief that the EPA over-stepped its bounds by adding greenhouse gases to the mix.
\
""The EPA can't act without the oversight of Congress,"" he said.
\
But it seemingly has, and its actions will have consequences, the congressman said.
\
""My committee just had testimony today (Friday) from DTE Energy CEO Tony Earley that some of the regulations the EPA is promoting would see the shuttering of 25 to 30 percent of coal operations within four years,"" he said.
\
Asked if EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson might be willing to compromise on the issue, Upton said she hasn't to this point. He's hoping her position softens, he said, arguing there's too much at stake.
\
""This is the biggest job killer ever in the United States,"" he said.

3,"As the debate about global warming continues, our national focus has shifted from whether something needs to be done, to what we should be doing. A number of entrepreneurially minded groups have come forward with ideas that could revolutionize the way we think about sustainable growth. From a cap-and-trade system to green buildings and products, the private sector has embraced the growing ecological awareness.\For example, venture capitalists have looked for opportunities to invest in and develop clean technologies. In fact, market analysts estimate that in the last few years more than $3 billion have been invested in clean technology companies. Indianapolis is one of the few Midwest cities that boast a venture capital fund devoted entirely to investing in clean technologies.\On the political side, President Bush recently announced a new environmental policy calling for halting the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. The next administration is likely to impose even more ambitious goals, as Sens. McCain, Clinton and Obama each has spoken in favor of some system to further regulate the emission of greenhouse gasses and to increase investment in renewable energy sources. A number of state and local governments have banded together to form multistate or regional compacts geared toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\Forward-thinking members of the business community are also looking to reduce their carbon footprint. Companies are participating in voluntary carbon trading systems, implementing sustainability policies, and assessing their energy sources and consumption through energy audits. The trend is so pervasive that even the Dow Jones has developed an index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which identifies and tracks sustainability business leaders on both a national and international level.\Companies, individuals and state government must each assess how these developments will impact growth opportunities or risk falling behind. The green and sustainable marketplace has already been established. These efforts and the resulting dialogue on alternative energy present a tremendous opportunity for businesses and entrepreneurs focused on providing technological and market-based innovation to this developing marketplace. To flourish in this green marketplace and become a truly ""sustainable"" economy, we all must embrace the green debate and critically evaluate the benefits and opportunities for our enterprises.\Alex Forman\Associate, Ice Miller LLP\Mike McNally\Associate, Ice Miller LLP\Indianapolis"

One of the most important events of our lifetimes may have just transpired. A federal agency has decided that it has the power to regulate everything, including the air you breathe.
\
Nominally, the Environmental Protection Agency's announcement last Friday only applies to new-car emissions. But pretty much everyone agrees that the ruling opens the door to regulating, well, everything.
\
According to the EPA, greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide -- the gas you exhale -- as well as methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. It is impossible to imagine a significant economic or human activity that does not involve the production of one of these gases. Cow flatulence is a serious concern of the EPA's already. What next? Perhaps an EPA mandarin will pick up a copy of ""The Greenpeace Guide to Environmentally Friendly Sex"" and go after the root causes of global warming.
\
Whether or not global warming is a crisis that warrants immediate, drastic action (I don't think it does), and whether or not such wholesale measures would be an economic calamity (they would be), the EPA's decision should be disturbing to people who believe in democratic, constitutional government.
\
Two years ago, the Supreme Court -- the least democratic branch of our formal government -- decided in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency could regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has launched its power grab over all that burns, breathes, burps, flies, drives and passes gas.
\
Yes, the head of the EPA reports to the president, which gives some patina of democratic accountability. Except the EPA is supposed to be politically autonomous, doing what it thinks best according to what President Obama calls ""sound science."" So the government bureaucracy is on its way to strong-arming the economy in ways Congress never imagined when it passed the Clean Air Act in 1970. Or the president has suddenly gained sweeping new powers over American life, in ways never imagined by Congress. This is not a sudden development. Vast swaths of the state have been on autopilot for years, effectively immune to democratic influence. The Federal Reserve, particularly of late, has been acting like the fourth branch of government. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, without congressional, presidential or court approval, has been committing trillions of dollars to fix the financial crisis. That may be warranted. But there's still something troubling about an institution so immune to democratic control.
\
In 2002, Congress created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It covers its expenses by taxing all publicly traded corporations. It alone determines the amount to tax, without approval of the White House or Congress, which, according to the Constitution, has the sole authority to levy taxes: ""All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives"" (Article 1, Section 7). In 1999, the Federal Communications Commission raised the so-called Gore tax on long-distance phone calls by 73 percent without seeking congressional approval. Lord knows what the EPA could collect by extorting ""climate criminals.""
\
In fairness, the Obama administration and congressional Democrats reportedly don't want to cede authority to the EPA. Rather, they want to use the threat of an EPA takeover -- and its presumably draconian impositions on business -- to force reluctant moderate Democratic and Republican members of Congress to sign on to the president's cap-and-trade scheme. California's Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has said as much: ""EPA, through its scientists, has given us a warning that global warming pollution is a clear, present and future danger to America's families. If Congress does not act to pass legislation, then I will call on the EPA to take all steps authorized by law to protect our families.""
\
Translation: Either you vote our way or we'll render voting meaningless.
\
Other Democrats are delighted by the EPA decision because it allows them to have their preferred policy -- carbon regulation -- without actually having to vote for it.
\
Either way, it doesn't sound like these folks take their oaths of office very seriously.

5,"I find it ironic that the same day (May 15) The Star published Gary Varvel's cartoon showing ""Cap and Trade"" beating up on ""Small Business,"" The Star also published Dana Hunsinger's article, ""Supermarkets stock up on energy savings."" She documents how the Nora Kroger has won an award from the Environmental Protection Agency by reducing energy in a number of ways including installing LED (low energy) lights in freezers.\I have a friend who is helping to grow a startup company that manufactures and sells LED lights to large commercial clients. His company is located here in Indiana.\If cap-and-trade legislation is passed and the cost of electricity rises, there will be a greater need for LED and other energy-saving innovations. This is great news for my friend and his company and other entrepreneurs willing to market products to meet the growing need. It's also great news for the environment if the rate of energy consumption growth is slowed.\Let's lead on this issue rather than make excuses. To the innovators will come the spoils.\Roland Bydlon\Indianapolis"
6,"On Thursday night, Richmond Power & Light officials Steve Saum, general manager; Harry Phillips, energy services director; and Phil Quinn, who as a Richmond Common Council member chairs the RP&L board of directors, answered questions from customers and the Palladium-Item as part of the weekly P-I Live! online show. These are excerpts from that chat. To view the complete transcript, log on to www.pal-item.com/chats/pilive.\*\Question: Let's talk for a minute on the status of Parallax (provides Internet and other services). Council had some tough questions some months back about its profitability.\Saum: Parallax has had a positive cash flow the past two months. They made their first payment on the loan last month.\Quinn: The board was pleased with the positive turnaround so far for Parallax. Several members also want to see a layout of future marketing efforts.\Question: When will Parallax expand to more remote locations? There is no high-speed of any kind in many areas of the county.\Saum: Parallax now uses wireless technology to reach customers out of town in remote areas. Service depends on the availability of signal from one of our towers. And like any other business, we need more than one customer to build and install a tower that will serve one person. The first step is to contact Parallax for information.\Question: Is the price of coal steady, and what's expected?\Quinn: It's as steady as the price at the pump. However, we are seeing a SLIGHT dip in coal prices, don't hang your hat on it. Steve and others are preparing for negotiations to try and limit price spikes.\Question: What is RP&L doing for the environment locally?\Phillips: Environmental Management System (EMS) Recycling -- RP&L has implemented a holistic companywide recycling program. RP&L collects eight cubic yards weekly of office waste and 2,000 to 3,000 pounds of electronic waste annually. Hybrid cars -- to date we have five hybrid vehicles. Earlham College Wind Solar Test Program P4P2 -- Partners for Pollution Prevention. Another highlight to this commitment was being awarded the Environmental Stewardship Company for 2006 by the Cope Environmental Center. RP&L has just completed construction on an $8 million baghouse, making this the largest environmental investment for the utility.\The baghouse was installed to eliminate the fine particulate emissions from the stack. We have reduced our emission by a factor of 10 with the baghouse.\We easily meet EPA standards for particulate emissions.\Question: What kind of dollar contingency reserves does RPL typically store and depend on for ice, wind, storms, per year? We got hit pretty hard last year.\Saum: We use our normal reserves for the storms. However, when we are declared a disaster area, we apply for relief money from the government. This last storm, Hurricane Ike, we received approximately $250,000 for our expenses. That, however, does not cover all costs and doesn't cover lost revenue.\Question: What is the maintenance fee on a residential bill of $10 used for?\Phillips: The easiest way to describe this is to visit our Web site http://www.rp-l.com/residentialrates.htm. This is a facility charge. Signing up on our Web site can give you a more complete view of your usage. It is a free service.\COMING SUNDAY\Cap and trade is the name given the Obama administration's energy plan intended to reduce carbon emissions, or greenhouse gases. But many legislators, notably Midwest legislators, and utility officials fear it could carry a steep price tag that will be passed along to utility customers. We'll learn more about cap and trade and the concerns from Indiana legislators and Richmond Power & Light officials."
7,"Imagine opening your electric bill to find your rates have risen by 79 percent, or pulling up to the fuel pump to find the cost of gasoline has doubled.\Would you complain to your elected officials?\If so, you might want to contact Sens. Evan Bayh and Richard Lugar immediately.\A debate is currently underway in the U.S. Senate on a proposal that will have a devastating impact on Indiana's economy. In a perhaps well intended, but poorly conceived, effort to reduce greenhouse gasses, Congress is poised to cap carbon emissions by fossil fuel users, particularly power plants.\If approved, utility companies emitting more CO2 than permitted would be forced to raise electric rates to buy or trade for allowances on the open market.\For Indiana, which relies on coal-fired plants to produce 96 percent of its electricity, the impact of so-called cap and trade legislation will be felt in lost jobs, reduced global competitiveness and skyrocketing costs to consumers and businesses.\While there might be a growing consensus about global warming, its causes remain the subject of spirited debate and the environmental impact of a unilateral move by the United States is questionable.\Many proponents point to carbon taxes imposed in Europe as a model for the U.S. The European experience has been incomplete at best.\The United Kingdom is facing energy shortages; Germany, which has some of the highest energy costs in Europe, is eyeing more nuclear power; and France's carbon tax has limited impact, because 80 percent of its power generation is already nuclear.\What has been conclusively proven is that the current Senate proposal will hit Hoosiers squarely in the wallet and will do so disproportionately harder than in most other states.\Independent assessments by the Heritage Center for Data Analysis evaluated the negative impacts of cap and trade on congressional districts. Among the 435 congressional districts nationwide, they identified eight of the 20 hardest hit are in Indiana.\The 4th Congressional District, which includes Lafayette, is projected to be the 14th hardest hit, and the 2nd Congressional District, which includes Delphi, is the second most negatively impacted district in America. It should come as no surprise that U.S. Reps. Steve Buyer and Joe Donnelley cast a bi-partisan ""no"" vote against cap and trade when it was considered by the U.S. House.\Now is the time to call upon both of our U.S. senators to do the same.\Diverse sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Heritage Institute have predicted that electric rates could increase from 44 to 129 percent; gas prices could raise from 61 cents to $2.53 per gallon, and 1.8 to 7 million jobs could be lost.\The Wall Street Journal called cap and trade the biggest tax in American history. This is a proposal that will not work for Indiana or the nation.\While the negative economic impact is certain, the environmental benefits are unproven. The fastest growing producers of CO2 emissions in the world, China and India, have announced they will not enact similar restrictions.\China uses more coal than the U.S., the European Union and Japan combined. India is close behind and is projected to overtake China in population by 2030.\A unilateral cap and trade effort by the U.S. would adversely raise energy and manufacturing costs in the U.S. while providing an edge to our global competition and a negligible reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.\Does this mean we should do nothing? No.\Opportunities exist to diversify our national energy portfolio, increase our energy security, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and encourage renewable and domestic energy sources.\Last session I authored SB 420 l which would have created a modest renewable energy standard in Indiana, broadened our use of alternative and renewable energy and maintained low electric rates.\The bill passed the Senate overwhelmingly, but died in the House.\Nonetheless, Indiana is leading the way in energy production with Duke's coal gasification plant under construction in Knox County, ongoing efforts to attract a multi-billion dollar synthetic natural gas plant to Spencer County and the passage of legislation supporting the growth of ethanol and biodiesel industries in the state.\Throughout Central Indiana, wind turbines and wind farms are being built, making Indiana the fastest growing wind energy state in the nation. Emerging battery research is occurring and managing our state's energy use through smartgrid technology has proven to reduce demand while being inexpensive.\All of these efforts will help our economy and our environment, and each has occurred without cap and trade.\State Sen. Brandt Hershman represents District 7, which includes parts of Tippecanoe, Carroll, White, Clinton, Jasper and Howard counties. He is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Tax and Fiscal Policy and is former chairman of the Committee on Utilities and Regulatory Affairs."

For the congressional candidates running in Indiana's 2nd District, energy policy is more than a plan for powering the machines in Americans' lives.
\
It's the nation's greatest opportunity to fuel a surge in the job market, not to mention shrink a key funding source for nations that may pose threats to U.S. security.
\
U.S. Rep. Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, said an all-American energy policy -- including oil, natural gas, clean coal and nuclear power as well as ethanol, biofuels and renewable sources such as solar and wind energy -- would be a huge boon to U.S. job growth.
\
""We spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year to buy energy from other countries,"" he said. ""Here in Indiana alone, an all-American energy policy would be about $5 billion a year invested in Indiana's economy, which would be a staggering job creator.""
\
Republican Jackie Walorski, a state representative, agreed that ""the jobs of the future are in energy production"" from all sources.
\
But she said Donnelly, who has talked about energy independence since before he was elected to his first term in 2006, hasn't achieved results.
\
""Here we are in 2010,"" Walorski said, ""just as reliant on foreign energy and with mandates coming down in a thing called cap and trade that are going to continue to keep those natural resources of ours in the ground.""
\
Mark Vogel, a Libertarian, said the government should let the free market decide which energy source is best.
\
""The federal government should play a hands-off role,"" he said. ""They shouldn't subsidize one source of energy over another. Let them all compete against each other.""
\
In 2008, Donnelly was one of 28 congressmen in a bipartisan group that crafted the National Conservation, Environment and Energy Independence Act. The bill was never approved, but it remains a potential blueprint to free the U.S. from dependence on foreign energy sources.
\
The bill was projected to generate an additional $2.6 trillion in royalty payments for the government over 10 years by opening up new areas for offshore oil drilling. About a third of that revenue would have been used to reduce the federal debt, another third to assist states with coastlines next to drilling areas and the final third for tax credits and other incentives for energy research and development.
\
Donnelly said those royalties would allow the federal government, without using taxpayer dollars, to foster advances such as technologies for clean-burning coal and nuclear power that produces less waste.
\
""I'm confident that, if we really go after this, we'll be in a position where, instead of importing energy, we can be exporting not only energy but also the technology that created it,"" he said.
\
Walorski agreed clean coal and nuclear power are key to the nation's energy future. But she added that the government should cut spending, lower taxes and reduce regulations to create an environment where the private market thrives and develops cleaner energy on its own.
\
""The government's job is not to come in and solve everything - they can't, they're not capable,"" she said. ""It's not bureaucrats who are going to solve these problems. It's the ingenuity of the American people who have always solved the problems.""
\
Vogel said politicians are not trustworthy or smart enough to decide which companies deserve incentives.
\
Both Donnelly and Walorski said the U.S. needs to allow more domestic oil and coal to be used. Coal produces nearly all of Indiana's electricity.
\
And, while Donnelly called for more offshore oil exploration, he said British Petroleum's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico highlights the need for federal regulators to do a better job of enforcing safety laws.
\
""What we need to do is have the least amount of regulations possible,"" he said, ""but have the amount of regulation needed so that companies like BP conduct themselves the right way.""
\
Walorski agreed companies need to be held accountable for damages like that in the Gulf of Mexico, but she also said the federal government should have acted more decisively when the spill occurred.
\
""The president reacted very slow to that and didn't come out with a the-buck-stops-here kind of mentality,"" she said.
\
Vogel said state governments should be responsible for responding to such disasters. The federal government should step in only if states ask for help, he said.
\
All three candidates are opposed to legislation known as cap and trade that is meant to address climate change.
\
Both Donnelly and Walorski are skeptical of manmade climate change. Vogel explicitly said he doesn't believe in it.
\
""I don't know to what degree it is created by man,"" Donnelly said, ""but I do know this: The less particulates and less materials we put into our environment the better off we'll be.""
\
Walorski said climate change research has ""gaping holes"" in it.
\
""When I was in college, they said we were in a global cooling period,"" she said. ""I emerged from college and got in the work force, and now they say we're in a global warming period.""

In Lewis Carroll's timeless book ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" Carroll created a character named The Mad Hatter. At the time Carroll wrote ""Alice"" in 1865, the phrase ""mad as a hatter"" had been common for at least 30 years. The phrase originated from an occupational hazard that exposed individuals who worked in the hat making industry to mercury.
\
Mercury, a powerful neurotoxin, was used to finish beaver and other furs in the hat-making process. Workers who were exposed to mercury vapors suffered mercury poisoning of their nervous systems, resulting in muscle tremors, twitching limbs, confused speech, hallucinations and other phsychotic symptoms. This tragic outcome was known as ""Hatter's syndrome.""
\
On Dec. 1, 1941, the U. S. Public Health Service brought an end to mercury's use by hat manufacturers, in part from pressure by the Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers Union. Unfortunately, many of the sites where hats were made remain poisoned by toxic levels of mercury.
\
Worse still, mercury continues to be dumped into our environment planet-wide to the peril of us all. Mercury is a component of all fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas. In addition to America's and other western countries' fossil-fuel addiction, the explosion of industry in China is giving rise to a proliferation of power plants whose emission standards are worse than U.S. power plants.
\
Our government warns us, especially children and women planning on bearing children, to limit consumption of fish. This leads to the quandary of how to get the health benefits of eating fish, which are naturally rich in Omega-3 fatty oils that are good for the heart and fetal brain development, and still protect ourselves and our children from mercury.
\
Warning us to limit fish consumption is ""a Band-Aid approach to the real problem,"" says Dr. Katherine Shea, a North Carolina pediatrician and environmental health consultant for Physicians for Social Responsibility, ""which is that fish shouldn't be polluted in the first place because they are such excellent sources of important nutrients.""
\
An ongoing study by Greenpeace revealed that 21 percent of women of childbearing age have unacceptably high levels of mercury in their bodies.
\
Many of us are keenly aware of the sharp rise in cases of autism in children. What was once a rare disorder, the Centers for Disease Control now calls an epidemic; one in every 166 children born today will be diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Autism is a disorder of the nervous system in which the individual is unable to process auditory, tactile and visual stimulation normally. Significant delays in language acquisition, resistance to change and often stereotypical patterns of behavior are some of the most common anomalies.
\
The Autism Research Institute, an advocacy group in San Diego, supports the idea that vaccines containing mercury-based preservatives are the primary source of mercury poisoning in autistic children. Studies, several financed by drug companies, refute these claims. However, the anecdotal evidence for mercury being a major culprit in the conundrum remains, particularly for autistic children who undergo experimental and risky chelation drug therapies which strip the body of mercury. Parents and physicians are beginning to report some promising results in the reduction of autistic behaviors, although this is still in the experimental stages and the drug therapies can cause damage to other systems of children's little bodies. Chelation therapy is also being used with some success for Alzheimer patients, suggesting that mercury may also play a role in some cases of this disorder as well.
\
So here we are. We know that mercury is a neurotoxin that can be dangerous to everyone (will our government tell us if the ""fine particles"" in an air quality alert include toxic mercury?) Evidence is beginning to point to a neurotoxin of some sort as being responsible for at least some of the rise in cases of autism. And what is being done about mercury emissions?
\
Although the technology exists to reduce, by at least 70 percent, mercury emissions by the coal, oil and gas industries by 2010, President Bush has promised these industries that they would have until 2018 to reach these caps. An EPA analysis indicates that the cap-and-trade portion of the plan could delay mercury reductions until 2025. That's 20 years from today. That's one more generation of women, their fetuses, your daughters, your children, your grandchildren and the rest of us who will continue to be exposed to mercury; a neurotoxin whose effects are cumulative and which our human bodies cannot get rid of naturally.
\
The question arises: if mercury is poisoning us all and it might at least partly explain the rise in neurological disorders, is Bush to blame? Of course not, at least, not entirely. We are all to blame; every time we turn on a light whose energy source comes from a coal-burning power plant or drive a vehicle, we put mercury into the air. Bush is simply catering to those who helped finance his election.
\
His constituents in the coal, oil and gas industries do not want to spend money on technology to reduce mercury emissions if they don't have to. Money rules. Those of us who don't pay attention to where the money comes from that funds the campaigns of the people we vote for; who don't contact our elected officials and demand cleaner energy sources; who invest in companies that pollute our air, land and water rather than renewable energy such as wind or solar, are to blame.
\
In Wonderland, Alice is frustrated when The Mad Hatter poses to her a riddle for which there is no answer. Here's a riddle for our times: Why are the profits of a few more important than the health of us all? For that I have no answer.

Indiana is a coal state. That much is clear.
\
More than 90 percent of Indiana's electricity comes from coal-fired power plants. Mines employ more than 3,200 workers in southern Indiana, according to state and federal regulators. The industry employs even more.
\
It is both obvious, then, and understandable that federal efforts to reduce coal consumption are a cause of great concern in the Hoosier state.
\
It's also obvious, of course, that the globe is warming - even as humanity's culpability in that warming is disputed by some.
\
When it comes to the science, U.S. Rep. Baron Hill, D-Seymour, and Republican challenger Todd Young are on opposite sides. Hill thinks climate change is man-made; Young, who speaks to those ""who are wrestling with the science,"" is not so sure.
\
That the two have taken different approaches to federal energy policy is, therefore, not very surprising. That both candidates defend their positions with the same pro-jobs, pro-environment argument might be.
\
Fundamentally, the bill - which was passed by the U.S. House in 2009, then stalled and maybe died in the U.S. Senate - created a marketplace where organizations could buy or sell the right to release pollution into the atmosphere.
\
Libertarian Greg Knott has criticized the bill as a misguided job killer, and believes the government should instead offer tax credits to help domestic energy sources including natural gas.
\
Hill is proud of his role in modifying the bill so that it would protect coal-dependent states such as Indiana while helping reduce levels of carbon in the atmosphere, he said.
\
The bill will create green jobs here while protecting the environment, Hill said. That companies like Duke Energy support the bill are proof that it isn't a destructive force.
\
""This is God's green Earth. We ought to protect it,"" Hill said during the Bloomington debate.
\
Young says he also wants to protect the environment, but he thinks the cap-and-trade bill doesn't work.
\
Global temperatures might fall by as few as 0.5 degrees Celsius over decades if it were to pass - and maybe not at all, Young said. If the bill causes countries such as China to build more and dirtier power plants that the U.S. otherwise would, there could be a negative net effect.
\
Young denounces the bill as ""possibly the largest tax increase in U.S. history,"" and claims it will kill 43,000 jobs in Indiana alone.
\
The Congressional Budget Office has indicated that coal-mining jobs would be hardest hit by the bill, but has also suggested it would create jobs in cleaner industries.
\
Hill wants to resurrect the House's cap-and-trade bill before the Environmental Protection Agency tries to seize carbon regulatory powers, he said. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling seems to have opened the door to that possibility.

Young does not believe the EPA will try to regulate carbon, he said. The ruling might give the EPA permission to regulate carbon, but does not give the agency a mandate, he said.

11,"Pro-life supporters should help others\Recently, this page has contained letters from two individuals who never have anything new to say about their pet subject -- ""pro-life,"" and yet feel compelled to expound on the ""evils"" of those who actually think beyond the life of the ""unborn child.""\One writer was so bold as to question the benefits of the stimulus plan -- I guess putting people to work wasn't ""pro-life"" enough.\Here's my challenge to them -- and to all others who feel they are ""pro-life."" Do something to help those humans who are actually here on Earth, and then write to tell about that.\Send a large check to the mother who has eight newborns and six others at home -- her address is in California, and she sure could use that money. Open a day-care center that is free to all families. All families -- no exceptions. Write letters extolling the virtues of Head Start to Congress -- tell them to fund that program to the fullest. Hold fundraisers for those local agencies that help handicapped individuals.\Be advocates of the proposed juvenile center. Those kids are most in need of help. Better yet, ask how you can help raise money. Volunteer for the Mental Health Association, Meals on Wheels or the Community Health Center. Open the doors of your church for an elder day-care center.\In other words, walk the talk -- work for those outside the womb too.\Gale Kvam\West Lafayette\Wheel tax is unfair for local drivers\As I stated during my 2002 campaign for county council, the wheel tax looks like a good idea on the surface but when you consider that Tippecanoe County has a large amount of workers from other counties it is not a true user fee.\So in my modest opinion, it is an unfair tax upon the county drivers. Maybe a better idea would be fees for builders and developers of commercial/residential spaces, and maybe they might think about using some of the empty buildings that we have all over our county, decreasing our eyesores of failed businesses or businesses that move to ""greener pastures.""\I request that our county officials start looking out for all of the citizens, not just a select few.\David Fulks\Lafayette\Stop playing video games and exercise\In response to ""New video games for kids provide workouts in disguise,"" I feel we are giving too much credit to these games. I own a Nintendo Wii and believe these games can be beneficial with moderate use.\Whatever happened to kids using their imaginations and playing outside? Those days seem to diminish with the use of video games and computers.\Sixteen percent of the people between the ages of 6 and 19 are overweight, so there is a definite problem. Maybe parents should encourage their children to be more active by being more active themselves.\As a parent of twins and a student, I understand how difficult it can be to ensure an active lifestyle for our children while juggling such a busy schedule. But it is our responsibility to do so, not video games.\The new technology can serve a good purpose but are we going overboard with it?\Mallory MarcAurele\Lafayette\School provides education and faith\I'm writing in response to the Feb. 25 article ""Private school gets new name.""\It's good for more parents to find out about the new Tippecanoe Christian School. I didn't know where the Christian school was until two years ago, and I have lived in the Lafayette area for 13 years. It's also a good school for kids since it's a Christian school.\Like Shelby Swanson-Cox (mother of two students) said, ""They get a quality education in small class sizes and what is taught is Christian-based.""\I'm Christian, so I think more kids should attend a Christian school to understand the Bible.\Ulises Gutierrez\West Lafayette\State should adopt a one-year budget\There is no reason for the state budget to be a two-year spending plan.\With the way the economy is, no one knows what the situation will be like in six months, let alone an entire year.\Some people think that if we did the one-year budget, it would lead to a full-time legislature and cause more spending or tax hikes. I do not believe this argument. I think the people who say that a one-year budget would lead to more taxes and a full-time legislature are afraid of the little extra work that is involved with going with the one-year plan.\A one-year budget can be reevaluated at the end of the year and decide how well we, as a state, are doing and where to go from there.\John D. Mishler\Lafayette\Say 'no' to cap and trade carbon policy\The Democrats in Congress think they are on a roll after passing the recent stimulus bill. But we can't let the urgent economic needs of this country create a snowball effect of bad legislation.\One example of such a mistake is the push for a cap and trade carbon policy. This would create an artificial market open to manipulation and speculation, without the assurance of doing anything for the environment.\I don't know how legislators can even bring up such a scheme at a time when millions of Americans are out of work and businesses are struggling to survive. A cap and trade policy would add billions of dollars in energy costs, without reducing emissions. In addition, it would require the creation and funding of a government bureaucracy to try to regulate against speculators.\When there aren't real market forces to contain prices, regulation and oversight are the only options. But as we have seen with recent financial scandals and the speculative run-up in the price of oil last summer, regulation and oversight don't work. Investors lost their entire life savings in the case of financial scandal.\Instead, we need a simple, transparent carbon tax that will reduce our emissions, without the political ""gaming.""\We cannot afford the additional costs and resultant loss of jobs the cap and trade scheme would bring. Congress must stand firm against this bad idea.\Paul Hoffman\West Lafayette\More diverse group needed in story\I find it unfortuanate that the article published Wednesday, Feb. 25, in the J&C titled ""Locals hear positive notes in address"" couldn't find a wider representation of people to interview.\Perhaps people in different age groups might have had a little different opinion as they watch their life savings shrinking.\I hope the young lady who ""feels better about her future"" still fells good as she and her generation work to pay off the debt.\Eleanor Mlynarik\West Lafayette\Faith restored by a show of respect\Recently while traveling down the hill from West Lafayette on Sagamore Parkway, I witnessed a funeral procession coming from the opposite direction up the hill. As I watched in my rearview mirror, I saw something which restored my faith in people. Every car that came upon the procession, when realizing what the line of cars was, automatically dropped in line behind them. Not a single car passed them.\This brought back a memory of an incident that happended as the funeral procession was making its way to the cemetery for my dad several years ago. I'll never forget the feeling it gave me. A crew was repaving a highway outside of Veedersburg. As our procession approached, every worker shut off their machine, climbed down, removed their hard hats, and stood at attention as we passed. The respect shown to my family and father at that sad time is something I can't describe. The paving company should be very proud of the integrity and kindness of these employees. If any of them are reading this, may God bless you.\Gail L. Jackson\Lafayette"
12,"President Barack Obama took office a year ago today with an approval rating of 68 percent.\Today, his approval rating is at 50 percent, which critics cite as evidence of Obama's failure. The president's supporters, however, point to that poll and declare his first year a success, comparing the approval rating to Ronald Reagan's after his first year.\Peel away the politics from the hype over Obama's one-year job reviews, and an objective analysis is that he hasn't done as well as his supporters claim, but he hasn't done as poorly as his critics suggest.\Obama campaigned that he would end the war in Iraq, pursue terrorists in Afghanistan, close the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay and end controversial interrogation practices. He pledged to restore the country's economic vitality, reduce unemployment, reform health care and curb greenhouse gas emissions. He also vowed to restore the prestige of the United States in the world's eyes.\He didn't say he would do it all in 12 months.\On the war front: The war in Iraq is winding down, the fight in Afghanistan is heating up, and he has ended U.S. use of controversial interrogation practices.\He missed his deadline to close Gitmo, which is still open. News reports indicate it has about 200 prisoners.\Obama's signature first-year issue, health care reform, has muddled through the House and Senate without much guidance from the White House. The two versions are now being reconciled in closed-door meetings with Democrats, instead of the open dialogue Obama vowed during the campaign.\The economic stimulus package which was Obama's first challenge passed within weeks of his inauguration. Now halfway through the two-year spending plan, it has not checked rising unemployment.\Legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is stalled in the Senate, and a world summit on the environment late last year produced no meaningful agreement.\Obama is not the first president to campaign on promises of change and hope, only to find daunting tasks and a toxic Washington environment. He won't be the last.\A fair critique of the last year is that Obama has tried to take on too many issues and met political rivals with political sandbagging. The result is that his administration has few accomplishments and the poisonous partisan atmosphere in Washington continues unabated.\The economy needs to be the top priority in the coming year. Whatever happens with health care legislation or the cap-and-trade bill is now secondary to nurturing job creation. Ten percent of working Americans need jobs. Fix that, and much of the rest will begin to fall into place."
13,"eweddle@jconline.com\A new policy institute at Purdue University aims to put the school's experts to work in helping communities around the world solve thorny problems requiring the latest research.\The Global Public Policy Institute received its first public unveiling Friday at a meeting of the Purdue University Board of Trustees.\The institute will provide research void of personal and political views to policy makers and help others secure grants to tackle multidisciplinary problems.\""Purdue's challenge is that it is not necessarily on the map with those who build our roads, or protect our water, and everything else that affects our lives,"" said Carolyn Curiel, chief of staff for president France Cordova.\She said the institute will elevate Purdue faculty as authorities on issues that affect communities of all sizes, from local towns to the United Nations.\The institute will focus on four areas:\life, health and family\energy, environment and climate change\cyber and other forms of security issues\civil society and leadership.\Topics mentioned as research examples included pandemic preparation, cap-and-trade analysis, homeland security and community resilience.\Helping Curiel map out the plan were Laurel Weldon, associate professor political science, and Joe Pekny, director of the e-Enterprise Center.\During this year they've attracted a group of faculty ready to sign on, including Eugene Spafford, a professor and executive director of Purdue's Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security.\The institute would be a presidential initiative, meaning it does not require formal trustees' approval, Curiel said. Starting a global public policy institute is part of Cordova's strategic plan.\Precise costs for the institute are not yet known, although during the presentation examples were given of peer schools with institutes that run from $1 million to $4 million a year.\""We are proposing a policy institute that follows Purdue's DNA,"" Pekny said. ""And by that, it is to do a lot with little.""\Students would be part of the institute through research and possibly through degree programs in public policy.\Plans are moving forward to identify an interim director for the institute."
14,"I would like to answer Scott Wiseman's recent letter on regulating mercury emissions from power plants. He argues that the federal mercury rule (known as CAMR) is a ""balanced approach to reducing mercury emissions."" For Indiana's power plants CAMR requires a 15-percent reduction by 2010 and then a 66 percent reduction by 2018.\Because CAMR allows banking of emission credits, which Wiseman favors, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the 66-percent reduction will not be achieved until 2025. The Hoosier Environmental Council's proposed alternative requires a 90-percent reduction by 2010. From 2010 to 2025, Indiana's power plants would emit tens of thousands of pounds more mercury under CAMR, and they would continue to emit 1,200 pounds more per year from then on.\Wiseman argues that ""cap and trade"" is a beneficial feature of CAMR. With cap and trade some power plants will be able to purchase allowances rather than reduce emissions of mercury. Under the proposal for a 90-percent reduction, all power plants would reduce emissions. There is growing evidence that the uneven emissions allowed by CAMR will cause local areas of higher mercury. For this reason, the cap-and-trade feature was recently criticized by the EPA Office of the Inspector General.\Wiseman is concerned about the cost of electricity if mercury emissions are reduced by 90 percent. According to the State Utility Forecasting Group at Purdue University, the 90-percent reduction would cost 3 to 3.4 percent more than CAMR in the initial years, after which the difference goes down to 2.14 percent. Even with this increase, Indiana's rates for electricity would still be well below the national average. I think it is worth this small increase to prevent the release of mercury, which is a highly toxic material.\Indra Frank, M.D.\Chair, Committee on Health and the Environment\Hoosier Environmental Council\Indianapolis"
15,"Gov. Mitch Daniels and U.S. Reps. Mike Pence and Steve Buyer have some significant non-allies in their vehement opposition to the carbon reduction legislation now moving through Congress.\Among them are most of the Midwest's governors, who already have signed a regional cap-and-trade agreement; and Indiana's largest electric utility, whose boss accepts the need for congressional action and insists it will benefit rather than punish this coal-dependent region -- if the region's leadership pulls up to the table.\The legislation already has undergone modification to ease fears of spiking energy costs. It undoubtedly is in for more. Yet Daniels and the congressmen have staked out positions of two-fisted defiance, accusing coastal states of ""declaring economic war on the Midwest"" (Pence) and ""seeking to exploit politically weaker colonies in order to prop up their own decaying economies"" (Daniels).\Their worry about the costs and risks of reducing coal dependence is shared by the nation's third-largest consumer of coal. But when James Rogers, chairman of Duke Energy Corp., testified before Congress May 19, it was not in opposition. For the nation and the Midwest, he declared, huge dollars stand to be gained, not lost.\""I understand the arguments against action on energy and climate with concerns focused on the economy,"" Rogers said. ""However, the reality is we can't afford not to act if we hope to compete and lead. The right comprehensive energy and carbon legislation can provide not only the certainty and rules of the road by which we can plan, build and compete, it will also protect consumers, help us advance efficiency and alternative technology efforts, and all while cleaning up the environment. The sooner Congress provides a clear set of rules, the sooner investments can be made.""\He cited a study that projects low-carbon energy markets to reach $450 billion a year by 2012. ""Without a U.S. carbon program, we will not be participating in this lucrative market.""\Ann Murtlow, president of Indianapolis Power & Light Co., agrees that the industry needs certainty. ""Climate change legislation is political reality,"" she says. ""It is in our best interests to make sure it's done in a way that not only gives the desired economic benefits, but at the lowest cost.""\Clearly, coal will reign in Indiana for many years to come; but the costs of burning it will rise -- along with the economic and environmental benefits of alternative energy. That makes it plain good business to shrink coal's slice of the pie. As proponents, such as Rogers and Rep. Baron Hill, a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, acknowledge, the transition will be difficult; but obstinacy is not an option."
16,"We need health care legislation that reduces costs, guarantees a choice of doctors and ensures quality, affordable care. A public option is vital if those objectives are to be achieved.\Opposition to the public option is emerging in large measure from the thousands of people employed in the insurance industry whose main objective is to preserve their own highly paid jobs, and who, in too many instances, are required to tell ""beneficiaries"" what is not covered in their plans and who must cancel insurance for people who become ill.\For some years now, I have been covered by Medicare and the Purdue Retirees Health Care supplement plan offered by PacifiCare, and I couldn't be more satisfied with the Medicare portion of the plan. It has been quick and efficient, and I have seen a variety of doctors of my own choosing.\When we have more than 45 million uninsured people in this country, we risk calamity in the form of illnesses that could grow into epidemics because those with no insurance cannot afford to seek a doctor's advice and may be too proud to show up at an emergency room until they are at death's door. By then, their illness may have been transformed into an incurable or highly infectious problem. We need an affordable, expanded public health option that works like Medicare, is supplemented by private health insurance, promotes healthful living, is preventive and is not primarily oriented to skimming off only the healthiest people while canceling those who become ill or who have pre-existing conditions.\Richard C. Nelson\West Lafayette\Forum didn't tackle cap and trade issue\Climate change is a very hot topic these days, and I appreciate the Lugar Center for Renewable Energy and Environment America sponsoring a panel discussion recently at the IUPUI campus in Indianapolis.\The panelists discussed how Indiana is already a leader in wind and solar power generation. Benton County has nearly 650 wind turbines approved and under construction. SunRise Solar is an Indiana company which is increasing sales and revenues each year and cannot manufacture solar attic fans fast enough. Its president, Bill Keith, made the comment that this growth is without any sort of government handout. Another panelist, Dr. Gabriel Filippelli, chairman of the earth sciences Department at IUPUI, discussed the dire consequences posed by climate change.\I was disappointed, however, that no representatives of Indiana's manufacturing or electricity community were on the panel. There is no question that the current ""cap and trade"" proposal would disproportionately affect Indiana very negatively, which is why the majority of Indiana's congressional delegation (both Democrat and Republican) voted against this onerous piece of legislation (to my amazement it was supported by Rep. Andre Carson and Rep. Baron Hill).\When an audience member asked the panelists about the cap and trade bill, none of them gave a glowing endorsement of the legislation.\Most people agree something must be done to address the critical issue of climate change, but the current proposals are not the solution and will place a huge financial burden on businesses and consumers for a miniscule reduction in CO2 emissions.\Colin Miller\West Lafayette"

Just consider the two brand new modest-sized hospitals with competing emergency rooms built a mile or so apart on the same side of town.

It would burden the U.S. taxpayer with billions of additional dollars on top of ""economic stimulus,"" TARP, automotive corporate bailouts and socialized health care.\Haven't we had enough government intervention in our lives?\C. Smith\West Lafayette\If we try, Indiana could be at the top\While methodology varies among different studies, Indiana is consistently rated among the states with the worst environmental quality.\An October 2007 ranking of environmental quality by ""Forbes"" magazine placed Indiana 49th, ahead of only West Virginia. My first reactions to this news were embarrassment and shame.\But then I thought about the money, time and effort it would take to improve our environment. I also realized that people feel the need to think that the place where they live is special.\So I reached this conclusion: Instead of improving our ranking, why not try to be dead last? Indiana has already done so much to earn that ranking, but there's always room for ""improvement.""\C'mon, Hoosiers! Let's wallow our way to the top of the heap!\Dump things into waterways that don't belong there. Litter. Decrease or stop funding for transportation infrastructure for anything other than private motor vehicles.\Rely on dirty, antiquated coal-fired plants for electricity (currently 96 percent) and fight hard to prevent efforts to make existing plants cleaner. Keep subsidizing polluting industries. Keep electing political leaders who are shills for polluters and remove the ones with good environmental records.\Or we could use our minds and hearts to figure out how to change things for the better.

Indiana, because of decreasing revenues, is facing a kind of economic famine, and Gov.

A successful curriculum is one that promotes and encourages creativity, develops skills for advancing innovation in the workplace and ensures a diverse worker pool that can adapt quickly to changing economic conditions. Once cuts in education are made, it is not easy to recover, especially in the short term.\Equally short-sighted is the idea that ""special programs"" such as library, art, music, physical education and so on can be cut without seriously affecting the overall educational output. This simply is not true. Such programs are the lifeblood for insuring the kinds of skills mentioned above.\Schools are making sincere and mostly successful efforts to improve what they do, but serious budget reductions will weaken any gains made. State Superintendent Tony Bennett is proposing an A to F grading scale for the schools, but in effect is saying, ""We want you to be better, but with fewer tools available.""\No one likes increased taxes, but paying for vital programs may require just that.

He is a big supporter of a cap-and-trade system he says will spur job growth and help the environment.\With all due respect, he is wrong.\This legislation will do little to help our global climate. In fact, it will force manufacturers to seek production facilities elsewhere, mainly in countries which have little or no environmental laws, which could actually lead to an increase in global emissions. The huge burden this legislation would put on our economy is even worse. According to the Heritage Foundation, a House-passed cap-and-trade bill would cost Indiana almost 30,000 jobs per year and increase electricity costs for the average household by over $500.\Now, because this legislation is stalled in the U.S. Senate, the Obama administration, through the EPA, is threatening to do even more harm through administrative regulations.

He said many companies would relocate to those places, where it would be cheaper to operate emissions-producing factories.\Indiana's Democratic Party chairman said Daniels, by delivering the radio address, appeared more interested in raising his national stature than in tending to the state's needs.\""The governor should focus a little more on the state budget and creating jobs in Indiana and less on federal issues,"" said party Chairman Dan Parker. ""He should deal with his job of being governor of Indiana and let those who have been elected to Washington do their jobs.""\Parker questioned Daniels' often-asserted pledge that he has no political plans beyond serving out his term.\""Maybe the governor's ambitions are a little bit bigger than he thinks,"" Parker said.\The state's Republican Party chairman, however, said profound ramifications for Indiana force the governor to get involved in the debate over national energy policy.\""To ignore what's happening in Washington with this radical and wrong-headed 'cap and trade' idea would do a great disservice to ordinary Hoosiers and businesses,"" said party Chairman Murray Clark. ""It would be awful for Indiana. It would create extraordinary hardships with respect to electric bills and energy costs.""\Daniels' tone toward Obama was respectful, Clark said, adding that he hoped the president was listening.\""This extraordinarily inexperienced president would do well to look to Mitch Daniels for advice and direction rather than Nancy Pelosi and the other big-government Democrats in Congress,"" Clark said.\The Democrats' bill would require a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 and an 83 percent reduction by midcentury. It could go before the full House this summer.\Under a cap-and-trade provision, polluters would be able to buy and sell emission allowances.

20,"
Congressman Fred Upton has seen the light. And it's incandescent.
\
Upton, the St. Joseph Republican congressman representing Michigan's 6th District, was a leading advocate of a 2007 federal law to phase out the traditional incandescent light bulbs that go back to Thomas Edison's design and require energy-efficient options, like those curly fluorescent bulbs.
\
Now he seeks repeal of that law.
\
Environmental groups savage Upton, claiming that he sold his environmental soul for a powerful chairmanship in a House where the tea party, disbelieving threats of global warming, calls the shots. More than bulbs are in the spotlight.
\
In a recent interview in his congressional office in Washington, Upton said those groups shouldn't have been surprised by his efforts as chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to halt Environmental Protection Agency plans to regulate carbon emissions.
\
""I led the fight against Cap and Trade,"" said Upton, referring to the Obama administration plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
\
""It should be no surprise that I'm not going to approve rules and regulations that are going to send our jobs someplace else,"" Upton said. ""My focus has always been jobs and the economy.""
\
He argued that proposed EPA regulations would devastate the economies of Indiana and Michigan, ship more U.S. jobs to China and India, cost the United States $90 billion a year and have scant effect on global warming. ""Less than one-tenth of one degree over 100 years,"" he contended.
\
""It's not going to happen on my watch,"" Upton said.
\
A recent Chicago Tribune article on Upton suggested that his watch now is from a tea party rather than moderate viewpoint on global warming and the environment. The American Lung Association targeted him with a critical billboard in his district. The Sierra Club has run critical TV ads.
\
Does all this criticism bother him?
\
No, Upton said, because he actually has been able as chairman to win bipartisan support for much of the legislation going through the committee and because allegations, such as in the Chicago Tribune that he had ""to reinvent himself"" to snare the chairmanship, are off base.
\
After Republicans won control of the House last fall, a battle ensued for chairman of Energy and Commerce -- Upton vs. Texas Rep. Joe Barton, who had been top Republican on the committee.
\
Barton, clearly no environmentalist, actually apologized to a BP official for the ""shakedown"" to get the oil giant to pay for the Gulf spill. Barton faced enforcement of a term limit for top committee Republican.
\
But Upton faced complaints by some conservatives that he was too moderate because of efforts to work with centrist Democrats to find common ground.
\
Upton cited his long reputation as a hawk on deficit reduction. He was a hawk back when President George W. Bush and most House Republicans were ignoring deficits.
\
Upton cited his strong opposition to Cap and Trade.
\
Upton cited his steady opposition to the Obama health care reform and desire to repeal it or starve it to death.
\
Upton won the chairmanship. Now he is on the bipartisan ""super committee"" to seek a solution to the nation's fiscal mess. He wouldn't have been appointed to that if he had lost the chairmanship.
\
Light bulbs?
\
Barton railed against the 2007 law and its scheduled Jan. 1 start for phasing out incandescent bulbs and use instead of what he called ""squiggly tailed CFLs."" Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, organizer of the House tea party caucus and presidential aspirant, scoffed at the view of scientists on global warming and denounced the light bulb law as governmental overreach.
\
Upton promised to reconsider.
\
He did. And he voted to repeal the 2007 law on bulbs. The vote was 233 for repeal, 193 against it.
\
But how many members of Congress does it take to change a light bulb?
\
Well, 233 weren't enough. Repeal was considered under rules requiring a two-thirds vote.
\
For him, Upton said, it was no big issue, not like the debt ceiling. And now the work of that 12-member ""super committee.""
\
Meanwhile, Upton said, Energy and Commerce has been moving bills on the environment with bipartisan support, including a pipeline safety bill sponsored by Upton and Michigan Democrat John Dingell.
\
The bulb battle isn't over. There will be more repeal or delay attempts.
\
Upton, with a light switch, has seen the light -- incandescent now. And those environmental groups insist that instead he is in the dark.

"
21,"
SOUTH BEND -- Mayor Stephen Luecke this week announced the city will seek federal stimulus money to create a new office of energy charged with lowering city government's energy costs while helping the environment.
\
Luecke said the city anticipates receiving an initial grant of $250,000 that will cover a full-time director of energy's salary over three years, along with programming costs that include stipends for six college interns.
\
After the three years, the new city office would be funded by cost savings created through energy consumption cuts, Luecke said.
\
Luecke said the city will immediately start searching for the director but won't hire the individual until the grant money is secured.
\
If the U.S. Department of Energy funds the initial grant, the new director would have 120 days to submit a plan on how it would spend another $800,000 in federal stimulus money on projects over the three years, he said.
\
The director will receive input and advice from a 60-member Green Ribbon Commission, containing a mix of private and public sector employees, that Luecke selected earlier this year.
\
The commission is co-chaired by Jim Mazurek and Mike Keen, directors of sustainability at the University of Notre Dame and Indiana University South Bend, respectively.
\
Luecke said the city now spends about $7 million a year on energy. Based on estimates derived from other communities, the city expects the new projects could trim energy spending by 25 percent, lowering annual energy costs to $5 million.
\
Possible uses of the $800,000 from federal stimulus funds might include:
\
* Replacing some city vehicles, such as those used by code enforcement inspectors, with hybrid models that consume less gasoline.
\
* Making city buildings more energy-efficient.
\
* Replacing street lights with energy-saving light-emitting diode bulbs.
\
Luecke and city public works director Gary Gilot said they also hope establishing the new office could help the city attract more stimulus-funded green energy grants in the future.
\
That money could help pay for a new hydroelectric dam near the Century Center. A consultant believes turbines there could generate power to run the city's wastewater treatment plant, potentially creating indirect savings for sewer customers.
\
It also could fund the planting of more trees to increase the city's urban forest canopy for potential carbon cap-and-trade credits, Gilot said.
\
The announcement comes a week after the city's Common Council passed a new 0.95 percent local income tax to replace property tax revenue lost to state-enacted cuts. Luecke said even with the new income tax revenue, the city will need to lay off employees next year and trim about $6 million in spending.
\
He said the new announcement is not inconsistent with those problems. For one thing, it's federal money, and it also will turn initial expenditures into long-term savings, he said.
\
""This position will save money in the long run, pay for itself, and because of the cost savings, will allow us to reduce the cost of city government,"" Luecke said. ""It seems to me this is exactly what people are asking us to do.""
\
He said the city of Ann Arbor's Energy Office has cost about $1 million to operate during the past decade, but has achieved about $7 million in energy savings.

Sensory friendly films
\
To the editor:
\
My thanks to AMC Theaters for bringing to Bloomington ""sensory friendly"" films for families affected by autism.
\
This program provides the opportunity for families to enjoy films in a safe and accepting environment. The auditoriums have their lights up and the sound turned down. And audience members are invited to get up and move, shout or sing.
\
The idea for the program began with a request from a parent with an autistic child for a special screening in Columbia, Md. More than 300 people attended the first screening. The program is now offered nationwide at select theaters.
\
I attended last month with friends. We got to see ""Legend of the Guardians."" The showing was a huge success. Please make sure families that you know (there are an estimated 1.5 million Americans living with an autism spectrum disorder) are aware about these opportunities.
\
This may be the very first time a family that is affected by autism get to attend a movie together. Coming up in November and December are Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia.
\
For more information, a schedule, or to request AMC Sensory Friendly Films in your area, visit amctheatres.com. To learn more about autism, visit autism-society.org.

I find it amazing that after paying for season football, as well as season basketball tickets, that I can't listen to the games when I am out of town on business, without paying more money for the online broadcast. What a way to establish a fan base. What a joke!

Indian Creek election
\
To the editor:
\
This is an appeal to the voters of Indian Creek Township; do the research before you vote Nov. 2. Please put aside any negative information you have heard. Each individual who ran in the spring election and those running in the fall election are intelligent and qualified to serve the township. Let's face it people, the election in Indian Creek this year is not for the person running, it's for which fire department you want to give you tax money to.
\
I have family in the township; therefore, I want to know that the fire department that serves the township is as qualified as possible. I want to be assured that the there will be more that one qualified EMT on the department. I want to know that the firefighters have met the required certification.
\
I urge you to contact the candidates, find out which department they support and why. Then contact the fire departments; see their credentials. Then if you still need more research, check out www.mycase.in.gov, to see if everyone on the department can legally serve on the department. There is nothing wrong in demanding that your tax money be spent for the best protection possible.

Hill supported
\
To the editor:
\
I have been an independent voter who has voted for candidates from a variety of parties for 42 years.
\
Baron Hill, during this last term, had the courage to be involved with work on three very important issues - health care, energy/climate change and governmental spending.
\
With health care, Rep. Hill stood up to his party's leaders in order to help create a more fiscally responsible bill.
\
Of 255 Democrats, Baron Hill rated as the ninth most independent. No matter the party, I think this shows integrity in character.
\
In addition, Hill wrote in the House of Representatives the PAYGO legislation, which will force Congress to balance its budget by offsetting any new or increased spending. This law gives Congress a practical way to achieve some fiscal responsibility.
\
It is a relief for me to have a congressional representative who understands the reality of climate change and who voted for the house version of a cap and trade bill to reduce climate warming emissions. The cap and trade strategy is the same one that successfully helped reduce emissions that produced acid rain.
\
I am happy to support Baron Hill, a man who works for practical and fiscally responsible solutions to some major challenges of our time.

Vote on Nov. 2
\
To the editor:
\
I believe we are a product of our environment. As an orphan, I had things pretty rough before I was 21/2, when I was adopted by an interesting couple who were unable to have children of their own. ""Interesting"" because: She was German. He was Polish. She was Lutheran. He was Roman Catholic. She was prim and proper. He was a roughneck. But, they were both Republicans.
\
They had their own special routine when it came to voting. They voted together, right after Dad got home from work, and then the three of us would go out for supper. Yay!
\
My mother was 101 years old on Oct. 24. As she got up there in years, the party would offer to send a traveling board to her home. ""Are you kidding?"" she'd say. She was going to go vote in person. I happened to mention to her recently about the controversy here regarding ""satellite"" voting. She said, ""What? They're going to vote in space now?"" Uh, not exactly.
\
What better way can I honor my mother and dad, but by going to the polls on Nov. 2 and voting my upbringing, as well as my conscience.

Think and vote
\
To the editor:
\
Emboldened by the Supreme Court's ""money equals speech"" decision, veiled partisan groups are pouring unprecedented millions into this year's elections, most going into television ads.
\
Maybe American voters haven't noticed, but TV advertising is a world of talking soap bottles, cookie elves, insurance companies devoted only to our happiness, and bears that use toilet paper when they poop in the woods.
\
Television programming itself discourages critical thought, its messages coming so dense and swift that they overlap each other, making it the worst kind of forum for something as consequential as elections. (And few Americans know that we own the very airwaves the broadcasting corporations have usurped to huckster and delude us.)
\
I never wanted to swallow H.L. Mencken's cynical statement that ""nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people."" But if we're gullible enough to believe anything from a medium that says bears choose the softest toilet paper, it will prove Mencken was right.
\
Please, citizens: Turn off the TV. Read, remember, and think before Election Day.

A year of change
\
To the editor:
\
There's a classic scene in the film ""Network"" where Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty) has a private conversation with Howard Beale (Peter Finch) describing to Howard how the world really works.
\
During the first few months of Obama's presidency, there was much excitement; hope of reform filled the air. But then, during the fall of last year, his demeanor suddenly changed; i.e. he began speaking more carefully, parsing his words so they became ambiguous; taking longer to make decisions; began to sound more like a Democratic operative than an agent of change; began towing the political line of our dysfunctional two-party system; all talk of change ceased.
\
What happened last fall is that representatives of those who hold the real power had a private meeting with him, and explained to him what was what and who was who, and that he was going to do what he was told. Americans have noticed this change in the president - one reason why his approval ratings have been falling. Voting in November won't make any difference because those elected will be Democrats or Republicans and they will act only in the interest of maintaining their power, no matter how much it hurts our country.

Politicians fail us
\
To the editor:
\
Let me start by stating that I have already voted. However, I wonder why I took the trouble to vote for those vying for national Congressional positions. Regardless of political party, the legion of lobbyists on ""K"" Street in Washington, D.C. will ply them with cash, junkets, dinners, family vacations and ""fact-finding"" flights to warm places.
\
We do the voting, hoping to send people to the nation's capital who will do our business. Even with the best of intentions, these folks end up doing the business of corporate organizations. For example, when Medicare was altered to allow people like me to get help with prescription costs, the people writing the rules were employees of pharmaceutical companies. No wonder there is a ""donut hole"" in the way the benefits are handled.
\
The recently passed federal health care legislation could have been very helpful to millions of U.S. citizens. The health insurance industry spent millions to make sure that a public option would not be passed. What we ended up with is overly complex and most of it doesn't take effect for years. If we judge this country by how we treat our weakest citizens, we get a failing grade.

Fair Tax plan
\
To the editor:
\
I received in the mail yesterday a flier stating that Todd Young, if elected to replace Baron Hill, will support ""a new 23 percent sales tax on everything we buy."" This is not true! What Todd Young, and over 10 percent of the current U.S. congress, wants to do is to completely eliminate the federal tax structure, replacing it with a national sales tax of 23 percent on the purchase of services and new items (not used).
\
The Fair Tax plan will eliminate all federal taxes, such as income, social security, capital gains, inheritance, etc. This Fair Tax plan also provides for a 'pre-bate' for all taxes paid up to the federal poverty level. It means that every household will receive a check to cover basic sales taxes. It means that everyone who finds ways to not pay taxes, such as illegal immigrants and criminals, will pay their fair share. It means that the IRS will be abolished and we won't file taxes in April. It means corporations will want to move their operations back to the U.S. from overseas and hire new employees. There are more benefits of the Fair Tax. Read the book, The Fair Tax. Visit www.fairtax.org. Don't believe Baron Hill.

23,"Our position is: State officials should consider ordering a faster cleanup of mercury pollution.\Federal regulations announced this week may not lead to significant reductions of mercury pollution for decades. That's a serious problem in a state where fish caught in most local waterways are unsafe to eat, especially for children and pregnant women. And where coal-fired power plants each year spew out 2.5 tons of mercury. Indiana ranks fourth in the nation in mercury emissions.\For those reasons, the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board should study the feasibility of ordering a faster cleanup. Six states already have imposed tougher limits. Others, including Illinois, are considering such steps.\Mercury builds up in the environment, harming the cardiovascular and immune systems of adults and impairing the neurological development of fetuses and newborns.\Although the new rule announced by the Bush administration will cut mercury emissions in half by 2020, even the General Accounting Office, the Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general and an EPA advisory group say the regulations don't move fast enough or go far enough.\While cap and trade provisions of the new mercury policy provide needed flexibility for utilities, they might be used to delay cleaning up Indiana power plants. State regulators ought to discourage that by allowing the cost of pollution control equipment, but not pollution credits, to be passed along to ratepayers.\Brian Wright, coal policy director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, says that 90 percent of mercury from power plant emissions could be eliminated within five years at a cost of less than $2 a month to ratepayers by requiring equipment that injects activated carbon in the smokestacks of coal burning power plants.\Utility officials argue that the technology isn't wholly proven, and deploying it along with other required pollution controls is a complicated undertaking.\We don't claim enough expertise to take sides in this dispute. But Indiana's mercury problem is serious enough that the Air Pollution Control Board must examine every reasonable effort to keep the pollutant out of the environment.\Congress and the EPA, meanwhile, need to take a comprehensive look at both environmental regulations and a long-range energy policy. Too many critical decisions are being made piecemeal. Consequently, utilities are reluctant to do anything while uncertainty reigns. And energy shortages, along with greater dependence upon foreign oil and natural gas, loom."
24,"Is global warming a fact or are startling signs that the land and seas are heating up merely proof of the cyclical nature of worldwide climate?\Scientists line up on both sides of that question, and many refuse to take sides. This leaves environmental policy-makers little choice but to rely on the best proof available (of global warming) and their own common sense.\Indiana senators Richard Lugar and Evan Bayh -- a Republican and a Democrat, but like-minded on several issues -- came down in the same voting column recently on a key global warming question. Their decisions were significant -- and encouraging.\Both voted for a legislative proposal to curb global warming, the first time the Senate had addressed the question since 1998.\Although the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act failed (43-55), votes like those of Lugar and Bayh are important. They prove that conscientious senators are beginning to grow uneasy with 'doing nothing"" about an insidious problem that could cause environmental and economic chaos in the world.\Doing nothing to reduce global warming pollution will increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods, said Sam Goldman, Indiana organizer for the environmental group Clear the Air. These extreme weather events cost Indiana more than $500 million last year.\The McCain-Lieberman legislation was modeled after acid-rain legislation of 1990. It would require a reduction in carbon dioxide emission levels; would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation, transportation, industry and commerce; and would create a market for individual companies to trade pollution credits.\This 'cap-and-trade"" system, Lugar said, is a 'reasonable and prudent first step"" toward reducing pollution.\He said cap-and-trade systems 'are effective and are currently working well in the control of acid rain. These acid rain environmental standards did not harm our economy, as some originally predicted,"" a suggestion that the same would hold true with emissions reductions.\It is likely that recent global warming trends from the ends of the earth have influenced senators like Lugar and Bayh.\At the North Pole, University of Washington scientists have noted dramatic changes in the Arctic environment. Extraordinarily warm weather over the past decade has disrupted fishing, animal behavior and caused unprecedented increases in the amount of plankton, jellyfish and vegetation, as well as changes in the Arctic Ocean's balance of fresh and salt water.\Thousands of miles to the south, two sections of Antarctica's largest ice shelf have collapsed over the past decade and another portion could be headed for the same fate as warming ocean waters undermine the ice.\These changes are perplexing to many and indicate that Congress must take more aggressive, but prudent, steps on global warming pollution. While draconian measures should be resisted, the nation can ill afford to do nothing."
25,"It was called an Energy Summit. And a congressional fact-finding mission. And a meeting of the ambitious-sounding American Energy Solutions Group.\But ultimately, a much-publicized meeting Wednesday at the Central Library was nothing more than a blustery U.S. House Republican news conference.\Pure pep-rally propaganda.\Not that there's anything wrong with news conferences or one-sided partisan rallies. That's politics. And House Republicans, led by U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, had every right to spend their day attempting to rally opposition to a bill moving through Congress that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\But it's hard to take an event seriously when it's called a ""summit,"" and when its backers insist their goal is to fairly gather information and look for sensible solutions, but there's no interest shown in listening to the other side, looking for middle ground or honestly debating the issue at hand. Or when the only ""witnesses"" the lawmakers call on are those who echo their own views, and the only studies they're willing to discuss are those that dubiously back up their own alarmist rhetoric.\Pence made clear the meeting's mission when he delivered -- time and again -- a carefully crafted talking point that said the bill was ""an economic declaration of war on the Midwest by liberals."" The mission was made more clear with each piece of cliched Republican red meat delivered throughout the morning: cracks at Al Gore, Bill Clinton, ""enviros"" and the Kennedys.\Who knew the goal of a summit was to trash those on the other side?\Also featuring Indiana Reps. Steve Buyer and Dan Burton, the summit could have been a reasoned discussion of a crucial issue. Or a chance for Republicans to show they have a few ideas that don't involve the word ""no."" Instead, it was aimed at doing the easiest thing you can do in Washington -- taint an idea.\The event was so one-sided it seemed the lawmakers had a side bet to see who could ask the most leading question. Such as when Burton asked a like-minded witness this about the energy bill: ""Do you believe this is part of a move toward an ideological-controlled economy?""\Or when Pence asked Gov. Mitch Daniels -- an increasingly vocal critic of the energy plan -- to explain why a group of energy industry leaders supports the bill.\Daniels suggested those leaders would actually agree with him and other cap-and-trade critics ""if you tied them to a lie detector.""\Ah, another little-known rule of summits: Call those on the other side of the table liars.\Here's a thought: If Pence wanted to know why people such as Duke Energy CEO Jim Rogers support the push to cap carbon emissions, why didn't he ask them to speak? Here's why: He wanted to hear from only a narrow group of group-thinkers.\So Wednesday's witnesses were critics from within the business world and from places such as the Center for Coal Technology Research and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a D.C. think tank. The goal was to shout worst-case scenarios about the costs of the legislation while ignoring the benefits of additional green jobs or a cleaner environment.\It was too bad.\Pence is a thoughtful guy. Concerns about the effect the bill would have on Indiana's coal-dependent economy are valid. Even many who support the legislation's underlying mission say it needs significant work. If politics had been put aside, even just a little, Wednesday's summit could have been useful.\Instead, it showcased a group of out-of-touch lawmakers who don't seem to realize the nation is moving ahead without them.\""It's really not going to have any kind of impact,"" Burton said of reducing carbon emissions. (Apparently, he has taken enough time off the golf course to get his Ph.D. in environmental science.)\At the end of the meeting, Pence closed with a statement that was as clueless as it was comical.\""I've heard nothing this morning,"" he said, ""that contradicts my belief that the cap-and-trade legislation is an economic declaration of war on the Midwest by liberals in D.C.""\Of course he didn't hear anything that contradicted his beliefs. That was the whole point, wasn't it?\Matthew Tully is The Star's political columnist. Reach him at (317) 444-6033 or via e-mail at matthew.tully@indystar.com."
26,"When Gov. Mitch Daniels placed a strongly worded opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal decrying a federal cap-and-trade proposal Friday, he felt compelled to point out that he's not running for anything.\""I'm not a candidate for any office -- now or ever again,"" Daniels wrote in the piece that compared the climate change proposal to imperialism.\Daniels said during his re-election campaign last year that being governor is the only position he's interested in. But he's continued to be mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, as pundits look around the country for Republicans who can lead the party back to the White House.\Republicans think the cap-and-trade proposal could be a politically difficult one for Democrats in future elections, especially in coal-dependent states such as Indiana.\Group moves to expand smoking ban\Smoke-Free Indy is reviving its push to expand the city's smoking ban now that statewide efforts to snuff smoking in the workplace fell short in the General Assembly.\The coalition of health organizations, businesses and physicians released a new survey last week showing that 70 percent of Marion County residents polled support a stronger city ordinance that covers all workplaces.\The current city law exempts private clubs, bowling alleys and bars that do not admit minors.\The survey of 606 county residents found that even two-thirds of smokers agree that employees working indoors should have a smoke-free environment.\Jim Wolf, the survey director, said the numbers are similar to results of a poll four years ago. Wolf also said there is no evidence the expansion would hurt businesses.\Tim Filler, a committee member with the group, said other municipalities have adopted comprehensive bans, so Indianapolis merely would be following their lead. He said employees no longer should have to choose between their health and a paycheck.\Bashiri Asad, a vocalist in a local band, said many of the venues where he performs still allow smoking.\""By the second set, I'm dehydrated and uncomfortable,"" Asad said. ""Most people don't have to deal with this in their office, and my band won't do it anymore.""\Health-care ad lobbies senators\Indiana's senators are being asked in a new ad campaign to support a public health insurance option, one of the sticky issues in the debate over health-care reform.\Health Care for America Now, a group pushing for expanded health-care coverage, began running a week's worth of TV ads in Indiana on Tuesday urging people to call Sens. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind., in support of a public health insurance plan.\""That's why you should have a choice,"" the doctor in the ad says. ""Keep the insurance you have now or join a new public health insurance plan with good benefits at a price you can afford so we're no longer at the mercy of insurance companies making decisions you and I should be making together.""\Advocates argue the public option is needed to achieve universal coverage. But opponents, including private insurance companies, say they will be driven out of business because the government will have unfair competitive advantages.\This is a big issue for Indianapolis-based WellPoint, one of the nation's top insurance companies. And Eli Lilly and Co. CEO John Lechleiter also warned against a public plan open to all. Asked if he's raised his concerns with Indiana's lawmakers, Lechleiter said Lilly is in constant contact with the congressional delegation.\Bayh said in a Fox News interview last month that he was ""agnostic"" on the issue.\""It's a debate we need to have,"" Bayh said. "" My own preference would be . . . deal with the inefficiencies, figure out a way to make the private marketplace accomplish our public good, only have the government role as a backstop, as a last resort, if the private sector has just failed to meet the challenge.""\Lugar has not commented on the public health insurance option and is waiting to see what will be proposed, according to his spokesman.\The ads are running in six states, all targeting senators the group says haven't backed the public option.\Still rounding up votes for Johnsen\Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is still trying to round up Republican votes for Indiana law Professor Dawn Johnsen to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.\""At this stage, I don't have all the Democrats,"" Reid said last week. ""I have virtually all, but not all.""\Democrats control 59 Senate seats and need 60 votes to stop a filibuster.\The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Johnsen's nomination on a party-line vote in March, but a vote by the full Senate hasn't been scheduled.\Sen. Arlen Specter, who was a Republican when the committee considered Johnsen's nomination, abstained from voting because he said he still had concerns he wanted addressed. Specter since has switched to the Democratic Party but is not expected to vote for Johnsen.\Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska has said he won't vote for Johnsen. But Nelson usually sides with his party on filibusters, even if does not end up voting for the underlying issues.\Lugar, a Republican, has said he is inclined to vote for Johnsen. But Democrats need one or two more Republicans to do the same.\""I've had a number of conversations with some Republicans to find out if we have a couple of Republican votes,"" Reid said. ""We need a number of Republican votes before we can get to 60.""\The Office of Legal Counsel, which decides what government actions are permissible under law, had been relatively obscure until the Bush administration, when it was at the center of the controversy over torture and executive powers.\While in her current job as a law professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, Johnsen spoke out against how the office was run under Bush.\That criticism, along with her previous work as legal director of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, have generated GOP opposition.\Bayh speaks in favor of credit-card bill\Bayh made a rare floor appearance last week to urge passage of a bill aimed at curbing abusive practices by the credit-card industry.\""I'm a free-enterprise person. I believe in the right of companies to make a profit, and credit-card companies are no exception,"" Bayh said. ""They ought to make it the legitimate, old-fashioned way, not on the backs of consumers through abusive practices.""\Bayh didn't go as far, however, to support capping interest rates at 15 percent, an unsuccessful amendment he voted against.\But Bayh's speech in favor of the overall bill was his first speaking appearance on the Senate floor this year.\The bill differs from one passed by the House, including a provision the Senate added that would allow people to carry firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges. Bayh was one of 27 Democrats who joined with all but one Republican in adding that to the bill.\The author of the gun amendment, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he had to offer the unrelated measure to the credit-card bill because Democratic leaders prevented him from moving the gun issue on its own.\Compiled from reports by Star reporters Maureen Groppe, Brendan O'Shaughnessy and Bill Ruthhart.\Tully: Do Daniels' moves have a message?

27,"All of the U.S. House seats are up for grabs this year, and three are vying for the District 2 spot.\District 2, which covers north-central Indiana, represents Carroll County and part of White County in the Lafayette area.\Democrat Joe Donnelly is seeking re-election. He's being challenged by Republican Jackie Walorski and Libertarian Mark Vogel.\Here are takes from the other two candidates on a variety of issues facing Congress.\Editor's note: Vogel did not respond to repeated requests to participate in the survey.\1. In one sentence, tell why you are running for this office.\Donnelly: I'm running to be an independent advocate for job creation and economic growth in Indiana and to fight to preserve the livelihoods of all Hoosier working families and opportunities for their children.\Walorski: I believe government spending is out of control and that the economy is headed in the wrong direction. As a state representative, I have been part of the team that has turned Indiana around. My goal in Congress is to cut spending, create private sector jobs and defund the health care appropriation before the tax increases take effect.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\2. Name the two top priorities you would have in office? And how would you get those done?\Donnelly: Grow the Indiana economy by rewarding entrepreneurs who invest and take risks to protect and create quality jobs that cannot be outsourced. And cut federal deficits by reducing spending and utilizing proven budget tools that have helped successfully balance our budgets before.\Walorski: I want to create the environment where private sector jobs can thrive, i.e. back off unfair and unnecessary regulations and over taxation of small business. I also want to defund the Obama health care takeover and replace it with policies that address tort reform and portability.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\3. Give two things that separate you from your opponent.\Donnelly: I am 100 percent opposed to risky schemes that would undermine Social Security by privatizing it or gambling seniors' guaranteed benefits on Wall Street. And I am opposed to unfair trade agreements and corporate tax loopholes that ship Hoosier jobs overseas.\Walorski: I am a tax cutter with a voting record to back it up, and he is a tax spender. I have supported job ""creator"" legislation, he has supported and continues to support job-killing legislation.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\4. Deficit - What one specific action do you believe Congress should take to reduce or control the federal deficit? How will you get that done?\Donnelly: Reduce spending. I have already voted against $220 billion in new federal spending. I also support legislation to set strict limits on new spending that would cut spending by an additional $400 billion. And I support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that would balance budgets by 2020.\Walorski: Congress should freeze discretionary spending, audit every department and then cut where there is excess. I will file the bill that requires it.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\5. Job creation/stimulus - Would you have voted (or did you vote) for federal stimulus plans approved in Congress over the past two years? Why or why not?\Donnelly: I voted for the Recovery Act because we were on the verge of a second Great Depression threatening to wreck working families and businesses and inaction was not an option. The Recovery Act also cut taxes for 95 percent of Hoosiers.\Walorski: I would not have voted for bailouts. This nation is headed for $14 trillion of debt, nearly overtaking the GDP of the entire country. This concept was sold as a job ""creator"" and it has not produced private sector jobs. We need to cut taxes in this country and bail out the taxpayer.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\6. What's one thing you would do in office to promote job creation and stimulate the economy in your district? How would you get that done?\Donnelly: Oppose unfair trade agreements and tax loopholes that offshore Hoosier jobs. I will continue to oppose NAFTA-style ""free trade"" agreements that let other countries benefit at our expense. And I have already helped close some loopholes that encouraged big corporations to ship jobs overseas with $10 billion of your money.\Walorski: I would start by defunding the Obama health care takeover and taking needless and heavy handed regulations off of our small business employers. I would fight against job-killing legislation like card check and cap and trade. If we don't create a stable climate, employers are not going to invest in hiring, acquiring or research and development.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\7. War- Rate President Obama's plan on Afghanistan, on a scale from A to F. What, if anything, should be done differently in the next year?\Donnelly: With Hoosiers fighting in Afghanistan right now, I believe an ""A to F"" rating is not the most helpful way to assess what is a very complicated and important mission. But I will always back our troops and their families and see that they have every resource they need.\Walorski: I would give him a C. We need a more clearly defined mission and we need to provide our troops with the tools they need to succeed.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\8. Health care - Would you have voted for or against the health care legislation passed by Congress? Why or why not? If not, what other action would you propose for controlling health care costs?\Donnelly: I voted for the law because it ends some of the most abusive practices by private health insurance companies, closes the Medicare prescription drug ""donut hole,"" strengthens Medicare for current and future seniors, covers those previously denied because of pre-existing conditions and not a cent can be used for abortions.\Walorski: No, I would not have supported it and will lead the effort to defund it. I would suggest tort reform, purchasing power across state lines, transparency of pricing, and allowing competition to drive down costs.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\9. Immigration - Name two things the federal government can do to address questions with illegal immigration. How would you get those done?\Donnelly: First, I am opposed to any form of amnesty that would reward illegal immigrants with American citizenship. Second, we must devote more resources to border security, and I have helped increase Border Patrol funding by 23 percent and hire 5,300 new border agents, and I support hiring another 6,000 border agents.\Walorski: We need to eliminate the option of ""amnesty."" Until the federal government takes decisive action, the states should be allowed to invoke their sovereignty under the 10th Amendment.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\10. Social Security - What's the first thing Congress should do to address questions about the Social Security system's long-term viability?\Donnelly: We must recommit to Social Security's bedrock principle: no risk. We should scrap any talk of privatizing Social Security and instead consider what's already proven successful: a bipartisan commission in the 1980s successfully acted to strengthen Social Security and I would support creating such a commission now.\Walorski: For the first time in nearly 30 years, Social Security is running a deficit this year. With hundreds of thousands of fewer Americans working since the start of the recession, the greatest threat to protecting our seniors is a continuing weak economy. We must stop the job-killing policies, get our people back to work and keep our commitment to our seniors.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\11. Energy - Which of the following should Congress concentrate on first, production of more alternative and traditional energy sources, or ways to conserve energy? How would you get that done?\Donnelly: I voted against ""cap and trade"" and instead support an ""all in"" strategy that would increase domestic production of oil, gas and coal, as well as homegrown and clean energy like biofuels, wind and solar produced now in Indiana. This strengthens our national security and creates reliable jobs for Hoosiers.\Walorski: Congress should concentrate on domestic production and get this country off of the reliance on foreign oil by those who seek to destroy us. The country is big enough to allow for the growth of both traditional and alternative sources.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\12. Constituent services - Name two things you would do to remain connected to constituents in the district?\Donnelly: My home and family are in the district, so I come home every week to go to church and I spend every day possible working with constituents in all 12 north central Indiana counties. I also have accessible offices in Logansport, Kokomo, LaPorte, Michigan City and South Bend.\Walorski: My record shows that I have been extremely available to my constituents. I would actively hold town hall meetings in local communities, i.e. regularly scheduled meetings where people could come on a timely basis. I communicate by newsletter, e-mail, Facebook, telephone, and will go anywhere to meet with people in the district.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\13. Higher Education - Are you willing to raise and spend more to increase student aid for college? Why or why not?\Donnelly: Ensuring an affordable and quality higher education is within reach for every Hoosier is vitally important to our economy and the creation of good jobs. I have already helped to cut the interest rate on federal student loans in half and increase Pell Grants by a total of 37 percent.\Walorski: There is no reason to raise taxes in this country. We can provide needed dollars for student aid by reducing costs in other areas.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\14. Veterans - Given the high number of National Guard and reserve troops deployed from Indiana, what's your top priority for making sure returning veterans from recent service are taken care of at home?\Donnelly: As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I introduced legislation pending a House vote that would institute commonsense reforms to the VA disability benefits system that can cut wait times by months. A more efficient benefits system honors their service and meets their needs when they return home.\Walorski: We need to make sure that they have medical support and the other services they need when they arrive home, including jobs and/or job training. They should be able to go to the hospital of their choosing, in their hometowns, with their own physicians and family members there, instead of traveling around the State for proper care.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\15. Roads - Do you favor raising the gas tax to funnel more money to road improvement projects? Why or why not?\Donnelly: No. Hoosiers have seen gas prices rise too much as it is.\Walorski: There should be no tax increases in this next congressional budget. We, in Indiana, have a fully funded, 10-year transportation and infrastructure plan which includes building roads, connectors and bridges without raising taxes.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\Candidate bios\The job of each U.S. representative is to create, discuss and vote on bills and resolutions from their own chamber, as well as bills and resolutions from the U.S. Senate.

28,"Our position:\Indiana needs to step up efforts to reduce power plant pollution.\For some Hoosiers, cleaner air is a matter of life and breath. That's why the news that Indiana leads the nation in the highest concentration of polluting power plants is disturbing. A study by the Environmental Integrity Project says Indiana is the only state with five facilities on the 50 ""dirtiest power plants"" list.\They are: NIPSCO's Michigan City and R.M. Schahfer plants (11th and 32nd dirtiest); Duke Energy's Wabash River (35) and Gallagher (46) plants; and State Line Energy's State Line plant (41).\These are mostly older coal-fired plants that spew out sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and other pollutants, creating human health hazards and harming the environment. The facilities account for 45 percent of the pollution generated by the nation's fossil-fuel plants while producing only 4 percent of its energy output.\In fairness, many utilities are investing huge sums of money on emission-control equipment. Duke, for example, has pledged to add $100 million in new pollution controls at Gallagher and will have spent more than a half-billion dollars on catalytic reduction devices to cut nitrogen oxide emissions on its Gibson power plant.\More than half the power plants on the list are committed to installing scrubbers that are expected to significantly reduce acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide emissions over the next decade. Federal officials also have proposed a plan to cut mercury emissions by an average of 70 percent, and are planning to build what has been touted as a near-zero-emissions coal power plant by 2012.\Indiana has approved tax incentives expected to lead to construction of a combined-cycle plant that turns coal into a gas free of sulfur, mercury and particles before combustion. But progress remains too slow.\An estimated 410,000 babies are born each year at risk for mercury poisoning because of high levels of mercury. Indiana's average risk for cancer is 33 per million -- well above the acceptable risk level of 1 per million, according to Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxics Assessment. Dozens of Indiana counties in major urban areas are well above acceptable limits for particulate matter and ground-level ozone.\Indiana potentially could benefit by participating in innovative cap-and-trade programs such as the Chicago Climate Exchange. They reward polluters for reducing emissions and pay farmers for no-till farming and planting forests to reduce global warming.\Federal and state officials need to press utilities harder to clean up existing plants or replace them with cleaner generators using newer technologies. Then we'll all be able to breathe easier."
29,"MUNCIE -- More than 450 students were full of energy by the time they left Delta High School on Friday afternoon. But not the kind of energy you might think.\The students spent the morning discussing solar power, wind turbines, nuclear plants and geothermal projects at the second annual Energy Summit.\""The idea is that they will take everything they have learned here about energy and its impact on the economy and the environment back to their schools so they can try to make their school, their environment, a little better,"" said Lance Brand, one of the Delta teachers behind the summit.\""I think this is one of the best things we do here at Delta,"" said senior Aaron Fry, 18.\Fry said he was also impressed with the day's keynote speaker, Rep. Mike Pence, who was ""very informative"" and offered ""a lot of insight into the energy industry.""\Pence, who spoke to a near-capacity auditorium for about 30 minutes at the end of the summit, said, simply, that the country has ""got to meet our need for energy in the 21st century.""\We need to do that, he added, in a way that will ""create jobs and opportunity in East Central Indiana"" as well as do that ""in an environmentally responsible way.""\He touted his American Energy Act, which he said, is an ""all of the above"" approach to energy, unlike the ""current approach in D.C."" which focuses on cap-and-trade legislation. His act, which he created as part of the American Energy Solutions Group, would include ""saying yes"" to the exploration of oil, gas and coal resources in our country; the use of wind, solar and nuclear power; the development of new technologies, and tax credits and incentives to encourage conservation.\""We owe it to our nation to achieve energy independence,"" he said, adding that not doing so jeopardizes ""our national security.""\Heavy stuff for a bunch of high schoolers. But these kids could handle it, and when it came time for questions, they fired off several -- about nuclear power, smart grids, foreign oil and his vote against the Climate Bill.\""It was energy legislation that would result in great harm to Hoosier farms and Hoosier businesses,"" he said of the latter.\Monroe Central student Kendra Buckmaster, 16, said she thought ""Pence really knew what he was talking about,"" but she preferred the student displays and presentations, ""like the one from the students at Union City.""\The students from Union City High School, you see, are way ahead of the energy game. ""We gave a presentation here today about the wind turbine and solar panels we have at our school,"" said Union City student Madison Keiser, 16.\""I like the idea of taking those ideas back to our school and trying them out,"" Buckmaster said.\Energy mission accomplished, Mr. Brand.\Contact Michelle Kinsey at 213-5822."
30,"Some play offense. Some play defense. At times, some are talented enough to play both.\The same is true for my colleagues in the Indiana General Assembly and our state's delegation in Congress, as we are handed possible increased federal carbon dioxide (CO2) regulations.\Whether it comes in the form of rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or ""cap-and-trade"" legislation from Congress, few states are more and jeopardized by CO2 regulation than Indiana.\Coal is the single largest domestic source of man-made CO2 and Indiana utilities use enormous amounts of it. It's the least expensive and most reliable way to produce electricity. That's why Indiana enjoys some of the lowest electric rates in the nation and why so many energy-intensive, heavy industries have traditionally located here.\How can we deal with the possibility of increased federal CO2 regulations without fumbling our efficiencies, our economy or our environment?\We need to be key players -- and smart, engaged ones.\CO2 regulation will force Indiana's utilities to use less coal. Since every available alternative to coal will increase electric bills, our challenge is to find reliable, low-cost alternatives.\Abandoning coal is not the answer. Coal is a major Indiana industry, employing thousands of Hoosiers and generating millions in wages and tax revenue. I strongly endorse research into technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration that would allow the continued use of coal as a major source of clean power.\Continuing to demonize nuclear power isn't the answer either. Nuclear power provides safe, CO2-free and emissions-free power to millions.\And we shouldn't ignore perhaps the simplest way to reduce CO2: Use less electricity. Conservation is good for the environment and good for consumers' pocketbooks.\There also is a role for CO2-free ""renewable"" sources of electricity such as wind and solar technology. We must recognize, though, that they are intermittent sources of power that require backup sources of power when the wind and the sun refuse to cooperate. That's why we must guard against relying too heavily on renewables until advancing technology increases their reliability or storage.\That is also why I am supportive -- but cautious -- about the use of programs that provide a financial incentive to use renewables. For example, ""net-metering"" programs allow you to install your own source of electric generation, such as solar panels or small wind turbines, and sell any excess power to your local utility. Indiana now allows net metering up to 10 kilowatts. I favor increasing that tenfold to 100 kilowatts.\Gov. Mitch Daniels recently stated at a conference for developers of wind energy components: ""Our strategy for energy in this state is an all of the above strategy . . . as a state and frankly as a nation, we have to be committed to pro-growth strategies or we can't pay for the debts we have now, let alone the investments we want to make in the future.""\I believe Indiana will be best served by an energy game plan that encourages a wide variety of players and choices."

Make parents, kids legally accountable for behavior
\
Student behavioral issues and lack of parental accountability are obvious problems relating to low high school graduation percentages and impaired classroom learning environments, as well as school safety. Now is a good time to address the problem and propose solutions. Here is my solution -- maybe not the solutions but a start.
\
At the beginning of the next school year, in all our local school systems, each parent and student should be required to sign an accountability agreement which describes expected student behavior. There are policies covering these issues. However, do they define penalties for non-compliance for both parents and students?
\
I suggest that the parents, depending on the severity of the rules infractions, be penalized with fines and (or) incarceration for breach of contract, criminal neglect, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, etc.
\
Student punishments should include loss of driving privileges, loss of computer access, community service and, in extreme cases, wearing ankle bracelets to monitor after-school activity.
\
My intent is to highlight the need for parental as well as student accountability for disruptive student behavior. What do you suggest? Start thinking of solutions you are willing to support. Don't wait until another child's life is destroyed by the failures of parents and school administrators.

Then, now
\
The Tribune reported this month that Michigan was at 8.5 percent unemployment. Auto companies are cutting back, I assume because of the high cost of gasoline. Congress wants to develop alternative energy. What about the interim?
\
We need to develop new ways of supplying energy and at the same time drill for more gas and oil. All Congress wants to do is tax more. Michigan residents already have a high tax burden and, therefore, get a double whammy. Many of us will think twice before hopping in the car for a trip to the Upper Peninsula.
\
Right now, Indiana still is doing well, but in 2009, if the pro-tax forces win, we also will be in trouble.
\
Look back to the 1972-73 oil embargo. The price of gasoline then, adjusted for inflation, was not much lower than today's cost. Back then, the discretionary dollars we had were not what we have today. Then, China and India were on pedal power.

A new way
\
Recently, U.S. Sen. John McCain changed his mind (again) and decided that offshore drilling is a good idea. However, the drilling that he now supports would not produce any oil for at least 10 years. And, the amount of oil produced would likely not be large enough to have a significant impact on world oil prices.
\
So, the offshore plan amounts to little more than increased revenue for oil companies that are already raking in obscenely high record profits.
\
In January 2007, David Sandalow of the Brookings Institute suggested we can end our oil dependence in a generation by transforming the auto fleet with plug-in hybrids and an increase in fuel economy standards; by transforming the fuel supply through increased use of ethanol; by protecting the environment with cap-and-trade laws; by investing in advanced energy technology research; and by reducing demand rather than adding supply.
\
Demand for energy is only going to increase as the world populations grow and countries continue to modernize. It's time to seek new solutions. If we follow the advice of Sandalow and others, we could break our addiction to oil, improve our environment and leave one less problem for our children and grandchildren.

Untapped
\
All these cutbacks, layoffs and vacancies do not mean tasks cannot be done. We have inmates who could be placed on chain gangs to clean parks, roadways and vacant lots, and perform any other task St. Joseph County needs. We also have people getting welfare who will not work because they do not look for jobs. They put down false information about having gone on job interviews so they have an excuse for joblessness, or they tell tall tales so an employer will not want to hire them. This is not everyone who gets public assistance, enough people to make a difference in our county. And I am not including people who are too ill for employment, just those too lazy to work. Wake up and let us put these people to work. Eventually some of these tasks could give them the ability to get a job and give them some dignity back at the same time. Of course it will require people to oversee the work, but someone ends up watching the inmates or overseeing public assistance. One boss, many workers sounds like a winner to me. Anyone in favor of this idea, speak up!

Cheap fixes
\
The intersection of Timothy Road and Indiana 2 has been the scene of more than one horrendous traffic accident resulting in fatalities. My heart goes out to the families who have lost their loved ones at this location. It is past time that local government officials take steps to improve the safety of motorists traveling along those routes. In these times of funding cutbacks and general recession, high-tech solutions or construction-intensive fixes are more than likely out of reach ... but this matter cannot end here. Lower-impact solutions such as adding rumble strips, like those at the approach to Toll Road booths, are one possible fix that ought not break the bank. Perhaps, painting reflective markings on the intersecting routes might increase the caution used by approaching motorists. Until local government finances improve, we should be putting our energies into cost-effective solutions such as these, suggested by Tom Pietrzak of the Michiana Quality Of Life organization and residents of that area. A little applied brainpower and a bit of elbow grease would improve the safety at Timothy and Indiana 2. Let's not wait until another life is lost to do what should be done.

Regarding the June 21 article about the veteran who was arrested for urinating outside a gas station: Oh, come on. Remember the woman who was arrested in New York's Central Park for allowing her toddler grandson to urinate in the bushes? In Europe, they would think we have gone crazy! For you to arrest a person relieving himself is just off the wall. There is one thing every single living thing on this planet has to do -- eliminate bodily waste. The poor veteran had been riding in the car for a long time. There was no working restroom at the gas station. What was he supposed to do? Wet his pants? The whole law is just stupid. Of course people are not going to stand out in the middle of a busy highway to relieve themselves, but behind a building, in the woods or cornfield? When you gotta go, you gotta go and you can only hold it for so long. Some people don't have the kidneys that allow them to hold it.

34,"WASHINGTON - As global warming takes center stage in world affairs, Al Gore can't be far behind: The Nobel-Prize-winning former-vice president-turned-energy entrepreneur is releasing his plan to crack the climate conundrum.\""The clock is ticking with respect to solving the crisis,"" Gore, 59, said Thursday as he sat in pinstripes and black cowboy boots in an environmentally certified conference room, with glass walls and white surfaces. Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis, which debuted Tuesday, ""offers us the tools to find a way out.""\In 416 pages, Gore offers a potpourri of lavishly illustrated recipes - solar, geothermal, and wind power solutions - for slowing the greenhouse gases warming the climate. ""It is now abundantly clear that we have at our fingertips all of the tools we need to solve three or four climate crises,"" Gore writes. ""The only missing ingredient is collective will.""\Essentially, Gore proposes moving ahead with such technologies on a broad front while securing an international agreement that puts a price on the carbon dioxide wafting from smokestacks, and limits the deforestation that adds to greenhouse gases. (The Senate's environment committee, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., forwarded just such a ""cap-and-trade"" bill Thursday, for a vote, despite a boycott by committee Republicans.)"
35,"
Tuesday delivered no more details on exactly what President Barack Obama will say when he visits Monaco RV in Wakarusa today.
\
But local Republicans are being more than specific about what they'll discuss during a rally across the street from Obama's visit: his plans for health care, the environment and organized labor.
\
What's known is this: Obama will make an announcement on grants for advanced battery and electric vehicle manufacturing at the facility at 606 Nelson's Parkway, according to the White House.
\
Several local officials have said the announcement will pertain more to Monaco RV rather than Electric Motors Corp., which in May announced it will locate to the Nappanee-Wakarusa area.
\
The former Monaco Coach Corp. filed for bankruptcy in March and was later bought by Navistar International Corp. in early June for $47 million.
\
After the purchase, the company's name was changed to Monaco RV LLC, a wholly owned affiliate of Navistar Inc., Navistar's principal operating company, and headquartered in Coburg, Ore., according to a news release.
\
The company announced in July 2008 it was closing plants in Elkhart, Wakarusa and Nappanee, and laying off 1,400 workers.
\
As for EMC, a spokeswoman said Monday that company officials will be there, but EMC Chief Executive Wil Cashen said Tuesday morning he had not yet been invited. He added it appears to be more of a ""Navistar deal.""
\
""I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be disappointed if I wasn't invited,"" he said. ""Sure I'm disappointed, but it's not over.""
\
Navistar spokesman Roy Wiley declined to release any details.
\
Elkhart Mayor Dick Moore said Tuesday he was invited to attend the news conference. He also said the conference is about Navistar.
\
Cashen, meanwhile, said earlier this year they were looking for $82 million in federal stimulus money to start his business.
\
Respectful difference
\
An Elkhart County Young Republicans event, scheduled to take place across the street from the Obama event, is not a protest, said group chairman Ryan Brandenberger.
\
""We want to keep this upbeat and fun,"" he said. ""We don't want to be seen as angry Republicans, because that's not who we are.""
\
Brandenberger said his group will respectfully give their opinions on health care reform, regulations on carbon emissions known as cap-and-trade, and proposed ""card check"" laws on labor union votes.
\
Their event is scheduled for 1 p.m. at the Nelson's BBQ location across the street.
\
""This is an intelligent, upbeat response,"" Brandenberger said. ""We're looking for everyone with conservative values to stand with us.""
\
Air Force One is expected to land about 11:10 a.m. at South Bend Regional Airport and take back off at 1:20 p.m. Obama will take a helicopter to Wakarusa, officials say.
\
A motorcade will then weave around downtown Wakarusa before arriving at Monaco. Indiana 19 will remain open.

Who raised the Nazi spectre?
\
David R. Hoffman is right when he writes about the inflammatory language and the ""great lies"" being told about Obama's health care proposals (Voice, Sept. 1). However, he is accusing the wrong people.
\
The charges of Nazism started when Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the protesters were wearing swastikas and weren't really legitimate. Rush Limbaugh was responding back in the same language. The great lie is the fact that our representatives are trying to tell us what is and isn't in a 1,000-page bill they haven't read. People are afraid that once again a huge, expensive bill will get passed without it being read or properly being debated.
\
We have already had enough of that with the stimulus bill and the cap and trade bill. Regardless of what side you are on, the American people should demand that we stop rushing huge bills through the Congress without reading and understanding them.

Public option
\
Michele Bachmann, the Republican congresswoman from Minnesota, recently stated that the United States has the best health care system in the world. That is understandable since the health care system for Congress is top of the line. Oh, by the way, it is a government-provided program.
\
In the next breath, she, the GOP and some misguided Democrats are fighting tooth and nail to stop the provision of a public option in the current health care debate. That option seems to have been distilled down to an expansion of Medicare to people younger than 65 years of age. The insurance industry does not want that to happen because they will no longer get to cherry-pick the young and healthy who can afford their jacked-up rates, and let those who cannot afford their options survive on their own.
\
So whether these opponents have been paid off by the insurance industry or they just feel they are better than the citizens they represent, I find it hard to stomach their position. Given the opportunity to talk to one of them, my first question would be how they manage to look at themselves in the mirror.

Schools
\
The elimination of so many programs in schools has caused a deterioration in the educational experience. Music, physical education, sports and arts are among the benefits students have lost.
\
Another issue is the teaching of civics. Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter warned that a lack of proper civics education poses a threat to judicial independence.
\
It should not be just a matter of teaching the test. The challenge is to give students the education needed, then to take into account the needs of all the students. Rewarding the teachers to stay in the schools not performing according to standards sounds great. But more important would be the support and encouragement to stay. There are good teachers everywhere. Sometimes the environment is not conducive to the desired goal.
\
Family is paramount to the successful educational experience. Teachers are often not aware of the family dynamic. Cutting out the parent-teacher meeting is really a disadvantage to attainment of family involvement.
\
As a retired teacher of 35 years, I have presented some views of the educational system. Hopefully they will throw some light on the issues that education now faces. These days, cost-cutting is the norm, but investment should be put into our own country's education.

37,"WASHINGTON - Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly will vote against President Trump's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, but not for the reasons many other Democrats are objecting to Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt.\Donnelly announced Monday he opposes the nomination because Pruitt has fought required increases in the amount of plant-based fuels oil refiners must blend into gasoline. Indiana is among the top ethanol-producing states.\Other Democrats have questioned how thoroughly Pruitt would oversee federal clean air and water laws, and are alarmed by his challenge to the Obama administration's restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.\Donnelly has sided with Republicans on some climate change and other environmental issues in the past.\He was one four Democrats who this month helped Republicans stop an Obama administration rule to limit polluted runoff from surface coal mining into nearby water sources. (Like Donnelly, the three other Democrats are also facing re-election in 2018 in states which have coal mining operations.)\In 2015, Donnelly was one of nine Senate Democrats to vote to approve the Keystone XL pipeline that President Obama opposed.\When he served in the House, Donnelly voted for GOP efforts to restrain the regulatory powers of the EPA and voted against creating a cap-and-trade system to rein in greenhouse gases.\When the Obama administration issued regulations instead, Donnelly said they would be too burdensome on Indiana's families and businesses.\Opposing Pruitt over renewable fuels gives Donnelly an Indiana-specific reason to side with environmental groups he's frustrated before without looking like a defender of the EPA. Environmental leaders say Pruitt -- who sued the EPA 14 times as Oklahoma's attorney general -- would be the most hostile EPA administrator in the agency's history.\The Hoosier Environmental Council had urged Donnelly to oppose Pruitt.\Jesse Kharbanda, the council's executive director, argues Pruitt believes environmental decisions should be left largely up to the states, a philosophy that Kharbanda said led in the past to too much pollution in Indiana's air and water.\Pruitt's supporters argue he will help rein in an agency that has hurt farmers, ranchers and small businesses and the overall U.S. economy with burdensome and costly regulations.\Donnelly said in his statement Monday he appreciates ""Pruitt's desire to improve EPA's working relationship with state partners and other stakeholders as it engages in its mission to protect our environment.""\""That's an issue I've focused on for years,"" he said. ""I, however, cannot support an EPA nominee who has sued the EPA to stop the sale of E15 and praised the erosion of a policy designed to strengthen our energy security and promote Hoosier-grown biofuels.""\Pruitt, who has close ties to the fossil fuel industry, promised during his confirmation hearing to carry out the renewable fuels mandate.\Democrats on the panel which conducted his confirmation hearing say he hasn't adequately responded to their questions or to requests for documents.\USA TODAY reporter Erin Kelly contributed to this story.\Contact Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.

Please join me and my wife as we vote for Mike Nov. 6th.\Roy W. Brown, Richmond\Romney's stances concern voter\After the first presidential debate, talking heads proclaimed that Romney's STYLE trumped Obama's SUBSTANCE. However elegant his style, the substance of Romney's positions remain sobering.\Two of many concerns:\We all pay for the uninsured who use the ER for primary health care. To recoup their losses (about 80 percent), hospitals get federal and state dollars (from taxes we pay) through the Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments Plan, and state and local dollars from tax appropriations.\Hospitals also use their own surplus dollars that accumulate from insurance providers who pay for insured treatment. Hospital costs go up, our insurance premiums go up, so we can pay for the uninsured. Under Obamacare, everyone will be required to have health insurance and thus take responsibility for themselves.\Meanwhile, Romney expresses great disdain for ""people dependent on welfare,"" but he is eager to repeal Obamacare and thus continue to give ""welfare"" to the uninsured.\Environment -- Romney is all for the XL pipeline, with complete disregard for the Ogallala Aquifer and the immense implications should it be compromised by the dirtiest of all oil. Romney dismisses Obama's EPA standards that cars be more fuel-efficient.\One Romney flip-flop is that he now disagrees with Cap and Trade, which allows factories, etc., to pay for the right to continue to pollute the air -- too much government regulation. Air pollution, world peak oil, and climate change are of no concern.\Romney's Bain Capital approach of ""get in, get a quick profit, get out"" clashes with all things environmental.\Les McClain, Richmond"

They're promoting a ""cap and trade"" policy that would effectively take over our energy sector. They're openly trying to seize the health care industry, and now they're seeking authority to nationalize any business they deem to be overpaying its executives or operating in a way they disapprove of.\That's not all. Barney Frank's Financial Services Committee just approved a measure called the Pay for Performance Act of 2009 that would allow the Treasury secretary to retroactively dictate the wages of any employee in any company that received any government assistance.\That's not a financial rescue plan or capitalism; it's European style socialism, an unprecedented expansion of government powers that reveals their disgust toward America's entire free enterprise system. We are quickly becoming a country with less freedom, bigger government and unimaginable debt.\Life, liberty and the right to happiness have been replaced with the right of some to take from others against their will in the name of a greater common good.

I was afforded every opportunity to have a successful life.\Despite the positive environment I grew up with, I began experimenting with sex, drugs and alcohol at the age of 15. I broke laws, sometimes getting caught and sometimes not.\When this cycle continued, my grandmother sought professional help for me and continued to provide me with love and emotional support. Even with her best efforts, however, I still find myself struggling 11 years later with substance abuse and legal issues.\At 15, I was cognizant of the ramifications of my actions but treated them with utter disregard. The thought of my grandmother languishing in jail for my poor decisions is sickening.\Punishing a parent for a child's wrongdoing will do nothing but solidify the acceptance of irresponsibility in the mind of that child.\Blame the music. Blame television. Blame the Internet. Blame schools. Blame ADHD. Blame the parents. Really? How about instead of playing a game of blame, we play one about real life -- taking responsibility for our actions.\Why not give these juvenile delinquents a chance at rehabilitation?

40,"Gov. Mitch Daniels on Thursday jumped into the national debate over a controversial Bush administration proposal to curb smokestack pollution, saying it's the best way to reduce dirty air and keep Indiana's economy growing.\Daniels and acting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Steve Johnson held a news conference to promote the Clear Skies legislation, which would reduce nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury -- emitted by coal-burning power plants -- 70 percent by 2018.\The law would establish a national pollution limit, or cap. Industries would be allowed to buy emissions ""credits"" -- essentially the right to pollute -- from companies that reduce pollution, as long as overall emissions stay beneath the cap.\Johnson said Clear Skies also would help Indiana counties that violate federal standards for smog and soot comply with the limits.\""There is no measure (federal lawmakers) will vote on anytime soon that has as much potential benefit to Indiana as this bill,"" said Daniels, who recently sent a letter to Indiana's congressional delegation, urging it to support the bill, now in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The panel is expected to vote on the bill Wednesday.\But opponents say it does not reduce emissions of heart- and lung-damaging pollution far enough or fast enough. They argue that enforcing the current Clean Air Act would reduce pollution by 90 percent up to 10 years sooner.\That is especially important for mercury, a potent neurotoxin that can harm developing fetuses, said Brian Wright of the Hoosier Environmental Council.\Nitrogen oxides, a primary component in smog, are linked to respiratory problems, and sulfur dioxide creates microscopic particles that can damage the lungs and heart.\The EPA has said 24 Indiana counties -- including eight of 10 in the Indianapolis metro area -- violate standards for smog. Marion, Morgan, Hamilton, Hendricks and Johnson also are among 14 counties and portions of five others that violate the new federal standard for particles.\Economic development officials have said the designations could hurt the counties' ability to attract more jobs; failure to comply with the standards could result in a loss of federal road money.\""The point is, we know we have the technology (to make deeper reductions) by more like 2012, so why not do it?"" said Armond Cohen, executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, a national environmental group. He said Indiana counties would meet pollution standards faster under current laws than under Clear Skies.\""Governor Daniels' position should really be moving Indiana as fast as possible,"" he said. ""Deal with the problem and get this monkey off Indiana's back. (He) is shooting the state in the foot if he supports deadlines this lax.""\Power plant officials have said they favor the Bush administration proposal, which would give them more time to comply and keep consumers' rates low.\""Strong compliance measures ultimately find their way into (electricity) rates,"" said Kay Pashos, president of PSI Energy.\_________________________________________________\Here are the differences between the Clean Air Act and Clear Skies Act.\Clean Air Act\* Limits mercury emissions at 5 tons per year by 2008.\* Limits nitrogen oxides emissions at 1.25 million tons by 2010.\* Limits sulfur dioxide emissions to 2 million tons by 2012.\* States can ask the EPA for relief from upwind polluters.\* Requires industries (non-utilities) to install technology to achieve maximum reductions available.\Clear Skies Act\* Limits mercury emissions at 15 tons per year by 2018.\* Limits nitrogen oxides emissions at 1.7 million tons by 2018.\* Limits sulfur dioxide emissions to 3 million tons by 2018.\* States cannot seek relief from polluters in other states.\* Allows non-utility industries to opt into cap-and-trade program, suspending the requirement for maximum achievable reductions of some hazardous air pollutants.\Sources: Energy Information Administration, Clear the Air, Sierra Club.\Call Star reporter Tammy Webber at 317-444-6212"

Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Science, and a leading critic of the hype over global warming, maintains that the hysteria about manmade global warming is unjustified and is more of an active and vibrant global political movement rather than a scientific phenomenon. This political movement is essentially anti-capitalist and anti-human as Chris Horner, author of ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming,"" and Lindzen of MIT have both said.
\
The science behind global warming is not very conclusive. Many noted climatologists claim that the models used to predict future global warming are not very accurate. There are also temperature discrepancies with data taken by satellites and even in ground-based temperatures. Urban temperature data is higher than rural data. More than 31,000 scientists, more than 600 in Indiana, including more than 9,000 with PhDs, have signed a petition urging the United States government to reject the global warming agreement known as Kyoto -- and any other similar proposals -- because the proposed limits on greenhouse gases would actually harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology and damage the health and welfare of mankind. Another 100 scientists have endorsed a newspaper ad by the Cato Institute challenging President Barack Obama's ""facts"" on global warming.
\
The atmosphere is composed of 1 to 2 percent of greenhouse gases with the majority being nitrogen (about 78 percent) and oxygen (about 21 percent). Of that 2 percent, carbon dioxide comprises only 3.62 percent, while water vapor encompasses 95 percent. And of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, humans cause only 3.4 percent of annual CO2 emissions, according to the Heritage Foundation. Further, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United States contributes 25 percent of that amount. The CO2 generated by the United States is a very small part of the total atmosphere.
\
In their closed-minded arrogance, the authoritarian leftists completely eschew any scientific inquiry into whether cap and trade legislation would have any appreciable impact on the alleged problems.
\
If they are so sure of their scientific position, why are we reading reports that ""the Environmental Protection Agency may have suppressed an internal report that was skeptical of claims about global warming, including whether carbon dioxide must be strictly regulated by the federal government."" (According to the CBS Political Hotsheet.) The head of the EPA told Congress that she cannot see any impact on climate if China and India do not reduce their CO2. They refuse to comply. The Heritage Foundation did a study and concluded that there would be a net loss of jobs and would eventually cost the consumer up to $5,000 in energy cost.
\
Pope Benedict XVI in his encyclical ""Charity in Truth"" warns that we should not hold environmentalism up as a religion ... ""Nature expresses a design of love and truth. It is prior to us, and it has been given to us by God as the setting for our life. Nature speaks to us of the Creator (Romans 1:20) and his love for humanity. Nature is at our disposal not as 'a heap of scattered refuse' but as a gift of the Creator who has given it an inbuilt order, enabling man to draw from it the principles needed in order 'to till it and keep it.' (Gen 2:15). But it should also be stressed that it is contrary to authentic development to view nature as something more important than the human person. This position leads to attitudes of neo-paganism or a new pantheism -- human salvation cannot come from nature alone, understood in a purely naturalistic sense.""

We can't afford any more of theis 'help'
\
So just to be sure I understand, President Obama is requesting more than an additional $50 billion to help get the economy going? How many times have we heard from this president that the economy and jobs is ""Job 1"" only to see it pushed to the back burner to push ahead cap and trade, health care, etc. This card has been played one too many times and it is becoming impossible to take this man seriously.
\
Why another multi-billion request when more than $200 billion of the original stimulus has not even been spent? If the stimulus was supposed to save the economy, why spend more? All tax dollars spent by Congress come from earned income. To take more out of an already ailing economy defies logic. By admitting he needs to do more, Obama is undercutting the success of his stimulus boondoggle.
\
Someone needs to tell this man that the purse strings are tied closed. Why not just get out of the way and let the economy grow as it always has by providing an environment condusive to hiring, investment and expansion? Someone needs to tell him and I think Nov. 2 is time for me to do just that.

It's a tragedy
\
Hooray for Mary Sparks (Voice, Sept. 3), in calling the charging of Dakotah Eliason, of Niles, as an adult in the shooting death of his grandfather an outrage. The Tribune quoted the prosecutor as saying that since the boy had considered the pros and cons of his actions the act was first-degree murder.
\
Fourteen-year-old boys don't even consider the pros and cons of mouth cancer when they stick a wad of tobacco between their jaw and gum.
\
Someone was once quoted as saying we ought to stick kids of that age in a barrel and let them out some years later when they have some sense.
\
Did anyone involved in this case do any research on the brain development of adolescent boys? Seems I remember reading that it is not complete at 14. It's not too hard to figure out why we historically send our 18-year-old ""men"" to war. Even at 18 they are not so apt to consider the pros and cons. Wisdom is not their claim to fame.
\
I do not personally know anyone connected to this affair or Sparks, however, I have been associated with a passel of 14-year-old boys. Some of them were smarter than others, some sweeter than others, but none were wise and mature -- my own included.

Beware
\
In 2009, high school students of Lower Merion School District of Ardmore, Pa., were issued laptops as part of an educational initiative similar to the one being implemented at Lincoln Junior High (Tribune, Sept. 2). As can be expected, some of those students took their laptops home.
\
At some point, an employee of the school district remotely activated webcams embedded in the laptops and spied on the students in their homes. Parents only learned of this -- as well as of the school district's ability to do this -- after an assistant principal informed the parents of one of the students that their son had been involved in ""improper behavior in his home"" based upon evidence obtained from pictures taken with the built-in webcam.
\
The parents of students at Lincoln should be wary. While they may trust the employees at Lincoln Junior High and at the school district, history has shown that giving school employees unconditional trust can and does lead to terrible results. They should ask many questions about the laptops that their young children are being given. Even if the laptops don't contain webcams, that doesn't mean that dangers don't exist. All it takes is for one school district employee with no scruples to install keystroke-monitoring software on a computer that parent and their child's whole world could be turned upside-down.

45,"Clay Miller, Republican member of Richmond Common Council, Mike Toschlog, local Democratic Party activist, and Rex Bell, Wayne County Libertarian chair, joined ""P-I Live!"" on Thursday for a review of Tuesday's election results.\""P-I Live!"" is the Palladium-Item's online viewer participation chat show featuring local issues and people in the news. It is produced in conjunction with WCTV Channel 11.\These are excerpts from Thursday's show.\To view the entire show, tune to Channel 11 at 1 p.m. today or log on to www.pal-item.com/pilive to see an on-demand replay of the show or past shows with local guests.\Question: Mike, it wasn't a very good day for Democrats. What can they salvage out of it?\Mike Toschlog: We took a shellacking, like the president said. There were a lot of angry folks out there on most of the issues. I think national issues actually drove the big turnout. People want change. I don't know if they understand which change they want. Usually in government, any laws or regulations enacted come from the people.\Question: On a national level, Clay, it is generally felt there was an anti-incumbency mood sweeping the nation. But we didn't see that locally. Most local officeholders are Republican and we didn't really see any turnover there.\Clay Miller: That's correct. What we saw I think Tuesday -- and locally obviously our party was very pleased with the results -- is that we did benefit from the national elections. If you characterize the 2008 election as theming ""Yes we can,"" I think you look at 2010 as ""No you don't."" ...\Question: And locally I suppose the closest thing we would have to a tea party insurgency would be the Libertarian presence on the (local) ballot. Rex, do you see the possibility of positioning yourself or some of your future candidates as tea party alternatives maybe within the Republican Party?\Rex Bell: I don't suspect the Libertarians would join up with the Republican Party and move that way. Occasionally you might see that happen, but I don't see that happening with the party as a whole. While we're pretty much on page with Republicans for the fiscal conservative beliefs, there are some other social issues that we separate from them.\I think the Libertarian Party locally has expanded quite a bit this year, the number of votes. We finished second in my race and several races and in Henry County and Rush County. We're just looking at different options on how we can get the message out a little better. I think the anti-incumbency and anti-big government (sentiment) is what helped the growth of the Libertarians this year. One thing we've got to figure out is how many times you can finish second before you're not considered the third party.\Question: How do you propose to cut the deficit and cut taxes at the same time?\Bell: There's only one way to do it. You have to cut spending.\Miller: We've got to start making some hard choices.\Toschlog: We have to look at expenditures. But Medicare/Medicaid and Social Security represent 68 percent of our budget. Where are we going to get the money to fund that?\Question: Is unemployment the biggest problem?\Miller: Unemployment is the biggest problem. And one of the factors coming into play is the taxes that we have. Cap and trade was proposed. That would have been devastating to us locally ... Most of those small businesses are where we have job growth. We've got to look at ways of cutting government spending so that people have more money in their pockets, which creates growth, creates jobs.\Bell: Jobs is the number one issue on everybody's mind this past election.

46,"Let there be no mistake -- Indianapolis Power & Light Company understands the importance of clean air. We take the environment and our effect on it seriously as evident by our ongoing $215 million environmental project that will benefit families and businesses that call Indiana and Indianapolis home.\IPL supplies about 99 percent of the electricity that lights up the Indianapolis community from coal-fired power plants. The use of this affordable domestic fuel allows Indianapolis residents to enjoy the lowest residential electric rates among the 20 largest cities in the U.S. served by investor-owned utility companies. The state's economy benefits from its use because IPL burns Indiana coal. The Indiana mining industry contributes more than $650 million to the state's economy annually and employs more than 2,500 Hoosiers. IPL employs another 480 people in our three coal-fired generating stations. The use of local fuel also minimizes the risk of a fuel supply interruption and reduces dependence on foreign and out-of-state fuels. It also avoids the price volatility of oil and natural gas.\The critical challenge facing policy makers and business leaders is to maintain the fuel diversity and cost benefits of coal while continuing to reduce environmental impacts, particularly air emissions, in the most cost effective manner possible.\Substantial progress has been made in reducing air emissions in the U.S. in recent years. Emissions of the six primary air pollutants have been reduced by nearly 50 percent since 1970. This is particularly notable when one considers that, over that same time period, the U.S. economy grew by over 160 percent (as measured by growth in Gross Domestic Product). The electric utility industry grew to support that expansion. This trend has continued in more recent years. Sulfur dioxide emissions alone are about 10 percent lower than they were in the year 2000 and 40 percent lower than they were in 1980. Similarly, nitrogen oxide emissions have decreased about 13 percent since the year 2000 and more than 30 percent since 1990. Additional significant reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions will result from the ongoing environmental projects of IPL and other Midwest utilities in the next few years.\According to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, air quality in Indianapolis has improved dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s when Marion County routinely violated state and federal air health standards for sulfur dioxide, lead, carbon monoxide, particles and ozone.\While we still have much to do, we should recognize and celebrate the tremendous progress we've made. These successes can be attributed, in large part, to the Clean Air Act that was passed in 1970 and subsequently amended in 1990.\All desire further improvements in air quality, and the successes of the past give us plenty of room to be optimistic. However, the fractured regulatory and legislative initiatives currently on the table are troubling. Separate initiatives have been proposed to deal with different types of air emissions from the same power stations. For example, one proposal would require mercury reductions as early as 2007, while another would require sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide reductions in 2010 and 2015, respectively. Given that the technologies used to control one pollutant can, and often do, affect the emission of others, a coordinated approach and timetable is clearly superior to an incremental approach that could easily lead to an inefficient technical and economic investment.\IPL advocates a single, federal legislative initiative, like Clear Skies, that provides sufficient clarity to the utility industry to enable careful planning and investment for the future. Such legislation should be based on solid scientific research, provide a coordinated multi-pollutant plan, and provide a realistic timetable for implementation. A cap and trade system is also beneficial as it provides an incentive to the industry to make the most cost effective improvements first -- something that was demonstrated as a highly effective component of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Contrary to the position taken by The Star on Feb. 17, we believe that the state of Indiana should resist the temptation to further confuse and fracture the current situation by regulating to different standards and timetables than the federal government. Not only would this further frustrate the process, it could also significantly hurt our prospects for economic development as compared to neighboring states. Rather, we would encourage state legislators and IDEM officials to continue to work closely with federal officials to promote a workable, multi-pollutant approach that will bring benefits to the citizens of Indiana for years to come.\Murtlow is president and CEO of Indianapolis Power & Light Co."
47,"WASHINGTON -- Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent. Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.\So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.\The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. Remember diplomat George Kennan's axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table? The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.\The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised."" The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of Copenhagen conference.\There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, two stubborn facts -- the two most populous nations. On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth -- together they account for 26 percent of emissions -- jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades. Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them.\But do not really embrace them. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel. When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""\In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago. Then intelligent people agreed (see above) that global cooling threatened human survival. It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average."" Some scientists proposed radical measures to cause global warming -- for example, covering the arctic ice cap with black soot that would absorb heat and cause melting.\Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change. For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement -- people eating locally grown foods from small farms -- actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.\Although the political and media drumbeat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:\They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!""\In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes. As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed -- half the average of the last 50 years -- and none have hit the United States.\Write George Will at Washington Post Writers Group, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071."
48,"WASHINGTON -- Even for people who don't believe in it, climate change just got real. It's about time.\The Obama administration's proposed new rule for existing power plants -- reducing heat-trapping carbon emissions by up to 30 percent by 2030 -- is ambitious enough to get anyone's attention. No, this one measure will not halt or reverse human-induced warming of the atmosphere. But the rule is necessary in the context of seeking international consensus on solutions -- and also significant in its own right.\Before Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy could announce the new rule Monday, critics were already bellowing about higher energy rates and lost jobs. They pretended not to see that President Obama -- as with health-care reform -- is taking what ought to be seen as a Republican-friendly approach.\The rule, which will not become final until next year, gives states great flexibility in how they reach the target. They are not forced to immediately begin shutting down the aging coal-fired power plants that constitute one of the biggest sources of carbon pollution. Rather, each state can take the path that best fits its circumstances -- ramping up the generation of energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar, for example, or entering regional cap-and-trade agreements.\Ultimately, however, hundreds of those aging, dirty, coal-fired plants will have to close. If the planet could speak, it would say good riddance.\Many of those who do not believe in climate change also reject the idea that carbon dioxide can be called a pollutant, since it is a natural and necessary component of the air we breathe. But direct measurement shows that the concentration of carbon dioxide in atmosphere has increased by an astounding 40 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when humankind began burning fossil fuels in earnest. As with any poison -- or pollutant -- it's the dose that counts.\This thickening pall of human-generated carbon dioxide -- which traps heat, according to universally accepted principles of physics and chemistry -- has coincided with a long-term rise in average temperatures that agrees with climate scientists' predictions. The big unanswered question isn't scientific, it's political: Will we continue to turn up the thermostat?\The question that some skeptics like to pose -- ""Why should the United States take such a big step on its own?"" -- is meaningless, when you think about it.\China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Emissions are rising sharply in India and other rapidly industrializing countries. Nothing the United States does unilaterally, or even in concert with Europe and Japan, can solve the problem. What we really need is a global solution.\All this is true, but one less ton of carbon makes an incremental difference, however slight. Obama's major energy initiatives -- higher fuel economy standards for vehicles, plus the new power plant emissions rule -- will mean billions of tons less of carbon dioxide in the air. It is true that we cannot save the planet on our own. But it is also true that if warming-induced disaster is inevitable, it will arrive sooner if we fail to act.\Meanwhile, Chinese and Indian universities are full of scientists who are warning their own governments about the negative impacts of carbon emissions. China has already signaled its intention to move away from coal, and while this is easier said than done, Chinese officials have an added incentive: The noxious smog that shrouds major cities, most of it from coal-fired power plants, has stoked real anger among the country's burgeoning urban middle class. In other industrializing countries as well, as people get richer they will demand a cleaner environment.\Obama hopes that action by the United States, the richest country in the world, will make it possible for the other big carbon emitters to act. Some of the domestic critics who scoff at this notion also complain that Obama, in their view, does not sufficiently assert U.S. leadership around the globe. What do these people think leadership means, if not actually leading?\The bonus is that closing coal-fired power plants will encourage the development of cleaner energy sources. The power generation industry was already moving toward cheap, plentiful natural gas, which releases much less carbon. Gas should be seen as a bridge toward clean, renewable energy sources -- an industry that will be huge in the 21st century.\It's our choice. We can try our best to ensure that the next industrial revolution -- the one that ends dependence on fossil fuels -- happens here. Or we can watch it happen in China.\Eugene Robinson's email address is eugenerobinson@washpost.com.\Eugene Robinson"
49,"Mike Pence, a global warming/climate change denier and skeptic throughout his political career in Congress and the governor's office, did an about-face last week.\""Wel,l look, there's no question that ... the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate,"" the Republican vice presidential nominee told CNN last week.\When he ran for Congress in 2000, Pence called global warming a myth created by environmentalists in their latest ""Chicken Little attempt to raise taxes and grow centralized government power.""\Over a 15-year-period when he was governor and a U.S. representative, The Star Press asked Pence the same question that was put to him by CNN last week. His responses:\July 2002:\""Put me down as a profound skeptic in this debate. I've been on the record on that and haven't changed. The theory of global warming is just that -- a theory. I look no further than the broad majority of climatologists and climate experts in the world who recognize it as a theory. It is a minority that recognizes it -- as much as the national media does -- as fact.\""Certainly we ought to study it. We only have one planet, and we ought to be investing the dollars to finding out what's going on with our planet. (But) the evidence is simply not there to establish global warming as a scientific fact. It's a political fact, but until it becomes a scientific fact, I think we need to proceed very slowly and cautiously about the development of policy to confront it.""\April 2006 (after evangelical Christian leaders signed a full-page advertisement in The New York Times below the headline, ""Our commitment to Jesus Christ compels us to solve the global warming crisis ...""):\""A lot of these men and women are wonderful leaders in the evangelical community, and I respect their right to be heard on issues unrelated to their expertise. Every American has that right. (But) any fair reading of the science today, while global warming has taken place, it is not yet clear that it is being driven by human activity. But I'm trying to read as much as I can. And my mom used to say 'better safe than sorry,' so I am glad the energy bill authorized construction of a number of nuclear power plants in this country, which represents electric-generating facilities that don't produce so-called greenhouse gases. ... It seems to me that this issue has such a significant ability to have an enormous drain on our economy and on our national economic vitality that we should simply let the science drive it.""\April 2008 (Earth Day):\The Star Press asked Pence whether he agreed with this statement: ""The time for doubt has passed. Scientific experts have clearly affirmed that our climate system is warming, as is evident from increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.""\He agreed.\The Star Press asked Pence whether he agreed with this statement: ""This warming is directly linked to human activity. Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.""\Pence: ""I would not agree that there is broad consensus on man-made or human activity being the proximate cause of global warming. I think there is more diversity of opinion among many scientists in this area of discipline than most people realize. I don't think global warming as caused by human activity is a settled question in the scientific community.""\The Star Press asked Pence whether he agreed with this statement: ""Global warming will lead to impacts on weather, agriculture, species, ecosystems, fisheries, coastlines, low-lying areas, vegetation, and drinking water that are abrupt or irreversible.""\Pence: ""Claims of catastrophic consequences in global warming are not reflective of the majority of the opinions even among IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scientists ... ""\The Star Press asked Pence whether he agreed with this statement: ""Local, state and federal governments should take action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.""\Pence: ""I think it is appropriate for particularly the federal government to encourage investment in new, clean, alternative technologies. But I think it should be done in a way that puts the broad interests of the American people first. If we were to embrace the more draconian proposals being advocated by some in Congress and the environmental movement we could see as much as a 20 percent increase in utility bills for Hoosiers.""\April 2009:\""I think, rightly understood, the cap and trade legislation represents an economic declaration of war on the Midwest by liberals in Washington, D.C. I really believe Democratic climate change legislation will cap growth and trade jobs. If ever there was a time that Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Illinois were unable to take the impact of what amounts to a national energy tax, it's a time like this.""\April 2015:\Jeff Dukes, director of the Purdue Climate Change Research Center, told The Star Press: ""It's a shame that some politicians seem to need to find an excuse not to believe our best experts on the planet on this topic. Basically, climate scientists around the world are in agreement that warming is occurring, and nearly all agree that the warming is largely driven by society's greenhouse gas emissions.""\Shortly after Dukes commented, Kara Brooks, press secretary for Gov. Pence, responded to the Star Press: ""The governor continues to keep an open mind about the science behind the cause of climate change but does not believe that it has been fully resolved yet.""\ELECTION 2016:\Women in spotlight\Female voters will be a key target of tonight's vice presidential debate in Virginia. 10A"
50,"Warmer winters, more frequent heavy rainstorms and a longer growing season -- Indiana already is feeling the impact of climate change, according to a massive new federal report.\The report highlights changes that could benefit Hoosiers, such as more productive farms, as well as those that pose serious risks, such as more flooding.\And as Central Indiana sweltered through the kind of heat Wednesday that the report says may become much more common, Congress is debating just how to react to the changes as it considers a measure that could reduce humans' impact on the climate.\Critics worry that the threat of climate change is overblown, but scientists say it is past time to leave that debate behind.\""I understand some of the reluctance and resistance that's out there"" to that idea, said J.C. Randolph, director of Indiana University's Center for Research in Energy and the Environment.\But ""the debate over whether climate change is happening -- it's over. The thing is trying to figure out how to help solve the problem,"" said Randolph, who was not involved with the report.\The report, created by 13 federal agencies and several major universities and research centers, details changes that already have taken place and uses scientific models to predict a range of possible climate-change effects ahead for the U.S. The report doesn't include any new research, instead building on conclusions and information first released by the Bush administration.\Changes unfolding\Among the changes seen in Indiana, ""Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States"" found:\An increase in average annual temperature of 1.8 degrees over the course of a century. That doesn't sound like much, but that is enough to have a complicated impact on climate and weather, scientists said.\It is enough to affect native plants and animals, encouraging them to shift northward and making way for species that prefer warmer conditions to move in.\The National Audubon Society suspects such warming has played a key role in dramatic shifts in bird migrations. American goldfinches and purple finches have begun wintering in Indiana, for example, hundreds of miles farther north than they did 40 years ago.\More frequent heavy rains, especially at times that are bad for farmers, such as the spring planting season.\Warming also has led to more flash flooding of the kind Central Indiana saw a year ago. Heavy downpours are now twice as frequent as they were a century ago.\Both summer and winter precipitation has been above average for the past three decades, the wettest period in a century. The Midwest has experienced two record-breaking floods in the past 15 years.\Shorter, milder winters and a growing season that starts a week earlier.\That means less driving on snow and ice and more growing time for crops, increasing crop yields.\Changes that could come\The report details possible climate change effects ahead. In Indiana, they could include:\More extreme heat waves, creating public health hazards.\The report said the number of heat waves similar to the one in Chicago in 1995 could increase to more than 80 in a 30-year period by 2070 under the highest greenhouse-gas emissions scenario.\That means a greater demand for electricity to keep air conditioners running, a demand that could strain the power grid.\More insect-borne diseases could proliferate in the standing water that could become more common with frequent rains.\""Frankly,"" Randolph said, ""I think there's some very real concern about how these pathogens may be able to move much more readily under warmer temperatures.""\Higher levels of urban ozone, pollution that can exacerbate health problems for those with asthma or other ailments.\Major changes in crop and animal production.\Corn, a staple crop, has difficulty growing in wetter climates. Farmers could turn to rice or other crops that perform better in the new conditions.\Increased temperatures also can put stress on livestock production, said Kevin Gurney, Purdue University professor of earth and atmospheric sciences.\A change in the state's forests.\If temperatures become too hot, Indiana's trademark hardwoods could begin dying. That might lead to more pine trees and scrub oak.\""You could see our forests replaced by grassland, by savannah,"" said Matt Auer, professor of international environmental policy at Indiana University.\Congress weighs emissions\Democratic leaders in the House have scheduled a vote Friday on a climate-change bill that would establish a complex cap-and-trade system to limit the nation's greenhouse-gas emissions, a priority for President Barack Obama.\The leaders angled for support from farm states this week when they agreed to put the Agriculture Department, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency, in charge of evaluating agricultural offsets, the credits farmers could receive for tilling and conservation practices that keep carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas, stored in the soil.\Another report\On Wednesday, a new report by a science advocacy group echoed the warning that global warming could bring scorching summers, more flooding and other problems to Indiana.\The nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists says its report is the first peer-reviewed analysis of what unchecked greenhouse-gas emissions could mean for Indiana.\The group's Midwest office director, Ron Burke, says Indiana could have up to a month of 100-degree days each year by the end of the century.\The Associated Press contributed to this report.\Call Star reporter Amanda Hamon at (317) 444-6705.\More: Go to IndyStar.com for the full report on the effects of global climate change.New poll: Most Americans think the government should regulate greenhouse gases.

51,"Jobs and the Economy\Joe Donnelly: Would make tax cuts for research and development firms permanent. He wants an ""all-in American energy policy"" to lessen the dependence on foreign oil. Supports shifting existing federal funds to college programs that have a track record of creating jobs, pointing out unemployment is highest among the least-educated.\Richard Mourdock: Top recommendation is to reduce government regulation. He said repealing ""Obamacare"" -- the Affordable Care Act -- and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms would spur the economy. Businesses, he said, don't know what their tax rates, health-care costs or the regulatory environment will be, ""so they are sitting on $3.2 trillion"" rather than expanding and hiring.\Health care\Donnelly: Supports the Affordable Care Act, pointing out it provides for the coverage of pre-existing conditions, reduces prescription costs for the elderly and allows young adults to stay on their parents' coverage. However, he wants to repeal a tax on companies that manufacture medical devices, and speed up Food and Drug Administration approval on medical devices.\Mourdock: In place of ""Obamacare,"" insurance companies should be allowed to sell their products across state lines to encourage competition. Also, letting businesses unite their insurance coverage would widen the risk pool and ""get greater potential for covering pre-existing conditions."" He also said insurance companies will just keep some of the more popular elements, such as allowing adult children to stay on their parents' insurance plans\Social Security and Medicare\Donnelly: He wants to ""keep the promise"" of both programs while searching for ways to better implement them. For instance, he would look for opportunities to reduce spending on Medicare, perhaps by paying for a course of treatment rather than individual health-care visits. He would not support privatization and voucher programs, pointing to potential loss in funding due to economic uncertainties -- like the economic collapse of 2008.\Mourdock: Says Social Security and Medicare must be changed for those younger than 55, with different deals made for progressively younger age groups. On Medicare, he supports the proposal by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney that would let seniors have a choice between keeping traditional Medicare or getting ""premium support"" -- a voucher -- to buy private health insurance.\Federal deficit, spending cuts + taxes:\Donnelly: Wants to cut spending and increase revenues. He thinks Congress should order every federal department to reduce spending by 10 percent, except Veterans Affairs. He would increase revenue through royalty payments on new drilling off the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. He also would eliminate tax incentives for companies that shift jobs overseas.\Mourdock: Calls for eliminating four federal departments -- Housing and Urban Development; Commerce; Energy and Education -- with some needed functions moved to other agencies. And, yes, he would deny funds for Big Bird and public television. The best way to address the deficit, he said, is by ""growing the economy."" He opposes raising taxes now, though he favors reforms, including adding a national sales tax, and has signed the Americans for Tax Reform pledge opposing any rate increase.\Bipartisanship\Donnelly: He says he's in Congress to make sure his constituents ""get a fair shake,"" not to promote party ideals. He says the more divisive you are in Congress, the less people want to work with you. He touts his record working across party lines to approve legislation. He also breaks with President Obama on key issues, voting against cap and trade, which would add environmental regulations to state industries.\Mourdock: In his GOP primary campaign against Sen. Richard Lugar, Mourdock said it was time for ""confrontation"" and that ""bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view."" Mourdock said he ""never said I would avoid compromise."" But, he would not compromise on his principles, including that the federal government is too big and expensive.\Compiled by Star reporters Mary Beth Schneider and Chris Sikich\5 questions for Joe Donnelly\Age: 57.\Party: Democrat.\Occupation: Congressman.\Home: Granger.\Personal: Wife, Jill.

Shelley Brim knew her electric rate was set to increase. But when the $507 June bill arrived, she unplugged night lights, unused televisions, cell phone chargers and an above-ground pool pump. She asked her husband to erect a clothes line behind their mobile home on Sadie Lane to dry laundry the old-fashioned way.
\
Her electric bill from the Bloomfield-based Utilities District of Western Indiana REMC the previous month, before the rate hike kicked in, was $234.
\
The Brim family could not afford to pay more than double what they had expected.
\
""Everywhere you go, the REMC bill is a topic of discussion,"" said Brim, secretary at Avoca Baptist Church in Lawrence County. ""We are constantly receiving calls for help with electric bills. How are these people going to make it?""
\
She heard of one family that moved out to their camper and used a generator during the peak summer months to cut out the cost of air conditioning their house.
\
In March, Kim Holt bought the family business, Holt's Cafe in Judah, from her parents. She took over paying the bills, and was shocked when the June REMC bill was more than double what it had been the month before.
\
""It was really hard to make it through the summer because I had not expected it to go up like that. I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention,"" she said. ""We had to let some things go to pay that, and then, when the rate went down this fall, I tried to catch up.""
\
She said electric bills often are the talk of the restaurant these days. ""And at the fair this summer, everybody was talking about it. The farmers and the older people, they get really upset,"" she said.
\
It's been suggested she could raise her meal prices to help pay the electric bill. ""But I just can't do that, because my customers are facing the same increases I am, and they might stop coming if I charge more.""
\
Why the increases?
\
There is a valid reason behind the rate increase and billing changes affecting UDWI REMC customers, who now pay more per kilowatt hour (kWh) during the three hottest and three coldest months of the year, when they consume more power to keep cool, then stay warm.
\
During more temperate months, when customers consume less, the rate dips way down, from 13.6 cents per kWh to 7.3 cents.
\
Here's why: Like the 17 other electric cooperatives that purchase their electric power in bulk from Bloomington-based Hoosier Energy, UDWI pays for it as the company is billed. Hoosier Energy's new rate structure charges more for power during peak-use times, and less for energy consumed when demand is lower.
\
That's because Hoosier Energy pays more for electricity during peaks and passes the cost along to its REMC consumers. During low-use times, those costs are greatly reduced.
\
Brian Sparks, chief executive officer for UDWI REMC, said he had to change the rate structure to be in line with the bills he receives from Hoosier Energy. Electric cooperatives do not have huge sums of money on hand to pay in advance, Sparks said. Instead, his REMC is customer-owned, not a private corporation or utility.
\
Over time, Sparks said, consumers' high and low electric bills balance out, although REMC officials admit the new rates will result in users paying about 5 percent more during the course of a year. ""The biggest increase I have seen, figuring over a year, was 9 percent,"" Sparks said.
\
""We do realize it has hit people hard, especially with the economy the way it is. But this is how we are billed, and we have to balance our cash flow,"" he explained. ""The increase to customers is revenue neutral for us. We don't make more money charging these rates. It pays for the power as we are billed for it.""
\
Customers have known the billing changes were coming for several years, Sparks said. As the time grew near, he held eight meetings around the 11-county district, serving a meal and explaining how the new system worked. He addressed the upcoming change in the REMC newsletter each customer received. And it was a topic at the cooperative's annual meeting in April, held at Bloomfield High School and attended by 600 people.
\
""Yes, we were aware, but I guess everybody just didn't realize how much it would be. It did not kick in that it would be this bad,"" Brim said. ""Then we had a really hot summer, so it was even worse.""
\
First a drop, then a panic
\
Struggling families and people on fixed incomes most often receive the same amount of income every month and count on bills to remain somewhat steady. So when UDWI REMC customers such as William and Shelley Brim saw their bill increase from one month to the next by 117 percent, panic set in.
\
This past spring, the Brims and 19,000 or so other households and businesses benefited from a low rate UDWI REMC's board of directors initiated in April. The kWh cost was slashed to just 7.3 cents, a rate not seen for 15 years. Before that, UDWI REMC members paid a straight rate of 10.3 cents per kWh all year long.
\
No one complained about the low bills when the rate went down three cents.
\
Then came June, and the kWh rate jumped to 13.6 cents for the next three months. It was a hot summer, so increased air conditioning use plus the higher rate combined to create quite a shock for customers when they received their summer electric bills.
\
Many complained. Loudly.
\
""We heard from people, of course. It is a big change,"" Sparks said. ""An increase like this is not something that is common in this area.""
\
Brim, the church secretary, often fields requests from church members needing help paying utility bills. Those inquiries soared. More than 1,000 customers signed petitions ""to voice our concern and confirm the hardship that this has placed on individuals in this community.""
\
Citizens were up in arms over the summer, although the clamor died down when the 7.3-cent rate returned for the temperate fall months of September, October and November.
\
But come Wednesday, UDWI REMC customer's rates will jump back up to 13.7 cents per kWh. They will remain at that rate until March 1.
\
In a letter to news organizations asking that someone look into the rate structure, Brim outlined her concerns.
\
""It doesn't seem right,"" she wrote. ""What about the many that get laid off in the winter months? What about the people that are struggling and now are hit with this? What about people on budgets or Social Security? And the elderly, who have to choose air or heat over their medications?""
\
Brim is not one to stir things up. But she had to do something on behalf of the REMC customers she kept hearing from. She wrote a letter and prepared a petition. ""Somehow, I have ended up being the voice behind it all,"" she said.
\
The evening of Nov. 4, Sparks and two UDWI REMC board of directors met with the Brims at Gulletts Creek Baptist Church, where William Brim is the minister. ""They explained why the increases happened and said this is what had to happen to keep from building more power plants and that Hoosier Energy's increases and government regulations were behind it. They talked about something called 'cap and trade,'"" Shelley Brim said.
\
Then they asked her why she had not said much during the presentation. ""I said all of that was just fine, but it would not do anything to help people who could not afford it.""
\
The men told her about REMC's budget plan. The power company determines how much power a household likely will consume, based on past usage, then divides that amount into 12 payments.
\
""For now, our bill will be $315 a month,"" Brim said. ""It would have been just $173 for October because of the lower rate, but of course it's more on the budget because it tries to even it out."" She's hoping for no more $500 REMC bills.
\
After the meeting, Sparks sent someone to the couple's mobile home to check the insulation, windows and doors to make sure the home was sound in that regard.
\
""The guy said everything was fine as far as efficiency goes,"" Brim said.
\
Sparks said consumers of electricity must realize costs will continue to increase. The way to save money is to cut back usage, and high rates during peak times should encourage people to do that.
\
""It's hard to think about saving money and cutting back on something you never see,"" Sparks said.
\
Other customers already affected
\
UDWI REMC customers are not the first, or the last, to face new rate structures for electricity. South Central Indiana REMC, based in Martinsville, is ready to launch new time-of-use residential rates that will be higher during peak times.
\
But they haven't implemented the system yet, realizing the cooperative's 39,000 members - many in Morgan, Monroe, Brown and Owen counties - have not been educated in the merits of the rate change and the reasons behind it.
\
SCI REMC's new structure has a flat 7.5-cent-per-kWh rate during March, April, May, September, October and November. During June, July and August, though, the rate jumps to 20.17 cents during peak times, which are noon to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday. The rest of the time, the rate goes down to 7.5 cents.
\
And during the frigid months of December, January and February, the peak rate - from 7 to 10 a.m. and from 6 to 9 p.m. weekdays - is 21.97 cents. Again, it goes down to 7.5 all other times.
\
CEO Kevin Sump acknowledged the rate structure is complicated. But since it reflects the rates Hoosier Energy charges SCI REMC, it makes sense.
\
He tried the new time of use system on his own home, without changing his usage pattern, and said he would have saved $102 over a year because he and his wife are not home to use power during the day. Making a change like moving laundry to weekends could make a big difference under such a plan, he said.
\
Consumers of electricity can direct their usage to less-expensive times and save money for themselves and energy for the environment. And both REMCs soon will offer equipment that can ramp down a household's usage during peak times by activating a switch to turn off an air conditioner's compressor, for instance, or shut down a water heater for a period of time.
\
""This kind of change results in reducing usage as people become more aware of the reality of the costs of electricity and how it is charged,"" Sump said. ""They physically reduce usage and move it to less expensive times. We need to influence consumer usage patterns away from peak times. Because the only environmentally friendly kilowatt hour is the one we do not produce.""

53,"Unlike most who enter politics, Brad Ellsworth didn't get his first taste studying political science in college, working on a campaign or idolizing presidential heroes.\He wanted a bulletproof vest.\As a young deputy on the Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Department during the mid-1980s, Ellsworth watched as a debate unfolded on the County Council between Democrats who wanted to spend $40,000 to equip officers with vests and Republicans who opposed the idea.\""When I got on the department, I had that swear-off-politics attitude,"" Ellsworth said. ""But these councilmen were willing to protect us, and that's how I got involved, supporting them.""\Since that baptism as a Democrat, Ellsworth has risen quickly through the political ranks.\In 1998, he won his first of two terms as Vanderburgh County sheriff before successfully running for Congress in 2006.\Now, in his second term in the U.S. House, Ellsworth is out to climb the political ladder again -- this time vying with Republican Dan Coats for the U.S. Senate seat soon to be vacated by Democrat Evan Bayh.\As Ellsworth, 51, is engaged in a battle for one of the country's elite political jobs, he's also in the midst of an internal struggle.\Running for the job forces Ellsworth to go against his nature.\He's an introvert who's not comfortable talking about himself, a challenge when candidates need to tout their strengths.\Just as problematic: He loathes publicly criticizing others, a hurdle when today's political environment practically demands attack ads and sharp tongues.\""You won't hear him talk about his accomplishments, but I think he has to do that,"" said Vanderburgh County Sheriff Eric Williams, a close friend who succeeded Ellsworth as sheriff and worked with him for almost two decades.\""It's not easy for him, but when you're campaigning for U.S. Senate, it's time to brag and talk about your strengths for the job.""\Frugal and shy\Ellsworth has lived in the southwestern toe of Indiana his entire life.\He was born in Jasper and lived in Huntingburg until he was 9 years old, when his family moved to Evansville, where he has lived ever since.\Growing up, Ellsworth says, ""if we were poor, I didn't know it, but looking back now, I can say it was a struggle.""\Every Sunday in Huntingburg, his parents, Jim and Margaret, would pile him, his two older brothers, Joe and Eric, and his older sister, Lisa, into their '53 Ford and drive to church.\""You could see the road through the floorboard,"" Ellsworth said. ""And on the way home, we couldn't take the most direct route, because there was this hill, and the car couldn't make it up there.""\He grew up in a small, three-bedroom ranch home where he and his brothers shared a 9-foot-by-9-foot room that had just enough space for a bed, a bunk bed and a three-drawer dresser.\""Joe got the top drawer, Eric got the middle, and I got the bottom one.""\Butch Hancock, an Evansville car dealer, grew up next door.\""We used to run the neighborhood,"" Hancock said with a Southern drawl. ""Brad never, ever got mad. Never got in any fights. He was a real good buddy, always looking out for you.""\As long as he can remember, Ellsworth had a job.\He made extra cash as a kid by pulling a lawnmower behind his purple Schwinn Sting Ray bicycle, offering to cut neighbors' lawns. His first real paycheck came at 15, working at a Super Slide, where he handed out burlap sacks and charged 10 cents a trip down the large plastic slides.\During high school, he bagged groceries at Wesselman's Supermarket. He paid his way through college at Indiana State University-Evansville working at Sears, first on the loading dock and later as a salesman in the paint and hardware department.\""I got a 10 percent discount and would buy stuff out of the return bin,"" said the frugal Ellsworth, who drives a 9-year-old Toyota Tundra pickup. ""In fact, I still have my Sears circular saw, my orbital sander. I'd be a good Craftsman commercial.""\During college, Ellsworth lived at home with his parents. He studied sociology with an emphasis in criminal justice and joined the Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity.\It was at a frat party that he first danced with Beth Wannemueller. Soon after, he approached her in a student lounge.\""He was literally sweating bullets,"" she recalled. ""He's really an introvert, so he was really shy, and it was probably the hardest thing he'd ever had to do in his whole life.""\Brad and Beth Ellsworth married in 1982 and had their only child, Andrea, four years later.\After graduating from college, Ellsworth applied for the Sheriff's Department. He quickly rattles off the first day he wore the badge: April 10, 1982.\But a badge is all he had.\""They started me off working in the jail, but they didn't have new uniforms yet,"" Ellsworth said with a laugh. ""But I had some brown corduroy pants and a tan shirt, and I thought that's kind of close to the colors. So I just wore that.""\Proving himself\Ellsworth quickly rose through the ranks, including several years as an undercover narcotics detective. His uniform those days: jeans, a T-shirt, a mustache and a mullet.\""I worried about him the most when he was in narcotics, because honestly, he didn't look the part,"" Beth Ellsworth said. ""He grew the mustache and looked as rough as he could, but I thought he was the last person who needed to be making drug buys.""\Ellsworth said he had to talk the sheriff into believing he wasn't ""too clean-cut"" for the job.\His next assignment, to start the department's DARE anti-drug program in schools, better suited his appearance -- but he wasn't happy about it.\""I was like, 'Don't do that to me,' "" he said. ""I'm in the most macho job in the world, having fun busting dope dealers, and they're like, 'We want you to go in schools and work with fifth-graders.' ""\That two-year stint, however, turned out to be one of the most rewarding jobs he'd ever had, Ellsworth said. It also paved the way for his political career.\A few years later, with then-Sheriff Ray Hamner's second term about up, a group of deputies, tired of having Evansville police officers get elected to run their department, decided to put up their own candidate.\One of those deputies held a meeting in his basement to decide who that candidate should be, and they all looked toward Ellsworth, Williams said. They cited the fact he had held every rank in the department and his community work through DARE as chief reasons he should run.\""We all saw Brad as having the right demeanor, the right background, the right credentials, the skill set and the popularity to do it,"" Williams said. ""I think he wanted to do it, but we had to convince him to do it.""\Ellsworth was the underdog in the Democratic primary, which pitted him against then-Evansville Police Chief Art Gann, who was backed by Mayor Frank McDonald. Ellsworth won easily.\Longtime Vanderburgh County Republican Bettye Lou Jerrel says there's an overwhelming reason why Ellsworth won -- his looks.\Jerrel, who twice has chaired the county GOP but also was in charge of safety for Evansville schools, remembers when she first met Ellsworth. He was visiting the school district's main office to discuss DARE.\""All those secretaries stopped, and they were all thinking, 'My goodness. What a handsome young man,' but there was no interest in what he was going to do. His appearance, without a doubt, is a great part of his success.""\The notion that some people consider his looks over his credentials always has irked Ellsworth, Williams said.\""When he was running for sheriff, there was an article in a local magazine, and the lady who wrote it said Brad had the hottest buns in law enforcement since Eric Estrada,"" Williams said.\""Brad was beside himself upset with that because he constantly said, 'I don't want people to vote for me because they like the way I look. I want people to know I'm capable of doing these jobs.' He's proven that he's very capable.""\That challenge would follow him to Congress, when as a freshman lawmaker The Hill newspaper named him the most beautiful person on Capitol Hill.\""It absolutely was the worst thing that ever happened. I want to be known as the hard worker, the guy who jumped in the ditch and did the work,"" Ellsworth said. ""That's not a label I would have ever sought or been proud of.""\The sheriff\As sheriff, Ellsworth tackled the long-controversial topic of building a new jail.\Jerrel, a county commissioner at the time, said he did a solid job as sheriff and handled the jail project well.\To sell the new $34 million jail, Ellsworth opened up the old, crowded jail for tours twice a week so the public could see the 530 inmates crammed into a building with 263 beds.\""Building a jail is not a popular thing to take on, but Brad got it done,"" Williams said. ""He did a very good job of explaining to the public why it was necessary.""\But the most gut-wrenching issue Ellsworth had to tackle as sheriff involved Hamner, his predecessor and mentor.\Shortly after taking office, Ellsworth learned $60,000 was missing from a stash of money that undercover detectives used to buy drugs. He received a tip that it was Hamner who took the money, so he called his former boss, expecting him to laugh it off.\He didn't.\Ellsworth called the county prosecutor and contacted the State Police to conduct an investigation. Hamner later admitted to taking the money and pleaded guilty. Ellsworth hasn't spoken to him since.\Williams said the incident showed Ellsworth's toughness as a leader.\""It was devastating, absolutely devastating,"" Ellsworth said. ""This was a friend, a mentor, a guy that gave me many opportunities on the department. It was horrible, but what are you going to do? The law is the law.""\Just two years into his time as sheriff, Ellsworth began receiving letters from party insiders, urging him to run against U.S. Rep. John Hostettler. Ellsworth threw the letters away.\But as the end of his second term as sheriff approached -- Indiana law limits sheriffs to two consecutive terms -- he slowly started to consider it. One evening during a walk around their five acres in Evansville, the Ellsworths decided to go for it.\Both admit they had no idea what they were getting into as a congressional candidate.\Ellsworth's 2006 run against Hostettler drew national attention in a year when Democrats took control of the House from Republicans. That also meant millions of dollars spent on negative ads against Ellsworth.\""We were really naive to the process,"" said Beth Ellsworth, who is a dental hygienist in Evansville. ""It was baptism by fire, for sure.""\The congressman\Ellsworth would go on to defeat Hostettler handily, and in 2008, he cruised to re-election.\Earlier this year, when Bayh shockingly announced his retirement, party insiders immediately flocked to Ellsworth.\After wrestling with the decision for a few days, he and his wife decided he should run.\With the bid has come even more attention -- and scrutiny.\Ellsworth remains on the conservative end of his party as a pro-gun, anti-abortion Democrat, but Republicans have worked aggressively to tie him to President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi by highlighting his votes for health-care reform and the federal stimulus package.\But Ellsworth points out he voted against Obama's cap-and-trade climate and energy legislation, even after the president called him personally to persuade him to do otherwise.\A voting analysis from Congressional Quarterly shows Ellsworth is one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress. In 2007 and 2009, he voted with his party 78 percent of the time, while the average Democrat did so 92 percent of the time. In 2008, he voted with Democrats 85 percent of the time, while the average also was 92 percent.\In those years, only a handful of Democrats voted with Republicans more often than Ellsworth.\""They say in the political ads that you're this Pelosi lap dog,"" he said, ""but that couldn't be further from the truth.""\Ellsworth admits it's uncomfortable for him to pat himself on the back during the campaign.\""Talking about himself is probably one of the hardest things for him, but it's particularly hard for him to say something about an opponent,"" Beth Ellsworth said. ""It's rare, and he has to be provoked.""\It happened last week, when Ellsworth lashed out at Coats over a television ad Ellsworth said distorted his record in Congress. But Ellsworth said he detests such confrontations.\""I want to formulate the policy in Washington,"" he said. ""I'd rather not have to go through the politics. I hate the politics.""\Ellsworth also has tried to shun Washington stereotypes.\He insisted that his campaign use a white SUV to travel the state, because a black one ""is what a lot of folks do in Washington, and I think it looks really pretentious.""\When he first arrived in Washington, Capitol police would stop him because he rarely wears his congressional lapel pin.\""They recognize me now,"" he said with a chuckle. ""I'm proud of the job, but I think the pin calls attention to yourself, and that's not what I'm there for.""\Beth Ellsworth said Congress keeps her husband away more, but he hasn't changed much and is still a simple guy who enjoys simple things.\""He wants to go hang out at Lowe's. He likes his lawn mower,"" she said. ""Going to Washington may have made him more worldly, but it's also made him hang on more to what we have here.\""He's not D.C. and never will be.""\Call Star reporter Bill Ruthhart at (317) 444-2771.\________________________\The U.S. Senate race in Indiana\This week, The Indianapolis Star is profiling the candidates in the race to replace Sen.

54,"Democrats in Congress think they are on a roll after passing the stimulus bill. But we can't let the urgent economic needs create a snowball effect of bad legislation.\One example is the push for a cap-and-trade carbon policy. This would create an artificial market open to manipulation and speculation, without the assurance of doing anything for the environment.\I don't know how legislators can even bring up such a scheme at a time when millions of Americans are out of work and businesses are struggling to survive. A cap-and-trade policy would add billions of dollars in energy costs, without reducing emissions. In addition, it would require the creation and funding of a government bureaucracy to try to regulate against speculators.\When there aren't real market forces to contain prices, regulation and oversight are the only options. But as we have seen with recent financial scandals and the speculative run-up in the price of oil last summer, regulation and oversight don't work. Investors lost their entire life savings in the case of financial scandal. Instead, we need a simple, transparent carbon tax that will reduce our emissions, without the political ""gaming.""\We cannot afford the additional costs and resultant loss of jobs the cap-and-trade scheme would bring. Congress must stand firm against this bad idea.\Paul Hoffman\Indianapolis"
55,"Voters want action on climate change and the environment, both in Indiana and across the country. State level surveys show that seven in 10 Hoosiers want their government to do more. And polling across the country shows the majority of voters support a transition to renewable energy.\Still, candidates at both the gubernatorial and presidential level have put forward starkly different environmental approaches.\Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb has not listed climate among his main priorities, while Democratic challenger Dr. Woody Myers has. President Trump has pushed a deregulatory agenda while former Vice President Joe Biden recently released a climate plan.\With the Nov. 3 election less than a week away, here's what you need to know about the major elections if you are voting with the environment in mind.\Coal has helped Indiana keep energy prices low in the past, which in turn has attracted businesses to the state. But as energy costs have risen almost 30% in the last decade, some utilities have made the move toward other energy sources and announced plans to retire their coal plants. Today, more than half of Indiana's energy still comes from coal.\Holcomb advocates keeping coal in Indiana's energy mix, as part of an ""all-of-the-above"" approach that also includes ""clean coal,"" renewables and natural gas.\Holcomb also supports President Donald Trump's deregulations and rollbacks, which experts say could lead to more air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Holcomb said this deregulation allows states to develop polices that are best suit their needs.\Holcomb's Democratic opponent Dr. Woody Myers, on the other hand, wants to move the state aggressively toward renewable energy sources and get ""completely away"" from fossil fuels. He would reinstate net metering — a policy that makes rooftop solar more affordable for homeowners, which Holcomb started to phase out in 2017 — and put wind and solar on government buildings and properties.\Biden similarly wants to move toward clean energy in the coming decades, and believes that there is economic growth in making that transition. His $2 trillion climate plan includes additional investment in renewables, as well as further innovation and infrastructure in the field.\Trump has taken a deregulation approach to environmental policy, moving to roll back nearly 100 environmental rules in the last four years. Many of those are still in progress or being fought in court.\He's said that this stance prioritizes economic growth for industry and utility companies, but environmentalists worry the rollbacks could lead to worsening air quality in Indiana, one of the most coal-reliant states in the country. At a national level, research has shown these rollbacks could release significantly more greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the air.\Biden's climate plan would see a carbon-free energy sector across the country by 2035. But in Indiana, which ranks highly in the country for coal consumption, this is a tight time frame.\About 59% of the state's electricity comes from coal, while renewables accounted for only 7%. Although several utilities already plan to move away from coal in the next decade, others might not do so for another 20 years.\One thing Biden's plan does not include, to the dismay of some, is a carbon tax, which would tax greenhouse gas producers for their emissions.\Biden has made addressing climate change a major part of this platform, laying out ambitions to achieve net-zero emissions in the U.S. by 2050.\Woody Myers also lists climate as one of his top priorities, and said he considers the climate crisis as both a public health and national security threat.\Gov. Holcomb does not list climate change as a top priority, and has said the extent of human contribution is debatable, although it's ""reasonable to assume that human activity contributes to changes in our climate over time.""\President Trump has a starkly different stance on climate change, dismissing the science and calling it a hoax in the past. Notably, within his first six months in office, he removed the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, a pledge signed by more than 170 countries to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\In the last decade, funding for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management has fallen by 20%, even as overall state spending grew. Staffing also fell by 150 jobs, raising concerns from some about the agency's ability to fulfill its mission to protect human health and the environment.\Myers would give IDEM ""a shot of epinephrine,"" he told IndyStar, and provide the agency with additional resources and attention.\When asked about whether he would consider increasing IDEM's funding, Holcomb said he administration doesn't measure effectiveness by the number of dollars or personnel.\This year, public outcry over police brutality spurred by the killing of George Floyd has pointed the spotlight on systemic racism in multiple spheres, including the environmental community. Low-income communities and communities of color remain at a disproportionately higher risk from pollution, climate change and hazardous waste.\In August, Holcomb pledged to address racial inequity across the state, and told IndyStar that his plans could include environmental inequity as well.\Myers also said environmental justice would be a focus for him, pointing to lead poisoning in East Chicago and elsewhere as an example of an issue he would tackle in office.\Biden has said environmental justice is part of his climate plan, which also includes creating an environmental climate and justice office within the Department of Justice.\Trump has not given environmental justice the same priority. In September, his EPA postponed their internal speaker and training series on the same topic.\Early voting is available until Nov. 2, and election day is Nov. 3.

Although several utilities already plan to move away from coal in the next decade, others might not do so for another 20 years.\One thing Biden's plan does not include, to the dismay of some, is a carbon tax, which would tax greenhouse gas producers for their emissions.\Biden has made addressing climate change a major part of this platform, laying out ambitions to achieve net-zero emissions in the U.S. by 2050.\Woody Myers also lists climate as one of his top priorities, and said he considers the climate crisis as both a public health and national security threat.\Gov. Holcomb does not list climate change as a top priority, and has said the extent of human contribution is debatable, although it's ""reasonable to assume that human activity contributes to changes in our climate over time.""\President Trump has a starkly different stance on climate change, dismissing the science and calling it a hoax in the past. Notably, within his first six months in office, he removed the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, a pledge signed by more than 170 countries to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\In the past decade, funding for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management has fallen by 20%, even as overall state spending grew. Staffing also fell by 150 jobs, raising concerns from some about the agency's ability to fulfill its mission to protect human health and the environment.\Myers would give IDEM ""a shot of epinephrine,"" he told IndyStar, and provide the agency with additional resources and attention.\When asked about whether he would consider increasing IDEM's funding, Holcomb said the administration doesn't measure effectiveness by the number of dollars or personnel.\This year, public outcry over police brutality spurred by the killing of George Floyd has pointed the spotlight on systemic racism in multiple spheres, including the environmental community. Low-income communities and communities of color remain at a disproportionately higher risk from pollution, climate change and hazardous waste.\In August, Holcomb pledged to address racial inequity across the state, and told IndyStar that his plans could include environmental inequity as well.\Myers also said environmental justice would be a focus for him, pointing to lead poisoning in East Chicago and elsewhere as an example of an issue he would tackle in office.\Biden has said environmental justice is part of his climate plan, which also includes creating an environmental climate and justice office within the Department of Justice.\Trump has not given environmental justice the same priority. In September, his EPA postponed their internal speaker and training series on the same topic.\Early voting ends Monday, and Election Day is Tuesday.

Liberals sure are funny these days. In criticizing local Republicans, Joy Shayne Laughter wrote (Oct. 11), ""Anyone who starts a business knows you've got to get out there and prove your goods are better than others."" Right! And then, make sure you don't prove your goods are so much better that your business grows so much that you've got over 49 workers, for whom you must provide costly health insurance, including coverage for such ""illnesses"" as pregnancy and requiring me to violate my religion by paying for abortion (as if the First Amendment did not exist).
\
And make sure you don't prove your goods are so much better that you must hire many employees, because, you know, you will soon be paying drastically higher taxes thanks, again, to our liberal, socialist president. After all, ""You didn't build that!""

Liberals don't get it
\
To the editor:
\
Kevin Hunt (Oct. 13) set out to disprove the ""total ignorance"" of liberals on economics. The result: He again proved liberals just don't get it.
\
Hunt boasts he could balance the budget using a magic ""algorithm"" concocted by none other than the liberal New York Times. Naturally, its highlight is raising taxes on everyone, imposing a new ""millionaire's tax,"" and adding another ""carbon tax."" ""That's it,"" he claims!
\
So, at a time when we have miniscule, declining economic growth, Hunt claims raising taxes is the solution! Yep, he expects small business owners to absorb a tax hike without affecting unemployment. Here's the result we'd get: decreased government revenue due to much higher unemployment; a very deep recession, if not depression; more declines in median income; and increased government dependency.
\
It's funny, how liberals think higher taxes, nationalized health care, hugely increased business regulations and high energy prices can actually produce a healthy economy! In the meantime, let us highlight a quote from the same H-T edition in which Hunt's letter appeared: ""Obama's presidency has now coincided with four straight $1 trillion-plus annual budget deficits - the first in history ...""

Doesn't feel 'assault'
\
To the editor:
\
Tim Latimer's letter (Oct. 19) complained about a supposed Republican ""assault on schools and labor unions,"" as well as complaining about right-to-work legislation. He specified that these abhorrent problems exist particularly in Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.
\
I wonder which of the assault's effects Mr. Latimer does not like: Is it the significantly lower unemployment rate, compared with the national average, that exists in each of the three above-mentioned states? Or the balanced budgets that each state boasts? Or that Indiana now ranks fifth in the nation in best-business environment rating, and is attracting many new businesses and job opportunities (see Cecil Bohanon H-T article Oct. 14)?
\
Let us know, Mr. Latimer. And tell us how the 23 million unemployed people under Obama is not an ""assault,"" please.

Keep schools public
\
To the editor:
\
Politics turns me off. The negativity bothers me, I'm skeptical of campaign promises, and I don't trust that I'm getting all the facts. Yet I try to be well informed, so that I can be a responsible voter and citizen.
\
Enter the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), whose name sounds harmless enough. Far from harmless, ALEC is a group of politicians and corporations that meets behind closed doors to write new laws - my fears, confirmed. You can be sure, if corporations are involved, that the beneficiaries of these laws are not the communities in which they are passed, but the people who stand to gain financially. ALEC's efforts include education reform. How can corporations benefit from education? By privatizing schools.
\
I don't know if Tony Bennett is a member of ALEC or not, but his strategy of grading schools and school districts, using a system that is designed for schools to fail, is right in line with ALEC's corporate interests. When a school fails, the corporations are invited in. And who, ultimately, will benefit then? The students? I think not. I support Glenda Ritz for Indiana State Superintendent (www.ritz4ed.com), who believes in keeping public education public.

Autopsy facilities
\
To the editor: In a recent article, Walt Hatfield, Republican for Monroe County coroner, quoted Dr. James Jacobi, a forensic pathologist, as saying he would perform autopsies in local funeral homes. Nicole Meyer (Democrat), the current coroner, said ""in conversation with other board certified forensic pathologists, it's not responsible practice to conduct autopsies in a funeral home."" What forensic pathologists did she talk to? Can't she quote them?
\
Nicole Meyer also said, ""After speaking with the local funeral homes in Monroe County, some as recently as last week, they have also stated they do not have the additional facilities to perform autopsies. nor do they want to assume the liability of them."" If Nicole Meyer did, indeed, speak to local funeral homes, who did she talk to?
\
Walter Hatfield did his homework. He did speak to Dr. Jacobi, a well-respected forensic pathologist. I am employed as an autopsy technician. The pathologist I work for performs autopsies in funeral homes around the state. The autopsies are done in the prep room of the funeral homes. No additional facilities are necessary. That is a ridiculous statement that no funeral director would have made. As far as liability, our company carries the coverage.

59,"Former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis can tell you: It's a lot easier being a Republican climate change activist now than it was 10 years ago.\But that doesn't mean Indiana Sen. Mike Braun isn't to be celebrated for helping to introduce the first Senate bipartisan caucus for climate solutions last month, Inglis said. In fact, he said it's more important now than ever for Republicans to join the conversation.\""The piece that we're missing,"" Inglis said, ""is American conservatives.""\Inglis, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, praised Braun at Greening the Statehouse, a conference of environmentally minded people and policymakers Saturday in Westfield.\For Inglis' first six years in Congress, he said in an interview with IndyStar, he was a climate change skeptic. After a few life-changing events, including trips to Antarctica and the Great Barrier Reef, by 2008 he had turned from skeptic to activist.\When Inglis proposed a plan to increase wages and implement a carbon tax in 2009, he faced pushback from his party. In what he called a ""rather spectacular face-plant in politics,"" Inglis lost his reelection with less than 30% of the votes.\""That (carbon tax) got me in a fair amount of trouble, politically,"" Inglis said. ""It appeared to people that I had crossed to the other side.""\Inglis spoke at the conference, which is hosted by the Hoosier Environmental Council, about RepublicEN.org, an organization he founded to unite conservatives concerned about climate change. Today, he travels the country and speaks about bipartisan support on climate change – and he continues to support a carbon tax.\More than 70% of Indiana's energy relies on coal, a subject that has become a source of conflict between environmental activists and state legislators.\Yet some environmentalists say working with legislators is the surest way to achieve their goals.\John Delurey, Midwest director of solar power advocacy organization Vote Solar, said there are many policies that could act as a huge boost for solar power in Indiana.\Some of these policies, including what he said was a ""brilliant"" financing model called PACE, have already been implemented or are in the process of being implemented in neighboring states.\""Things aren't as bad as they might seem ... but there are a key few missing pieces,"" Delurey said at the conference. ""Ultimately, the path to victory in Indiana looks like these tangible, concrete policy wins.""\State Sen. Mark Stoops, a Democrat from Bloomington's District 40, also reminded attendees at the conference to work with legislators, particularly in regard to support for public transportation and trains.\Stoops said trains and public transportation boost economic development, benefiting employers as they make it easier for employees to show up to work.\""These things are stated priorities, but beyond ground implementation, it means passing legislation to get that done,"" Stoops said.\Considering Indiana's position as one of the largest manufacturing and agricultural states in the country, Sen. Braun's initiative to start a bipartisan climate caucus in October came as a surprise to some.\Braun teamed with Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons to start the caucus. The two senators plan to address reducing emissions, sustainable agriculture and energy security.\Inglis said one of the main reasons it's difficult for Republicans to get on board with climate change action is because the rhetoric surrounding the issue often doesn't relate to their beliefs. It's what he calls ""the language of the left.""\But that's why Inglis believes Sen. Braun will be so valuable for conveying climate change problems to conservatives, he said. Braun's business background may help him present the issues in a ""pitch-perfect"" way.\""I think that his experience in business is going to serve us very well in the U.S. Senate; he helped devise an answer to climate change that meets the needs of business and meets the needs of the environment,"" Inglis said. ""He's just the right messenger for free enterprise solution on climate change.""\Contact IndyStar reporter London Gibson at 317-444-6043 or lbgibson@gannett.com.

60,"eweddle@jconline.com\Despite the tough economic times and recent layoffs, Indiana is poised to attract new manufacturing jobs.\That was the message Wednesday from E. Mitchell Roob Jr. during the keynote address of the eighth annual Advanced Manufacturing Summit at Purdue University.\Roob, state secretary of commerce and chief executive of the Indiana Economic Development Corp., listed a number of reasons why he thinks the state is well-positioned.\He said Indiana is one of three states with a surplus budget. He noted the state's ability to work with renewable energy, such as wind power and clean coal. And he said Indiana's central location and low cost of doing business will continue to appeal to out-of-state or foreign businesses.\""We are going to come out of this recession like a jet plane, ready to go, ready to deliver more jobs and more services than ever before,"" he said.\Still, Roob offered a few caveats.\Roob said industrial investment in the state, if not the country, could disappear if a carbon tax -- a tax on emissions of carbon dioxide or other pollutants -- is enacted federally.\The cost could worry investors, especially during a time when credit is already difficult to come by, he said.\""There are better ways to clean up the environment. The carbon tax is a tax on manufacturing.""\The recently announced layoffs at Caterpillar and Kirby Risk Service Center, two Lafayette plants, and others throughout the Midwest were felt at the summit, which was hosted by Discovery Park's Center for Advanced Manufacturing.\Last year, about 400 people attended from across the Midwest. Turnout was closer to 200 people on Wednesday.\""A lot of it has to do with the economy,"" said John Sullivan, director of the Center for Advanced Manufacturing. ""Taking a half-day away from the office to come here may not be as easy as before.""\Sullivan said he would like the Indiana Economic Development Corp. to do more for business facing layoffs and declines in manufacturing. Roob said the Indiana Economic Development Corp. was focused on selling Indiana's attributes.\Both agreed that advanced manufacturing was key to the future of the state's economy.\A quarter of the state's $246.4 billion in gross domestic product comes from manufacturing, said Yung Shin, a Purdue advanced manufacturing professor.\""Innovation spurs growth,"" he said. ""Manufacturing spurs the rest of the economy.""\An award for Easterday\A Subaru of Indiana Automotive Inc. executive was awarded Purdue University's Excellence in Manufacturing Innovation award Wednesday.\Thomas Easterday, SIA's senior vice president, received the award for his vision and leadership in advancing SIA's sustainable manufacturing efforts, according to John Sullivan, director of Purdue's Center for Advanced Manufacturing.\In 2004 SIA became the first U.S. auto assembly plant to achieve zero landfill status, meaning that more than 99 percent of its refuse is recycled or reused so it doesn't end up in a landfill.\""Your house makes more trash than the entire plant,"" Sullivan said.\The award is given annually by the advanced manufacturing center to an individual whose vision and leadership creates a new standard in manufacturing.\-- Eric Weddle/eweddle@jconline.com"
61,"Democrat David Johnson and Libertarian Paul Hager face quite a few hurdles in the race for U.S. Senate. They're not only running against a popular incumbent in the form of Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, but against Lugar's international reputation in foreign affairs. In wide-ranging interviews with The Indianapolis Star editorial board, the three candidates offered three distinct visions of the America they'd like to leave their grandchildren. Here are edited transcripts of what they had to say:\Education\Q: Education is one of the top issues in the governor's race in Indiana. What is Congress' proper role in helping Indiana improve education?\Paul Hager: I follow the U.S. Constitution, and the Constitution has no enumerated power for education. In my view, the federal government should abolish the Department of Education and cease being involved.\David Johnson: I think there is a federal role in education, and it's primarily to help our local and community schools do a better job of educating our kids. It's very important that we give our communities the resources they need, for example, to learn in classrooms with more and better trained teachers, more modernized facilities.\Richard Lugar: I think the role of Congress is to provide more money through education appropriations that could be available to state and local governments to make the necessary choices. During this campaign, I've indicated I am not serving as a super school board member, but I am attempting to facilitate and will vote for much larger educational appropriations on the assumption that the strings will be fewer and the opportunities, the options, will be greater for people here in Indiana.\Budget surplus\Q: The Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal budget surplus, excluding Social Security, will total $2.2 trillion over the next decade. What would be your strategy for dealing with the surplus: cut taxes, increase federal spending or reduce the debt?\Hager: There's a big ""if"" there, and it's predicated on the continuation of the economy expanding, and I have absolutely no reason to assume that would be the case. So I'm kind of disinclined to talk about some kind of miracle budget surplus. To the extent there is a surplus, I think it should be used to facilitate the process of phasing out the entitlement programs and of privatizing Social Security. There's obviously going to be some cost associated with that because you're going to have to balance the needs of seniors who have depended on it and those who are opting out.\Johnson: First of all, we need to be sure that the surplus materializes in the next decade. I don't favor a $1.3 or $1.6 trillion tax cut, which would spend today resources we're relying on to come in tomorrow. We need to be absolutely sure that Social Security and Medicare are safe and well-funded, not only for this generation but the next one. We can accomplish this in part by saving the Social Security surplus, but we can also do that by being sure we're working on the Medicare system with a portion of the non-Social Security surplus. That includes having a real prescription-drug benefit for seniors under Medicare; it includes putting more money into federal programs for education. There's also a high priority to use funds to pay down the national debt. That is the kind of tax cut that will benefit people the most, not having the burden of debt for this generation or the next.\Lugar: Despite the estimate and the authority of CBO, I have doubts that there will be $2.2 trillion of surplus. Leaving that aside, I would think that the first priority always is national defense, and I want to make certain that we are prepared in the world to meet whatever we need to do. Beyond that, I would be strongly in favor of health care reforms because Medicare is in much greater difficulty in terms of its reserves than is the Social Security system. Both systems, Medicare and Social Security, must be secured for all Americans so that there is confidence they will be there. In addition to that, I have advocated a prescription drug plan, which is an additional expense on top of a Medicare program that is not yet secure itself. Tax cuts are also important.\Energy supplies\Q: Considering rising gas prices, concerns about power outages and projections of a 30 percent to 50 percent rise in natural gas costs this coming winter, should Congress be taking action to ensure reliable and affordable energy supplies?\Hager: In my view, the federal government has interfered with energy policy in ways that actually exacerbate the problem. Over the last 25 years, I have been heavily involved in studying energy, alternate energy, effects on the environment, economic factors and so forth. The extent the federal government has discouraged the development of nuclear power is the extent to which we have increased our dependency on foreign oil. In general, I think the federal government should be less involved in trying to control the energy market.\Johnson: We need to continue to do everything we can to explore alternative fuel and gas supplies, but at this point I think we need to be sure we have adequate reserves to meet our needs this winter.\Lugar: Congress and the administration will have to tackle the energy problems seriously in the next administration. Efforts to produce a supply of energy during recent years have been minimal. And we are now about to pay the price for that negligence. Oil prices, natural gas prices will rise, and at this point, there are no stoppers because supplies are very short, and the demand in a full-employment economy is greater. Within our country, I have advocated that 15 percent of our needs could come from bio fuels. Specifically, I've talked about agricultural residues, some research fixes that I think are doable in the next two years, and I think that's important to proceed on. But that's two years down the trail and only 15 percent of the problem. So we are going to have to be very thoughtful at this point about the possibilities of fuel cells in all sorts of forms and then, finally, some very effective international diplomacy. It would be unacceptable for the OPEC countries to hijack us, and we have authority and we have leverage to prevent that.\Missle Defense\Q: Do you support deployment of a missile defense system?\Hager: I remain completely unconvinced that a ballistic missile defense is feasible with current technology. I would favor continuing some research funding in the area of national missile defense but would not be in favor of deploying any technology that currently exists, because it can't work. It would be a huge waste of money.\Johnson: I do not support deployment of a missile defense system that is currently under debate, and I don't believe most people do. There's no evidence that the defense system the president recently decided to delay deploying works, and there's lots of evidence that it threatens our relations with the Chinese, the Russians, Indians, Pakistanis and others who are in the process of developing nuclear weapons.\Lugar: I do favor a missile defense system. But I have been careful to say that we really have to think through the technology. As a part of the missile defense theme, we have a huge diplomatic job to do because our NATO allies will want to be protected and not left outside. In due course, a skillful American president might even convince the Russians they want to be protected. Ultimately, we will have to develop the very best anti-missile system that we can. That is clearly our destiny, but to rush into a system presently would defeat both the diplomacy as well as the technical skill.\Global warming\Q. How big of a problem is global warming? If Al Gore is elected president and submits the Kyoto treaty to the Senate for ratification, which way would you vote?\Hager: I've been acquainted with human-caused CO2 buildup for almost 25 years. Is it increasing as a result of human activity? The answer is yes, there's no question of that. Will it cause the Earth to warm up? Almost certainly. Is warming all negative? I'm not sure we have answers to that. I would certainly not endorse the Kyoto treaty at this point, although I am open to the idea of something like a carbon tax somewhere down the road, maybe something of an international trade in carbon. But it would be premature to do that. I find it really ironic that Al Gore would be so much in favor of this when Gore and the Democratic Party -- I used to be a Democrat, I might point out, a very unhappy one -- have for at least 25 years been opposed to nuclear power.\Johnson: I think global warming is a significant issue. I would want to study that treaty before I tell you which way I would vote on it. In our bilateral relations with other countries, we need to be very clear that they are pursuing the kind of environmental policies that will reduce global warming and fossil fuel emissions.\Lugar: If the vice president, maybe president-elect, were to simply send it over cold, I would vote no. I would guess the vote would be 95-4, in large part because none of the basic work has been done by this administration in regard to the Kyoto treaty. I accept the fact that global warming may be a problem. I've read the treatises of people who claim that, if you take a look at centuries of data, this is not necessarily so. But I think that the increase in economic activity in the world, the greater number of people trying to engage in a higher standard of living, tends to create that. Furthermore, energy steps we take in this country will be good for our economy: To the extent that energy is less of an input, that we use less energy, we will be more prosperous as well as have a better environment.\Kyoto treaty's impact\Q: Assuming the United States does try to comply with the Kyoto treaty, do you believe this country can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent to 40 percent in the next decade without disruption of our economy?\Hager: No. As the treaty currently exists, it's flawed. We would be sacrificing economic development for no obvious benefit.\Johnson: It's theoretically possible. It will take everybody working together. I want to be sure as a senator from this state that the burden is borne equally by all states. We need to be careful that the East Coast states don't shift their burdens of compliance here to the Midwest, which has happened too often in the past.\Lugar: Probably not. My guess is that we would not simply bumble on in the same way with regard to the use of energy. One of the good things about a market economy such as we have is that people are constantly trying to figure out how to spend less money on energy. How to utilize less of it. It's a subtraction before you get to the bottom line. So to the extent these technologies are more available, the economy will do a lot better.\Affirmative action\Q: Should the federal government continue to give preferences in hiring and contracts on the basis of race and gender? Which affirmative action initiatives do you support and which do you oppose?\Hager: The short answer is no. Affirmative action is unconstitutional. The function of the 14th Amendment was to block state and local discrimination, and that should be the proper focus.\Johnson: Affirmative action programs have been a great success, certainly for my generation. We've seen a great difference in the equal opportunity of people coming into the workplace, having the right to compete. I think we've done a better job in recent years of being sure affirmative action programs are fair and applied equally to all. I would continue to recommend the kinds of programs that do not have fixed goals or set-asides, but where we encourage businesses, employers and others to be sure we're providing a level playing field and giving everybody a right to compete.\Lugar: I think that we ought to continue to give support to minorities and to women with regard to entry into small business and other sorts of contracts that have been typical in federal government policies. In terms of my own witness on this, the Hoosier Excellence Program of scholarships that I've set up is designed to make sure that minority students -- African-American, Hispanic and Native-American -- have better opportunities to attend college in Indiana. Each year at the banquet I point out that this is, in fact, a form of affirmative action. This is not to demean anyone else's potential, but it is to say that disproportionately fewer Hispanic and African-American students are in our colleges now, and we would like to stimulate greater participation because that would be better for our whole society, and it would be better still if those students stay in Indiana.\Hate Crimes law\Q: Would you support a federal hate-crimes law that would obligate federal authorities to pursue charges in violent crimes motivated by race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation?\Hager: It's unconstitutional. The powers of the states generally include all issues relating to criminal justice. If you look in the Constitution, there are really only three federal crimes: counterfeiting, murder or piracy on the high seas and high treason.\Johnson: Yes, I would. Those are challenging statutes to enforce, and we've wrestled with those same issues here in Indiana. I think it is the right policy of government to do everything possible to pursue that.\Lugar: I've supported through a vote we had in the Senate this year efforts by the federal government to pursue the perpetrators of hate crimes. I understand the argument that such proof is more difficult to come by; criteria may be less precise than a straightforward homicide case or assault case. But I think there is enough out there to justify a more intense federal activity in this area, and so I'm prepared to support that.\Social Security\Q: The Social Security Trust Fund is expected to be paying out more than it takes in payroll taxes by 2015 when baby boomers are retiring en masse. What would you do to fix Social Security? Would you support George W. Bush's proposal to allow individuals to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts?\Hager: If Bush's plan were the only one on the table, I might support it. My goal is to phase out Social Security and allow people to control their own money. What a radical idea. We don't even have to get into the fact that Social Security is not constitutional. Let's just talk rationality. If you just look at the numbers, it's a very, very bad deal.\Johnson: I would fix Social Security by being sure that the trust fund is solvent for longer than 2015. We can do that in large measure by paying down the national debt, not only by keeping the so-called lockbox with the $2.2 trillion, but increasing our debt service payments out of the non-Social Security surplus so that we have a real shot at being debt-free by the end of this decade. I do not support Gov. Bush's proposal on the privatization of Social Security because it will end up shortchanging the program. It will take a percentage of revenues out today that are needed to earn interest to keep the program solvent.\Lugar: Well, the most recent figures that I've seen of when the Social Security Trust Fund runs down to zero is 2030, and others are even suggesting 2050 on the basis of extraordinary growth in the economy; money is pouring in. Furthermore, we still are trying to weigh this entire proposition of how long people are going to work. But in answer to your question, it appears to me that we will finally have to weigh what sort of revenue stream is likely, what sort of assumptions you make in terms of economic growth or payout or longevity of people, and what the retirement age should be. This is clearly a case where a bipartisan group is once again going to have to get some type of agreement; first of all, that we have a problem, and secondly, that we want to have a solution; and at this point there isn't any such consensus at all. I do think that a portion of the Social Security taxes paid by younger Americans ought to be self-directed, which means that President -- er, Governor -- Bush's proposal is one that I think is a good one. I think it goes without saying, but I will say it: Everybody who is now 65 and older should be held absolutely harmless; there should not be a debate as to whether those checks are going to change. They should not, and we may even want to say that should be 55 and over.\Medicare\Q: Both major political parties say they want to provide senior citizens on Medicare with a prescription drug benefit. How would you go about this?\Hager: Once again, the entitlement programs need to be phased out. We have to come up with a workable way of doing it to minimize the pain. It's better to take a little pain now than a lot of pain later, which is what's happening to a lot of European countries that went through the demographic transition earlier. Their entitlement programs are costing them a much larger proportion of their overall GDP (gross domestic product); it's a demographic trap you get caught in.\Johnson: We need to have a prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors so they don't have to make the painful choice between buying prescription drugs and paying the rent or buying food. We need to have a program that doesn't necessarily benefit the Bill Gateses of the world but does benefit the people who are having to make the tough and real choices between drugs and food. We can do that under Medicare. We can do it with a co-payment and stop-loss program that means our seniors won't be out of pocket more than, say, $1,000, and that there is a first-dollar coverage so that they're not out-of-pocket all at once.\Lugar: Specifically in the debate the other night I spelled out over the course of several minutes a plan offered by Sen. Chuck Hagel, which I've tried to work with him on, which says that every citizen over 65 would have the ability, for a $35 annual fee, to buy into what amounts to a discount drug club or organization. The discounts are estimated at least as large as those of other groups of people who now buy drugs in large numbers. For instance, the federal employee benefit plan has 10 million members and routinely has discounts of 25 to 35 percent. Also, you would not pay any more than $1,200 in your own money if you had an income that was 200 percent of poverty level or below, any more than $2,500 if you were 400 percent of poverty level or below, and $5,000 for the rest. I believe this is a superior plan to the one being offered by Vice President Gore. I think the Gore plan is more likely to lead to small businesses opting out of health coverage, therefore leading to another problem that we are not discussing as often, but that we should be: that 10 million more Americans now have no health coverage than did at the beginning of the Clinton era.\Relations with China\Q: What should be the U.S. policy toward China in the 21st century? Do you support permanent normal trade relations with China?\Hager: Yes. China is going to be probably the world's largest market, so it doesn't make sense to me to deny access to that market. There is a nagging problem that is going to have to be addressed, and that's the one-China or the two-China policy. One of the challenges over the next 10 or 15 years is extricating ourselves from the situation where we are responsible for defending Taiwan. We're going to have to move to a situation where the Taiwanese are responsible for their own defense.\Johnson: The goal of having freer trade with China is laudable, and I think the potential benefit of that trade is huge, but I don't think the case was made in Indiana as to what the benefit is going to be here for us in the immediate future.\Lugar: Our relationship with China will probably determine whether our children in the next generation have an extensive war on their hands. A similar thing could be said about Russia. There are a long list of foreign policy problems, but if we don't get those two right, we will have grave consequences because both have the potential to be aggressive powers and the potential to reach us with devastating harm. I faced the permanent normal trade relation vote from the standpoint of American security and foreign policy; this is one chapter in a number in which we have to make a decision as to whether we are going to be heavily involved with China, and I think we will need to be.\Immigration\Q: Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, has called for easing restrictions between this country and the United States so more Mexicans can seek jobs here. Here in Indiana, the Hispanic population is growing rapidly. Is it time to reconsider our immigration policies, especially with respect to Mexico?\Hager: Sure. Libertarians in general, and I in particular, are in favor of basically eliminating immigration restrictions. In application they tend to be racist, and frankly, I don't see them as being beneficial. I would be very receptive to working with the Mexicans to make the U.S.-Mexican border more like the U.S.-Canadian border.\Johnson: It's always time to reconsider those policies, but I think we need to continue to enforce the laws as they are. President Fox is a real breath of fresh air. I think he's going to work well and cooperatively with the U.S. to pursue jointly the benefits of trade, and I think we may start seeing more of a return on those trade relations here in Indiana and elsewhere. But I would not yet favor easing those restrictions to do that.\Lugar: I believe that the next president of the United States ought to forge a strong relationship with Vicente Fox on immigration and on trade, and on a whole gamut of things, but those two are certainly immediate concerns that will lead to greater freedom of access of both people and goods and services across our borders. Now, the immediate consideration is: How do you get some degree of legality, some degree of control of the border? Vicente Fox is too facile in simply saying it ought to be open borders within 10 years. We have to have control of our border.\Bill priorities\Q: If you could sponsor just one bill in the next Congress, what would it be?\Hager: Privatize Social Security. I think that probably would benefit the average working person in the United States more than anything else.\Johnson: It would be to provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors under Medicare and to take a portion of the surplus to provide that benefit. It's not a Cadillac plan, but they would have adequate coverage to avoid making painful choices between prescription drugs and buying food and paying rent.\Lugar: I have so many irons in the fire now that need to get across the finish line, but let me just mention two, because these are works in progress that I hope that I may have some success with. The first is an amendment that would give incentives for people to make contributions to food banks and food pantries in this state. At this point, individual farmers, ranchers, restaurateurs do not receive a tax deduction for those contributions. A more complex one involves (convincing the government to use the technology of) RealMed Corp. in Hamilton County, which has the software so that when you go into the doctor's office or the dentist's office, right then an adjudication is made of what you're going to pay and what health insurance will cover. Using this system, $8 billion of waste in Medicare would be eliminated.\Coming soon\On Oct. 22, The Indianapolis Star will profile the gubernatorial hopefuls; Focus will feature the candidates in a question-and-answer session by the editorial board."

The red and metal-laden sludge that poured out of a Hungarian containment pond last week could be made less hazardous through a mitigation technique invented by an Indiana University researcher.
\
Geologist Chen Zhu said this week a carbon sequestration process for which he has a patent pending could potentially reduce the toxicity of the nearly 200 million gallons of sludge that has flowed through Hungarian waterways and into the Danube River, the second largest river in Europe.
\
To date, nine people have died, more than 150 people have been injured and the environmental impact of the disaster still is unknown.
\
The red sludge, or mud, is a byproduct of the conversion of bauxite to alumina, which is used in aluminum production. It has a high pH, rated 11 to 13, and can quickly damage and kill living cells.
\
Zhu said, ""We think we could bring it down to pH 8 or 9, which is very important, because it reduces it from what is considered hazardous waste to what is less toxic, industrial waste.""
\
Zhu's technique would involve mixing the bauxite residue with another industrial waste, oil-field brine, and then injecting carbon dioxide into the mix. The CO2 is readily available because aluminum plants use large amounts of energy and are always near power plants, which produce CO2 in the electrical energy generation process.
\
""The water-based brine provides the medium for carbon dioxide to dissolve. Once dissolved, the carbon dioxide can chemically react with water to form carbonic acid,"" explains an IU news release. ""The carbonic acid counteracts some of the red mud's alkalinity, and what's left - the negatively charged carbonate - can serve as a partner for positively charged metal ions, such as iron, calcium and magnesium.""
\
While the technique has never been attempted at the scale of the Hungarian spill, Zhu is confident that lab tests and other modeling show it would work. ""It depends on the economics and how much it would cost to do this,"" he said.
\
Zhu said it would be an expensive process, but said it has to be measured against the considerable damage to human lives and the environment.
\
European officials say there are other, similar sludge reservoirs in Eastern and Central Europe that pose an ongoing environmental threat.
\
U.S. aluminum producers do not create the same kind of toxic byproduct churned out by the more primitive operations in Eastern and Central Europe and do not store liquid waste.
\
""Essentially, they (U.S. manufacturers) dump waste in low-lying areas and use water to evaporate it and wind up with dry lead mud,"" Zhu said. ""It makes the area barren.""
\
The waste also threatens the water table where it is located and is recognized as a serious environmental concern, he said.
\
The IU researcher's technique to mitigate Hungary's current problem is just that, he said - a way to lessen the severity of the disaster. While it makes use of excess CO2 - a greenhouse gas - it shouldn't be seen as a significant method to bring down atmospheric CO2 levels.
\
Zhu is one of the world's leading authorities on carbon sequestration - a technique that Duke Energy initially proposed to use in the Edwardsport power plant under construction in Indiana. Duke later backed off the concept of using carbon sequestration - shooting the CO2 deep into the Earth - because the geology of the area will not support it.
\
Zhu recently landed a $400,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to continue his study of carbon sequestration in the North Sea. Since 1996, the Netherlands' state oil company has been successfully sequestering CO2 as a way of cutting carbon emissions and reducing the carbon tax imposed by that country. ""They inject 100 million tons of CO2 a year, and so far it's been very successful,"" Zhu said.
\
""Part of the reason is that the geological conditions are ideal. There is a very porous sandstone one kilometer down, and there is a layer of shale on top of that.""
\
The IU researcher said carbon sequestration is seen as a bridging technology and not a solution to global warming dynamics. But in the North Sea, he said, it is projected that significant amounts of CO2 can be successfully sequestered for hundreds if not thousands of years.

63,"Imagine opening your electric bill to find your rates have risen by 79 percent, or pulling up to the fuel pump to find the cost of gasoline has doubled.\Would you complain to your elected officials?\If so, you might want to contact Sens. Evan Bayh and Richard Lugar immediately.\A debate is currently underway in the U.S. Senate on a proposal that will have a devastating impact on Indiana's economy. In a perhaps well intended, but poorly conceived, effort to reduce greenhouse gasses, Congress is poised to cap carbon emissions by fossil fuel users, particularly power plants.\If approved, utility companies emitting more CO2 than permitted would be forced to raise electric rates to buy or trade for allowances on the open market.\For Indiana, which relies on coal-fired plants to produce 96 percent of its electricity, the impact of so-called cap and trade legislation will be felt in lost jobs, reduced global competitiveness and skyrocketing costs to consumers and businesses.\While there might be a growing consensus about global warming, its causes remain the subject of spirited debate and the environmental impact of a unilateral move by the United States is questionable.\Many proponents point to carbon taxes imposed in Europe as a model for the U.S. The European experience has been incomplete at best.\The United Kingdom is facing energy shortages; Germany, which has some of the highest energy costs in Europe, is eyeing more nuclear power; and France's carbon tax has limited impact, because 80 percent of its power generation is already nuclear.\What has been conclusively proven is that the current Senate proposal will hit Hoosiers squarely in the wallet and will do so disproportionately harder than in most other states.\Independent assessments by the Heritage Center for Data Analysis evaluated the negative impacts of cap and trade on congressional districts. Among the 435 congressional districts nationwide, they identified eight of the 20 hardest hit are in Indiana.\The 4th Congressional District, which includes Lafayette, is projected to be the 14th hardest hit, and the 2nd Congressional District, which includes Delphi, is the second most negatively impacted district in America. It should come as no surprise that U.S. Reps. Steve Buyer and Joe Donnelley cast a bi-partisan ""no"" vote against cap and trade when it was considered by the U.S. House.\Now is the time to call upon both of our U.S. senators to do the same.\Diverse sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Heritage Institute have predicted that electric rates could increase from 44 to 129 percent; gas prices could raise from 61 cents to $2.53 per gallon, and 1.8 to 7 million jobs could be lost.\The Wall Street Journal called cap and trade the biggest tax in American history. This is a proposal that will not work for Indiana or the nation.\While the negative economic impact is certain, the environmental benefits are unproven. The fastest growing producers of CO2 emissions in the world, China and India, have announced they will not enact similar restrictions.\China uses more coal than the U.S., the European Union and Japan combined. India is close behind and is projected to overtake China in population by 2030.\A unilateral cap and trade effort by the U.S. would adversely raise energy and manufacturing costs in the U.S. while providing an edge to our global competition and a negligible reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.\Does this mean we should do nothing? No.\Opportunities exist to diversify our national energy portfolio, increase our energy security, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and encourage renewable and domestic energy sources.\Last session I authored SB 420 l which would have created a modest renewable energy standard in Indiana, broadened our use of alternative and renewable energy and maintained low electric rates.\The bill passed the Senate overwhelmingly, but died in the House.\Nonetheless, Indiana is leading the way in energy production with Duke's coal gasification plant under construction in Knox County, ongoing efforts to attract a multi-billion dollar synthetic natural gas plant to Spencer County and the passage of legislation supporting the growth of ethanol and biodiesel industries in the state.\Throughout Central Indiana, wind turbines and wind farms are being built, making Indiana the fastest growing wind energy state in the nation. Emerging battery research is occurring and managing our state's energy use through smartgrid technology has proven to reduce demand while being inexpensive.\All of these efforts will help our economy and our environment, and each has occurred without cap and trade.\State Sen. Brandt Hershman represents District 7, which includes parts of Tippecanoe, Carroll, White, Clinton, Jasper and Howard counties. He is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Tax and Fiscal Policy and is former chairman of the Committee on Utilities and Regulatory Affairs."
64,"Pro-life supporters should help others\Recently, this page has contained letters from two individuals who never have anything new to say about their pet subject -- ""pro-life,"" and yet feel compelled to expound on the ""evils"" of those who actually think beyond the life of the ""unborn child.""\One writer was so bold as to question the benefits of the stimulus plan -- I guess putting people to work wasn't ""pro-life"" enough.\Here's my challenge to them -- and to all others who feel they are ""pro-life."" Do something to help those humans who are actually here on Earth, and then write to tell about that.\Send a large check to the mother who has eight newborns and six others at home -- her address is in California, and she sure could use that money. Open a day-care center that is free to all families. All families -- no exceptions. Write letters extolling the virtues of Head Start to Congress -- tell them to fund that program to the fullest. Hold fundraisers for those local agencies that help handicapped individuals.\Be advocates of the proposed juvenile center. Those kids are most in need of help. Better yet, ask how you can help raise money. Volunteer for the Mental Health Association, Meals on Wheels or the Community Health Center. Open the doors of your church for an elder day-care center.\In other words, walk the talk -- work for those outside the womb too.\Gale Kvam\West Lafayette\Wheel tax is unfair for local drivers\As I stated during my 2002 campaign for county council, the wheel tax looks like a good idea on the surface but when you consider that Tippecanoe County has a large amount of workers from other counties it is not a true user fee.\So in my modest opinion, it is an unfair tax upon the county drivers. Maybe a better idea would be fees for builders and developers of commercial/residential spaces, and maybe they might think about using some of the empty buildings that we have all over our county, decreasing our eyesores of failed businesses or businesses that move to ""greener pastures.""\I request that our county officials start looking out for all of the citizens, not just a select few.\David Fulks\Lafayette\Stop playing video games and exercise\In response to ""New video games for kids provide workouts in disguise,"" I feel we are giving too much credit to these games. I own a Nintendo Wii and believe these games can be beneficial with moderate use.\Whatever happened to kids using their imaginations and playing outside? Those days seem to diminish with the use of video games and computers.\Sixteen percent of the people between the ages of 6 and 19 are overweight, so there is a definite problem. Maybe parents should encourage their children to be more active by being more active themselves.\As a parent of twins and a student, I understand how difficult it can be to ensure an active lifestyle for our children while juggling such a busy schedule. But it is our responsibility to do so, not video games.\The new technology can serve a good purpose but are we going overboard with it?\Mallory MarcAurele\Lafayette\School provides education and faith\I'm writing in response to the Feb. 25 article ""Private school gets new name.""\It's good for more parents to find out about the new Tippecanoe Christian School. I didn't know where the Christian school was until two years ago, and I have lived in the Lafayette area for 13 years. It's also a good school for kids since it's a Christian school.\Like Shelby Swanson-Cox (mother of two students) said, ""They get a quality education in small class sizes and what is taught is Christian-based.""\I'm Christian, so I think more kids should attend a Christian school to understand the Bible.\Ulises Gutierrez\West Lafayette\State should adopt a one-year budget\There is no reason for the state budget to be a two-year spending plan.\With the way the economy is, no one knows what the situation will be like in six months, let alone an entire year.\Some people think that if we did the one-year budget, it would lead to a full-time legislature and cause more spending or tax hikes. I do not believe this argument. I think the people who say that a one-year budget would lead to more taxes and a full-time legislature are afraid of the little extra work that is involved with going with the one-year plan.\A one-year budget can be reevaluated at the end of the year and decide how well we, as a state, are doing and where to go from there.\John D. Mishler\Lafayette\Say 'no' to cap and trade carbon policy\The Democrats in Congress think they are on a roll after passing the recent stimulus bill. But we can't let the urgent economic needs of this country create a snowball effect of bad legislation.\One example of such a mistake is the push for a cap and trade carbon policy. This would create an artificial market open to manipulation and speculation, without the assurance of doing anything for the environment.\I don't know how legislators can even bring up such a scheme at a time when millions of Americans are out of work and businesses are struggling to survive. A cap and trade policy would add billions of dollars in energy costs, without reducing emissions. In addition, it would require the creation and funding of a government bureaucracy to try to regulate against speculators.\When there aren't real market forces to contain prices, regulation and oversight are the only options. But as we have seen with recent financial scandals and the speculative run-up in the price of oil last summer, regulation and oversight don't work. Investors lost their entire life savings in the case of financial scandal.\Instead, we need a simple, transparent carbon tax that will reduce our emissions, without the political ""gaming.""\We cannot afford the additional costs and resultant loss of jobs the cap and trade scheme would bring. Congress must stand firm against this bad idea.\Paul Hoffman\West Lafayette\More diverse group needed in story\I find it unfortuanate that the article published Wednesday, Feb. 25, in the J&C titled ""Locals hear positive notes in address"" couldn't find a wider representation of people to interview.\Perhaps people in different age groups might have had a little different opinion as they watch their life savings shrinking.\I hope the young lady who ""feels better about her future"" still fells good as she and her generation work to pay off the debt.\Eleanor Mlynarik\West Lafayette\Faith restored by a show of respect\Recently while traveling down the hill from West Lafayette on Sagamore Parkway, I witnessed a funeral procession coming from the opposite direction up the hill. As I watched in my rearview mirror, I saw something which restored my faith in people. Every car that came upon the procession, when realizing what the line of cars was, automatically dropped in line behind them. Not a single car passed them.\This brought back a memory of an incident that happended as the funeral procession was making its way to the cemetery for my dad several years ago. I'll never forget the feeling it gave me. A crew was repaving a highway outside of Veedersburg. As our procession approached, every worker shut off their machine, climbed down, removed their hard hats, and stood at attention as we passed. The respect shown to my family and father at that sad time is something I can't describe. The paving company should be very proud of the integrity and kindness of these employees. If any of them are reading this, may God bless you.\Gail L. Jackson\Lafayette"
65,"As the Nov. 3 presidential election approaches, Joe Biden and President Donald Trump couldn't be further apart when it comes to climate policy. These stories look at both candidates positions.\Democratic nominee Joe Biden has made climate change an integral component throughout his platform, even closely tying his plan for economic recovery from the pandemic to combating the climate crisis.\On the other hand, President Donald Trump has doubted the science of climate change and believes that its effects have been overstated, thus not warranting what he considers unnecessarily burdensome regulations on industry that he says could kill jobs and hurt the economy. As such, he has moved to deregulate many environmental protection rules.\On climate change, Biden creates a stark contrast with the president. But even more so, Biden also has set himself apart from past presidential nominees. He is the first to release such a comprehensive and aggressive plan on climate change.\He lays out a timeline to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 – which balances out the emissions and removal of greenhouse gases that warm the planet.\Before that, he wants the power sector to be free of carbon pollution by 2035 and for all new U.S.-made buses and new commercial buildings to be net-zero emissions by 2030.\He believes there is economic opportunity and potential growth in a transition to clean energy and a carbon-free society.\Biden also puts racial and environmental justice as a core tenet of his plan, advocating for disadvantaged communities to be at the center of determining solutions and benefiting from those decisions.\His plan comes with a $2 trillion price tag that would be spent over less than 10 years and that he says will be partially paid for by raising corporate taxes.\Some applaud Biden for bringing this topic into the political mainstream at the presidential level.\Others have been critical of Biden's plan – some saying that it doesn't go far enough and some, like President Trump, calling it a ""hard-left crusade"" that pushes too far. Jared Noblitt with the Indiana Conservative Energy Alliance called it government overreach, saying the mandates and higher taxes will be bad for businesses in the state.\Here's more on what Biden's plan could mean for Indiana:\Biden wants the country's electricity sector to be carbon free by 2035.\Indiana's electricity sector, however, is currently dominated by fossil fuels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\In 2018, Indiana ranked second among the states in coal consumption and 59% of its electricity in 2019 was fueled from coal. Renewable sources – including wind, solar, biomass and hydropower – accounted for only 7% of Indiana's energy generation in 2019, according to the EIA.\With that in mind, according to environmental advocates, 15 years is not much time. The technology exists and that is the trajectory, according to Janet McCabe, but she said it will take an ""all-hands-on-deck approach"" to speed up the time frame.\""We as a state don't have a policy or a public plan for moving into clean energy in the future,"" said McCabe, a former EPA air official who now runs the Environmental Resilience Institute at Indiana University. ""But as a state that depends so significantly on coal, we can certainly expect this plan to have an impact on Indiana.""\Several utilities have announced plans to move away from coal and retire their plants. NIPSCO, for example, announced two years ago that it would retire all of its coal facilities in the next decade and transition to renewable energy sources.\Other utilities, however, are not planning to turn their coal plants off until the late 2030s or early 2040s.\Noblitt, with the Indiana Conservative Energy Alliance, said that transition will happen in its own time due to market pressures. He approves of clean energy – which his organization says includes natural gas – because it's more affordable. But doing ""too much, too fast"" will actually cause rates to go up, Noblitt believes, which he said will hurt Indiana businesses that want cheaper energy.\Natural gas is not among Biden's preferred fuel options, but his plan did say he would continue nuclear and hydropower generation. He also would create Energy Efficiency and Clean Electricity standards for utilities.\Beyond furthering cleaner sources, Biden also wants to advance research in carbon capture storage and technology to keep carbon out of the atmosphere.\Biden's climate plan isn't just about cleaning up the environment, he's said, but is intrinsically tied to economic growth.\He calls for creating millions of jobs in the form of construction workers, scientists and engineers to build electricity-producing sources such as wind and solar – including both the expansion of existing technology and the development of new ones.\Those jobs would also come from adding union jobs around transporting goods and people – via roads, rail, ports and waterways and aviation – in ways that are faster, less expensive and more resilient to the effects of climate change.\In a state that is known as the ""crossroads of America"" with a large industrial and manufacturing base, that presents a lot of opportunity, according to Jeff Dukes with the Purdue Climate Change Research Center.\There is tremendous potential, he said, in the products that the U.S. and Indiana could design, manufacture and distribute around the world to make things more efficient or resilient, or technology to address climate change.\""But we are losing the opportunity to dominate the market and be leaders on this for decades to come,"" said Dukes, adding that the rest of the world is moving forward.\Some critics have pointed to the potential jobs to be lost in this transition, such as those in the extraction and production of fossil fuels. Indiana has about 2,500 coal mining jobs, according to the state. Indiana also had nearly 91,000 people working in clean energy in 2019, according to a recent report by Advanced Energy Economy, a national public policy advocacy group for the energy sector.\In his proposal, Biden said he would help those struggling coal communities transition into new jobs and sectors.\Biden's plan says the right things and has the right level of ambition, according to Kerwin Olson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition.\""But the devil is always in the details and implementing policy is always a whole other ball game,"" Olson said. ""I hope the plan is more interested in deployment instead of 'Let's take a look at this and talk about it for years,' because there is no time.""\Biden said that on day one, he will sign a series of executive orders with ""unprecedented reach"" to put ""us on the right track."" Those could include undoing some of the various rollbacks and deregulation that Trump has implemented during his time. He said he'll also ""demand"" Congress enact legislation in his first year to establish enforcement mechanisms with milestone targets, to make investments in research and innovation and to incentivize the rapid deployment of technology across the country and economy.\He plans to pay for his $2 trillion proposal by raising the corporate income tax rate, increasing taxes on wealthy Americans and using stimulus money. One thing that is absent from his plan, however, is a carbon tax, or a tax on greenhouse gas emissions and goods and services that produce significant emissions. Advocates say such a tax is an important tool to help decrease emissions at home and abroad, and also could help fund some of this plan.\One key component of that plan is environmental justice: He wants to ensure such investments, solutions and benefits realized do not leave disadvantaged and marginalized communities behind. Research has shown that low-income communities and communities of color often live with worse air and water quality, and are disproportionately at risk from the effects of climate change.\Biden said his investments will address those disparities and that he will create an Environmental and Climate Justice Division within the Justice Department.\Noblitt said he doesn't think Biden's plan will be well-received in Indiana.\""We are a very conservative state,"" he said, ""made up of people who don't want to see massive government overreach on these topics.""\Still, two recent statewide surveys showed that the majority of Hoosiers – as many as seven in 10 people – want to see the state and federal government do more to address climate change.\Early voting is available from Oct. 6 to Nov. 2, and Election Day is Nov. 3.

66,"WILL HIGGINS\YOU CAN TAKEJIM ROGERS anywhere. The PSI Energy chairman is\friendly, outgoing, quick to smile. He looks you in the eye and\seems genuinely interested.\Then there's John Hodowal, chairman of IPALCO Enterprises, the\holding company for entral Indiana's other big electric utility,\Indianapolis Power & Light. Hodowal often wears a gloomy look. He's\quiet. When he does have something to say he doesn't candy- coat it.\In some ways, the two $500,000-a-year super-yuppies are peas in\a pod. Both are smart, rich, white and strong-willed. Both come\from small Midwestern towns, are big wheels in Indianapolis, have\law degrees and are chief executives of two of Indiana's biggest\corporations. Rogers, 45, took over at PSI in 1988, the year before\Hodowal, 48, ascended at IPL.\As similar as they seem, though, their personal styles differ\dramatically, as do the companies they head. So unlike are Rogers\and Hodowal, in fact, that the idea of a PSI-IPALCO merger seems\absurd. That idea circulated around Indianapolis recently when PSI\announced it planned to merge with an Ohio utility and that the\merged entity's headquarters would be in Cincinnati.\Some local business leaders wondered why, if consolidation\indeed the future in the utility industry, as Rogers was saying,\PSI didn't get together with IPALCO. That way the key decisions\would be made in Indianapolis and not in some far off land such as\Cincinnati.\But nobody who knows Rogers and Hodowal asked whyor the two are\worlds apart in how they view their industry and how they live\their lives.\Says one acquaintance of both men, requesting anonymity:\""Rogers is smooth-talking and very PR conscious. Hodowal is more a\diamond in the rough. Rogers is diplomatic and articulate. Hodowal\is neither.""\Rogers immediately agreed to be interviewed for this story.\Hodowal took some coaxing.\Rogers often describes the utility industry as ""stodgy."" In\PSI's 1989 annual report, he points out proudly that ""The average\age of our executive group is now 46 _ almost 10 years less than it\was a year ago.""\Hodowal calls the ""stodgy"" nameplate ""ludicrous"" and claims the\industry has been evolving to meet today's needs ""since at least\1978 and maybe since the industry's beginnings.""\Rogers has pushed hard for deregulation in the utility\industry. ""PURPA made sense it worked,"" he says, referring to the\1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, the first move towards\deregulation.\Hodowal told a group of Indiana lawmakers last week that PURPA\has been a disaster, which has created ""real horror stories.""\Rogers is an outspoken advocate of a strategy to reduce energy\called Demand Side Management, Hodowal merely an advocate. DSM,\hatched during the oil embargo of the '70s, is fueled by heightened\environmental concerns.\Its proponents argue that by reducing energy utilities can postpone\or even cancel construction of power plants.\Last year IPALCO spent $2.3 million on DSM, compared to PSI's\$10 million. (Both companies curbed by about 19 megawatts.)\At the core of Rogers' pro-DSM stance is his view that power\plants are bad for the environment. Wait, says Hodowal, ""you can't\say a new power plant is automatically bad for the environment.""\Rogers is a health nut. He is a triathlete, a competitive one.\He rides his bicycle to Frankfort and back.\Hodowal, on the other hand, only recently quit smoking\cigarettes. Seemingly oblivious to the harmful effects of the sun's\rays, he keeps his skin a golden brown. He rides a Harley and plays\golf.\Hodowal has cut a narrower swath through town, though lately\he's been getting out more. He's on a smattering of non-profit\boards and recently campaigned vigorously for the chairmanship of\the Corporate Community Council, a powerful group of elite business\leaders. He got the job.\Says one fellow bigshot: ""John is not a friendly person, but\he's trying."" Still, Hodowal's chief lieutenant at IPL, Ramon\Humke, maintains a much higher profile in Indianapolis.\Rogers' sphere of influence extends far beyond the city. For\example, he's pals with former Reagan chief of staff Ken\Duberstein, and no sooner did he arrive in Indianapolis than he got\Duberstein on PSI's board.\Covering all the bases, Rogers also persuaded a bigwig\Democrat, his buddy Stuart Eizenstat, to serve as a director.\Eizenstat, a former top aide to former President Carter, is a key\adviser to President-elect Clinton.\Hodowal's board, by contrast, is made up entirely of members of\the Indianapolis establishment.\Hodowal lives in the stable, tasteful Meridian-Kessler\neighborhood, in the house built by deceased utility kingpin Tom\Moses, who during the '70s and early '80s headed the Indianapolis\Water Co.\Rogers and his family live in a big house in Carmel, in one of\those glitzy, new neighborhoods where you're expected to have a\powerful, built-in ""entertainment center"" and an enormous bathroom\complex off the master bedroom. Carmel is a tony though transient\community, with fast-track executives coming and going all the time.\Rogers will be going soon, assuming PSI's merger with CG&E goes\through. Under the deal's terms, Rogers would become chief\executive of the merged entity, CINergy, two years from now when\the current CEO, his old, old friend Jackson Randolph, is scheduled\to retire. Rogers would immediately begin looking for more\utilities to acquire. Who knows where it all will end?\Rogers has all these old friends not only because of his\engaging personality but also because he's been around. He started\out in utilities by working as an assistant attorney general in\Kentucky, representing consumers in utility rate cases. That's\where he first ran into Randolph. The two squared off against each\other when Randolph sought a rate hike for CG&E's Kentucky\operations.\Next Rogers moved to Washington to become a lawyer for the\Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and from there to a Washington\law firm that represents utilities before the commission.\Then Rogers went into big business, as executive vice president\of Enron Corp. He ran the company's natural gas pipeline\subsidiaries as president of Transwestern Pipline, Florida Gas\Transmission and Northern Natural Gas.\Rogers has never held a job longer than four years.\Hodowal, on the other hand, has spent his entire career at IPL.\He signed on as a junior engineer in 1968, after graduating from\Purdue University and completing a year of law school in\Bloomington. (He continued to take classes and three years later\earned his law degree.)\Hodowal was the classic company man, rising steadily through\the ranks for 10 years, when he decided to chuck it all and\practice law in Virginia. Zane Todd, then IPL's chairman,\intervened and offered Hodowal the treasurer's job if he stayed.\Hodowal took him up.\But it wasn't until the mid-'80s that Hodowal made his big\splash by engineering a deal that earned IPL millions and himself a\reputation as a wunderkind. In '84 he was given responsibility for\Mid America Capital Resources, a brand new subsidiary IPL formed as\a way for the company to diversify into unregulated, non-utility\industries. Hodowal quickly set about acquiring Indianapolis\Cablevision, a local cable TV provider. Two years later he sold it,\netting a $48 million profit for the IPL.\IPL had never done anything like that before. Executives there\rejoiced. Hodowal had arrived. He was given a $300,000 bonus; two\years later he became CEO.\Since Hodowal and Rogers have the same job but do it\differently, you would think one of them must be right and the\other wrong.\You would be mistaken, in the opinion of Ed Simcox. Both are\right, Simcox says. Granted, Simcox is a career politician and is\executive director of the Indiana Electric Association, an industry\lobby group that gets its funding from the state's electric\utilities.\Still, Simcox has a point. Since Hodowal became CEO of IPALCO,\the company hasn't sought a rate hike; its stock price has risen\more than 50 percent. PSI under Rogers has cut rates about 10\percent; its stock price has risen more than 30 percent.\""There are differences in the corporate cultures of the two\companies, and Jim Rogers and John Hodowal have something to do\with that,"" explains Simcox. ""But (the differences) also result\from history. The PSI culture is influenced by Marble Hill.""\Marble Hill is the name of the ill-fated nuclear power plant\PSI began building in 1977. The company spent $2.6 billion on the\project before abandoning it in 1984.\Rogers took the helm of PSI when it was in crisis. It had $600\million in outstanding lawsuits, among other nightmares. The times\required bold action.\Things were calm at IPALCO when Hodowal took over. It had\steered clear of nuclear power and hadn't asked regulators for a\rate hike since 1986 and its earnings were stable.\Says Simcox: ""PSI called for a different strategy than a Power\and Light that has averted big problems."""
67,"S.P. DINNEN\A coalition of Indiana environmental groups, convinced that PSI\Resources Inc. Chairman James E. Rogers Jr. is in their corner, came\out four- square Monday in support of the Plainfield utility's\efforts to merge with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co.\The Hoosier Environmental Council and at least seven other\environmental groups threw their support behind Rogers in PSI's\attempts to rebuff an unwanted takeover by IPALCO Enterprises Inc.\""PSI already has in place people who are committed to change.\They have a commitment to clean-air technology,"" said Adeline\Marshall of the Citizens Resource Council.\One of the nation's heaviest utility polluters, PSI needs to\spend hundreds of millions of dollars to remove sulfur dioxide and\other unwanted gases produced when coal is burned at its power\plants. Though IPALCO has considerably fewer problems in that\arena, the environmental groups based their ranking largely on an\energy-conservation program known as demand-side management.\Demand-side management seeks to avoid construction of new power\plants by creating programs that promote energy conservation. For\instance, PSI sponsors inspections of homes meant to detect energy\waste and suggests ways to lower consumption.\PSI implemented demand-side management in 1991 and has adopted\what it calls an environmental charter that pledges the company\will do its part for an improved environment.\Michael Mullet, general counsel to the citizens' watchdog group\Citizens Action Coalition - which didn't participate in Monday's\meeting - said IPALCO started its demand-side efforts after a 1992\chiding by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.\But Susan Hanafee, a spokeswoman for IPALCO, said her company\has had an environmental charter since 1971. She said IPALCO has\installed equipment that removes sulfur dioxide from smokestack\emissions on 40 percent of its power generators, compared to under\5 percent for PSI.\IPALCO has kept its conservation efforts low-key. But the\environmental groups applauded PSI for advertising heavily and\spreading the word about potential savings.\""The management philosophies of the two utilities at war here\stand in stark contrast when it comes to the environment,"" said\Jeff Stant, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council.\While Rogers has been accessible to environmentalists and even\conferred with many of them before joining PSI in 1988, Stant\complained that IPALCO Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John\Hodowal has refused two recent requests to meet with him.\State or local chapters of the Audobon Society, Sierra Club and\Izaak Walton League were among those who joined in support of PSI.\Among contributors to the Hoosier Environmental Council last\year was John A. Hillenbrand II, a Batesville businessman who is a\director of PSI."
68,"WILL HIGGINS\The Hoosier Environmental Council on Monday threw in with PSI\Energy, lauding PSI chairman James Rogers and vilifying IPALCO\Resources chairman John Hodowal.\""Management counts!"" said the council's executive director,\Jeff Stant, in a written statement. ""The management philosophies of\the two utilities at war here stand in stark contrast when it comes\to the environment.""\In March IPALCO launched a hostile takeover bid of Central\Indiana's other big electric utility, PSI. Three months earlier PSI\had agreed to merge with Cincinnati Gas & Electric.\The council, which was joined by representatives of seven other\Indiana environmental groups, said in a statement it was impressed\with Rogers' willingness to meet with them and miffed at Hodowal's\reluctance to do the same.\""Rogers has been accessible to environmental groups,"" the\statement said. ""If he moves to Cincinnati there is no reason to\think that he'll be less accessible. John Hodowal is much more\difficult to talk to, and has been unavailable to meet despite two\invitations made over the past six weeks to do so at a date, time\and place of his choosing,""\On a personal level, the ebullient Rogers is more approachable\than the more withdrawn Hodowal, acquaintances of both men say.\The environmentalists also lauded PSI's demand-side management\plan, a strategy that seeks to reduce energy usage among customers.\Proponents say by reducing the amount of energy people use\utilities can postpone or even cancel construction of power plants.\Last year PSI spent $10 million on demand-side management,\compared to IPALCO's $2.3 million. But both companies saved the\same amount of energy, about 19 megawatts.\PSI has been more vocal about its demand-side management plan\than IPALCO, touting its plan widely through paid advertising.\""PSI spends a lot more in advertising (its plan) than we do and\that seems to appeal more to the HEC people than doing the job,""\said IPALCO's Susan Hanafee. ""I don't quite understand that.""\Said the environmentalists: ""With the white washing that\Hoosiers receive from Rush Limbaugh and other public figures about\the nonexistence of global warming, much more of this public\education will be needed for Indiana and the Midwest to come to\grips with what the rest of the world is facing. If IPALCO is\concerned about the environment, it should make the same efforts to\tell the public about it."""
69,"There are many reasons Indiana's manufacturing and industrial sectors are vibrant. Abundant and cheap energy, especially electricity, is among the most important.\It is no surprise, then, that a couple of numbers in a ranking chart during last week's Indiana Energy Conference captured the attention of companies that buy power by the gigawatt. The commercial electricity rate in Indiana is tied for 24th in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a far cry from the fifth-lowest rate the state's commercial and industrial consumers paid just a few years ago.\Regulatory changes and environmental requirements have diminished the economic development benefit of inexpensive electricity in Indiana. Hoosier power plants burn coal to make electricity, and coal is squarely in the cross hairs of federal regulators who seek to reduce the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment.\At the same conference, an Environmental Protection Agency official described new emissions guidelines, added just two weeks ago, for states and utilities to consider as deadlines for proposals loom in the next month.\Perhaps the surest sign of frustration with federal regulatory proposals felt by most of the utility executives, big-time electricity users and state regulators: No one asked any questions of the acting assistant administrator of EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, but they sniped at the rules in every session afterward.\After lunch, a panel of state legislators active on the General Assembly's energy committees talked about how Indiana could balance energy costs with environmental concerns. Last session, the General Assembly ended an energy-efficiency program implemented as part of a demand-side management program adopted in 2009, so it's clear the economic development impact weighs heavily on lawmakers' minds.\So it was interesting that Sen. Jim Merritt, R-Indianapolis, again made a case for nuclear power. While nuclear reactors dot the Midwest, including 11 in Illinois and four in Michigan, there are none in Indiana, although American Electric Power's Cook facility on Lake Michigan sends about two-thirds of the electricity it generates to Hoosier customers.\Indiana tried to enter the nuclear age 40 years ago. Twice. One attempt along Lake Michigan never got off the drawing board. The other, outside Madison along the Ohio River, was more than $2.5 billion into construction when the state pulled the plug over safety concerns and cost overruns.\The specter of Marble Hill looms over any conversation of nuclear power generation in Indiana. More than 8,000 people worked on the massive site at the height of construction in the late 1970s, and the twin cooling towers rose over the rolling countryside. The largest construction project in Indiana's history was doomed, though, when a reactor core partially melted down at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear facility.\Allegations of construction defects soon surfaced, and the cost overruns ballooned for a project initially projected to cost $700 million. Gov. Robert Orr finally canceled the project in 1984, and generating electricity through nuclear means has not been seriously considered since.\Merritt promised to reintroduce a bill he authored last session that would add nuclear power facilities in Indiana to the list of clean energy generators that qualify for financial incentives. Last session, the bill did not move out of the Senate Utilities Committee Merritt chairs, and Merritt made no guarantees about its future this year.\There are a lot of reasons why nuclear energy is polarizing. Merritt and others argue that nuclear generating plants are reliable, are relatively inexpensive and do not emit harmful greenhouse gases. It's a primary way, the argument goes, to maintain inexpensive electricity rates in a state that takes cheap power for granted.\These points are countered by the specter of nuclear disasters at Three Mile Island; Chernobyl, Russia; and Fukushima, Japan. There is nothing inexpensive about the fact that people won't be able to live near Chernobyl or Fukushima for generations, or that the radiation released won't produce greenhouse gases yet present an immediate threat to life.\Merritt noted the recent election ended Sen. Harry Reid's tenure atop the Senate and his ability to block development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear storage facility in his native Nevada. Yucca Mountain's activation could nullify one of the primary concerns about nuclear power plants by moving spent yet radioactive fuel rods to a central location.\Will Indiana consider a nuclear alternative as a way to comply with new federal rules on greenhouse gas emissions? Maybe, but the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's lawsuit against the federal regulations is a clearer indication of the state's intentions. And Commissioner Tom Easterly vowed he would pursue the lawsuit to the end.\John Ketzenberger is president of the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization to research state budget and tax issues.

70,"Decisions to use energy efficiently are made by both individuals and society. Consumers who practice efficiency are rewarded with lower utility bills, while society reaps reduced emissions and other benefits. However, efficiency, like energy production, also has a cost.\Balancing costs and benefits of various efficiency and production options is a vital aspect of our work as we represent the interests of consumers in the development of legislative and regulatory policies. This is a responsibility of increasing importance as many factors, including higher wholesale commodity prices, service reliability and heightened concern for the environment combine to raise the attention consumers and policymakers give to energy issues.\Our office recommends decisions that offer the best opportunity for safe, reliable utility service at the lowest price possible while maintaining our state's economic and environmental health. We have supported demand-side management programs to promote efficiency and load management among consumers as well as the development of new electric generation. We encourage consumers to purchase ""green"" power and utilities to use clean coal technology and coal emissions controls.\We believe this approach will succeed, keeping in mind that finding the right balance is as much an art as a science.

71,"WILLIAM J. BOOHER\A $35 million program designed to get PSI Energy customers to\reduce power consumption carries a familiar funding feature:\The customer will pay.\Under a plan approved Wednesday by the Indiana Utility\Regulatory Commission, the utility's 590,000 electricity customers\will pay the cost of implementing the program.\Then, if the program _ called demand-side management _ succeeds\and power usage declines, customers will pay to offset the utility\for those lost revenues. Customers also will pay to compensate the\utility for lost returns on investments in generating facilities it\would no longer have to build.\Under the commission's order, PSI Energy can use future\rate-increase cases over a period of time to recover program costs\and losses in revenues and investment returns. The utility's next\rate- increase case is expected in 1993.\The order resulted from an agreement PSI Energy reached with\the office of the utility consumer counselor, the Citizens Action\Coalition and various groups of industrial customers.\Pam Chapman, manager for PSI Energy public information, said\the utility will implement the voluntary program Jan. 1.\The program aims to impove efficiency from existing facilities,\avoid costly future construction of generating facilities and\encourage environmental benefits, Chapman said.\With higher electricity rates virtually assured, PSI Energy's\message to customers is clear: If you conserve enough power, you\can help offset the higher rates.\""If they keep at their current energy use level, they will have\higher monthly bills than otherwise"" after rate increases go into\effect, Chapman said.\Chapman said reduced consumption will reduce the need for\costly new generating facilities, saving on construction and\operating costs. A reduction in power use also will mean fewer\emissions from power plants, which will benefit the environment,\she said.\Chapman said the utility will promote the program through\commercial advertising and inserts in monthly bills to customers.\The utility serves 69 counties in north-central, central and\southern Indiana.\Elements of the program include using utility contractors to\install water-heater insulation jackets, thermostat setbacks,\low-flow shower heads, and caulking and weatherstripping at willing\customers' residences.\Customers will be charged a fee for the service and materials\""far below"" what they normally would cost, Chapman said.\The utility also plans to offer for sale expensive,\energy-saving, compact fluorescent light bulbs at significant\discounts, she said.\The utility plans to provide commercial and industrial\customers with information on energy-savings strategies,\anticipated cost and savings from those strategies and\recommendations for implementing them, she said."

To say\they don't save any energy would not be much of an exaggeration.""\What changed the minds of Hill and other energy experts were\studies in the late 1980s of nine urban and rural weatherization\programs for low-income housing in Minnesota. Researchers conducted\a special test, called a blower door test, to find air leaks and to\estimate the energy savings by filling the gaps, according to the\January/February issue of Home Energy magazine.\About 200 homes were weatherized in the summer of 1988 using\the enhanced methods of looking for and filling air leaks in attics\and basements as well as in the living area. The audit, work and\inspection averaged about $1,300 per house.\Follow-up tests showed that average annual fuel bills of $688\were reduced an average $126 a year, meaning that payback would\take 10 years. That's a significant savings compared to the pennies\pocketed with previous caulking methods.\New areas to be plugged include holes in the attic floor from\the chimney, plumbing, electrical wiring, heating and air\conditioning service. Attic insulation should have an R-38 rating,\according to state recommendations.\Gaps in basements and crawl spaces include where wood hits\concrete block or slab or where electrical service comes through\the wall.\""You need to be careful not to put anything over light\fixtures"" or combustible material near the chimney or electrical\wiring, Hill said.\Tell-tale signs of air leaks include dark spots around the\exterior edges of carpeting and dirty areas in fiberglass\insulation in attics, he said.\It's important that consumers don't make their abodes too\tight, however.\A lack of circulation or improperly insulated areas may provide\the right environment for mold and mildew, the build-up or\concentration of chemical odors, or radon, an odorless, natural\occurring gas considered a carcinogen.

74,"The domino-effect power outages that instantaneously deprived 50 million consumers of electricity last month were not caused by too little generating capacity but by transmission system failures. Although Indiana was spared from the effects of the blackout, this catastrophe made clear the need for better energy policies and solutions.\Over the next few months, energy forensic analysts will assess why the outages occurred and cascaded out of control, who was responsible, and whether proper procedures were followed. Meanwhile, President Bush and congressional Republicans have seized upon public anxiety from the blackout to gain political advantage for energy legislation that would open Alaskan wilderness to more oil and gas drilling and provide billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies for new nuclear plants.\Democrats claim that the administration is fiddling with energy politics while the antiquated transmission system is burning out.\Amid the forensics and politics, it is critical that the public understand the blackout's causes and recognize that there are some substantive, constructive steps needed to improve electric service reliability and reduce risks, at a fraction of the $50 billion to $100 billion the energy industry says it will take to upgrade the grid.\In terms of causes, massive electricity-transmission networks such as the three separate grids that transmit power on the North American continent are inherently vulnerable to blackouts. Their scope and complexity make it extraordinarily difficult to keep them stable. A lack of attention to maintaining, repairing and upgrading the grids has exposed this vulnerability.\The precarious nature of grid stability has been further aggravated by electricity deregulation. Freed from government regulations that emphasize investment in the public interest over profitability, utilities nationwide cut energy efficiency programs by more than $1 billion between 1993 and 1998. This effectively has increased the amount of electricity flowing over the grid.\In Indiana, for example, Cinergy spent $40 million on energy efficiency in 1994 through programs known as demand-side management. Through DSM, utilities help power-hungry industries find ways to reduce their electric usage. But under pressure from a deregulated electric industry, in which incentives promote increasing revenues and cutting costs, Cinergy's commitment to efficiency had fallen to $2 million by decade's end. While the utility has increased energy efficiency and conservation through direct-load control on air conditioners, DSM funding remains a fraction of where it was a decade ago.\While addressing the issues of reliability and stability is indeed complex, reducing demand on the grid must be a significant part of the mix. This includes decentralizing the grid through increased efficiency and more distributed and diverse power generation, including co-generation, wind-power farms, solar photovoltaic panels and gas-fired micro-turbines. There also are untapped opportunities for new, clean, on-site generators that can be used by hospitals, schools, data-processing centers, research labs, and medium to large commercial and industrial buildings.\Not only would this approach enhance grid reliability, it would create jobs, stabilize the economy, improve the environment, and drive down business and residential utility bills.\Americans would be better off if Bush listened to his brother, instead of his friends in the energy industry, who not coincidentally stand to pocket as profits enormous chunks of the tens of billions of dollars needed to fix the problem their way. As Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently said, ""The cheapest, easiest and fastest kilowatt we can generate is the one we save through efficiencies. There is a consensus on conservation and efficiency, so let us start there.""\Smith is utility program director for the Citizens Action Coalition in Indianapolis."

76,"Decisions to use energy efficiently are made by both individuals and society. Consumers who practice efficiency are rewarded with lower utility bills, while society reaps reduced emissions and other benefits. However, efficiency, like energy production, also has a cost.\Balancing costs and benefits of various efficiency and production options is a vital aspect of our work as we represent the interests of consumers in the development of legislative and regulatory policies. This is a responsibility of increasing importance as many factors, including higher wholesale commodity prices, service reliability and heightened concern for the environment combine to raise the attention consumers and policymakers give to energy issues.\Our office recommends decisions that offer the best opportunity for safe, reliable utility service at the lowest price possible while maintaining our state's economic and environmental health. We have supported demand-side management programs to promote efficiency and load management among consumers as well as the development of new electric generation. We encourage consumers to purchase ""green"" power and utilities to use clean coal technology and coal emissions controls.\We believe this approach will succeed, keeping in mind that finding the right balance is as much an art as a science.

77,"WILLIAM J. BOOHER\A $35 million program designed to get PSI Energy customers to\reduce power consumption carries a familiar funding feature:\The customer will pay.\Under a plan approved Wednesday by the Indiana Utility\Regulatory Commission, the utility's 590,000 electricity customers\will pay the cost of implementing the program.\Then, if the program _ called demand-side management _ succeeds\and power usage declines, customers will pay to offset the utility\for those lost revenues. Customers also will pay to compensate the\utility for lost returns on investments in generating facilities it\would no longer have to build.\Under the commission's order, PSI Energy can use future\rate-increase cases over a period of time to recover program costs\and losses in revenues and investment returns. The utility's next\rate- increase case is expected in 1993.\The order resulted from an agreement PSI Energy reached with\the office of the utility consumer counselor, the Citizens Action\Coalition and various groups of industrial customers.\Pam Chapman, manager for PSI Energy public information, said\the utility will implement the voluntary program Jan. 1.\The program aims to impove efficiency from existing facilities,\avoid costly future construction of generating facilities and\encourage environmental benefits, Chapman said.\With higher electricity rates virtually assured, PSI Energy's\message to customers is clear: If you conserve enough power, you\can help offset the higher rates.\""If they keep at their current energy use level, they will have\higher monthly bills than otherwise"" after rate increases go into\effect, Chapman said.\Chapman said reduced consumption will reduce the need for\costly new generating facilities, saving on construction and\operating costs. A reduction in power use also will mean fewer\emissions from power plants, which will benefit the environment,\she said.\Chapman said the utility will promote the program through\commercial advertising and inserts in monthly bills to customers.\The utility serves 69 counties in north-central, central and\southern Indiana.\Elements of the program include using utility contractors to\install water-heater insulation jackets, thermostat setbacks,\low-flow shower heads, and caulking and weatherstripping at willing\customers' residences.\Customers will be charged a fee for the service and materials\""far below"" what they normally would cost, Chapman said.\The utility also plans to offer for sale expensive,\energy-saving, compact fluorescent light bulbs at significant\discounts, she said.\The utility plans to provide commercial and industrial\customers with information on energy-savings strategies,\anticipated cost and savings from those strategies and\recommendations for implementing them, she said."
78,"JO ELLEN MEYERS SHARP\In the battle to weatherize homes for winter, consumers arm\themselves with caulk guns to fill gaps around windows and doors.\Although caulking covers air leaks that make consumers feel\uncomfortable, recent tests show that doesn't save much energy.\Consumers will save energy dollars, however, if they aim their\caulk guns higher and lower to fill air leaks in attics, basements\and crawl spaces.\""For years, we've been told that caulking (windows and doors)\is the most cost-effective thing you can do and that the payback\would come in a matter of months,"" said Bill Hill, a professor of\urban planning and senior researcher with the Center for Energy\Research/Education/Service at Ball State University in Muncie.\""I used to say that with conviction, and I was wrong. To say\they don't save any energy would not be much of an exaggeration.""\What changed the minds of Hill and other energy experts were\studies in the late 1980s of nine urban and rural weatherization\programs for low-income housing in Minnesota. Researchers conducted\a special test, called a blower door test, to find air leaks and to\estimate the energy savings by filling the gaps, according to the\January/February issue of Home Energy magazine.\About 200 homes were weatherized in the summer of 1988 using\the enhanced methods of looking for and filling air leaks in attics\and basements as well as in the living area. The audit, work and\inspection averaged about $1,300 per house.\Follow-up tests showed that average annual fuel bills of $688\were reduced an average $126 a year, meaning that payback would\take 10 years. That's a significant savings compared to the pennies\pocketed with previous caulking methods.\New areas to be plugged include holes in the attic floor from\the chimney, plumbing, electrical wiring, heating and air\conditioning service. Attic insulation should have an R-38 rating,\according to state recommendations.\Gaps in basements and crawl spaces include where wood hits\concrete block or slab or where electrical service comes through\the wall.\""You need to be careful not to put anything over light\fixtures"" or combustible material near the chimney or electrical\wiring, Hill said.\Tell-tale signs of air leaks include dark spots around the\exterior edges of carpeting and dirty areas in fiberglass\insulation in attics, he said.\It's important that consumers don't make their abodes too\tight, however.\A lack of circulation or improperly insulated areas may provide\the right environment for mold and mildew, the build-up or\concentration of chemical odors, or radon, an odorless, natural\occurring gas considered a carcinogen. The new research has\changed the messages utilities are giving consumers about saving\energy dollars, too.\""It's cheaper to assist on the energy efficiency side than it\is on the supply side,"" said John Haselden, director of\Indianapolis Power & Light's energy reduction program, called\demand side management.\Sometimes, however, convincing consumers that a little grime\now will save dollars later can be difficult.\""It's easy to put off crawling under your house with sticky\stuff in a gun.

80,"The domino-effect power outages that instantaneously deprived 50 million consumers of electricity last month were not caused by too little generating capacity but by transmission system failures. Although Indiana was spared from the effects of the blackout, this catastrophe made clear the need for better energy policies and solutions.\Over the next few months, energy forensic analysts will assess why the outages occurred and cascaded out of control, who was responsible, and whether proper procedures were followed. Meanwhile, President Bush and congressional Republicans have seized upon public anxiety from the blackout to gain political advantage for energy legislation that would open Alaskan wilderness to more oil and gas drilling and provide billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies for new nuclear plants.\Democrats claim that the administration is fiddling with energy politics while the antiquated transmission system is burning out.\Amid the forensics and politics, it is critical that the public understand the blackout's causes and recognize that there are some substantive, constructive steps needed to improve electric service reliability and reduce risks, at a fraction of the $50 billion to $100 billion the energy industry says it will take to upgrade the grid.\In terms of causes, massive electricity-transmission networks such as the three separate grids that transmit power on the North American continent are inherently vulnerable to blackouts. Their scope and complexity make it extraordinarily difficult to keep them stable. A lack of attention to maintaining, repairing and upgrading the grids has exposed this vulnerability.\The precarious nature of grid stability has been further aggravated by electricity deregulation. Freed from government regulations that emphasize investment in the public interest over profitability, utilities nationwide cut energy efficiency programs by more than $1 billion between 1993 and 1998. This effectively has increased the amount of electricity flowing over the grid.\In Indiana, for example, Cinergy spent $40 million on energy efficiency in 1994 through programs known as demand-side management. Through DSM, utilities help power-hungry industries find ways to reduce their electric usage. But under pressure from a deregulated electric industry, in which incentives promote increasing revenues and cutting costs, Cinergy's commitment to efficiency had fallen to $2 million by decade's end. While the utility has increased energy efficiency and conservation through direct-load control on air conditioners, DSM funding remains a fraction of where it was a decade ago.\While addressing the issues of reliability and stability is indeed complex, reducing demand on the grid must be a significant part of the mix. This includes decentralizing the grid through increased efficiency and more distributed and diverse power generation, including co-generation, wind-power farms, solar photovoltaic panels and gas-fired micro-turbines. There also are untapped opportunities for new, clean, on-site generators that can be used by hospitals, schools, data-processing centers, research labs, and medium to large commercial and industrial buildings.\Not only would this approach enhance grid reliability, it would create jobs, stabilize the economy, improve the environment, and drive down business and residential utility bills.\Americans would be better off if Bush listened to his brother, instead of his friends in the energy industry, who not coincidentally stand to pocket as profits enormous chunks of the tens of billions of dollars needed to fix the problem their way. As Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently said, ""The cheapest, easiest and fastest kilowatt we can generate is the one we save through efficiencies. There is a consensus on conservation and efficiency, so let us start there.""\Smith is utility program director for the Citizens Action Coalition in Indianapolis."

""It's got a large piece of America's clean energy economy.""\The state employs more than 17,000 people in the clean energy economy, exceeding the national average.\""In fact, Indiana is one of seven states and the District of Columbia where total jobs fell but jobs in the clean energy economy increased between 1998 and 2007,"" Grange said in a teleconference. ""Trends point to explosive growth (throughout the country).""\Examples of the clean energy economy include solar and wind power, reduction of greenhouse gases, improvements to the electric grid, fluorescent lighting, smart electricity meters, software to reduce energy use, hybrid engines, green building materials, and recycling.\Ball State University's geothermal project will add clean energy jobs to East Central Indiana, as will the Brevini plant that will manufacture gearboxes for wind turbines, and the proposed wind farm or wind farms in Randolph/Jay/Wayne counties.\Pew does not include agricultural jobs that supply corn to ethanol refineries -- several of which have been built in East Central Indiana -- in the clean energy economy. It does include the actual refineries, because ""the commercialization of second-generation biofuels from the cellulose in plants and waste holds the potential to produce an energy source that does not divert substantial amounts of land from growing food or damage the environment.""\Indiana has made recent leaps forward in the wind power industry.

83,"The Issue\After eight years with a Texas oil man as president, environmentalists are looking forward to a greener White House. And soaring gasoline prices are at the forefront of voters' minds. On Tuesday, prices at many Indianapolis gasoline stations surged 18 cents, hitting $3.75 for a gallon of unleaded and pushing the city toward another record high. Whoever wins November's presidential election, environmentalists agree, is bound to address their concerns better than President Bush has. The League of Conservation Voters has called him ""arguably the most anti-environmental president in our nation's history"" for supporting efforts to weaken clean-air and water laws and to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\Indiana\49th Indiana's rank among the 50 states in Forbes.com's first ranking of America's Greenest States last fall, with ""1"" being the most environmentally friendly. Only West Virginia fared worse.\6th Size of Indiana's carbon footprint among the 50 states, with ""1"" being the highest.\25 of Indiana's 92 counties are out of compliance with tougher air-pollution standards set this year. The state had just met federal standards last year, then the EPA lowered the acceptable threshold for ozone from 84 parts per billion to 75 ppb. Central Indiana levels hover between 80 and 85 ppb.\One reason is coal. Indiana is among 12 states with the heaviest concentration of coal-fired power plants.\Coming Thursday:\Where the candidates stand on education. Find earlier ""Where they stand"" grids online at www.IndyStar.com/2008race.\___________________________\John McCain\Gas tax holiday\Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was the first to call for a gas tax holiday, proposing that the federal tax -- 18.4 cents a gallon on gas and 24.4 cents a gallon on diesel -- be suspended from Memorial Day through Labor Day to help ease the impact of soaring fuel prices.\Oil imports\McCain has said: ""As president, I'll propose a national energy strategy that will amount to a declaration of independence from the fear bred by our reliance on oil sheiks and our vulnerability to the troubled politics of the lands they rule.""\Pollution, climate change\McCain has worked on legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a market-based system and through the development of nuclear, solar and other alternative energy sources. Legislation he sponsored would reduce carbon emissions 65 percent by 2050. He has pledged to toughen automotive fuel standards and to join the Kyoto treaty, provided that India and China also participate. However, he says that U.S. energy policy must not impose ""unsustainable costs on the economy."" McCain supports federal funding and preservation of national parks.\McCain has voted against renewable energy standards that supporters say could reduce pollution and U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\Hillary Rodham Clinton\Gas tax holiday\Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., followed McCain in calling for a holiday on collecting the federal gas tax. She has called for a windfall tax on oil companies to pay for it.\Oil imports\Clinton calls for cutting foreign oil imports by two-thirds from 2030 projected levels, or more than 10 million barrels per day.\Pollution, climate change\She has proposed a $150 billion, 10-year energy package for new fuel sources and backs caps on greenhouse gas emissions.\To address global warming and dependence on foreign oil, Clinton proposes a ""strategic energy fund,"" created with oil company profits, to invest in developing and deploying alternative energy sources. She stipulates that by 2025, 25 percent of electricity should be produced by renewable energy sources.\She also advocates raising fleetwide fuel-economy standards from the current level of 25 miles per gallon to 40 mpg in 2020 and 55 mpg in 2030.\As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Clinton has pushed for tougher clean-air, water and toxic-waste laws.\She also is calling for a new program to make it easier for low- and middle-income Americans to buy green homes and invest in green home improvements.\Barack Obama\Gas tax holiday\Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., has dismissed his rivals' calls for a national gas tax holiday as a political ploy ""to get them through an election"" that won't help struggling consumers. As a state senator, Obama voted at least three times in favor of temporarily lifting the state's 5 percent sales tax on gasoline.\Oil imports\Obama calls for cutting oil consumption by at least 35 percent, or 10 million barrels per day, by 2030 to offset imports from OPEC nations.\Pollution, climate change\Obama, whose older daughter, Malia, suffers from asthma attacks made worse by air pollution, is viewed as a passionate environmental advocate. He has called for a $150 billion, 10-year program for ""climate-friendly"" energy supplies and favors emission caps. Some specifics:\An 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050.\Make all new buildings carbon neutral, or produce zero emissions, by 2030.\Double fuel-economy standards within 18 years and provide retooling tax credits and loan guarantees for domestic auto plants and parts manufacturers so they can build new fuel-efficient cars.\Consider standards that ban new traditional coal facilities.\Sources: Gannett News Service; Star research; the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life; candidate Web sites"
84,"Last spring, as gas prices approached $4 a gallon, we stubborn Americans began to alter our driving behavior.\In the Indianapolis area, more people were suddenly carpooling, biking to work and, imagine this, even taking the city bus. Many people began to consolidate their weekend chores into fewer trips and to cut down on unnecessary drives.\For millions, pricey gasoline did what years of warnings from Al Gore and other environmentalists had not: It persuaded them to think about the gas they were burning each time they pulled out of the driveway.\For a brief period, hybrid vehicles were all the rage. Gas consumption was down sharply. Dedicated conservationists populated every neighborhood block. Concerned politicians took the matter seriously. These were positive side effects to the painful pounding gas prices were inflicting on American wallets.\Gas prices are now down, as they have been for months. At a Marathon in Carmel on Tuesday, a sign advertised a gallon of regular unleaded at the bargain price of $1.72. Unfortunately, the price drop has led to another drop: America's addiction to foreign oil is no longer a hot-button issue.\It's yesterday's news.\But it's also tomorrow's news. Eventually, something will happen that forces our dependence on imported oil, and oil in general, back onto the front pages. Some development -- and it will not be a good one -- will bring the issue roaring back. At that point, nervous politicians will react, and a suddenly engaged public will ask why they didn't react sooner.\This brings us to Sen. Richard Lugar, who unlike many politicians is not a hostage to the next election. As usual, Lugar is setting himself apart by thinking about tomorrow's issues today. In this case, the Indiana Republican is pushing a proposal to increase the federal gas tax by $1 or more to reduce the number of miles Americans drive and the demand for imported oil.\Now before you panic, let me explain the other half of this proposal: Every dollar raised by the gas tax would be sent back to Americans through a cut in the payroll tax, higher Social Security checks or some other measure. Lugar insists this is a crucial selling point.\It's a smart plan. After all, there is no denying statistics that show higher gas prices lead to less driving and a reduced demand for oil imports. And, as Lugar recently wrote, ""Nearly every major foreign policy challenge we face is aggravated by our continued addiction to oil.""\As we talked by phone Monday, Indiana's senior senator acknowledged the controversial nature of the idea. Already, his office has fielded calls from angry voters. Most calmed down after being told the plan includes a tax decrease equal to the increase. Still, it's certain to be a tough sell on Capitol Hill.\""If you added a dollar when gas was $4 a gallon, people would say, 'my goodness, this is over the top,' "" Lugar said. ""At $1.71, or $2.71, it's still not very appealing.""\But, he added, current gas prices provide an opening, and a new administration in Washington could provide opportunity for bold ideas. Moreover, this is not about money. At its core, the plan Lugar supports is about the environment, incentives for Detroit to invest in fuel-efficient vehicles, and national security.\""In 2008, our country spent over $430 billion (on imported oil),"" Lugar said. ""Unhappily, a very large amount of the money goes to . . . countries that on other occasions we find to be difficult if not dangerous.""\Here's the bottom line: Gas is a bargain today. But ultimately, we'll pay heavily if we don't address our dependence on oil.

87,"Polaroid camera inventor Edwin Land said, ""People who seem to have had a new idea have often just stopped having an old idea."" In Indiana, we need to stop having old ideas of sacrificing the environment in order to benefit the economy. As Indiana policy makers debate ways to stimulate the economy and make up the state's budget deficit, new ideas about investing in Indiana's environment are desperately needed.\Our environment is a green infrastructure of air, water, land, plants and animals that acts as our life-support system. This provides ecosystem services worth as much as $33 trillion annually, more than the entire global gross national product. Many of these services we could not duplicate for any cost.\Protecting this green infrastructure is best done by investing in pollution prevention and new energy technologies, using land and resources more efficiently, enforcing pollution laws and conserving parklands, wildlife habitats and other green space.\Investing in pollution prevention saves money for businesses and eliminates toxic releases to air, water and land. Since 1994, the Indiana Clean Manufacturing Technology Institute has helped businesses eliminate about 5,000 tons of pollution while saving them more than $10 million. The recycling and material reuse industry in our state employs 75,000 people and generates annual revenues of $19 billion.\Investing in cleaning up waterways and protecting groundwater will safeguard citizens from illness and disease, reduce drinking water treatment costs, and stimulate water-based recreation and tourism.\Investing in park land and wildlife habitats boosts tourism and outdoor recreation opportunities that provide jobs and enhance quality of life. Tourism and recreation in Indiana is a $6 billion-a-year industry. Corporate officials say that quality of life is the third most important factor in locating a business.\We can also invest in the environment by focusing economic development efforts where they are both the most cost effective and beneficial to public health and the environment. For example, there are unlimited opportunities in new energy technologies and efficiency measures. Investments in energy-efficient factories, office buildings, homes and automobiles will create jobs, save money and natural resources, and reduce harmful air pollution.\A new study finds that implementing the Repowering the Midwest renewable energy and energy-efficiency plan in Indiana will lead to 22,000 new jobs and $1.8 billion in additional economic output by 2020.\Investing in inter-city high-speed rail and urban mass transit would save land and energy, reduce traffic congestion and give Hoosiers real transportation choices. It also would create a new market for Indiana's steel industry.\By contrast, how well are the old ideas serving Indiana? Indiana is at or near the top of most state-by-state pollution rankings. We're rated 48th out of 50 states in overall environmental quality according to a study by the Institute for Southern Studies. We're 44th in per-capita spending on the environment. We spend the least of all Midwestern states on protecting our drinking water.\The study ranks Indiana's economic performance 40th of the 50 states. Current budget proposals will just make things worse. Indiana's environmental protection efforts will suffer as both the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and Indiana Department of Natural Resources face spending cuts of 13 percent or more.\The Indiana Clean Manufacturing and Technology Institute will be fortunate to retain its meager budget of about $500,000 a year. The Indiana Heritage Trust land protection program that has generated nearly $23 million in matching funds from other sources is expecting no state budget appropriation.\Indiana continues planning a new-terrain Interstate 69, needlessly wasting a half-billion dollars over the cost of the I-70/U.S. 41 alternative. At the same time, mayors across the state are demanding another gas tax increase to pay for fixing roads we already have.\It's time for new ideas for Hoosier families, our environment and economy.\Maloney is executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council in Indianapolis."
88,"At the current level of consumption, world oil reserves are expected to run dry by the middle of the century; some experts believe it will happen much sooner.\Yet, we continue to behave as if the oil supply were endless. We keep building our homes farther and farther from our jobs, as if ignorant of the fact that expanding suburbia is wasteful of resources and destructive to the environment.\We persist in our consumer preference for trucks and sport-utility vehicles although widespread use of these gas-guzzlers only accelerates the timetable under which we ultimately must make the transition from an oil-based economy.\A logical person might assume this recent surge in oil prices would convince Americans to become more conservation-minded. Think again.\It seems a majority of Americans expected the government to provide price relief. Measures advocated by various politicians included applying political pressure on OPEC to increase oil production, eliminating the gas tax, tapping into the Strategic National Reserve and opening more wilderness areas to drilling.\Even without the decline in oil reserves, there would be compelling reasons to invest in cleaner technologies. The environmental costs of petroleum are staggering. Annual U.S. health expenditures attributable to vehicle pollutants are estimated to be in the $20-50 billion range. And our excessive driving doesn't merely affect ourselves but has global consequence.\One-fourth of all greenhouse gases derive from vehicle emissions. It may become even more difficult to feed the 6 billion people on Earth if global warming renders our best farmland less productive, as some experts predict.\Given these environmental and resource-scarcity imperatives, automakers should be developing alternative fuels and fuel-efficient technologies. Instead, they're developing plans for expansion of their new truck and SUV models. Industry analysts predict 20 new SUVs will be introduced in the next five years.\Yet we can only place so much blame on automakers. It is our collective passion for SUVs that drives their actions. If we as consumers demand green cars, the market will respond. Better yet, if we as voters demand access to other transportation modes such as light rail, government leaders can be spurred to action. A sustainable transportation system would be a nice gift to pass on to our children's generation.\The legacy we're in danger of leaving, however, is one of greed, short-sightedness, wasted resources and a fouled environment. Is it acceptable for the richest 5 percent of the world's population to squander a quarter of the world's annual oil output, and thereby saturate the atmosphere with greenhouse gases? The fact that few people in this country see this as a problem bespeaks a cultural arrogance that may prove to be our downfall.\Henderson resides in Indianapolis."
89,"WASHINGTON -- Completing the Indianapolis-Evansville section of I-69. Adding lanes to I-65 and I-70. Building an outer-loop freeway around Indianapolis.\Those are some of the transportation projects a blue ribbon panel of experts identified last year as critical for the state.\But the money set aside to advance such projects isn't enough, the Indiana Department of Transportation's chief financial officer told the panel.\While the group did not back a specific way to raise the funds -- leaving that decision up to lawmakers after INDOT completes a study of options this fall -- it did back the idea that money should come from user fees.\""We invest in those things that we value, and most of us don't hesitate to pay $100 a month for a good cellphone plan or $100-plus a month for our cable and Internet at home,"" said Lt. Gov. Sue Ellspermann, who co-chaired the study.\But while economists like the efficiency of user fees, Indiana University researchers found the public doesn't support the concept that -- at least for roads -- people should pay in proportion to the benefit they receive from the service.\Only about one-third of those surveyed nationwide by IU backed the idea that road users should pay more for roads than nonusers. That's reflected in the actions Congress has taken in recent years as it has tapped general fund revenues to supplement the gas tax, said Denvil Duncan, an IU economics professor who co-authored the study.\""I think most people would agree that the short-term solution (to transportation funding) is simply to increase the fuel tax rate, but that is going nowhere, at least not at the federal level,"" Duncan said. ""They are staying away from this thing with a long stick.""\The federal Highway Trust Fund provides almost 40 percent of Indiana's transportation spending. Proposals for replenishing the fund without raising the gas tax include changing the way the U.S. taxes multinational firms, selling part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, reducing dividends paid by the Federal Reserve to member banks, using private debt collectors to seek overdue taxes and revoking passports for delinquent taxpayers.\At the state level, however, about a quarter of states have raised or reformed their gas taxes since 2013, according to the Pew Fiscal Federalism Initiative.\Mileage-based tax\The user-fee funding option most often discussed as a supplement to, or replacement for, the gas tax is a mileage tax.\An independent commission established by Congress in 2005 to solve the gas-tax issue called a tax on miles traveled the ""consensus choice of the future.""\In July, Oregon launched a voluntary program for 5,000 drivers to switch from the state's 30 cent-per-gallon tax to a mileage tax. (Drivers can choose to have their mileage tracked by GPS or their odometer.)\At Oregon's tax rate of 1.5 cents a mile, a trip from Indianapolis to Lafayette would cost almost $1.\A Senate Finance Committee working group said this summer that a nationwide, voluntary mileage tax should be considered.\A mileage tax addresses the fact that federal rules require vehicles to be 67 percent more fuel-efficient by 2025 and that alternative-fuel vehicles are projected to make up nearly half of new car sales by 2035.\Another advantage of a mileage tax: it correlates more with road usage costs, especially if the rate takes into account a vehicle's weight and whether drivers are traveling at peak times and on the most congested roads.\The disadvantages include privacy concerns and the fact that the revenues have more administrative costs. While collecting the gas tax consumes less than 1 percent of what it brings in, Germany's experience shows administering a tax on miles traveled could eat up 13 percent of revenues collected.\Another user-fee alternative to raising the gas tax is increased tolling, either by itself or in conjunction with public-private partnerships.\Former Gov. Mitch Daniels, who leased Indiana's toll road and used other arrangements with private entities to help pay for transportation projects, has encouraged Congress to expand tolling options.\""Public-private partnerships are not a complete answer for all our challenges, but Congress will not find a complete answer without them,"" Daniels told the Senate Finance Committee this summer.\The Senate's transportation bill would make it easier for states to charge tolls on existing interstates.\INDOT told the state budget agency last year that it planned to explore the feasibility of public-private partnerships that use tolls for the top priority projects identified by the blue ribbon panel.\But the National Association of Truck Stop Operators argues that tolls divert highway traffic off interstates and onto secondary roads, which can create unsafe conditions. The group also notes that none of the states -- Virginia, North Carolina and Missouri -- that got permission through a federal pilot program to consider new tolls have been able to impose them because of public opposition.\Even when imposed, tolling revenues don't always meet projections. That's a primary reason some analysts remain wary of public-private partnerships that rely on tolls, according to Federal Funds Information for States, a nonpartisan research group.\The private operator of the Indiana Toll Road went bankrupt last year after failing to collect enough revenues to meet debt and other obligations. (An Australian investment group bought the bankrupt operator this year.)\An alternative funding approach backed by Gov. Mike Pence's administration would let states opt out of the federal gas tax. While Indiana would have to come up with a substitute for the federal resources, Pence's Office of State-Based Initiatives argues Indiana would gain more control over funding.\Transportation groups, however, worry that states won't raise the replacement revenues, creating an even bigger funding gap.\Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx compares this ""devolution"" to ""whack-a-mole.""\""What that really means is a state tax increase, or a local tax increase, or both,"" Foxx told The Indianapolis Star. ""You move one piece of the equation out of the picture and you're going to increase pressure on another part of the system.""\National focus\The change could also erode the focus on a national transportation program. For example, while Indiana is trying to complete its segment of the I-69 route, Tennessee officials have said they don't want to spend scarce state resources on their portion of the interstate.\Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee who takes credit for helping launch the devolution idea 25 years ago, now says it wouldn't work.\Former Indiana Rep. David McIntosh, who heads the conservative Club for Growth, which has advocated shifting control to states, said the proposals aren't going anywhere.\""We recognize that,"" McIntosh said.\The recent closure of a section of I-65 due to an unstable bridge could help develop public support for state policy makers to pursue their own solutions, said Laurie Maudlin, a Build Indiana Council member who has lobbied for transportation funding on behalf of INDOT and the private sector.\""I think it does help in demonstrating why good roads are so important, why mobility is so important,"" she said. ""Having the interstate shut down is kind of the unthinkable.""\Email Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com. Follow her on Twitter: @mgroppe."
90,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate easily rejected Tuesday an effort by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., to boost highway funding for Indiana and some other states while lowering it for others.\The Senate voted 70-28 to reject Coats' amendment to a highway funding bill, which would have meant an additional $284 million for Indiana roads. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., voted for the amendment.\Coats said the highway bill the Senate is considering is unfair to Indiana, which has historically received less in federal funding than residents have paid in federal gas taxes.\""A majority of states, like Indiana and many, many others, do not receive a fair share of the distribution of highway funds,"" Coats said.\California Sen. Barbara Boxer, the Democrat who chairs the committee that wrote the bill, said Coats' amendment would kill it. Boxer said the bill's distribution of funds is ""very, very fair"" and continues the tradition of awarding funds based on factors such as the amount of use a state's roads get and maintenance costs.\Boxer said the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee didn't want to shake up the funding formula and ""jolt the states in the middle of a tough economic time.""\A Senate vote on the bill is set for today.\The committee has not released comparisons of each state's share of the $109 billion, two-year bill.\The Federal Highway Administration estimates funding for Indiana would drop from $989 million last year to $921 million this year and $936 million next year.\Indiana's funding also would drop under a five-year bill approved by a House committee that is being reworked because it lacks support to pass the full House.\Congress last approved a multiyear transportation bill in 2005. Lawmakers have been temporarily extending the old bill, which expired in 2009, because they haven't figured out how to fund a new one. The most recent extension expires at the end of this month.\Roads, bridges and mass transit projects had been mostly paid for through user fees, particularly the 18.4-cents-per- gallon federal gas tax, which hasn't increased since 1993. But revenues haven't kept up with demand, in part because vehicles have become more fuel-efficient, so less tax revenue is generated.\Coats wanted to make the share of the gas tax that Indiana gets back more closely match the share it contributes.\Indiana's relative share of federal highway funding is lower than almost every other state's, according to the Government Accountability Office.\Indiana and Arizona each received 91.3 percent of the share each contributed in federal highway-related taxes from 2005 to 2009, according to a 2011 GAO report.\That was the lowest rate among the 28 states whose share of funding was less than their share of taxes. The rest of the states got a larger share of funding than the shares they contributed in taxes.\The GAO, the watchdog arm of Congress, recommended that Congress better define highway program goals and the federal role. Specifically, states and local governments could assume more responsibility in areas where the federal interest is less evident, the GAO said.\Performance and accountability also need to play a bigger role in highway funding decisions, the GAO said. That could mean moving toward a competitive funding program, rather than one focused on rates of return."
91,"STAFF WRITER\About 50 people, mostly connected to politicians or political parties, attended Indiana General Assembly candidate debates Tuesday evening at Indiana University East.\Young professionals moderated and questions submitted from the public were included in the discussion, which was organized by the Richmond-Wayne Chamber of Commerce.\The general election is Nov. 7.\State Senate Dist. 27\Education: Incumbent Republican Sen. Allen Paul said he would not vote for legislation for full-day kindergarten or textbook costs that do not provide funding to school corporations.\Democratic candidate Clayton Phillips said he supports better education as a way to compete in a globalized world.\Gas prices: Neither Phillips nor Paul supports temporarily lifting the gas tax while gas prices are high.\""We have to look at all kinds of ways of becoming energy independent,"" Phillips said.\Property taxes: Paul said he favors repealing a recently passed law that states that property taxes cannot exceed 2 percent of the assessed value of the property. That means businesses would be hit with the extra taxes.\Phillips said he would work to eliminate property taxes, though he doesn't know what they would be replaced with.\Health benefits: Phillips said one of the reasons he is running is because of disillusionment with government. He does not like that state senators and their families receive health insurance benefits for life while other Hoosiers do not receive the same.\Paul then picked up a copy of his W-2 and stated that he made roughly $21,865 last year.\""I'm not ashamed of it,"" Paul said.\State Rep. Dist. 54\Confined feeding operations: Democratic candidate David Sadler supports studying the effects of confined feeding operations on the community and environment.\Libertarian candidate Rex Bell said he thinks the issue can be addressed with local zoning.\Republican incumbent Tom Saunders said he has asked the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to send in more inspectors for the operations, and he intends to follow up with legislation.\Gas tax: Sadler supports a temporary removal of the gas tax when gas prices are high, while Bell and Saunders said they would not because it wouldn't solve anything. Saunders said if the state doesn't want the money from the gas tax, maybe it should be moved to local road accounts.\State Rep. Dist. 55\Hoosier homegrown energy: Republican candidate Tom Knollman, a Union County farmer, said ethanol and soy diesel production must be a priority in Indiana. Democratic candidate Dale Lanning agreed.\Property tax: Lanning supports eventually getting rid of property taxes because not everyone contributes to them.\""We need to replace property tax burden,"" Knollman said, although he admitted he does not know what to replace it with.\Education: Lanning said he supports Gov. Mitch Daniels' education plan, and Knollman said he'd like to see the state redirect more money from administration costs to classroom costs.\""Every child in district 55 is my responsibility,"" Knollman said.\Lanning said he favors all-day kindergarten but doesn't know how to fund it and he'd rely on constituents to help him out.\""I'll vote the way the majority of the people in this community want me to vote,"" Lanning said.\State Rep. Dist. 56\Health care: Republican challenger Jaye Gibbs suggested encouraging health savings accounts and high deductible insurance policies he said would be more affordable.\Democratic incumbent Phil Pflum said 840,000 Hoosiers don't have health insurance and he supports a national health care policy. He also suggested the state look into allowing small businesses to buy into state insurance plans.\Confined feeding operations: Pflum, who lives on a farm, wants a moratorium on confined feeding operations until their effects on communities and the environment can be studied. If they're built, he wants them to be put in the most rural areas.\Gibbs disagreed.\""If agriculture can't be conducted on agricultural land, then where is it going to be conducted?"" Gibbs said. ""I don't think Indiana should regulate it out of hand because it's unpleasant.""\Keeping young people: Gibbs said that to attract young people, the state needs to have more of a can-do and welcoming attitude.\Pflum said a few years ago the state created technology parks all over Indiana to spur development and attract jobs. He said Indiana was ahead of the game passing biodiesel ethanol legislation in 2003.\Smoking ban: Both support it, citing health reasons.\Reporter Rebecca Helmes: (765) 973-4478 or rhelmes@pal-item.com\NEXT UP\*What: Debates between candidates for Wayne County Commissioner Dist. 1, Wayne County Council Dist. 2 and 4, and Wayne County Assessor\*When: 6 p.m. Thursday\*Where: Vivian Auditorium at Indiana University East, 2325 Chester Boulevard\*The event is free and open to the public.

92,"By many accounts, Indiana's two most vexing legislative matters in this session involve the financing of highways and pre-K education. While there are many important questions about both issues, the real problem is Indiana's shrinking tax base. This challenge will only worsen with time, so it is useful to understand what the trouble is, and how it may be remedied.\The financing of Indiana roads is primarily done through a gasoline tax. This is an excise tax, levied on each gallon sold. Vastly better fuel efficiency combined with alternative fueled vehicles means that revenues from this tax no longer cover the costs of infrastructure improvements and maintenance. Worse still, even a doubling of the gas tax may leave the state cash-strapped in a decade if alternative fueled vehicles become price competitive. This is a real problem that we have not clearly prepared taxpayers to face, but it is small relative to the grand problem of sales taxes.\Expanding pre-K education is important in a state that continues to suffer embarrassingly low educational attainment. While I think believe the smartest option is a limited expansion to perhaps one-third of households, the argument for universal pre-K is not without merits. Still no matter what scale of pre-K is chosen, we face a very tenuous tax environment. Indeed, it is fair to say our state tax revenues are built upon the quicksand of the sales tax base.\Indiana sales tax includes only some goods and not any services. This is a curious choice for a state that prides itself on making things. But worse than the intellectual vacuity of this approach is the fact that that Hoosier households are spending a declining share of their earnings on goods. Today, each additional dollar in household income results in roughly a 30-cent increase in spending on goods. This trend, which dates back to the Great Depression, means that we are ever raising sales tax rates to capture enough revenues run government.\If you search for an amusing visual metaphor for the Indiana legislature facing the declining sales tax and gas tax bases, imagine a dog chasing a constantly shrinking tail. Even when you catch it, it won't be enough.\It is astonishing that despite a growing economy, the state has a tax system that cannot meet its future needs due to entirely predictable problems. So what to do?\For transportation, we must tax congestion. That can be achieved through tolls and mileage taxes. A gas tax can even be part of the mix, but cannot do it alone. The challenge here is the inconvenience of tolls along with the technical and privacy worries of a mileage tax. But this is nothing compared to the sales tax problem.\By taxing the ever shrinking consumption of goods, Indiana faces a long-term budget crisis. As services comprise an increasing share of income, our reluctance to tax such things as medical treatment, legal advice, amusements and accounting services dooms us to an endless budget worries. It also leaves us a tax system that overburdens the poor and middle class, and distorts our consumption choices.\There may be legitimate concerns about taxing consumer services, but I haven't heard them yet. The Legislative Services Agency has estimated that we could raise the same tax revenues with a sales tax of 3.1 percent instead of the 7 cents we now pay, this would seem to be an easy choice for the legislature. So, why hasn't the legislature acted?\Well, the fact is that extending a sales tax to services, while cutting the rate on goods, would make almost all Hoosiers better off, and those whom it would hurt comprise a particularly powerful voice in the state. Lawyers, accountants and other high earning professionals will face taxes they have thus far dodged. I expect that is why the issue will have a hard time getting a solid hearing at the statehouse.\Michael Hicks is is the George and Frances Ball Distinguished Professor of Economics and the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University.\Michael Hicks"
93,"cslyder@journalandcourier.com\According to gasbuddy.com, gas prices in Indiana were averaging $1.91 per gallon in mid January 2007. On Friday the average was $3.64 a gallon.\With motorists in Indiana and the entire country fuming each time they pump gasoline, the two Democratic presidential candidates are stepping up.\Both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama say they have multi-faceted plans to bring prices down or help Americans save money in other ways to cope with high gas prices.\After reading both candidates' platforms, Sarah Khan felt Obama's would directly benefit Americans, especially those in the Lafayette area.\""Cutting taxes for the middle class would help people buy gas,"" she said of the Illinois Senator's plan.\Since prices have risen, Khan began walking more and carpooling. As a result, she agrees with raising fuel efficiency standards -- one idea the candidates share.\According to Jason Grumet, Obama's principal adviser on energy and the environment, ""Senator Obama's plan has a near and long-term approach."" There's no quick fix to the issue of high energy prices, he warned.\Jonathan Swain, the communications director for Hoosiers for Hillary, agreed. ""The president can move this country in the right direction when it comes to energy independence,"" he said.\But according to some experts, high gasoline prices are not something presidents can fix by themselves.\""(High gasoline prices) have been a long time in the making,"" said Jerry Lynch, a Purdue University professor of economics. ""There are a lot of forces at work here.""\Demand for oil has been rapidly increasing in China and India, Lynch said. Increasing demand drives worldwide prices up.\Worldwide political instability and resulting nervousness by oil investors are other factors, Lynch said.\The decreasing value of the dollar is another issue, Lynch said. Since oil is bought and sold in dollars around the world, a devalued dollar makes oil an attractive investment to people in other countries.\Dave Kenny, the president of Lafayette-based Super Test Oil Co., which operates five gas stations in Lafayette and other cities, believes the dollar plays a role, too.\""Each time the government lowers the interest rate, that raises oil prices because the dollar is lower,"" Kenny said.\Many of those oil-based issues could be solved, James Feure said, if automakers would begin large-scale manufacturing of alternatives to fossil fuel powered vehicles.\""The industry needs a kick in the complacency,"" the West Lafayette resident said. ""Solar-assisted electric cars is what they should begin to make.""\Kenny thinks the president and Congress should either ban the ""on-paper"" trading of crude oil or force traders to take possession of oil they buy. That, he said, would eliminate a lot of speculative buying and selling by investors who never see one drop of oil they buy or sell.\Maggie McShane disagrees with Kenny about banning ""on-paper"" trading. She's executive director of the Indiana Petroleum Council, an agency representing companies with oil-refining interests in Indiana.\""There shouldn't be government controls,"" McShane said, adding that oil is not the only commodity on the rise. ""The prices of all commodities are soaring right now.""\McShane argued that singling out oil trading for controls is unfair. ""Copper is soaring. Why not control it, too,"" she said, noting some people have resorted to stealing copper from construction sites to resell for its high value.\While Feure wants alternative energy, he agrees the gas industry should be left alone to let capitalism work.\""People are paying the high prices for gas,"" he said.

94,"Environmentalists called Pete Buttigieg's focus on sustainability in his $1 trillion infrastructure plan well-intentioned and forward-thinking – but some expressed concern about how he would pay for it.\The sustainable initiatives proposed in the candidate's 17-page plan, announced Friday, build on his previously released $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion climate change plan, which was released in September.\The former South Bend mayor's infrastructure plan hopes to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars toward environment-friendly approaches such as lead safety, flood protection and public transportation.\His plan isn't necessarily unique in subject or cost – competitor Joe Biden's proposed infrastructure plan is priced at $1.3 trillion, and Bernie Sanders' infrastructure goals also tackle environmental concerns such as contamination and clean water – but it does pay special attention to long-term sustainable practices.\Bob Pollin, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies investment needs in climate policy, said Buttigieg's plan had the right spirit but was somewhat unsteady concerning financing.\""It's going in the right direction. All of these things, a lot of it hinges on where you come up with the money,"" Pollin said. ""One of his competitors, (Elizabeth) Warren, certainly has a detailed financing plan. ... I think she does a much more serious job of going underneath the surface than he does.""\Here's what you need to know about the environmental implications of Buttigieg's infrastructure plan.\Buttigieg's hometown South Bend has a history of battling lead exposure, an issue he attempted to address throughout his time as mayor, a campaign spokesperson said. And, according to his infrastructure outline, he plans to continue addressing it as president.\The plan establishes a $100 billion Lead-Safe Communities Fund to clean up lead in paint, soil and water. This includes replacing 3 million lead service lines in the next decade and investing an unnamed amount in corrosion control.\Buttigieg's plan would also allocate $10 billion each to the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for utility infrastructure upgrades and to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to help communities address wastewater treatment.\It's a good start, said Tim Maloney, senior policy director for the Hoosier Environmental Council, but it might not be enough.\Maloney said Indiana alone likely needs billions of dollars to bring its drinking water and waste management infrastructure up to repair. The funds promised for national repairs, he said, should probably be bolstered.\""This should clearly be a priority and we're pleased to see that a number of candidates are talking about the problems with drinking infrastructure and the problems with lead,"" Maloney said. ""But the size and cost of the investment needed is dramatic.""\Maloney said the environmental council could not endorse Buttigieg or any other candidate or their plan, but he was glad to see such a focus on infrastructure and the environment.\Other aspects of ensuring clean water in Buttigieg's plan include:\Asking the EPA to research contamination from groundwater-contaminating chemicals such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl materials, or PFAS. The plan also directs the EPA to classify all sites with high levels of PFAS as Superfund sites.\Promising to lower water bills by creating a $16 billion Drinking Water Assistance Matching Fund. The plan says after a decade, this would cut the average water bill in half for 10 million families.\Alan Hamlet, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Notre Dame, has spent his career making the argument that infrastructure needs to be forward-thinking and include information from global climate models.\Future global climate models project increased precipitation and escalating extreme weather events such as flooding – both of which affect long-term infrastructure planning, Hamlet said.\Hamlet said the country has a lot of infrastructure that needs to be replaced, but oftentimes the design process doesn't take into account additional risks from a changing climate.\Buttigieg's plan, however, attempts to address these climate predictions by establishing a $50 billion flood protection fund under the Federal Emergency Management Administration.\This kind of additional attention will be essential in the future, Hamlet said, considering the projected increases in flood risk for the Midwest.\""Because the environment is changing very quickly, then we need to look ahead with these climate models to understand the future risks,"" Hamlet said. ""If we don't invest in gaining an understanding of how the environment is changing, our infrastructure will likely not perform property in the future.""\Regarding climate preparedness, Buttigieg also promised to:\Establish a $40 billion Sea Level Defense fund to help protect the country's coastlines.\Allocate $40 billion for expanding pre-disaster mitigation programs such as the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program\Buttigieg's infrastructure plan builds on an already-promised $100 billion for expanding transportation, which he outlined in his September climate plan.\Specifically, his infrastructure plan would commit $160 billion in investments to help states, cities, towns and tribes amplify public transit. This includes improving the national rail network, the plan says.\Steven Coxhead, president of Indiana Passenger Rail Alliance, said Indiana is in need of more public transportation, especially after last year's state decision to cease funding for the Hoosier State line service from Indianapolis to Chicago.\""The trend these days, especially with the younger generation ... is to have a fairly sophisticated, well built-out system of internal public transportation,"" Coxhead said. ""Indiana does not have that.""\However, Coxhead said his organization favors building a rail system under state control rather than under federal control or through partnerships with Amtrak, which he said would be less stable than an Indiana-built program.\""These are all good ideas,"" Coxhead said. ""Of course, as always the devil is in the details, and being able to get funding and actually being able execute on plans is something else.""\Buttigieg's public transportation plans also include:\$12 billion for expanding rural public transportation\Tripling funding for the Low or No Emission grant program in hopes of boosting use of environmentally friendly and electric buses\$6 billion in grants and loans through the American Clean Energy Bank to create an electric vehicle charging infrastructure\Requiring the Department of Transportation to propose an alternative to the gas tax such as a fee for vehicle miles traveled, which is being piloted in some states.\Aside from the sustainability-oriented aspects of Buttigieg's plan, he also focuses on creating jobs, expanding broadband and repairing schools.\Most notably, he aims to create 6 million jobs and commit $10 billion for training a skilled workforce. The plan also allocates $165 billion for the Highway Trust Fund.\Here's what else the plan includes:\An $80 billion investment in a repair program for school districts with high poverty levels\An $80 billion initiative to expand broadband in rural and underserved communities\A $100 million investment to expanding Apprenticeship Readiness Programs\A $50 billion grant program for states in need of repairing bridges\Contact IndyStar reporter London Gibson at 317-444-6043 or lbgibson@gannett.com.

95,"The next Indiana governor will have to answer a $1.1 billion question.\All three candidates for the office say they want to complete I-69 from Evansville to Indianapolis.\But where will they find the cash?\Or should they even bother?\The controversial freeway, one of Gov. Mitch Daniels' cornerstone infrastructure projects, will connect Evansville to Bloomington by 2014. But no money has been allocated to complete the most expensive, most politically sensitive and busiest stretch: Bloomington to Indianapolis. And existing revenue sources are tapped out.\The $3.8 billion in Major Moves funds from the Indiana Toll Road lease is all spent or allocated. Gas tax collections are falling. A tax hike is politically difficult. Federal earmarks have dried up.\And there's little money to shift from other projects.\""There is no money to finish anything of consequence, much beyond routine maintenance and a few minor projects,"" said Rep. Jeff Espich, chairman of the House's tax-writing and finance committee.\So the choice for the next governor, although far from easy in practice, is fairly simple in principle: either come up with a new source of funds or stop the project -- at least for the time being -- in Bloomington.\Daniels, who notes he has presided over eight years of unparalleled highway spending, acknowledged in an exclusive interview with The Indianapolis Star that times are now tough, and he'd be OK if the incoming governor decides to put I-69 on hold.\""At that point, you will have essentially what folks have always dreamed of,"" he said, ""a divided four-lane highway all the way from Evansville to Indy.""\If that happens, however, it will almost certainly open up the project to a whole new source of criticisms about whether the 94-mile stretch Daniels punched through prime farmland and Indiana forests was even worth its $1.5 billion price tag. Some critics are already describing the incomplete freeway as less than fiscally sound.\""There's the argument you shouldn't go down the path of building a road,"" said state Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, ""until you have funds to complete it.""\Daniels, who leaves office at the end of December, says his critics have overstated the costs and understated the benefits.\""I would say they've been wrong about everything,"" he said. ""And I think they're wrong about this.""\A long-sought transportation goal\For those living in the Evansville area, I-69 represents a lifeline to the political and economic center of the state. The drive to Indianapolis now takes at least 31/2 hours along a route notorious for crashes.\Vaneta Becker, a Republican state senator who has represented Evansville since 1981, said her constituents long have felt ignored in state transportation plans that left them disconnected from the economic heart of Indiana and its capital.\""It's pretty easy to feel that way,"" she said. ""I think it is easier to get to Louisville or St. Louis -- even Nashville, Tennessee -- than Indianapolis. When you think of it in those terms, it shows why it's so important for growth and development of southwest Indiana.""\So the I-69 extension has been on the state's transportation plans for more than 30 years. The project gained new life in 1991, when Congress proposed a new system of freeways as part of what would eventually become the North American Free Trade Agreement. I-69 was envisioned as one of six ""Corridors of the Future,"" superhighways that would ultimately connect Mexico to Canada.\It has become political orthodoxy for Hoosier governors to support the project.\And the top two candidates running for Daniels' job, Republican Mike Pence and Democrat John Gregg, have taken up the cause.\""We're going to complete I-69 to our capital city,"" Pence told reporters this summer. ""For more than 20 years, I believe, we had a spoke missing in the bicycle wheel of Indiana.""\Gregg is equally emphatic.\""It's going to provide economic development,"" he said. ""It's going to bring jobs and investment in a lot of communities.""\Even Libertarian candidate Rupert Boneham, who insists eminent domain shouldn't be used to acquire land for the project, also says he supports finishing I-69.\None of them, however, has identified a source of funding for it.\The $1.1 billion question\The remaining sections of the highway through Bloomington north will run along what is now Ind. 37, a four-lane highway that includes cross-roads and traffic lights.\One might think it would be less expensive to build the freeway along an existing right of way than across raw land.\And Daniels suggested as much, saying it was just ""a matter of taking some stoplights out and making it limited access.""\But state highway officials in preliminary planning documents describe the Bloomington-to-Indianapolis project as much more complicated -- and expensive -- than that.\In fact, the last section, the one closest to Indianapolis, is projected to be the most expensive.\That's largely because the state will have to acquire dozens of homes, business and properties along a more highly developed route in order to build interchanges and widen the right of way to standard freeway width.\In total, the last two sections of the project -- from Bloomington to Martinsville to Indy -- are expected to cost $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. By comparison, state officials say the four sections that extend from Evansville to Bloomington will cost about $1.5 billion by the time construction is finished in 2014, a number that could shrink as bids are awarded.\Officials caution, however, that more detailed and up-to-date cost analyses will be released next year, when environmental impact studies for the Bloomington-Martinsville section are completed. The state also won't be required to pay the entire cost. Federal officials typically match a portion of states' funds for interstate highway projects.\Daniels thinks the projects will cost far less.\""The entire history of this project -- I'm talking about since we got started -- is of cost reduction and underestimates,"" Daniels said. ""My instruction was, 'Build a road, but don't overbuild a road.' And so the cost of whatever remains, will, I think, be quite manageable.""\Funding is tight\Daniels used an innovative source of funding to fire up the project.\In 2006, he persuaded state lawmakers to lease the Indiana Toll Road in Northern Indiana to an international consortium for 75 years. The lump-sum $3.8 billion was doled out to highway projects around the state as part of his Major Moves program.\Daniels and Espich, R-Uniondale, said with Major Moves funds, the state was spending about $1 billion a year on road improvements, about double its previous expenditures.\A large chunk of the money -- $787.7 million--was allocated to I-69.\Now that the Major Moves money is all allocated, however, state highway funding will fall back to previous levels.\Espich said most of the Department of Transportation's money will be spent on salaries and maintenance, leaving a couple hundred million for projects.\""So we can limp along as we did prior to Major Moves,"" Espich said, ""but that's all you can do.""\Pence and Gregg say that, if elected, they absolutely won't raise the state's fuel tax, one of the key sources states use to pay their share of interstate highway projects.\Indeed, when the subject of taxes comes up at all, both candidates say the state needs to cut, not raise, them.\But that poses a challenge. Indiana's 18-cent-a-gallon fuel tax hasn't changed since 2002. Since 2007, revenues from the tax have dipped 7.5 percent.\States also are scrambling to secure federal highway dollars. The federal highway bill passed this year kept Indiana's revenues steady, but highway policy experts say that pot of money continues to shrink for the same reason the state's gas-tax revenues have dropped -- drivers are filling up less and driving more fuel-efficient cars in the weakened economy.\Federal earmarks also have largely been eliminated because of public backlash over pork-barrel spending on projects in individual lawmakers' districts.\Daniels said Indiana is returning to an era when ""needs outrun the gas tax.""\""Yes, we'll be back in a resource-scarce environment, along with everyone else,"" Daniels said. ""We spent 10 years in the sunshine, so to speak, but we'll be back in difficulty if nothing changes.""\Fierce opposition to last sections\The last two sections of the project also are expected to face staunch opposition from landowners.\In a preliminary planning report, state highway officials say the Bloomington-Martinsville stretch would require the state to acquire a minimum of 200 acres of land, two apartment buildings, 40 houses, 12 commercial buildings and two churches.\Alternative plans would take as many as 770 acres, 14 apartments, 119 homes, 45 businesses and four churches.\The state hasn't yet estimated what it would need to acquire for the most expensive stretch, from Martinsville to Indianapolis.\State Sen. Brent Waltz and state Rep. Dave Frizzell, the Republicans who represent Greenwood and Indianapolis' Perry Township, say many of their constituents don't want the highway expansion.\Waltz said local governments would also be affected. Land acquisition would take property off tax rolls, leaving a hole in already beleaguered local budgets that fund schools, libraries, fire departments and other local government services.\Waltz said that in Perry Township alone, initial estimates showed the state seizing as much as $300 million in assessed property that couldn't be taxed.\INDOT spokesman Will Wingfield countered that, while studies specific to Perry Township haven't been done, the added development along I-69 is expected to bring net economic benefit to the communities through which it runs.\But with shrinking budgets, opposition to the project and no plan or a timeline to complete the rest of the freeway, Waltz said it may make more sense, both financially and politically, to stop I-69's construction at Bloomington, especially since Ind. 37 already is a four-lane, divided road.\""The question then becomes, as a matter of public policy, does it make more sense to improve roads we have and fix the roads we have, than it does to build a highly controversial road in an area where the citizens don't want it?"" Waltz asks. ""Is putting a freeway from Evansville to Bloomington good enough? If the goal was to try to connect the southwestern portion of Indiana, which has historically been underserved transportation-wise, if that's the case, we've accomplished the mission.""\And even the biggest I-69 booster of them all -- the outgoing governor himself -- says he'd be OK with that.\""We'll have 90 percent of the functionality by the time we get to 2014,"" Daniels said. ""And if the next governor decides to spread the work over more years instead of fewer, the benefits in terms of convenience, safety and jobs will be accruing already.""\Becker, the state senator from Evansville, said I-69 has been in the works for so long, she'd also be OK with waiting several more years if needed.\""Even if nothing happens,"" Becker said, ""we already have a four-lane highway.""\Will that accomplish its goals?\But shelving the project may not sit so well with everyone, especially for Bloomington-area transportation planners who have faced intense pressure and lobbying from state officials to sign off on I-69 over protests from vehemently opposed local activists.\Josh Desmond, the head of the Bloomington/Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization, said the added traffic from I-69 could overburden intersections on Ind. 37 that are already among the county's worst in terms of safety.\""This is probably one of our biggest concerns,"" he said.\State traffic-projection studies, however, downplay the risks.\Officials say some stretches of Ind. 37 through Bloomington would see more than 50 percent increases in traffic volume but won't overburden the highway.\In the environmental impact statement for the section from the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center to Bloomington, officials wrote that Ind. 37 ""has additional capacity and is projected to continue to operate at acceptable and even high levels of service"" for as far out as 2030.\Still, critics ask whether diverting traffic onto Ind. 37 actually accomplishes one of I-69's primary goals: cutting the travel time between Evansville and Indianapolis.\Tim Maloney, senior policy director at the Hoosier Environmental Council, one of the groups that have long opposed the I-69 route Daniels chose, says state highway officials have consistently overestimated the amount of time I-69 is expected to shave from the Indianapolis-to-Evansville trip.\State officials say the new freeway will take a minimum of 30 minutes off the trip, but Maloney's group contends they've found that, at most, it will save just 13 minutes.\With stoplights and traffic slowdowns already common along Ind. 37, Maloney says, it's ""a fair prediction"" that even less time will be cut off the trip, should I-69 stop in Bloomington.\Some say too much work has been done and too much is left to be gained to walk away. The reality, said state Sen. Luke Kenley, R-Noblesville, is that the next governor and the legislature won't be able to say it's OK to park the project in Bloomington -- unlike Daniels, who is leaving the problem for someone else to solve.\""He gets to do that,"" Kenley said. ""The rest of us don't.""\Follow Star reporter Ryan Sabalow on Twitter at twitter.com/RyanSabalow.

The huge increase in the cost of natural gas should be viewed as a national problem, and a severe one at that. The problem is much greater than its monetarily painful effect on individuals, businesses and organizations. Soaring prices for gas threaten to cripple the entire economy. That must not be allowed to happen.
\
During this past week, The Tribune and
\
WSBT-TV's News22 reported at length on the cause and effect of the higher prices. While the problem is severe, there are potential solutions and no reason to panic.
\
Natural gas is the fuel of choice these days because it is clean- burning and relatively easy and safe to transport through existing pipelines. The fact that gas is the least-polluting of fossil fuels makes it desirable for those with environmental concerns, or for companies wishing to stay under the Environmental Protection Agency's radar. Every one of the electric generating plants proposed in the Michiana area plans to use gas as its energy source. In fact, the availability of plentiful gas is one reason why there is interest in locating generating plants in this area.
\
Although gas suppliers have blamed the higher prices on a gas ""shortage,"" that is something of a misnomer. Experts say there is plenty of gas still in the ground, enough to last for decades. The problem is that current demand is straining available resources, partly because, until recently, there has been little financial incentive for the exploration needed to find and tap into new supplies. Gas prices were so low as recently as 1998 that lenders were unwilling to finance well exploration and drilling costs. In September 1998, gas was selling for $1.69 per million cubic feet. By December 2000, the cost had risen to $10.53 per million cubic feet, a 623 percent increase.
\
The utility companies are quick to point out that despite the higher prices, they are not raking in huge profits because they are forbidden by state regulatory agencies from doing so. The companies making the real profits are those that own the wells and the gas reserves.
\
True enough. But it is also true that conglomerates like NiSource can own both drilling companies like Columbia Natural Resources, which is making huge profits, and NIPSCO.
\
Is there some gouging going on? Probably, although finding out for sure would be difficult, thanks to the corporate layers shielding the beneficiaries, and wouldn't solve the problem anyway. Is there a solution? Yes, but it will require a national energy policy that relies on natural resources, technological innovation and common sense.
\
For the short term, conservation and energy-saving measures need to be promoted. For the long term, a more permanent solution is needed. Having an abundance of power is necessary for the nation's long-term economic well being. That's why conservation alone isn't the answer. This nation needs to generate lots of power if it is to continue to serve as the world's economic engine. There are many possibilities.
\
The nation has an abundance of coal. If a way could be found to make coal more environmentally friendly, it could be more-widely used to produce electricity, thus reducing the demand for natural gas. Tax incentives and technological innovation could achieve this goal.
\
The nation has an abundance of oil and gas, though much of it is hidden beneath environmentally protected areas. Again, there ought to be a way to use tax incentives to promote exploration and technological innovation to extract these fuels without raping the environment. The land and sea should not be despoiled so that a few businesses can get rich. At the same time, precious natural resources shouldn't be withheld if there is a way to get them cleanly. Surely there is a way to satisfy both sides of this argument.
\
There are non-traditional energy sources that ought to be encouraged, including wind and solar, both of which show promise but need further development. Nuclear power has safely provided energy for years, though the nation still has to solve the problem of disposing of the radioactive waste and must constantly supervise to make certain that nuclear plants are operated safely. Fuel cells, which promise power for homes and businesses independent of any power grid, are still on the horizon, but it is a horizon that can and should be moved closer.
\
Finally, the national energy policy should have energy independence as its goal. President Bush and Congress should set aside their political differences and make establishment of a sensible energy policy a major objective.

Passing smoking ban a step in the right direction
\
Indiana's new smoking ban ensures Hoosiers will breathe cleaner air. This has been a long time coming, and hats off to Indiana legislators who tirelessly presented concerns to the Indiana House and Senate since 1990. The evidence to indicate smoking is harmful to individuals and the environment has been there for decades. Even cigarette packages must warn that cigarette smoke is hazardous to health and secondhand smoke is known to be a risk factor for many respiratory and cardiac diseases as well as a trigger for major asthma attacks. The statewide ban passed by the Indiana General Assembly during the 2012 session prohibits smoking inside a business and within 8 feet of an entrance. While there are some exceptions for bars and casinos, businesses and municipalities in the state can enact stronger smoke-free policies. This is being considered in South Bend. Passive smoking can be just as harmful as smoking and dangerous for infants, children and, especially, for people with respiratory diseases. When it comes to the health of our state, this is certainly a step in the right direction.

So long
\
It saddens me to see the demise of yet another local radio station, WAOR. With a long and proud history, WAOR was the station to listen to. That is, until station management decided to program the same 100 or so songs to be played daily. Over and over. And then they wonder why listenership is down. And then decide the only solution is sports talk, which mimics WSBT.
\
WZOC took a similar route. It dropped the best thing it had going, Buddy King, and ""the boss"" Tony Ross, for more of the same canned music, over and over, this time computer-generated.
\
Management at these and other stations need to realize that listeners want a local connection, that they want a friendly voice in the morning, or afternoon and that the listeners want a variety of music, not the same old tired songs day after day. Buddy and Tony gave us variety of music, stories, chances to win prizes and interact with the personalities and kept the programs interesting.
\
So long, WZOC and WAOR, that sound you hear is the listeners leaving. In droves.

Sisters
\
The Leadership Conference of Women Religious was given an assessment by the Vatican that its organization needed reform to come in line with the church's doctrinal teachings. The Vatican appointed Archbishop J. Peter Sartain of Seattle to oversee the reform.
\
My whole life has been molded and shaped by the example of sisters who taught and reflected to me the truth of living out the Gospel. The sisters have stood up for social justice, ministered to the poor and most vulnerable in our population, healed the sick and taught in schools to enrich our faith.
\
I find this approach by the Vatican to be offensive and degrading to the Catholic sisters. I am in firm solidarity with the LCWR and would urge all Catholics to stand in solidarity with the sisters. Let us pray for the members of LCWR who are going to Rome that the Holy Spirit will guide and direct their discussions.

Businesses
\
Judging by the businesses that do not call back when I leave messages on their voice mail/answering service, the economy must be booming in the Michiana area. I am not speaking of an isolated incident -- roofing companies, home repair services that advertise in the paper, insurance agents, et. al, have not returned calls when I have left messages inquiring about services.
\
Even a call back that informs the consumer about reasons for delays in potential service is better than being ignored. I never recommend a business to others that does not return calls.

Hurwich employees bent over backward to make the transition to a different apartment as smooth as possible. And do you know what? Hurwich Farms is still a great place to live.

Twist
\
In response to Samuel H. Littler's comment in the June 19 Voice concerning how President Obama referred to the White House as his White House:
\
In typical conservative twist on the truth, Littler leaves out the fact that Obama was referring to how GOPers were trying to pin the leaking of classified information on the Obama administration. Most past presidents have referred to their administration as their White House. This is not some socialist agenda, just common practice.

Sticker shock

On my recent trip to Florida I had a similar experience to that of Penny Roberts (Voice, June 18). It was true sticker shock to see the gas prices go up 40 cents from Kentucky across the river into our fair state.
\
There has to be a reasonable excuse for the blatant price hikes we are experiencing in Indiana. Is it additives? How about the gas tax? Greed at the pump? Does anyone care? Where are our representatives, both local and in Washington? Oh, yes, it is an election year and they are busy securing their jobs on both sides of the aisle. Does anyone out there care about us?

98,"Question: What do you think about a proposed cap on the state sales tax for gasoline as a solution for rising fuel prices? What, if anything, should state or federal governments do to alleviate the spiraling costs for consumers?\*Something must be done. Like a telephone, gasoline for personal vehicles is a necessity, not a luxury. Any relief -- even the little bit by tax remission -- will help. The larger issue is how do we define price gouging. If the price spikes, it's obvious. But rising and falling and then rising again so that the price keeps escalating is a slow gouge that most of us just accept. I'm not for over-regulation, nor am I for being taken economic hostage by the oil-related industries.\Mark L. Eutsler\Linden\*Taxes are not the reason fuel prices have risen through the roof -- speculation and trading are. As long as the price of fuel is part of the game for making money, we will have no control whatsoever over those prices. I'd rather see the state use those taxes to keep our budget in the black.\Noemi Ybarra\Lafayette\*Anything to help is welcome. The oil company executives are making too much money. If gas prices were regulated like other utility prices, perhaps they would be more reasonable.\Janet Bolan\West Lafayette\*Indiana government entities are experiencing the same increases in expenses due to high gas prices as are consumers. The extra sales tax is needed by government to cover the increased cost of providing the services we depend on every day. Government cannot and should not pick up the tab every time consumer prices increase.\Carl V. Covely Jr.\Sheffield Township\*There shouldn't be a cap. We still pay less than any other developed nation for gas. The lower price that we pay has played a major part in making us dependent on foreign fuel instead of developing alternative energy solutions and learning to conserve, including developing mass transit systems, and has led to urban sprawl.\B. Gibbs\West Lafayette\*I would like to see the tax go to road improvements and highway beautification so we can be competitive with other states.\Larry Rose\Lafayette\*I think it's very ironic that a state sales tax cap is being discussed for gas when the state sales tax on everything else just went up. If they aren't concerned how much we have to pay for every other thing we buy, why should they care how much we have to pay for a gallon of gas?\Lena Carlson\Lafayette\*Governments should do little to alleviate the rise in energy costs. Energy prices everywhere else are typically far higher, and engineers and consumers have responded with smaller cars, better construction and superb public transportation. How long can we afford to be so wasteful?\Gordon Clark\West Lafayette\*Supply and demand will take care of the problem. Governments can only make things worse, as has been shown before. Remember 1976?\David Trout\Lafayette\*Anything that the government, either state or federal, could do to reduce the price would be a help. But don't hold your breath. They are not ever inclined to lower taxes. Raise taxes has always been their battle cry.\Harold Williams\Shadeland\*Indiana, Crossroads of America. If we cap the sales tax, then we each save what, $20 a year? And we lose all the extra taxes that out-of-state drivers would pay as they pass through the state on our roads. Frank O'Bannon did that and we lost millions. Bad idea. Having the proper tires with proper inflation would save over 10 percent.\John Childress\Linden\*Do what the Europeans have done -- switch from miles to kilometers and we would get a lot more pleasant readings on our odometers.\Edwin D. Posey\West Lafayette\*We should use less gasoline by taking the CityBus, carpooling, biking or walking. Reduce the demand and the cost will go down, our environment will improve and your pocketbook will expand.\Tom Brown\Lafayette\*I would like to see all taxes capped, at least until our federal, state and local governments learn to eliminate waste and live within a budget like the tax-paying public has to. I would also like to see the paper publish a list of all the taxes currently levied on gasoline. If the taxes are in percentages, they have gone up tremendously in the last few years along with the price. Where is all that money going? Those taxing gasoline should have budget surpluses, shouldn't they?\Dan Sommers\West Lafayette\*It seems $2 a gallon too late.\Jerry Nichols\Lafayette\*How about if the elected officials would have to pay for their own gas. I bet the gas prices would go down then.\Terry Smith\Lafayette\*Stop the tax! We get taxed enough.\Ryan Hickle\Lafayette\*I hope gasoline prices continue to rise. As fossil fuel prices rise, investment in wind, solar and geothermal increases, making these genuinely responsible energy choices more affordable for all of us. And forget ethanol. It's a boondoggle.\Jason Dufair\West Lafayette\*Government's best move to limit spiraling prices would be to get out of the regulating business and allow people to access the ample billions of barrels of oil under the tundra in Alaska and elsewhere around our land. Washington's answer to crisis management is akin to performing a heart transplant after someone has already died of heart failure.\David Dimmich\West Lafayette\*In economic terms, today's shortage is the start of tomorrow's glut. Government should first get its own fiscal house in order to help the consumer -- a balanced budget and even lower taxes. The state and federal governments shouldn't try any new initiatives because they would have the reverse effect. The U.S. is sitting on the biggest bubble of them all in terms of gas prices. Prices will tumble with time.\Danny L. McDaniel\Lafayette\*This is an artificial solution that does no good. People can control a large part of how much fuel they use by controlling what and how they drive. This is just more ""feelgood"" politics.\Pat Rund\Romney\*The economy is bad. Who can afford to purchase a new hybrid vehicle right now as they are loosing their homes? There is not any option to say we do not have to fill up this week. Most people have to drive to work, and some drive many miles. Something has to happen. Is anyone checking out how rich Exxon is getting?\Shelby Branstetter\Lafayette\*We should definitely put a cap on the state sales tax for gasoline, but not as a solution for rising fuel prices. The only way we will alleviate the cost of gas is to open U.S. oil drilling, build new refineries and build more nuclear energy plants. Conservation will help when consumers reach the ""tipping point,"" but wind power, solar power and those ridiculous hybrid cars will eventually all prove to be counter-productive.\Harry Linback\Lafayette\*Hmmm. Didn't we have a cap on the tax before? Did it work then? It won't work now either. What the government needs to do is stop buying oil from outside the U.S. Use our own resources for a change. We'll use it up sooner or later, but hopefully by then we will have a viable alternative to fossil fuel.\Candy DeFries\Battle Ground\*I don't believe a cap is really going to help right now, and I'm not sure what the state or federal government can do. But I do believe that the higher demand is, the more we're going to keep paying. Everyone needs to make a real effort to cut back on unnecessary driving and making every trip count. There's no reason we can't carpool or even walk or ride a bike sometimes, and of course teach our teenagers not to be wasteful either. It all comes down to discipline in the end.\Crystal Wesselman\Delphi\*I think a cap on fuel taxes makes perfect sense -- if we could also cap the cost of road repair, construction and alternative energy development, at the same time. Or why not raise the tax on excess oil company profits as a way of making it less personally profitable for the well paid CEOs and CFOs of ExxonMobil to stick it to us? Or would that be too obvious?\Kimit A. Muston\Lafayette\*Think of taxes as user fees. They are not tools to achieve social goals. What's next? A bigger tax on fried chicken than on tofu? Governments already do too many things badly. They should do much less, not more.\Ted Nottingham\West Lafayette\*A state gas sales tax cap would only be a temporary solution and stop money from being used for road construction and maintenance. State and federal governments should work to increase automotive fuel efficiency, encourage more domestic oil exploration and refinery development, explore credible alternative fuel products, and eliminate wasteful forms of energy consumption such as auto racing.\Bert Chapman\Lafayette\*Capping the sales tax would be a good start, but I really think we need to invade Saudi Arabia and take over their oil fields.\Rich Trent\Lafayette\*Government's role should be twofold: 1. It should remove the billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies and breaks given to oil companies -- if they get a penny of government aid, it's too much. 2. It should extend tax breaks to people/businesses who invest in energy-saving technologies, whether in electricity, machines, transportation or construction.\Putting a cap on the state sales tax for gasoline is a bad idea. We should encourage conservation, not consumption.\Frank Arnold\Lafayette\*It does not make a sense to me. First, it is a temporary solution and prices will keep going up. Second, lack of state tax revenue will eventually result in fewer services provided by the local or state government or, alternatively, they will figure out other ways to collect those taxes (e.g., property taxes). Find better ways to be energy independent; the biofuel solution is having negative effects on the consumer because of the rising cost of essential foods. Force car makers to make fuel-efficient cars and cars using renewable sources of energy (e.g., hydrogen, electricity).\JosA(c) Ramos-Vara\Lafayette\*Since it's really not the tax that is making the price go up, capping the tax will have little to no effect on the overall price of gas. Capping gas company profits -- now that would help lower gas prices. Forcing gas companies to invest 25 to 50 percent of yearly profits in the research of renewable and sustainable energy resources would make the prices go lower, too. After all, what company wants to be forced to fund something that will eventually put them out of business? Better yet, if a gas company were to become the first sustainable energy provider, think of the profit that could be had then.\Cindy Salazar\Lafayette\*The federal government should ease the permitting process for refinery construction because that is the primary bottleneck limiting supply (causing higher fuel prices) in this country. Also, any vehicle-related tax should be dedicated solely to road infrastructure. Worn, broken roads contribute to lower fuel mileage.\Jason Roehl\Lafayette\*The governor that sold the toll road, fired state workers to privatize state services to a company in Texas and raised the sales tax knowing that it would hurt the disabled, the retired and the working poor is going to cap the tax on gasoline? Give me a break. I have some ocean-front property in Oklahoma for sale.\Furman A. Powell\Lafayette\*Wheee!! Another ""solution"" from our current administration. Maybe we should stop the $153 million per month going to Iraq for their fuel for fighting the war. This group sure comes up with the best ideas. No wonder Bush says Iraq is making great progress. Who wouldn't?\Cliff Davenport\Rossville\*Well, call me a heartless Scrooge, but I do not think gas prices require a ""solution."" Higher prices are the only guaranteed way to reduce demand for fossil fuels and reduce dependency on foreign oil. Many Americans clamor for higher fuel economy and note the average fuel economy is higher in Europe. However, they seem to fail to recognize the causality in the relationship. Higher fuel costs, mostly from higher gas taxes and excise taxes based on engine displacement, lead to Europeans buying more fuel-efficient cars.\Frankly, I feel lucky that gas costs about the same, adjusted for inflation, as it did in 1981 because it could be much worse.\Darren Cooper\Lafayette\*It's really not a taxation issue. To respond to the question: We should dissolve any/all taxation on oil. Oil prices drive our economy and relative consumer costs and should be exempt from taxes. It's not liquor, cigarettes or elective surgery.\As far as gas prices in general: We need to drill in the oil rich Alaska plains and reduce, if not eliminate, our dependence on the corrupt and monopolized oil trade governed by OPEC. (Oil-rich nations pay as little as 12 cents per gallon).\Additionally, we need to greatly restrict access to our borders, quit outsourcing and build, sell and (most importantly) buy ""Made in the USA"". Anything else continues to weaken our dollar. (NAFTA is OK.)\Lastly, our federal overseers need to act and strengthen the dollar in the global market and penalize those responsible for the current economic (subprime) crisis. A strong dollar will alleviate the current high cost of oil.\Chris Cornell\Lafayette\*Capping the state tax on gasoline is tantamount to putting a Band-Aid on a bleeding artery. What we should do is tax the huge capitol gains the oil companies are currently enjoying and directly invest that money into developing a better, safer electric battery, not finding more oil. This technology holds the real promise of saving the planet. We should never agree to turn our food and fresh water into fuel. Ethanol is an empty promise that leads to widespread famine and pollution of what precious little drinkable water we have.\Christopher D. Fullerton\Reynolds\*Suspending the sales tax will not have an impact on consumers. If you want consumers to cut back on usage, you allow the price to continue to go up. Drivers will learn to carpool, bike, walk, etc. I believe the federal government should have allowed for more oil exploration that would have drastically reduced our dependence on foreign oil. Thank you Bill Clinton. Thank you for our high fuel prices.\Dan Huff\Lafayette\*Working to ensure that the price of energy spirals for consumers should be an urgent priority for our politicians. Americans' mindless, profligate use of fossil fuels is an international scandal. The zillions of petrodollars acquired by governments hostile to our interests provide funding for terrorists and some of the most repressive political regimes on earth. A phased-in $4 to $5 federal tax on gasoline would force conservation, and the funds should be stipulated to be used only to develop alternative, green sources of energy.\We owe this to our children and grandchildren.\Brian Capouch\Monon\*The problem is supply and demand. To end the state and federal taxes would be a temporary solution. Our country has access to decades of oil supplies that will end our dependence on foreign oil. The permanent solution is to drill our own oil, but Congress is unwilling to stand up for the American people and increase our supply to bring down prices.\Neal Hawkins\Rossville\*Of course there should be a tax cap. There is no justification for the high taxes already. Taxpayers cannot simply take any raises we want from our employers, and by the same token, our government should not be able to do so to us. Our legislators need to be accountable to all of the people and more carefully spend the money they force us to donate. Why should I tighten my belt so some so-called ""representative"" can push another pet project we neither need nor want?\Scott Schnarr\Rossville\*Higher sales taxes won't help at all. Americans have been getting cheap gas for many years at the expense of others. We've supported oppressive governments and sent our troops to die for cheap oil. That's the real cost.\Rich Ward\Lafayette\*The proposed cap on the state sales tax is quite frankly a little silly. The result is lower revenue for the state, which will have a long tail and more ramifications. The answer to gas prices is simply to use less. Not all of the trips to the mall and other optional places are necessary. The cure for high prices is high prices, the same way the cure for low prices is low prices. Let the economy work and it will correct the high prices.\Roger Wiese\Reynolds\*Blaming the war in Iraq or the Bush administration would only show people's ignorance to the facts. It's simple supply and demand. There's plenty of oil, but the world is using more ""refined oil products"" than are being produced, specifically India and Asia. It's been over 30 years since our last refinery was built, and we have less than half the number of refineries operating now than we did in 1981. The Democrats in power need to address our nation's lack of refining capacity and finally do something about it.\Tony Priest\Battle Ground\*The spiraling cost of gas has been aided by a lack of governmental action. Democratic and Republican administrations have restricted offshore drilling along the Atlantic coast, most of the Gulf of Mexico east of Louisiana and ANWAR, blocked nuclear plants and then acted surprised when we end up depending on more foreign oil. All parties preach energy independence but do nothing to really follow through. The only thing good about the high prices has been the zeal now to move to other energy sources. In effect, the market is effecting the change our government abdicated. I would not cap the gas tax because painful though the cost of gas is, it is forcing us to do what we should have done 30 years ago.\Garland Byron\Lafayette\*The problem is not the high price of gasoline; it is our over consumption. The solution is to use less gasoline. However, this requires sacrifice, and I question if Americans are up to the task. We have lost the will that our parents and grandparents had during WWII when gasoline and other common goods were rationed. They understood that their daily actions had a direct impact on global affairs. Do we have the will to really solve this problem, or will we simply elect people that promise to lower the price a few pennies per gallon?\Tim Delworth\West Lafayette\*If it's true that most U.S. oil reserves are on federal lands, and federal lands are owned ""by the people"" then that means it is ""our"" oil, not the oil company's. Correct? One has to wonder why we are being charged $3.50 a gallon for our own gas. It has to be ""processed"" they say. Considering that the actual cost of getting a barrel of oil out of the ground runs between 7 to 30 cents, depending on location, perhaps it is time for our government to get into the not for profit oil refining- processing business.\J Derringer\Lafayette\*A sales tax cap sounds good in an election year, but it will provide only a slight, temporary relief. This is really a supply and demand problem, so either increased supply or reduced demand will lower fuel prices.\Crude oil is a non-renewable resource. OPEC adjusts production levels to keep total crude supply stagnant, even if we drill every square inch of this country and coast. Government regulation makes new refineries cost-prohibitive. China is multiplying its demand. These factors guarantee that the fuel supply will never effectively increase.\The government should assist rapid development of alternative energies and encourage conservation to reduce the demand for oil. When we consolidate trips, carpool, walk, ride a bike, take the bus, buy fuel-efficient vehicles, recycle, etc., we reduce demand in the market. If the U.S. is proactive in developing sustainable energy alternatives, we can bequeath our dependence on foreign oil to the Chinese (and Islamic terrorism with it).\Jerry Hirschinger\West Lafayette\*This is meaningless political posturing. Cheap oil is gone, probably forever, and people just need to adapt to that reality. If that means you must drive a smaller car, ride the bus to work, travel less or buy fewer luxuries and conveniences, then it does. High gas prices are simply the free market telling you to consume less energy.\Paul Radecki\West Lafayette\*I most definitely want Governor Mitch Daniels to role back his recent sales tax increase to ease the gasoline gouge.\I also would like a windfall tax to pay for a gasoline/fuel stamp program for the poor. It should help food stamp qualified households. Perhaps 10 gallons a month? It could be run by the food stamp people to save money.\Gregory R. Smith\Delphi\*Capping the gas tax will only mean the revenue willneed to come from some other sources. Gas tax revenues come from out of state visitors and over the road trucks, it also is a small portion of the actual price of a gallon of gas. This would be an insignificant drop, but the alternate source of revenue could be worse. This would occur, as the citizens of Indiana would have to pay all of the tax and not share the burden as we do now with out-of-state visitors.\Government has proven that when they meddle with the economic problems they make them worse. They need to stay out and let the market settle out the difficulties. Our economy is changing and so will our lives. Adapt as best you can and learn how to cut costs and save money.\Ray Faber\Crawfordsville\*Capping sales tax does nothing to address the root issue of runaway fuel prices and, by doing so, would only penalize ourselves with a shortfall of funding. A real solution would have Indiana build a modern refinery in Whiting, then sell the gasoline at discount prices to any vehicle with an Indiana registration.\Jim Stalker\Lafayette\*What is the point if Congress would do their jobs instead of just calling in the oil CEOs for their annual chit chat then do nothing. The demand is steady; the supply is being controlled by the oil companies with any excuse they can come up with. As long as they are allowed to control the supply, we will continue to be at their mercy.\Dennis Donoho\Sedalia"

102,"More than 200 Hoosiers met in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representatives on Tuesday night in the fourth annual People's Agenda Town Hall, sponsored by The Indianapolis Star and its news-gathering partner, WTHR (Channel 13).\The speakers -- ordinary citizens who took the time to tell their elected representatives what was on their minds -- touched on a wide range of topics, from I-69 to education. Following is an edited transcript of what they had to say:\Interstate 69\Tom Tokarski, Bloomington: As it stands, we have to build I-69 with the existing state and federal gas tax revenues. To build this highway, transportation projects around the state will go unfunded. The promoters of the proposed I-69 extension have suggested raising the state gasoline tax to help fund the project. How many legislators are willing to raise the gas tax to build this highway? Indiana has lost thousands of jobs directly or indirectly to NAFTA. One of the reasons given by the Department of Transportation to build I-69 is to support NAFTA trade. Should Indiana spend $3 billion to $4 billion to build another NAFTA highway? Keep in mind that there are already two existing Canada-to-Mexico interstate routes that pass through Indiana. Legislators need to listen to all of the citizens of this state and get this monetary monkey off our backs.\Nick Noe, Indianapolis: I am very concerned about I-69. The money keeps Indiana from having a balanced transportation policy. . . . We have no money left for passenger transportation via rail. Indiana only seems to know roads or air, and we have very little money budgeted for rail transportation; this has to change. Indiana has to determine what is the fairest allocation of money for all transportation for all of its people. Just pouring money into concrete and asphalt makes no sense for the future.\Sandra Tokarski, Bloomington: Indiana is second in the nation in the loss of farmland. Farmland is a nonrenewable, valuable natural resource, and we need to work together to try to protect it. The I-69 extension would pave over 5,500 acres of farmland. In Daviess County and Gibson County, much of that is prime farmland. In Daviess County, there is an Amish community that would be impacted by the current plan. In a very unusual move, nearly 700 individuals sent a letter to the late Gov. Frank O'Bannon asking him to not build this road. We ask the legislators, please listen to the people. Protect our farmland, protect our natural resources, and save our tax dollars.\Child abuse\Jay Carrigan, Indianapolis: I would like to address the issue of extending the statute of limitations on crimes of child sexual abuse. People who have been sexually abused frequently have something called delayed-onset post-traumatic stress disorder, which frequently does not happen until many years after the actual abuse. Right now, the statute of limitations allows only two years, or age 20, after the abuse has happened, but many people are in their late 20s or 30s before they realize what has happened. So I would like to encourage the legislature to vote to increase the statute of limitations.\Health care\Rick Weber, Indianapolis: I am a physical therapist. I am here to support direct access to physical therapy. We are asking for you, the consumer, to have the right and privilege to come to a physical therapist for treatment, and for only three days we must be in contact with your physician, which is a very conservative approach. What we are hoping to acquire is the ability for you, the consumer, to receive physical therapy without seeing your physician first.\Funding for disabled\Amy Yoder, Goshen: I am the mom of children with disabilities and also a case manager for the developmentally disabled population in northern Indiana. And there have been huge cuts in the Medicaid waiver program in the last six months that have affected many adults, children and families. And I have to sit here and hear about the millions of dollars going to a new road that is going to harm our country. My children are 4 and 2. If health care and other services are there to help our developmentally disabled young people, they can be gainfully employed and independent; then we won't have to support them later in life. But if we keep cutting these things, we are going to have to take care of a small population that needs our help the most.\Ron Moody, Indianapolis: My son is 26 years old, and he is physically and mentally disabled, and I found out today from my caseworker that he no longer will receive assistance. This program is to be cancelled March 1. This program has enabled my son to get therapy, horseback riding, trips to the zoo, The Children's Museum, and many other opportunities he has received through this program. Although my son still lives at home with my wife and myself, there are many other physically and mentally disabled adults in this community who do not have family support, and to see another resource opportunity taken away from them is very discouraging. These fine men and women should have the opportunities to see and enjoy life as much as you and I do. Our case manager told us today that we could apply for my son to live outside our home in an apartment situation, but only if it is an emergency. Our son has lived in our home for 26 years, and to say it has been a hardship is an understatement. We have kept him with us all these years mainly for his safety, but we should at least have the opportunity for him to live outside our residence. I know Indiana is in a budget crunch, but to take away funding for individuals that have no means of help, well, all I can say is shame, shame on you. The other problem I have is handicapped parking privileges allowed in Indiana. It is entirely too easy for someone to get a handicap parking permit. It has gotten so out of hand that it is pretty much a farce. Being a blue hair does not automatically entitle you to a blue handicap permit.\Clark Lienemann, Indianapolis: I am a hard-working tax-paying parent of two wonderful children, a first-grader and a third-grader, so of course I believe education is very important, and so is supporting our teachers, principals and everybody involved. Today's classrooms are very different than when most of us went to school. Especially when you look and realize that nearly one out of every five students is receiving special education services. And that brings up my first-grader, who has Down syndrome, a developmental disability, and he will have it all his life, and in 90 seconds I can't adequately explain what that all means. We have heard some other stories tonight of people receiving services. In the current budget, the areas of Medicaid and family, children and social services and veterans areas were all flat, and this is not realistic, they are not responsible and . . . assumes that the current level of our current system is adequately serving needs, but it is not. For every one family that I know who is lucky enough to receive services through the Medicaid waiver program, I know about five other families who are on a waiting list. And the way this works, you wait about one to two years for a short-term waiver support, and you wait another four to five years for another mainline Medicaid waiver program. It is just not working adequately. In 2004, we must find a way to adequately serve all the families facing disability in children and adults as well, and not just ones who are not on the waiting list anymore.\Homelessness,\mental health\Sally Park, Indianapolis: Every day you pass them by. They are the profoundly mentally ill, developmentally disabled and physically disabled and/or all of the above. Every day our lawmakers pass them by outside the Statehouse because that's where bus tickets are sold that the homeless agencies give to them. Every day you pass them in front of the City-County Building and other municipal buildings. Every day you pass them in our parks, our libraries and in front of the Greyhound bus station. Mental health agencies from other states ship them here because it is easier and cheaper to ship them than it is to store them. The only time people in this state do anything about the homeless is on Thanksgiving Day when you put that scoop of mashed potatoes on their plate. What I am asking all lawmakers and the media, which I have been doing for 22 years on the street: We need less money -- shock, shock -- going to the homeless industry for ineffective programming, for misdiagnosing, for miscounting the homeless, for failed remedies. We have to stop. They are your brothers and sisters; the homeless do not become invisible because every day you pass them by.\State employees\Dorothy Greene, Indianapolis: I am a state employee, but I am here tonight as a taxpayer.\One of the problems that has been in the media is the license branches, and I think one reason there is a problem is they really pay abominable wages to those people. I know that 10 years ago my nephew had a job as a part-time bus boy at MCL, and he made the same wages as they pay the people at the license branch. Now, I am willing to pay someone who I give several hundred dollars to for license plates a little bit more money than I want to pay the person who buses my dishes at MCL. And to a certain extent, you get what you pay for. If you are not going to pay decent wages, then you won't get decent people coming in, and you are inviting scandal.\Booster seats\Dick Reed, Terre Haute: I am a family doctor in Terre Haute, and I want to talk about child passenger safety. The primary cause of death and injuries in children is accidental injury, and chief among that category is motor vehicle accidents. Unfortunately, there is a big hole in the protection that we provide kids, and that hole is in the age group from 4 to 8 years old. These kids should be in a booster seat. A booster seat carries the kids over from the toddler seat to the adult lap and shoulder belt. A booster seat picks the child up and puts them in the right position for the lap and shoulder belt to do the job in the child. Unfortunately, over 90 percent of all the serious injuries and deaths in Indiana occur in kids who are not properly in booster seats. Less than 6 percent of the eligible age kids in Indiana are not in a booster seat. This isn't because kids or their parents don't know enough to put the kids in the booster seat or choose not to; they really aren't aware of the impact. The state legislature has a real tool in its hands right now in House Bill 1098 mandating the use of booster seats, not so much as a punitive measure but as an educational measure to let people know that this really is an important concept to protect their kids.\Jobs\Robert Pedersen, Zionsville: More than 25 years ago, I was fortunate to get a job in a factory here in Indianapolis that is still working. It is now Rolls-Royce of America, formerly Allison Gas Services Division of General Motors. I see in the news that even folks like myself who have been able to earn a decent living and have had secure jobs can just about write them off for the future, especially for our children. In the legislature, you need to stop the hemorrhaging of decent-paying manufacturing jobs from Indiana. Will the legislature lobby Washington for fair trade or protect the environment in trade agreements? Will Indiana government go to bat for manufacturing, considering what ""fair trade"" has done to Indiana?\Eugene Wallace, Indianapolis: I don't want to turn this into a job hunt, but I wonder if anybody needs a seasoned science teacher to do other things like customer service and coordinating, editing, public relations or something of that sort.\I am here to talk a little bit about jobs, and I hope and pray the governor's agenda on jobs will come to fruition for a baby boomer like myself. We are very concerned about the great rift between the rich and the poor. I guess I have experienced that on the lower end.\The amount of jobs that are moving out of the state is getting more difficult. I have had jobs as seasonal and part-time temporary; you really can't pay a mortgage on those kinds of wages. I think if this trend does continue, America is in a deficit right now, and it is becoming worse and worse, and our credit isn't going to be any good, and we are going to be in another world depression.\John Austin, Indianapolis: We have got to do something about these jobs, people. Our best and brightest college students are leaving this state. I lost my job because my job left for Mexico, and now I am back in school, and I graduate in a few years. I will be one of the ones considering to leave Indiana because our well-paying jobs are not staying in Indiana. So all I might be doing in four years is I might be deciding to use that new I-69 to drive my way out of Indiana.\Education\Susan Risker, Indianapolis: My husband, Mike, and I are home educators of our two daughters. I want to come before you tonight and thank you that Indiana remains a responsible yet nonrestrictive state in which to home school, and I thank you and your colleagues not only for your concern that each child receive a quality education, but also for your understanding that there are several paths for a quality education, one of which is home schooling.\I also stand before you tonight and ask you not to put stumbling blocks in the paths of home-schoolers. Statistics have repeatedly proven that home schooling produces excellent test scores, encourages healthy socialization and appreciation of the arts, and this results in college admissions and scholarships, and many home-schoolers are well sought after. Often home-schoolers forfeit a second income, a lot of our personal time and resources to ensure our children receive a top-quality education. So as you consider the Education Roundtable's plans to improve education, please review the facts involving the success of these dedicated families. We simply ask to maintain our liberty to prepare the next generation to lead our great country into the future. Give us the freedom to teach, and in return we will provide Indiana with young men and women who exhibit excellent citizenry equipped with the knowledge and ability to lead.\John Smith, Solsberry: The discussion a moment ago was about how will we fund all-day kindergarten. Gov. Frank O'Bannon was quoted in The Indianapolis Star: The teacher's pension fund has already been tapped to shore up the budget. Kernan said the pension fund can be used without jeopardizing teachers' pensions. The fund has about $1.8 million in it and an unfunded liability of $7.9 million. What this means is that state teachers are taking their retirement money in the state of Indiana, which has a mandated budget balancing in our Constitution, and using the state teachers' funds to make up the difference in the budget. We owe the teachers $6 million. Two candidates for governor recently wrote the state of Indiana is bankrupt. Last week, the governor said we would give the teachers' retirement fund, the lottery money, back into the kindergarten. How would you like to learn -- let's state it this way, Indiana is also looking to spend $3 billion for I-69. One hundred percent of this comes from Hoosier taxes. Indiana already has the fourth largest percentage of our land covered in interstate highways. We are number one in job losses. Twelve hundred Hoosier homes will be taken for I-69; 12,000 Hoosiers will lose equity in the property when their homes aren't taken.\Jennie Bick, Brownsburg: I just completed eight weeks in the classroom in a first-grade room. Half of the students in my student teaching experience had never been to kindergarten and had not had any experience in preschool, and they were at a terrible disadvantage to those children who had these opportunities. I think having mandatory kindergarten is of utmost importance so that these kids have equal beginnings, so that we don't have kids who are struggling to learn their ABCs and don't recognize their name but are sitting next to children who can read already. I also believe that by the time the child gets in kindergarten, all these standards that a teacher has to meet, that full-day kindergarten is important for all kids, not just those who can afford it for the extra half a day, but for all kids to be able to have an equal opportunity.\School vouchers\William Scott, Bloomington: About eight years ago, we began a study of public schools in Indiana and found that it is not simply a few children who are left behind. The state of Indiana's public schools are leaving every child behind, despite generous funding. My proposal is to engage in education reform, the principal centerpiece being . . . a voucher system; parental choice is absolutely essential here. The woman who home schools her kids has all sorts of data indicating that they do a better job, a far better job, and some of our private schools do a far better job with the same talent as the public schools. It is incredible what we need to do. And by the way, this Education Roundtable . . . law . . . it has made a formal process, a formal bureaucratic legislation. This P16 plan, P16 plan that literally lifts the baby from their mother's arms and treats them for the next 16 years, giving them the faulty educational treatment or no treatment at all.\Property taxes\Laurie Klinger, Indianapolis: I would like to talk about property taxes. I understand there is some discussion in the Senate of a bill that would actually get rid of property taxes altogether. I think it is a great idea. I think what we have got just does not work. I live in Center Township, and I can tell you there are a lot of people there who can't afford the taxes. We were paying the highest taxes and are already the lowest income township in the city, and our township will be paying higher taxes still. The people can't afford it. They are going to have to either lose their homes or find another way to survive.\Predatory lending\Valerie Ringham, Indianapolis: There was an article in The Indianapolis Star about predatory lending. I live in Center Township and have seen a lot of handicapped people, as well as older people, hurt. I have taught here in Indiana for 24 years and am now retired. I want to know how we can protect the handicapped and others, the older population, from out-of-state-based predatory lenders. Our courts are protecting these predators . . . I have sat in on court proceeding investigation of Household Finance, who is located in Virginia, and something needs to be done. There was an in-depth article about Household Finance in The Indianapolis Star. Something needs to be done now. After researching this problem, I have found there are many lawsuits filed against Household Finance throughout the country, but how long must it hurt Hoosiers waiting to have these predators investigated and stopped?\Economic development\Jane Martin, Bloomington: I am vice chair of Tech Point, which is the statewide organization for technology advocacy, and among all of these worthy causes I have heard tonight, I would like to speak in support of four initiatives. The first, the telecommunication highway and broadband coverage for every corner of Indiana such that we can be connected to the information highway. Second, to make pertinent the research and development tax credit so that organizations can plan long-term visionary research with some sense of servitude. And thirdly, to extend the business tax credits to include small businesses that are the largest creators of jobs in the nation today. And last, to give some consideration to make some investments in economic development for new businesses in the state, also creating jobs from the state public deposit insurance fund. This step could provide the next critical funding for some new graduates from the 21st Century Fund. Those who might suggest the technology agenda is irrelevant, I would suggest that history is a witness to it being the primary source of innovation in R&D job creation to every institution.\Off-track betting\Dick Hamilton, Indianapolis: Fifteen years ago, the people of Indiana agreed to change the Constitution to allow the state to have a lottery. This seemed to be an easy money system; all kinds of promises were made that it would only be a lottery. I am here 15 years later to say that every year since then in these chambers . . . there have been contests and questions about how to move this deeper into the life of Indiana, the gambling system. This year's issue is electronic slot machines in off-track betting parlors and in several cities around the state. The details are not important right now. I don't believe the people of Indiana want to see casinolike gambling, and slot machines make up 80 percent of the dollar action in casinos, 80 percent. I don't believe the people of Indiana want slot machine action on Main Street. At first, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, a couple of specialized off-track betting parlors; later on, why not the Meadows? A lot of Indianapolis people here: why not the Union Station Downtown? Why not Terre Haute; why not the center of Columbus; why not the center of Kokomo? The convenience is the key factor in taking the 5 percent of young people who we know will become addictive or problem gamblers and putting them into that system. Talk to your legislators about slot machines now.\Tourism\Jennifer Anderson, Bedford: I want to talk about the tourism industry. Every dollar spent on the hospitality industry generates $7 of economic spin-off that amounts to a $6.7 billion industry in Indiana with a $2.1 billion payroll. Recently the line item for tourism and commerce budget was eliminated. Staff dedicated to generate economic benefits from tourism has also been diminished in the Department of Commerce staff to a level of one employee. I am here to ask if the legislature will support having the Department of Tourism report to the lieutenant governor, where the economic benefits of tourism will flourish, and what will they do to help restore the line item for tourism in the commerce budget and ensure that the level of staff meets the appropriate level.\__________________________________\Who attended\Nearly one-fifth of the Indiana General Assembly attended Tuesday's town hall meeting.

Weapons search is not a joke
\
Our president made a joke at the Radio and Television News Correspondents Association dinner about searching for weapons of mass destruction in his office -- saying, ""Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere ... nope, no weapons over there ... maybe under here?""
\
Many young people have died or have been seriously wounded searching for his nonexistent WMDs and he jokes about it!
\
This insensitive man does not deserve to be commander-in-chief with the power to start a war that has no end.

Stop the war
\
I think the war in Iraq should be put to a stop now. Hundreds of our soldiers are being killed over there, and so are many innocent Iraqi civilians. The last thing we need is more deaths.
\
The weapons ""hidden"" somewhere in Iraq are not there. Our soldiers and agents have risked their lives searching in every possible place where the weapons could be, but to date none have been found.
\
In my opinion, President George W. Bush has sent troops to Iraq for no good or honest reason. We all know that there is a lot of oil in Iraq and its neighboring country, Kuwait. Bush sent the troops over to ""investigate"" for weapons, but the main objective is to take all the oil that he can get to make more money off of it. In that case, he lied to his country about the weapons, and just wants more money out of sheer greed.
\
The one action I want to see done is for Bush to get our troops out of Iraq, bring them home to safety, and end this immoral, ridiculous war!

Change is good
\
Did Tribune arts critic Julie York Coppens leave ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" before the standing ovation? We were at the same performance March 26. I don't agree with her negative comments.
\
At first I was skeptical of the new changes, such as the modern clothing and use of flashlights. I quickly realized the updates put this story in today's society. We loved it! We gave it an outstanding rating.
\
I won my tickets from WAOR-FM and can't thank the radio station enough for a wonderful evening.

It was my third time seeing ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and I loved the changes.

Responsibility
\
It was so refreshing to hear Richard Clarke's testimony on March 24 before the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks.
\
Clarke, the former chief of counterterrorism during both the Clinton and Bush presidencies, prefaced his remarks with an apology to the victims and victims' families for government's failure to protect them from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Imagine that, a public official telling the truth and taking responsibility for the consequences of his department's failure. What a contrast to President Bush, who continues to tell Americans the economy is improving and that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. Anyone who dares to call Bush to account for his failures or mistakes is immediately attacked on a personal basis. Bush has been quoted as saying he doesn't regret any of his decisions since Sept. 11, 2001.
\
Does that include no regret for the hundreds of lives lost and thousands of lives damaged in Iraq? Bush could take a lesson from Clarke and take responsibility for the disastrous years in the White House. Let the buck stop with him and give someone else the opportunity to clean up the mess he's made of this country.

Missing style
\
Driving past the former Kramer's Grill, I realized how unfortunate the closing is. John ran his restaurant with quiet professionalism -- a constant smile on his face and the ever- present dress shirt and tie as his uniform. John vacated his previous location, The Style Restaurant on Mishawaka's north side, after a successful run.
\
After relocation, the name was changed to Kramer's; a non- smoking philosophy was embraced. John transplanted the familiar green Naugahyde booths and folksy artwork. He baked bread himself. He had the thickest and crispiest bacon in town. John made everything from scratch, even the soups. His was an easy place to understand the entrepreneurial spirit as it thrived in this enterprise.
\
I ponder the demise. What happened to the loyal clientele from The Style? Perhaps the non-smoking policy alienated many. Sadly, the business failed. I wish I would have visited one more time to eat and thank John for his hard work and dedication. That is impossible for me and many others to do now. John, you had style; we miss you.

Makes the point
\
Mike Hamann's rebuttal (Michiana Point of View Feb. 29) regarding county officials was wrong in all four particulars.
\
1. State law did not prohibit restoring the homestead credit last year. The maximum required a certified rate, but our officials could have estimated. Instead they waited until after elections to get their rate certified, and until '04 to restore the credit -- costing us $4.3 million.
\
2. When the county budget doubled, public safety was not all that exceeded inflation. As the published correction showed, even the non- safety departments went up 40 percent! And did crime go down when safety more than doubled (160 percent)?
\
3. The wheel tax's $2.5 million is more than covered by the option income tax surplus ($2.5 million), the homestead credit ($2 million), the state gas tax increase ($0.5 million) and the property tax excess ($11 million to $36 million). The wheel tax should be rescinded.
\
4. That other architects have done small projects for the county does not change the multi-millions going to Cole/DLZ (whose vice president is County Democratic Party Chairman Butch Morgan), which contributed heavily to our commissioners' campaigns. So did Herceg, which did the 1855 courthouse. And on the Law Building, Hamann's other example, the $50,000 plumbing contract went to Dave Niezgodski, who was on the County Council at the time.
\
Our thesis remains: There is an entrenched political machine in St. Joseph County with an inside track to increasing our taxes in order to sustain itself. We taxpayers must stop these excesses by removing the entrenched politicians.

War on nature
\
We all need clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and security from toxic chemicals to live. During the past 30 years, laws were passed that went far to reach those goals.
\
But since conservative Republicans have controlled Congress and the White House, they have been waging war on the environment! They want to weaken long-standing protections like the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. They have changed rules to allow damage to our national parks by mineral industries; vastly increased logging of our national forests; and the removal by dynamite of whole mountaintops in some of our most beautiful natural areas.
\
Our local congressman, Chris Chocola, votes in lockstep with this conservative wing of the Republican Party. Isn't it time we broke the stranglehold that these extremists have on our country? Compare the two parties' voting records on environmental issues at lcv.org/ scorecard/scorecardmain.cfm and cast your vote in favor of a cleaner, safer environment for Michiana by voting Chocola out of office in November.

Help appreciated
\
On March 23, a fire broke out on the second floor of our home. Within minutes of me calling for help, several fire engines arrived. What followed was something that I will never forget. These firefighters not only did their job of putting out the fire, but they did so with such professionalism, kindness, thoughtfulness, and consideration that I will always be grateful. Because of their clear thinking and quick actions, we lost only half of our home, not all of it.
\
I also wish to thank South Bend Animal Care and Control, which brought oxygen for one of my cats, and took her to the emergency clinic for me. They also took several of my cats and my pet rabbit to the shelter for safe-keeping. Animal Control deserves more credit and respect than is often accorded to it. Its employees are truly caring individuals who have a tough job to do.

104,"In response to letter printed June 28, ""McCain offers real gas price solutions,"" the writer made several inaccurate statements. He stated ""liberals"" caused the problem of no new drilling or refineries.\Is he aware that until recently Sen. John McCain, along with other Republicans in Congress, opposed new drilling? Remember, the Republicans held the majority and the White House from 2001 to 2007.\Any new drilling will take 10 years to come on line. Much of the offshore oil is in deep water, costing a lot to extract, unlike the cheap Middle Eastern oil.\We have heard the ""no new refineries"" line, but in fact refineries have been upgraded and expanded. The big oil companies have no plans to build new refineries with gas more than $4 a gallon.\McCain might blame domestic production, and Sen. Barack Obama might blame the oil companies, but the fact is a weak dollar and increased world demand are driving the price up.\McCain's plan to suspend the gas tax won't work. Where will the money come from to maintain our highways?\The solutions are simple.\First, lower the speed limit to 55 mph. Second, ban all drive-thrus. Raise fuel economy for new vehicles. Encourage and expand public and mass transportation.\These steps would have a direct, immediate effect on the price of gas.\Lastly, when the price does go down, it doesn't mean it's time to raise the speed limits or to go buy a big gas hog like we did in the '90s.\Matt Anderson\Lafayette\Immigrants' jobs not appropriate for kids\I was rather surprised at the recent column, ""Guess who's doing the jobs our kids don't want,"" by Ruben Navarrette Jr. (Journal & Courier, Monday).\What is a business to do when it can't find enough labor? There are many options, but one I have never heard before is to yell at your kids to quit their urban, neighborhood job and hit the highway like a modern-day ""Grapes of Wrath.""\Higher pay, better working conditions and union recognition are just a few of the more standard methods used in other industries, but what business owner wants to go down those roads when there is an easier option?\Does he honestly think that agricultural labor is a valid option for most young people as an ""after-school"" job?\Can he truly say that the working conditions on California farmlands are safe environments for the majority of children under 18?\Lest we forget that only 100 or so years have passed since child labor even became an issue in this country and that it wasn't restricted until 30 years after that (and not by a conservative, I might add).\Hard work is good. But starting up the Philadelphia ""orphan train"" again to benefit California's farm owners is not the solution.\And President Bush is just about the last person you want to bring up when it comes to excessive coddling of young people.\Michael McNamara\Lafayette"
105,"I was sorry to see The Star's Feb. 16 editorial, ""Time for president to wield first veto,"" on the recent passage of the Senate highway spending bill. There are a few pertinent facts you should have explained before stating your position:\Indiana, by the end of the bill year, would receive 95 cents on the dollar in lieu of the current 90 cents we now receive. How can our senators not support this position? That accounts for a large chunk of additional money for Indiana. This equals more jobs in the construction and transportation industries and also more tax revenue for the state's coffers.\This money comes directly from the federal gas tax we pay and is based on increased revenue projections over the six years of the spending bill.\We should applaud our senators for voting for a bill that will increase jobs, increase our fair share of money received, decrease congestion on our highways and decrease the amount of pollution that cars sitting in stopped traffic emit into our environment.\It is an investment for the future of Indiana.\Brad Miller\Fishers"
106,"In the distant past -- say, 1999 -- most Americans still held the quaint notion that they, and not government bureaucrats, were best suited to make decisions about how they should live their lives. Increasingly, however, that no longer seems to be the case.\The latest evidence of that trend emerged Wednesday at the White House, where President Barack Obama announced new fuel-efficiency standards that are likely to force Americans to give up their pickup trucks, sports utility vehicles and minivans.\Obama ordered the nation's already-struggling automakers to achieve an average 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. That's about a 10-mile per gallon increase from the current mark.\The administration's dictate is driven by the desire to reduce the nation's dependency on imported oil and better protect the environment. And there's much to commend both of those goals.\Yet rather than allowing the marketplace -- in short, the American public -- to arrive at those destinations on its own, the president is asserting that he knows better than the Hamilton County mother or the Morgan County farmer what vehicles will best meet their needs.\By the way, the new smaller, less-versatile vehicles will cost consumers an estimated $1,300 more on average. Which is further proof that less for more is the most common outcome when governments intrude deeply into free markets.\It's not as if consumers don't already have purchase options that include high-mileage vehicles. A year ago, with gas prices above $4 a gallon, the Smart car was trendy. Demand dropped, however, when gas prices fell. This spring, USA Today reported that many prospective buyers who ordered one of the cars were refusing to take delivery.\Detroit automakers have many problems, but one of them is that they now sell their most fuel-efficient cars at a loss to meet existing federal regulations. The new mandate is likely to exacerbate those losses.\Supporters of the president's order point to Europe, where small, fuel-efficient cars are popular, as a model. But Europeans pile into tiny vehicles in part because heavy gas taxes have pushed up fuel costs. The Obama administration, for now, says it has no plans to raise the federal gas tax.\Should Americans drive vehicles that get better gas mileage? Sure. They also should eat more vegetables. But the federal government -- so far -- hasn't dictated that restaurants must serve more broccoli."
107,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education. The Senate has a bipartisan proposal authored by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.\House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline, R-Minn., is hoping to advance his companion measure in the House after an earlier effort in February was abandoned when conservatives said his bill did not go far enough to remove the federal government's role in setting state's education policy. The legislation, a rewrite of President Bush's No Child Left Behind education law, is under close scrutiny from conservatives.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs. The White House has threatened to veto spending bills at the current levels, while Republicans want to maintain austere spending levels set in a 2011 budget law."

109,"Upgrading the Bedford aluminum casting plant is a sign that General Motors is trying to improve mileage in its cars and trucks.\But the $49 million project announced Wednesday -- turning out parts for a new 8-speed transmission designed for fuel economy -- comes as the Detroit automakers grapple with energy concerns.\GM head Dan Akerson on Wednesday urged raising the federal tax on gasoline by as much as $1 a gallon to spur sales of the vehicles the 8-speed will go in.\Akerson told a Detroit newspaper that raising fuel taxes would aid the environment more than new federal mandates for better fuel economy in cars and trucks.\""There ought to be a discussion on the cost versus the benefits,"" Akerson said about higher taxes.\Many analysts doubt the GM chief executive would sway political leaders. He came over to run the stricken company in 2010 from the powerful Carlyle investment firm in Washington, D.C.\""It's career suicide for a politician to call for raising gas taxes,"" said auto analyst Rebecca Lindland of IHS Global Insight, Lexington, Mass.\The issue is pertinent here. Consumers are strapped by high gasoline prices. At the same time, Indiana is the No. 2 automotive state and home to more than 50,000 autoworkers. Dozens of plants make auto parts, particularly for engines and transmissions, a legacy of a past era when the industrial Midwest specialized in powertrains.\Detroit auto execs have insisted that consumers will resume buying big vehicles when fuel costs subside. According to this view, higher gas taxes would sustain sales of the most fuel-efficient autos.\Pushing mainly for better air quality, President Barack Obama's administration ushered in stricter mileage standards in 2009. Beginning in 2016, an automaker's entire array of car and truck models must average 36.5 miles per gallon, up from about 27 mpg currently.\GM's 8-speed and a large share of the $1.2 billion Chrysler committed this year to its Kokomo transmission complex are aimed at meeting that new standard.\In Bedford, the project will create 58 jobs by 2014 on a new line casting parts slated for delivery to a transmission assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio. GM has earmarked about $2 billion for upgrading its plants across North America.\Auto companies are looking beyond the 2016 standards. Federal officials are considering annual fuel efficiency increases, beginning in 2017, to bring the fleet average to 62 mpg by 2025. That means automakers must start engineering the improvements in the next few years.\But execs in Detroit fear the stricter federal CAFE standards -- it stands for Corporate Average Fuel Economy -- will work against GM, Ford and Chrysler. The Detroit Three still depend on full-size pickup trucks for a large share of their profits.\Tougher CAFE rules could lead to less acceleration and tow-power in a pickup, while the higher gas tax advocated by Akerson would allow the automakers to keep the big pickups on the market. Akerson compared the CAFE rules to a tax on the Midwest.\""What we are going to do is tax production here, and that will cost us jobs,"" Akerson said.\The Detroit News contributed to this story.\Call Star reporter Ted Evanoff at (317) 444-6019"
110,"The city of Indianapolis is at a crossroads.\Residents and officials are deciding whether to drastically change Downtown by creating paths for bikers, skaters, walkers and joggers, eliminating traffic lanes on some major arteries in the process.\Experts say the city's decision isn't only about cosmetics. It's about changing Downtown from a car-driven one to a destination for health-conscious residents and new companies.\But some who live and commute Downtown say shrinking the width of the roads will create traffic problems and more parking headaches.\Dubbed the Cultural Trail, the estimated $15 million to $20 million path would be built on busy Downtown streets. The final decision is still months away, but the city is spending more than $330,000 in tax money as it ponders the direction it wants to go.\Mayor Bart Peterson favors the Cultural Trail, calling it one of the best ideas he has heard ""to take Downtown to the next level.""\He said it could separate Indianapolis from most other cities, giving it a world-class amenity. A mixture of grants, donations and tax money would pay for the trail, which could take two to 15 years to build, depending on funding.\""There is a reasonable chance this will happen,"" Peterson said.\Conceptual drawings show the trail snaking around Downtown, connecting White River State Park and the Canal Walk with Downtown shopping, monuments and government buildings, and the city's arts and entertainment offerings in the Fountain Square and Massachusetts Avenue areas. On the north, it would follow Walnut Street or North Street; the east leg would follow Alabama Street; the south leg would follow either Washington Street or Market Street; and the west leg would continue along Canal Walk or West Street.\One offshoot would stretch to an eventual Monon Trail segment near 10th Street and Bellefontaine.\""It really is going to be one of the gems that we have as a community,"" said Mary Peters, director of the Office of Cultural Tourism. She said connecting the cultural areas would add another amenity to the city's sports and racing offerings.\While many cities have amenities like multi-use paths in their plans, Indianapolis' idea is unique in this country, planners say.\Civil engineer Peter Swift said building an elaborate, looping boulevard specifically for biking and skating, separated from a companion walkway on one side and from a street on the other, could set a precedent.\Swift, whose business is in Longmont, Colo., is one of 200 civil engineers writing a book about traffic engineering for ""walkable"" communities. He said these types of paths are prevalent in Amsterdam, Netherlands, but not in the United States.\Health behavior experts say such a trail could make more Hoosiers aware of exercise -- not a bad thing for a state that ranks high nationally in obesity and smoking.\""I have been to over 200 communities in the last couple years, and I have not heard of anything like this,"" said Rich Killingsworth, director of Active Living by Design at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.\Killingsworth studies how infrastructure, such as a Cultural Trail, affects residents' health behavior.\As Indianapolis officials grapple with the decision on whether to move forward with the project, they also must figure out who will pay for it.\Deputy Mayor Jane Henegar said all the costs will not fall to taxpayers.\She said tax dollars could be used as seed money to help secure grants to pay for more than half of the project. Private donations would account for the rest.\The idea is an intriguing one, said Gretchen Wolfram, director of communications for Lilly Endowment, which awards millions of dollars each year for community projects. But that's no guarantee that the endowment, among the five largest in the country, will help pay for the trail.\""There are a lot of intriguing ideas out there, and there are a lot of major campaigns going on for other purposes,"" she said. ""I'm not sure where this would fall into play on the priority list.""\So far, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization -- which gets 80 percent of its annual $1 million planning budget from gas tax money and 20 percent from the city -- has spent $180,000 on preliminary plans.\The planning organization will spend an additional $152,000 this summer on more designs that should help nail down the exact route and construction costs.\A report from that study will be instrumental in determining whether the trail becomes reality, said Mike Dearing, the planning organization's manager.\Two public workshops have been held to present the plan to about 300 area residents and business owners, and officials discussed it with about 300 others who attended neighborhood association meetings last winter. At least one more meeting will come this fall after the next report is completed, Dearing said.\Criticism likely will surface when people begin to realize that transportation dollars, traditionally earmarked for motorists, are being used for pedestrians, Swift said.\Under the current proposal, the trail would rob traffic lanes and money from cars. Transportation funds traditionally used to improve roads would be used to build and maintain the trail. But officials insist the reallocation of some funds would not affect necessary road projects.\There has been wide support so far, city officials say, but some residents and commuters believe the trail would cause more headaches than it's worth.\""I don't think the streets need to be narrower,"" said Carole Keppler, 67, a retiree who has lived in Downtown's Lockerbie area since 1984. ""The idea of bringing people Downtown and trying to take them to all the interesting places is a good idea, but I'm a little concerned with traffic.""\Keppler, who attended one of two public workshops, said she fears parking spaces around her home would disappear.\Susan Dice, 45, a saleswoman who lives on the Far Southside and travels Downtown almost daily, said she doesn't think the timing is right.\""Because of the economy, we don't need to be spending money on that at this time,"" Dice said.\But proponents say now is the time for such a trail. Creating the path would encourage tourism, make the city a more interesting place to live and help attract new businesses, they say.\""The bottom line for the project is economic development,"" said Meg Storrow, of the design firm Storrow Kinsella Associates, which designed the current plan.\She said it's a ""wave of the future"" as cities try to create environments where businesses want to locate -- places where employees would want to live.\To some Massachusetts Avenue business owners, the money spent on a trail could mean more customers -- and profits.\Stout's Shoes owner Brad Stout said he likes the idea, partly because it will bring more pedestrian traffic into his store.\Stout, a bicyclist, also likes it because it would give him another place to ride.\""I think it's an investment in the community. It enhances lives,"" said Stout, 45. ""It seems like a fair chunk of change. . . . At what price would it be too expensive?""\He said the canal project near the Statehouse and the Eiteljorg Museum is an example of how Downtown can be enhanced.\""It's beautiful,"" he said of the project, which cost $113 million to complete.\Douglas Bostic, 67, a security guard at a Downtown office building on Ohio Street, said he favors the plan ""if it takes the bikers out of the car traffic.""\That's the point city officials want residents to consider.\""The whole frame is whether we want to be a 'car' Downtown or a 'pedestrian' Downtown, and that's one of the decisions we're asking the community to help us make,"" Storrow said. ""It's a very bold idea, a very bold statement about values -- about quality of life.""\_______________________________________\What's next?\A decision by city officials on whether to move forward on construction of the Cultural Trail is expected as early as this fall. Before they make the decision:\* Designers and engineers will complete a $152,000 study of the trail plan. The study will examine infrastructure along the proposed route, suggest modifications and update cost estimates. At present, the trail is expected to cost $15 million to $20 million.\* City officials will conduct another public meeting to discuss the new plans.\______________________________________________\Project designer Storrow Kinsella Associates has identified some of the pros and cons of developing a trail system that links Downtown areas.

113,"If you like the taste of vanilla, you'd probably like Gov. Eric Holcomb's first State of the State address Tuesday night. No, it wasn't a bad speech. It was a platform where Holcomb outlined in very broad strokes his agenda for the upcoming legislative session and his vision for the state.\At 30 minutes, his speech was the first opportunity for many Hoosiers to hear from their governor in a non-campaign environment.\His speech centered around five pillars: 1) a strong and diverse economy; 2) Fund long term a roads and bridges plan; 3) Develop a 21st century skilled workforce; 4) Attack the drug epidemic and 5) Provide great government service and value to taxpayers.\Getting to the main issue facing lawmakers, fixing our crumbling roads and bridges, Holcomb is seeking a ""sustainable plan"" to fund roads and bridges for the next 20 years. ""When it comes to paying for these projects, I'm open to a menu of options,"" Holcomb said. ""The fact is, existing sources of revenue are just not keeping up."" He didn't specifically mention raising the gasoline tax, which is smart political strategy, but as the session moves forward, eventually he will have to back raising the gasoline tax or push for some other means to help raise $1.2 billion a year for transportation. A bill in the House would raise the gas tax 10 cents a gallon, the first tax increase since 2003. That's only part of the equation. Bills also seek to have Hoosiers pay more when they buy their license plates, and pay tolls on some highways or interstates.\Stay tuned for details.\One area where Holcomb did offer details was solving the state's drug epidemic. That's a topic that poses grave concern for people of East Central Indiana, particularly in Delaware and Wayne counties. ""We're going to attack this problem on all fronts: prevention, treatment and enforcement,"" Holcomb said.\He wants to give county officials decision-making authority to establish needle exchanges, something Holcomb's predecessor, Gov. Mike Pence, was reluctant to do. He also wants to limit the amount of controlled substances, prescriptions and refills, increase penalties for those who rob pharmacies and upgrade the Indiana State Police labs. Earlier this month, he named Jim McClelland, former CEO of Goodwill Industries, to a drug czar position.\With Delaware County being ground zero in the state's meth epidemic, 248 meth labs were discovered in 2015, help can't come too soon. The same for Wayne County, where officials reported nearly one-third of the mothers giving birth at Reid Health tested positive for an illicit or high risk drug. In terms of numbers, that's 211 out of 684 women.\The state needs to take a leading role to fight the drug scourge because communities don't have the resources to make a dent .\As for Holcomb's fifth pillar, great government service, he was fuzzy on the details. Said Holcomb: ""I'm going to insist that all of our agency heads be accountable for the programs and services they're providing.""\Shouldn't that be happening already?\The evening's longest applause came when Holcomb announced state police would receive a pay raise of an unspecified amount. He also wants to exempt veteran pensions from state income tax as a way to say thanks for your service and to attract more veterans to the state.\Then there's this: Former Yorktown Superintendent Jennifer McCormick might be the last elected state superintendent of public instruction. Holcomb wants to make the position appointed. ""I've long been committed to the notion that, as the state's chief executive, the governor should set education priorities and be held accountable for the results."" A bill to make that position appointed beginning in 2021 has been filed in the Statehouse.\Holcomb avoided social issues such as religion and abortion that Pence was not shy to embrace. There is little to be gained by becoming a lightning rod of controversy just weeks into his first term.\He played it safe with this speech.

114,"MARCY MERMEL\Lacking a better chemical to remove ice from roads,\transportation officials have tried to put themselves on a low-salt\diet.\A committee of the national Transportation Research Board\reported to the Federal Highway Administration this month that rock\salt remains the most cost-effective way to control snow and ice.\The study compared salt with calcium magnesium acetate, a\synthetic chemical the highway administration proposed as a\possible replacement for salt in 1980. The committee found that CMA\cost as much as 20 times more than salt and failed to match its\melting abilities.\But salt's disadvantages remain. It has been linked to\corrosion of cars and bridges and damage to trees, grass and\drinking water.\The auto industry has worked to reduce the effects of salt\corrosion on its products, said Joe Loughmiller, spokesman for the\Indianapolis Department of Transportation.\""I don't want to fool you and tell you there's no effect.\Obviously there is, but we think the benefits outweigh that,""\Loughmiller said. ""If we stopped using road salts tomorrow, you\would see a lot more injuries and a lot more deaths.""\Marion County spent $1.1 million on road salt last year, he\said.\Last week alone the county used 9,449 tons of salt to control\ice and snow.\Over the last two years the department has upgraded its salt\truck fleet with vehicles that can automatically control how much\salt falls onto the road, Loughmiller said.\When the truck stops at an intersection, the salt stays inside,\he said.\The city also has installed a computerized system that helps\dispatchers determine when and where to call out road crews.\Six weather stations throughout the county provide atmospheric\information. Sensors painted the same color as roads and bridges\report the temperatures so officials know when the surfaces will\freeze, Loughmiller said.\Several times this season dispatchers have called only a few\trucks to freezing bridges in a region of the city, he said.\""In the past we probably would have called out all the county\to do the roads and bridges,"" he said.\Indianapolis workers supplement the salt with calcium chloride,\a liquid which improves its ability to melt ice in temperatures\below 20 degrees.\Indiana officials have monitored the experiments of other\states and have stuck with salt for the 11,000 miles of state\highway and interstates they service, said Steven Owens, spokesman\for the Indiana Department of Transportation.\The other states ""always go back to using salt,"" he said.\To minimize the amount of salt that leaks from storage\facilities, Indiana officials have upgraded salt domes and improved\the drainage around them, he said.\Workers have improved the methods they use to load and unload\salt to reduce the amount that lands on the ground, where it could\affect the environment, he added.\The state also reinforces bridges with epoxy-coated steel and\latex-modified concrete to protect them from salt damage, Owens\said.\Michigan transportation officials tested CMA on state highways,\but now use it only to protect the new concrete Zilwaukee bridge.\More than anything, Michigan officials refused to pay the price\for widespread use of the chemical.\""We'd have to raise our gas tax 15 cents a gallon,"" said Tom\Shawver, spokesman for the Michigan Transportation Department."

116,"Suppose your boss is throwing a party and your job is to make sure everyone in town is invited. What do you do?\If you're the Indiana Department of Transportation, apparently you wait until the last minute to issue invitations, leave key guests off the list, hold the party at an inconvenient time and location, hide essential details, and send out announcements after the party's already begun.\At least that seems to be the way INDOT would go about it, if you judge by the way it handled getting Hoosiers to public hearings about drafts of the two most important transportation planning documents in our state: the 2035 Long-Range Transportation Plan and 2012-2015 Statewide Transportation Improvement Plan.\Contrary to what INDOT's handling of these projects might suggest, providing clear, transparent public notification of government projects, with ample advanced notice, is more than a simple formality. If projects are to be successful and citizens' interests are to be served, public input is essential.\In the case of these long-range transportation plans, they help to guide the investment of more than $1 billion a year in taxpayer money, while also affecting Indiana's overall livability and the quality of our natural environment. Furthermore, these projects are being planned in a time when our population is rapidly aging and driving less, more citizens are moving toward sustainable transportation alternatives, and the traditional source of transportation funding -- gas tax revenue -- is dwindling.\Consider a few of the ways INDOT handled the public comment process on these long-term plans: Groups that expressed an interest in providing input were not included in the list of organizations receiving an announcement of the meetings. A notice on the INDOT Public Hearings List Serve was posted on March 30, a day after the first hearings were held. All public meetings were scheduled in the afternoons -- when most citizens are at work -- and only one was held in one of the state's largest population centers, Fort Wayne (no meetings in Indianapolis, Evansville, South Bend, Gary or Hammond).\In addition, a draft of one of the plans was not available on a public website until after the first meeting. Citizens who do manage to find the reports on the INDOT website find little guidance on how to comment, and they find a comment period that's quickly slipping away: The public comment period for one of those documents has already ended; the other ends May 15.\So what should be done?\First, INDOT should reopen the comment period for these plans, offer a process that truly invites public input, and seriously address the input it receives.\Second, the public input process for transportation projects should be overhauled to create a process that not only complies with federal regulations but actually enables public input. This process could include five simple steps:\INDOT should hold a series of public meetings aimed exclusively at introducing draft planning documents and accepting public comments. These should be separate from other INDOT meetings.\The meetings should be well publicized in media across the state, and communicated through stakeholder organizations and Indiana's congressional delegation.\Meetings should be held after traditional work hours in locations along public transit routes.\The 30-day comment period shouldn't begin until the final public meeting has been held to guarantee that all interested parties have sufficient time to submit written comments.\INDOT should empanel a citizen advisory council of concerned members of the public from around the state. This council should be integrally engaged in the planning process throughout development of planning documents.\Public input is essential to our system of government, and it is the government's responsibility to ensure that input is solicited, welcomed and heard. With these long-range planning documents, INDOT fell short of that responsibility.\Let your elected officials know that you want Hoosiers to be heard, because, in a democracy, everyone should be invited to the party.\This My View was written by Gil Holmes, American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana; Kim Irwin, Health by Design; Jesse Kharbanda , Hoosier Environmental Council; Amelia Miller, Indiana Citizens' Alliance for Transit; Roger Sims, Indiana High Speed Rail Association; Richard Vonnegut, Hoosier Rails to Trails Council; and Irene Wegner, AARP."

118,"Indiana stands to reap hundreds of millions of dollars under the economic stimulus package Congress is expected to consider for states and could see its share go even higher if Gov. Mitch Daniels gets his way.\The money, state officials say, would help Indiana offset investment losses in its Major Moves road-building fund and could accelerate the timetable of big projects such as the extension of I-69 from Indianapolis to Evansville.\Although just how much any state might get is up in the air, Daniels and Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., hope to persuade Congress to rethink its traditional approach to parceling out federal transportation dollars.\Those dollars typically have been distributed under a formula that has returned just 92 cents to Indiana for every $1 in federal gas taxes that Hoosiers send to Washington. Some states get more than they send.\Daniels and Bayh are urging Congress and President-elect Barack Obama to distribute the stimulus money based on a state's economic health.\""If they're going to throw a lot of money at infrastructure, for goodness sake, don't use the highway formula to do it. It's grossly unfair, especially to Indiana,"" Daniels said. ""You have states with full employment who get $2 and $3 for every $1 they send in. If this is really about putting people to work, let's build the projects where the economic need is the greatest.""\Bayh said that looking at a state's losses in tax revenues or jobs as a result of the recession would be a better way for Congress to determine how to parcel out the money.\That, he said, would ensure that states in most need of the money to create jobs would receive it.\""I agree with the governor that a better mechanism would be based upon which states have been hurt the most economically and have lost the most jobs,"" Bayh said. ""That seems to me to be more just, and it also would have the impact of helping a state like Indiana because of our manufacturing base.""\Indiana's unemployment rate is 6.4 percent, slightly below the national average of 6.7 percent.\Robert Puentes, a transportation expert at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution in Washington, agrees with Daniels and Bayh.\""If we want to spend infrastructure and transportation dollars to put people back to work, there should be some consideration of where the projects are,"" he said.\So far, speculation has placed the size of the stimulus package at $15 billion to $50 billion. Based on those figures, Indiana's share would amount to at least $375 million and as much as $1.25 billion.\If the state's share is toward the lower end of that range, Indiana Department of Transportation Commissioner Karl Browning said, he'd likely use the money to plug a shortfall in funding for the state's Major Moves program, a 10-year slate of road projects totaling more than $11 billion.\That shortfall, which could approach $418 million, developed because investment income from the state's proceeds from the $3.8 billion Indiana Toll Road lease has been less than expected, as have state and federal gas tax revenues, thanks to the recession.\Beyond filling that gap, Browning said, he would try to use any extra federal dollars for road work before tapping state money.\That would let the state add projects to its Major Moves list.\Some possibilities: completing an expansion of U.S. 31 through Hamilton County, finishing a revamped I-465 on Indianapolis' Northeastside and building the stretch of I-69 from Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center, to Evansville.\Browning said 25 percent of the money would be distributed to local governments, as the state does with all federal transportation money it receives.\Daniels, meanwhile, has pressed Congress to eliminate some of the red tape typically associated with federally funded projects so that jobs could be created as soon as possible.\""If this is a genuine emergency, and that's what we're responding to, then throw away the rule book,"" Daniels said. ""No state I know is going to go out to build an unsafe bridge, abuse a property owner or hurt the environment. Let's have a little experiment in freedom here.""\Bayh indicated at least a degree of support for that sentiment. ""The top priority needs to be jobs and getting the economy moving, and if we can streamline the process to make that happen as soon as possible, we should,"" he said.\Obama has mentioned a stimulus package as his first order of business, and Congress could approve the proposal in time for him to sign it into law Jan. 20, the day he takes office.\Call Star reporter Bill Ruthhart at 317-444-2771.\A look ahead: Go to the online version of this story at IndyStar.com for a look at future projects."

LANSING--Gov. John Engler touts the 24 tax cuts made during his term in office like a mantra. But some state Democrats say they can use parts of his record to their advantage.
\
Their argument: Engler is responsible for raising fees and taxes some 70 times, even as he runs for his third term as the tax-cutting governor.
\
The statement has started spreading recently within the party. Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Mark Brewer said the party wanted to get out the truth about Engler's record before November elections.
\
""He runs around talking about his tax cuts, but there's another side to the story,"" Brewer said. ""We thought it would be useful to have a list like this people can use in letters to the editors.""
\
But Engler spokesman John Truscott said Friday that Democrats are distorting the governor's record.
\
""If they try to make taxes a campaign issue, it couldn't make us any happier. They are fighting on our turf,"" Truscott said. ""I don't think there are many people out there who would doubt the fact that the governor is the biggest tax cutter in Michigan history.""
\
In the one-page campaign flier titled ""Engler's 70 Tax Increases,"" a Democratic contender for a House seat lays out 28 of those tax and fee increases he says can be pinned on Engler.
\
Joel Leach, of Macomb County's Chesterfield Township, said he asked a Democratic Party activist to research the tax increases after conversations with voters in the 33rd House District.
\
""I'm tired of being called a tax-and-spend liberal,"" Leach said. ""The Republicans always want to take credit for the cuts, but they don't talk about the fee shifts that burden the middle class.""
\
Leach, owner of a rental car operation and a moderate Democrat in a heavily Republican district, distributed the flier at the Democrats' largest fund-raiser last month. The 70-increase figure was also used by the keynote speaker.
\
""It's my way of telling the rest of the story,"" Leach said.
\
But economists and fiscal analysts label the comparison a stretch since Engler's tax cuts have trimmed $9 billion from state coffers while the tax and fee increases have brought in around $250 million since 1991.
\
Jay Wortley, senior economist with the Senate Fiscal Agency, said taxpayers will save $2.37 billion more this year alone because of tax cuts.
\
Bob Kleine, senior economist at the nonpartisan Public Sector Consultants Inc., said the first five items on the list relate to Proposal A, which reduced property taxes by 70 percent throughout the state in 1994.
\
In exchange, the sales tax increased from 4 cents to 6 cents, a 6- cent sales tax was applied to out-of-state phone calls and the per- pack tax on cigarettes went up 50 cents.
\
""A lot of Democrats probably voted for these,"" Kleine said. ""I think this is pretty much of a reach to make a case when there isn't one.""
\
But Kleine agreed with Leach that many of Engler's much publicized tax cuts such as reductions in unemployment, business and intangibles taxes have benefited businesses and upper-income residents over the poor and middle class.
\
Besides Proposal A-related tax increases, the list includes hikes in hunting and fishing licenses and fees on a wide variety of goods and services, such as vending machines and direct deposit of state employees' paychecks.
\
The increase in user fees reflects an Engler administration philosophy that some Democrats disagree with, said Rep. Tom Alley, D- West Branch.
\
Alley, chairman of the House Conservation, Environment and Recreation Committee, said the hunting and fishing fee increases go right into operations and pay for conservation officers.
\
When the fee increase passed, the fund was facing a $7 million deficit and layoffs were predicted. The fund now has a $11 million reserve, Alley said. But he disagrees with Engler that user fees can fully support certain state programs.
\
""If you start making a user pay total costs, you won't have many users because the cost is too high,"" Alley said. ""I think there should be some additional general fund monies put into recreation. It's our job to keep the fees low enough so there are users.""
\
While Democrats say the fees burden low-income people, Kleine said they aren't unpopular.
\
""User fees can make a lot of sense. I think that's why the gas tax isn't as unpopular as the income tax,"" Kleine said. ""It's going toward something they can see.""

120,"If you like the taste of vanilla, you'd probably like Gov. Eric Holcomb's first State of the State address Tuesday night. No, it wasn't a bad speech. It was a platform where Holcomb outlined in very broad strokes his agenda for the upcoming legislative session and his vision for the state.\At 30 minutes, his speech was the first opportunity for many Hoosiers to hear from their governor in a non-campaign environment.\His speech centered around five pillars: 1.) a strong and diverse economy; 2.) Fund long term a roads and bridges plan; 3.) Develop a 21st century skilled workforce; 4.) Attack the drug epidemic and 5.) Provide great government service and value to taxpayers.\Getting to the main issue facing lawmakers, fixing our crumbling roads and bridges, Holcomb is seeking a ""sustainable plan"" to fund roads and bridges for the next 20 years. ""When it comes to paying for these projects, I'm open to a menu of options,"" Holcomb said. ""The fact is, existing sources of revenue are just not keeping up."" He didn't specifically mention raising the gasoline tax, which is smart political strategy, but as the session moves forward, eventually he will have to back raising the gasoline tax or push for some other means to help raise $1.2 billion a year for transportation. A bill in the House would raise the gas tax 10 cents a gallon, the first tax increase since 2003. That's only part of the equation. Bills also seek to have Hoosiers pay more when they buy their license plates, and pay tolls on some highways or interstates.\Holcomb could have used his speech to offer specifics. ""At some point in time, he's going to have to say whether he supports those particular tax increases,"" Senate Minority Leader Tim Lanane, who represents much of Delaware County, told the IndyStar.\Stay tuned for details out of the Statehouse.\One area where Holcomb did offer some details was solving the state's drug epidemic. That's a topic that poses grave concern for people of East Central Indiana, particularly in Delaware and Wayne counties. ""We're going to attack this problem on all fronts: prevention, treatment and enforcement,"" Holcomb said.\He wants to give county officials decision-making authority to establish needle exchanges, something Holcomb's predecessor, Gov. Mike Pence, was reluctant to do. He also wants to limit the amount of controlled substances, prescriptions and refills, increase penalties for those who rob pharmacies and upgrade the Indiana State Police labs. Earlier this month, he named Jim McClelland, former CEO of Goodwill Industries, to a drug czar position.\With Delaware County being ground zero in the state's meth epidemic, 248 meth labs were discovered here in 2015, help can't come too soon. The same for Wayne County, where officials reported nearly one-third of the mothers giving birth at Reid Health tested positive for an illicit or high risk drug. In terms of numbers, that's 211 out of 684 women.\The state needs to take a leading role to fight the drug scourge because local communities don't have the resources to make much of a dent in the problem.\As for Holcomb's fifth pillar, great government service, he was fuzzy on the details. Said Holcomb: ""I'm going to insist that all of our agency heads be accountable for the programs and services they're providing.""\Shouldn't that be happening already? Isn't that what being an agency head is all about?\The evening's longest applause came when Holcomb announced state police would be receiving a pay raise of an unspecified amount. He also wants to exempt veteran pensions from state income tax as a way to say thanks for your service and to attract more veterans to the state.\Then there's this: Former Yorktown Superintendent Jennifer McCormick might be the last elected state superintendent of public instruction. Holcomb wants to make the position appointed. ""I've long been committed to the notion that, as the state's chief executive, the governor should set education priorities and be held accountable for the results."" A bill to make that position an appointed one beginning in 2021 has been filed in the Statehouse.\There were calls to spend more on education, in particular, doubling the state's outlay for pre-kindergarten to $20 million a year. That would still leave most Hoosier children out of the system. Baby steps?\Holcomb avoided social issues such as religion and abortion that Pence was not shy to embrace. There is little to be gained by becoming a lightning rod of controversy just weeks into his first term.\He played it safe with this speech, which is to say he played it smart. After all, lots of people like vanilla.\Jeff Ward is a news columnist for The Star Press.\Jeff\Ward\Columnist"
121,"Direct deposit my check for taxes\I just wanted to personally thank the Tippecanoe County Council members who voted in favor of the wheel tax. And, just to make sure I get this right, we now have a gas tax, wheel tax, and various federal, state and county taxes assessed to our vehicles. I do have a couple of questions, though:\1. For those living outside of the county, traveling to Tippecanoe County and using Tippecanoe County roads, how will you tax them for using our roads?\2. Please let me know what bank you use and how you would like my paycheck direct deposited into your account. I will need to notify my payroll department of this change since I now work to pay taxes.\Nancy Vestal\Lafayette\We're living with Staley's fact of life\I want to thank a recent writer for his insightful column about the people who have to put up with the stench from the A.E. Staley plants. It is much worse than he said.\When you wake up at night from a sound sleep because the air is so foul you can hardly breathe and have to get up and turn all your air purifiers on, it does not make for a happy camper. I have four air purifiers and it runs my electrical bill up, but it is worth it to be able to breathe decent air.\As for calling Staley, I quit doing that a long time ago. It is a waste of time. People who don't have to live near the south side Staley plant are very lucky. Here's a bit of trite humor: I noticed one day that they had built some new condominiums off of Indiana 38. They named them Crosswinds. I couldn't help laughing, as I thought they are going to wish for crosswinds when Staley starts stinking.\Unlike the letter from the gentleman who was quoting statistics, I am talking about a fact of life for the people who live in this area and the stink that we have to live with daily. I also know nothing will ever be done about it because it is a large corporation.\To you who live in a healthy environment, congratulations.\Elizabeth Thomas\Lafayette\Decent job on sewer overflows? Hardly\I would like to correct some misinformation from opponents who willingly ignored Connie Basham's key points on combined sewer overflows (which result in the dumping of raw sewage into our waterways).\Joe Micon, her Democratic opponent in the District 26 state representative race, said Lafayette-West Lafayette has done great on this. Decent? Yes. Great? Hardly. We've spent millions eliminating some overflow areas as wastewater upgrades have been constructed, yet 18 overflow sites remain. Most dump untreated sewage upstream from Tapawingo Park and Shamrock Park. Farther downstream lie beautiful Fort Ouiatenon and the Ross Hills/Ross Park properties.\Micon said the state is doing a fine job on sewage. That's ridiculous. Indiana is second worst in the nation in the dumping of raw sewage into our critically important waterways. That's the opposite of a fine job to anyone who's not defending an indefensible status quo and complacent state administration.\Micon said spending more money to keep raw human waste out of the waterways would be irresponsible. What is irresponsible is being second worst in the nation on this problem while hundreds of millions of dollars are tied up in existing state loan programs established specifically to address this problem. Basham isn't suggesting that we throw money at the problem with little or no accountability. Quite the opposite. She supports a long-term approach, similar to the way that we try and plan for traffic improvements decades in advance.\Like Connie said at her press conference, nearly two centuries of damage to our waterways can't be solved in a handful of years. Patience may be a virtue, but a specific plan of attack clearly needs to be put into place. If not for us, then for our children and grandchildren.\Tom Boots, campaign\manager, Connie Basham for state representative\Climate act will cost Indiana jobs\Energy is the food that powers the Indiana economy. Our economy is intrinsically linked to the availability and affordability of energy such as gasoline and electricity. When energy costs increase, it creates a negative ripple effect in Indiana's economy. This affects us all - from consumers to farmers to small businesses to big corporations.\Yet, Sens. John McCain and Joseph Lieberman's ""Climate Stewardship Act"" would boost energy prices in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.\A recent study conducted on the economic impact of the act by Charles River Associates found that it could decrease U.S. economic output by increasing electricity costs up to 42 percent, eliminating 600,000 jobs nationwide and reducing household income for every family by $2,225 annually.\For Indiana, the study mirrored national projections. Higher energy costs result in the potential total statewide loss of 14,200 jobs and financial cost of up to $2,300 per household every year. Even more troubling is the fact that this legislation will be harshest for the poorest 20 percent who spend proportionally more of their income on energy.\Indiana's economy is recovering from the national recession, but this legislation is a step backwards when it comes to future statewide economic growth and job creation.\Harry Alford, president,\National Black Chamber of Commerce, Washington, D.C."
122,"A sampling of the best comments of the week from the Editorial Board's online readers' panel.\Uganda's captive children\Gloria Lewis Vaughn, author and recruiter/trainer\Thousands of children, some as young as 7, are being forced either to become rebel fighters or escape for their lives in northern Uganda. They are called Night Dwellers because it is especially during the night that they seek to escape the Lord's Resistance Army. The LRA has earned a reputation for its brutality against the people of northern Uganda and for abducting an estimated 20,000 children over the years.\According to Human Rights Watch, some 5,000 children have been abducted since June 2002. In a report in March, it said the number was likely to be higher because of the return of the rebels to Uganda after the government intensified a military offensive against their bases in neighboring Sudan.\Older female captives (still considered children in our country) are forced to become the ""wives"" of senior commanders and are subjected to rape, unwanted pregnancies and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and AIDS. The younger girls are forced into grueling domestic work.\The LRA appears to be led by a demented, self-declared prophet, Joseph Kony, who says his aim is to set up a government that rules according to the Ten Commandments. What will they think of next to blame on God! He is said to have had at least 60 ""wives.""\Please say a prayer today for the children.\Inventing a right\Kevin Bain, consultant\In honor of the National Spelling Bee, your word is ""penumbra."" According to The Star, San Francisco U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton defines it as the constitutional right to partially remove your living fetus from your womb, and then crush its skull. The documented pain that the fetus feels in the second or third trimester is ""irrelevant""; a women's right to choose takes precedence because of the penumbra of rights that emanates from the specific guarantees of the Constitution.\Still not sure how to spell it? Here's another definition of penumbra: a convenient tool used by activist judges, starting with William O. Douglas in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) to invent nonexistent rights to further their own social agendas. If Judge Hamilton's ruling stands, the precedent set is that my freedom of choice is much more important than the physical pain and suffering I inflict on you in exercising that choice. Color me skeptical that the Founding Fathers intended to make provision for an inalienable right to utter selfishness.\Higher gas tax needed\Yaw Anokwa, electrical engineer and computer scientist\London -- We are a nation very dependent on oil, and it is only when gas prices rise that we are made aware of the problem. So far, the political solutions that have been offered for America's thirst for oil are lackluster. Republicans are demanding passage of their environmentally questionable energy bill. Democrats want to tamper with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so oil supplies increase, driving down the price. The truth is that most people react to one thing: taxes. Americans only need look across the Atlantic for a working example.\Gas is so heavily taxed in Europe, at $5.79 a gallon, that filling up a Hummer H2 in London will set you back $185. Of that, $105 goes directly to the government. Needless to say, you don't see a lot of Hummers in London, but instead, multitudes of fuel-efficient cars.\An extremely high fuel tax, although political suicide, is a great way to wean America of oil. Such a tax could be phased in over several years. The government could offset the tax by adjusting income taxes shifting the tax burden to the middle to upper class. Collected revenue could go to funding alternative fuel initiatives, public transportation, or into cleaning our environment.\Our choices are few, but the bottom line is clear. Oil is a finite resource, and as time passes oil prices will inevitably climb. We can either keep complaining, or act now.\Neighborhood connections\Kanwal Prakash Singh, Architectural writer and artist\The existing and proposed greenways linking communities across Central Indiana can offer Hoosiers much more than just the traffic-free corridors for fitness enthusiasts. The green trails can offer safe and pleasant ways to connect neighborhoods, places to recreate and have fun, and spaces to contemplate and commune with nature. Landscaped and well-kept green ribbons serve as sanctuaries against the onslaught of urban noise and the daily pressures of life in the city. These green trails have the potential to be much-needed ""corridors of tranquility.""\The greenways must offer basic public amenities and conveniences: water fountains, restrooms, rest stops, shelters from unexpected weather changes, and adequate lighting and safety. We must guard against any open opportunities for encroachment of urban distractions and unfriendly sprawl coming too close to these pedestrian corridors. These pleasantly landscaped walkways must stay a people-friendly investment, always inviting and safe. Safeguards must be in place to assure their unique character and designated space. We must preserve these linear parks as valued community assets and find imaginative ways to expand in time this network across the state and beyond. Our ""neighborhood"" must be linked to the rest of the world at many levels and in many ways."

Probably not in politics, either, but we'll\get to that later.\Yet along with X, Black Flag, the Dead Kennedys and other West\Coast punk bands, D.O.A. made it possible for current punks like\Green Day and the Offspring to become millionaires.\Somehow, Keithley's not bitter.

I'm\not going to give that up easily.""\He says that with a chuckle, via telephone from Ontario, but\it's also true. Except for a 20-month breakup in 1990 and '91,\D.O.A. now has trudged along in the commercial shadows for 18\years. The Vancouver, Canada, band has released three discs in the\'90s, the latest being the scorching The Black Spot.\Keithley and company have continued to tour the East and West\coasts and in Europe. But they've been almost invisible everywhere\else, including in standard rock reference books like The Rolling\Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Spin's Alternative Record Guide.\So D.O.A.'s current tour is an attempt ""to reintroduce\ourselves to most of America.""\If punk fans don't know D.O.A., they should.\Lively on arrival\In the late '70s, the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Ramones\started the movement to shake rock 'n' roll from its sorry, bloated\state. In western Canada, Keithley says, most musicians were trying\to emulate light-rockers like Pablo Cruise and Dan Fogelberg.\""We heard the Ramones' record and thought it was really\weird-sounding,"" he says. ""The first time we put it on, we couldn't\discern any differences in the songs. Then we got used to it and\thought it was fun. And we wanted to play.

The\'70s-'80s punks also had a longer- lasting influence.\""When we started out, people who had influence in newspapers,\radio and record companies, etc., had all grown up listening to the\Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin,"" he says.

\
To the editor:
\
I have been terribly disappointed with the biased stories in The Herald-Times about I-69. Andy Ruff has said that unless the questions that have been raised about the funding for I-69 are answered, the road should not be built. Mr. Sarvis, a bureaucrat with INDOT, could not answer any questions raised during the MPO meeting.
\
The highway could have been built using 41 and 70, but for some reason or another building a highway with substandard road surface and building a bridge that is likely to flood farms in the southern part of the state is what the governor and those who want to shave 10 minutes of driving time decided upon. The road will funnel traffic into an already overburdened route 37 in Bloomington.
\
What we truly need is someway for people, not cars, to get from Bloomington to Indianapolis, not an outdated NAFTA highway that will provide low paying jobs. The bully ""Goliath"" was and continues to be INDOT and hopefully ""David,"" little old Bloomington, can withstand the pressure and not cave.

I sometimes wonder just how Bloomington politics have gone so far to the left. I find it unbelievable that some insignificant board with an obvious bias against the interstate coming through Monroe County claims to speak for all of us and openly hopes that our area will somehow defeat the road building that has already begun and will continue to happen until the road is completed.
\
Have the members of this board not seen the dramatic growth of clean industry along I-65 from Indy to Louisville? Do we not need jobs that pay well in this area? What on earth are these people thinking? Come to think of it, just who are the members of this board, and is their myopic view of things really representative of this area?
\
I for one hope the road comes through Monroe County, hooks up Bloomington to both Evansville and Indy by a high-speed interstate. Certainly our local economy could use the boost, and IU would also benefit greatly. Build the highway and build it through Monroe County and the Bloomington area!

It is unfortunate that the H-T editors have resorted to name-calling rather than reading the legal basis for the MPO's exclusion of I-69 in the TIP. If they had, perhaps they might reconsider their short-sighted position. Indiana deserves better than 1950s solutions to 21st century problems.

I attended a few of the INDOT meetings in the earlier days of the I-69 proposal when we first moved to Brown County in 2000. As far as I could tell, there was no ""exchange"" of ideas going on. It was as though INDOT had to follow certain procedures, like informing the public, but the conclusion was foregone. We, as citizens, had no choice.
\
Then Mitch Daniels was elected, and was determined to bring Indiana into the arena of economic powerhouses, first aligning our time zone with New York City, then supporting I-69 at the expense of education in our state. Apparently, big business can improve all our lives.
\
Indiana has more miles of interstate highway per acre than any state in the country. That makes it a great place to pass through on your way to someplace you would like to live. As for me, I was born a Hoosier and will stay one if someone were just listening.

It is a shame that this wastefully expensive project will divert a huge amount of our Indiana Department of Transportation money from more pressing needs like rebuilding crumbling bridges.
\
We have a similar new highway proposal up here in Northwest Indiana, the ""Illiana"", which like I-69 is mostly unfunded and primarily backed by green field developers. As in Monroe County, our local newspaper, the Times, has shamelessly promoted the Illiana highway project, regardless of the facts. Good job, Bloomington/Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization, for having the guts to oppose INDOT for a change! We wish our Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Organization would do the same. INDOT is the worst enabler of sprawl, which is bad for people and for nature.
\
What is it we need for long term sustainability? What do we need when gas is $10/gallon? Investment in rail and mass transit and revitalizing our decaying once grand old cities so they are great places to be is what we need for a sustainable and prosperous future in Indiana.

"
125,"INDIANAPOLIS – An Indiana lawmaker filed a bill Tuesday that would completely ban abortions in Indiana — a measure that threatens to deepen a nasty rift between Republican leaders and social conservatives on the far right.\The ongoing feud has already led conservative activists to protest at the churches of House Republican leadership, question leaders' morals and attack House Speaker Brian Bosma on a recent Facebook post about his mother's death.\In response, Bosma called for civility on the ceremonial start of session, saying he refuses to ""participate in the long spiral to uncivil comment in political life.""\However, the recent social media attacks could signify what's to come during the upcoming legislative session.\""The signs would suggest that things are going to get worse before they get better, even if there has been a call for civility,"" said Robert Dion, a political scientist at the University of Evansville.\An increasingly vocal faction of social conservatives say they feel abandoned by their party's leaders, and upset that more hasn't been done after five years with Republican super majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly.\""I believe a super majority is one of the most dangerous things you can have,"" said Monica Boyer, tea party activist and leader of the Indiana Liberty Coalition. ""Once you have a super majority that doesn't have to be held accountable to their constituents, then the big money, the chamber money, controls and the constituents are forgotten.""\Resistance to the proposed abortion ban is just the latest issue to rile social conservatives.\Last legislative session Republicans passed a 10 cent gas tax increase in order to fund road construction and maintenance. Conservative groups saw the plan as a massive tax hike.\In previous years, social conservatives have watched in disappointment as lawmakers rejected a same-sex marriage ban and scaled back Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\The angst has led to the creation of several new groups, including Hoosiers for Life, the primary organization leading the charge for a total abortion ban. The group has grown 300 percent since its inception about a year ago, according to Executive Director Amy Schlichter.\But the group's uncompromising approach and some of its tactics have divided Indiana's anti-abortion movement, which has traditionally taken a slower, piece-meal approach.\""It does bring about a rift in the life movement and the Republican caucus as well. It puts them in an awkward position,"" said Micah Clark, executive director of the socially conservative American Family Association of Indiana. ""I'm not sure what the pro-life movement can do within the boundaries of the courts that we haven't already done.""\Hoosiers for Life routinely criticizes Bosma and House Public Policy Chairman Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, and last year even distributed Smaltz's personal cell phone number in an email encouraging supporters to call him.\But Schlichter said her group is now being blamed for the actions of others, including protests at Bosma's and Smaltz's churches and the comments on Bosma's Facebook post about his mother's death.\""Saying that I have a responsibility for every person in Indiana that is pro-life is asinine,"" she said. ""They have used these different things to try to discredit us. That was not me. I would never do that to anyone. I am the only spokesperson for our organization.""\One of the comments on Bosma's Facebook post about his mother's death called into question the authenticity of his religious beliefs.\""You want to bury pro-life bills because you think raising taxes is more important. With 'Republicans' like you, who needs Democrats?"" one Facebook user said. ""And stop the religious nonsense. God wants to know what you're going to do about the babies!""\Another user posted a link to the Hoosiers for Life website.\When asked if such behavior from other activists was appropriate, Schlichter declined to say.\""That's not for me to say,"" she said. ""I don't know what God is doing in their life.""\State lawmakers have routinely passed laws in recent years to further restrict abortions. Those restrictions are routinely challenged in federal courts and sometimes struck down as unconstitutional.\""Indiana already leads the way in piloting the ideas of the pro-life movement,"" Dion said. ""Sometimes you wonder how many more restrictions Indiana can pass. But there's always something they dream up.""\The total abortion ban introduced Tuesday by Rep. Curt Nisly, R-Goshen, would almost certainly be found unconstitutional.\The measure, House Bill 1097, is nearly identical to the bill Smaltz refused to hear last year. The proposal would criminalize all forms of abortion and allow prosecutors to file charges against those who participate in the procedure.\The U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade and subsequent decisions have effectively established a woman's right to an abortion before viability of the fetus.\Just last year, for example, a U.S. district court struck down an Indiana law that would have prohibited abortions sought solely because a fetus had been potentially diagnosed with a disability such as Down syndrome.\But with a Republican in the White House and new appointments to federal courts, many conservatives believe now is the time to test Roe v.

128,"
INDIANAPOLIS -- Republican state Reps. Tim Neese of Elkhart and Mary Kay Budak of LaPorte both voted for the Indiana Toll Road lease against strong constituent opposition.
\
But the lease is a central campaign issue only in Neese's primary election contest, where his challenger is counting on the issue to carry him to victory.
\
""Basically it's a referendum on the Toll Road and the way Gov. (Mitch) Daniels has tried to push this thing through,"" Lorell D. Nihart says.
\
Neese disagrees about the issue's centrality. But he acknowledges continued public sentiment against the lease, even though his personal contacts seem to ease people's concerns.
\
""I do have an obstacle,"" he said, ""there's no doubt about it. And I'm taking that very serious.""
\
Budak faces a different issue: Is she pro-business enough for her northwest Indiana district and for downstate business interests that are backing her opponent?
\
No, according to challenger Tom Dermody and the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, which cites Budak's 62 percent career rating on Chamber issues.
\
""It ranks dead last among all current 52 House Republicans,"" said Michael R. Davis, the Chamber's vice president for political affairs.
\
Budak, who hasn't faced primary opposition since 1982, acknowledges she's in a tough fight. But she says poll results look good and her reception is warm as she goes door to door.
\
""I haven't (done that) for a while,"" she says, ""but when you're in a tough primary, honey, you do that.""
\
Neese vs. Nihart
\
Like lots of northern Indiana Republicans, Neese sweated his vote for the Toll Road lease before he cast it.
\
But he maintains it was the right public policy move, if not the smartest political vote.
\
Understandably, it's not the main message of his campaign.
\
""The message is that politicians and government have to start thinking outside of the box,"" he said, ""and not be so quick to look at increasing taxes to solve the problems that exist in government.""
\
But even that message comes back to Major Moves, as Daniels calls his transportation funding plan that includes the Toll Road lease.
\
Neese says the $3.8 billion lease will pay for statewide road and highway projects without a tax increase, while generating thousands of construction jobs.
\
Neese acknowledges that private toll road operators will raise tolls throughout the 75-year lease, but he calls that a user fee that's different from a tax.
\
Some of his campaign literature -- mailed and paid for by the House Republican Campaign Committee -- attacks Nihart's support for higher gasoline taxes as an alternative to the lease.
\
""Norell Nihart's gas tax scheme will have Hoosiers running on empty,"" the mailing says.
\
Nonsense, according to Nihart, who said a 5-cent tax increase would generate $165 million per year for needed road and bridge projects. But the real prize would be continued state control of a vital asset that still performs well financially.
\
Nihart, whose campaign is largely self-financed, says he cannot gauge the election's outcome. But he is convinced that general dissatisfaction with Daniels -- from Major Moves to license branch closures to daylight-saving time -- may bleed Neese's support even among the party faithful.
\
""Any Republican trying to beat an incumbent Republican is very hard,"" he says, ""and I knew that going in. But I feel strong enough about it, (and) I think enough people feel that way that maybe Republican voters will send a message that ... 'Hey, we're tired of it now.'""
\
Neese's incumbent edge cannot be discounted in a low-turnout environment of a typical primary election.
\
He is one of three challenged Republicans with financial backing from the House campaign committee, and he's won endorsements from Indiana Farm Bureau, Indiana Chamber of Commerce and both pro-union (teachers) and anti-union groups (National Right to Work Foundation).
\
Ultimately, though, Neese says the election will turn on constituent service and his general message that smarter government beats higher taxes.
\
""Elections by design are about ideas and stating positions,"" he said. ""So I don't see this election as any different, although clearly the Toll Road issue is a very significant issue.""
\
Budak vs. Dermody
\
Budak's been in office for 26 years, long enough to establish a reputation as a forceful advocate for children's issues and for public schools.
\
""She has been probably the legislator most focused on children's issues that we deal with,"" said Nancy Papas, a spokeswoman for the political arm of the Indiana State Teachers Association.
\
Dermody says he's grateful. But he also says LaPorte and Pulaski counties need more forceful representation in Indianapolis and a more visible presence inside House District 20.
\
""People say, 'I want to have somebody that's accessible and available, and that's around and is listening,'"" Dermody said.
\
He also promises more attention to business development that can generate needed tax revenues. ""I don't want to raise taxes,"" he said. ""I want to generate revenue, and we have to be more aggressive.""
\
According to Daniels and other Republican leaders, the Toll Road lease is an aggressive stab at economic development. And there is no question that Budak risked her career by voting for it.
\
""I had to do a lot of soul-searching in order to do that vote,"" she said, adding, ""I only did it for the good of my community.""
\
But Dermody says the community didn't benefit enough from a promised $40 million distribution to LaPorte County and a handful of highway projects.
\
Dermody won't say that Daniels was wrong for limiting northern Indiana's share. But he says stronger local representation would have produced better results.
\
Based on her Toll Road vote and incumbency, Budak is endorsed by House Republican leaders and Daniels, who appeared with her at a recent fund-raiser.
\
But Dermody has significant endorsements, too, and name recognition as a four-year member of the LaPorte School Board.
\
Based on those factors and a general mood of voter discontent this year, the Howey Political Report gives Dermody the edge.
\
But Budak's 26 years of constituent service cannot be discounted, either, and both candidates will likely have to work for votes until the polls close.
\
""I know I have the heartbeat of my district,"" Budak said. ""Now, I will say, a lot of them are still angry about Major Moves, but that's kind of been dying down the last couple of weeks.""

130,"In a huge upset against two well-established names in Indiana Republican politics, wealthy businessman Mike Braun won Indiana's high-stakes GOP Senate primary.\Braun, who fueled his bid with millions of dollars of his own money, defeated U.S. Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita in what has been called the nation's nastiest and most expensive U.S. Senate primary.\The Associated Press called the race at 8:48 p.m., with Braun garnering 41 percent of the vote and Messer and Rokita receiving about 29.5 percent each.\The results represent a stunning rebuke of two sitting congressmen and a powerful indicator that the anti-establishment sentiment remains strong among Hoosier Republicans who helped catapult Donald Trump into the White House two years ago.\Braun, a former state lawmaker and owner of a national distributor of auto parts, painted himself as an outsider with real world experience who could shake up Washington. He entered the race in August after Messer and Rokita had already spent months attacking each other.\At a victory party at a brewery in Whitestown, Braun told supporters that the race came down to whether people were happy with business as usual. He called politicians who come from the private sector the ""new dynamic we need in Washington.""\Braun will now face Sen. Joe Donnelly, who is widely considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the November election. The race will be one of a handful that determine which party controls the Senate next year.\Braun will have little time to relish Tuesday's victory. Democrats already are planning to attack him with advertisements highlighting his GOP opponents' criticisms throughout the primary. But he'll also get plenty of reinforcements. Trump will visit Elkhart on Thursday to rally Republicans behind Braun, and national GOP groups are expected to pummel the state with advertising on Braun's behalf.\Throughout the campaign, Braun argued that Messer and Rokita were nearly indistinguishable career politicians. In one of the campaign's most memorable advertisements, he carried cardboard cutouts of his opponents around his hometown of Jasper, where voters struggled to tell them apart.\But as he surged, Rokita and Messer highlighted his routine voting in Democratic primaries in the past and his support last year for a gas tax increase to pay for roads.\Those efforts either came too late or didn't resonate strongly with voters.\Much of the campaign's vitriol was fueled by Rokita, who embraced Trump's brash rhetorical style and often used derogatory nicknames to refer to his opponents. His campaign even authored a children's book in the style of Dr. Seuss to attack Messer for residing in Washington, D.C. His style rubbed some voters and many Indiana GOP establishment figures the wrong way.\Messer, on the other hand, tried to rise above the fray early in the campaign, but was quickly dragged into the pattern of attacks and counterattacks that came to define the race. He was the darling of Indiana's Republican establishment, but it became clear Tuesday night that wasn't necessarily an asset. He also holds the fifth-ranking leadership position among Republicans in the U.S. House.\""Politics sometimes offers life lessons,"" Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said on Twitter. ""Todd Rokita and Luke Messer had a college rivalry that continued all the way to tonight's #INsen primary. Now they've destroyed each other's chances, allowing a third candidate to win. Better for pols to bury the hatchet — but not in each other.""\With the primary behind them, Republicans are hoping that the negativity of the race doesn't hurt Braun. While he entered the race after his opponents, scrutiny increased as he outspent his opponents and came to be viewed as the frontrunner.\A recent IndyStar story, for example, found that during his brief time in the legislature, he pushed several pieces of legislation that could have benefited his private timberland holdings, which are among the largest in the state.\And stories by the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette and the Associated Press have raised questions about his distribution and logistics business practices, including his use of government subsidies, the importing of auto parts from overseas, lawsuits from employees who say they were underpaid or otherwise mistreated and dozens of trucking safety violations.\But ultimately, Republican voters chose an outsider with business experience over two competitors with longer tenures in government and politics. The question is whether hard feelings from the race will linger and depress Republican enthusiasm in November.\Rokita, in a concession speech at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, congratulated Braun, but did little to encourage his supporters to get behind the party's nominee.\""Not every fight is fair. Not every candidate can stroke a personal $6 million check. That's life,"" he said. ""The result tonight was different than we had hoped, but I will continue to fight for you.""\His supporters, too, had trouble ginning up enthusiasm for Braun.\""Am I going to go out and work on this race? No, I'm not going to do that,"" said Indianapolis City-County Council Republican Janice McHenry. ""For Todd, I would have.""\Still, party leaders expressed enthusiasm about Braun's nomination. Vice President Mike Pence, who maintains a major influence in the Indiana GOP, called to congratulate Braun, and Gov. Eric Holcomb texted him from a trade mission to Israel.\""It's been a hard-fought primary, with three great candidates putting their names forward,"" Indiana Republican Party Chairman Kyle Hupfer said, ""but it's now time for Hoosier Republicans to come together and work as one team to defeat Democrat Joe Donnelly and give Hoosiers another conservative voice in the U.S. Senate.""\Democrats, however, plan to continue pounding Braun. American Bridge, a Democratic Super PAC, released a new ad within moments of Braun's victory. It features video of Rokita and Messer accusing him of buying a Senate seat and asserting that voters should not trust him.\David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Braun ""emerges tonight badly damaged from one of the most divisive primaries in the country.""\""With no more childish primary antics to hide behind, Rep. Braun will be forced to run on his record of self-dealing and using the power of the Statehouse to enrich himself — like when he carved out a tax break for himself while repeatedly raising taxes on Hoosiers — and voters will hold him accountable in November,"" he said.\Braun's victory also neutralizes to some extent Republicans' relentless attacks on Donnelly for having owned stock in his brother's company, which outsources some of its labor to Mexico. The National Republican Senatorial Committee even hired a mariachi band to appear at one Donnelly campaign event last year.\Braun's company, Meyer Distributing, also imports auto parts from factories abroad, which Democrats argue could be produced in Indiana.\But even with the advantages of incumbency, Donnelly will face a challenging environment in a state that voted for Trump by a 19-point margin in 2016.\On Tuesday night, Donnelly acknowledged the attacks on Braun during the primary — including his past voting in Democratic primaries — but said he stayed ""focused on my job"" as the Republicans battled each other.\""I know there was a lot of back and forth on the other side,"" Donnelly told reporters. ""But I think it's a lot more important what you're going to do on health care than how you voted eight years ago.""\IndyStar reporters Vic Ryckaert, Emma Kate Fittes, Tim Evans, Marisa Kwiatkowski and James Briggs contributed to this story.\Inside\Delph wins, but other GOP legislators fall short, 3A\Hamilton County results may mean more money for projects, 3A\Forestal, Durham advance in Marion County race, 3A\Pence wins GOP race for 6th District seat, 5A\CAPTION: \Supporters hold signs and cheer as Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun, winner of Indiana's GOP primary, takes the stage at his election night party at Moontown Brewing Company in Whitestown on Tuesday.\Jenna Watson/IndyStar"
131,"It began with two congressmen slugging it out. It could end with neither of them winning.\After enduring the nastiest and most expensive primary in the country, Republican voters will decide Tuesday whom they want to run against Sen. Joe Donnelly in the November election.\The stakes are high: Donnelly is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, given his status as the party's only statewide officeholder in a state that President Donald Trump won by a wide margin in 2016. Republicans across the country will be gunning for him in an effort to maintain their slim majority in the Senate.\But the urgency of the race has taken a toll in the primary, which effectively began nearly a year ago with U.S. Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita — old Wabash College classmates — launching attacks and counterattacks.\Rokita slammed Messer for living with his family in the Washington, D.C., suburbs and for his wife's lucrative contract with an Indianapolis suburb. Messer returned fire, calling his opponent ""unhinged"" and dubbing him ""Temper Tantrum Todd.""\And those were just the opening salvos.\Soon, reports of Rokita's harsh treatment of his staff emerged, including an eight-page memo painstakingly detailing instructions for his driver that included carrying the congressman's toothbrush.\The constant barrage of attacks opened a path for the race's third contender, wealthy businessman and former state Rep. Mike Braun.

It could end with neither of them winning.\After enduring the nastiest and most expensive primary in the country, Republican voters will decide Tuesday whom they want to run against Sen. Joe Donnelly in the November election.\The stakes are high: Donnelly is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, given his status as the party's only statewide officeholder in a state that President Donald Trump won by a wide margin in 2016. Republicans across the country will be gunning for him in an effort to maintain their slim majority in the Senate.\But the urgency of the race has taken a toll in the primary, which effectively began nearly a year ago with U.S. Reps.

Messer returned fire, calling his opponent ""unhinged"" and dubbing him ""Temper Tantrum Todd.""\And those were just the opening salvos.\Soon, reports of Rokita's harsh treatment of his staff emerged, including an eight-page memo painstakingly detailing instructions for his driver that included carrying the congressman's toothbrush.\The constant barrage of attacks opened a path for the race's third contender, wealthy businessman and former state Rep.

133,"I'm not good at saying ""no"" to children in need. I'm even worse at turning away kids who desperately need help. Unfortunately, I'm getting a lot of practice at both.\Each day, my staff and I have to turn away about 20 kids who need foster homes. Twenty kids: each with a name, a pair of bright eyes, a favorite toy or book and a crisis -- turned away because we don't have enough foster parents.\This isn't just a Damar Foster Care Services problem; this is an Indiana problem. With 23,000 kids in the foster care system -- up from 13,000 just five years ago -- Indiana desperately needs foster parents. May is National Foster Care Month, so we're shining a light on the problem now.\The good news? You or someone you know can join the dozens of Indiana families already working with Damar Foster Care Services to provide safe environments to children until crises are resolved and, we hope, they reunite with their families or are adopted.\While you might know Damar Services as one of the state's leading providers of services to children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, you might not know that Damar Foster Care Services provides services for all children, of all ages, in need of foster and adoptive families, regardless of abilities or disabilities. And you can be a part of those services.\Before you think, ""But I don't know how to be a foster parent,"" let me reassure you: We'll give you all the support you need to become a successful foster parent. We'll walk you through the application process, provide you one-on-one training, and give you access to professional case managers 24 hours a day, every day. What kind of person do we need? Here's what we know about foster parents: Most are big-hearted, strong-willed people with a passion for helping kids. Some of them feel a spiritual or even religious ""calling"" to be foster parents. They provide homes where hugs and rules coexist in harmony.\My guess is that those qualities resonate with some of you, or they remind you of someone you know. If so, let us know. No one reading this is going to help all 20 kids I'll have to turn away today. But maybe you, or that someone you know, can help just one of those kids -- and provide the promise of a better day.\Learn more by visiting damar.org.\Guenevere Kalal\Director,\Damar Foster Care Services\Daniels should be above disrespectful discourse\I read Mitch Daniels' op-ed in the May 10 edition of IndyStar, and I cannot turn the other cheek. The tone was very disturbing. It was petty, condescending and extremely mean-spirited. In fact, it was downright Trumpian.\If Daniels felt that the writers of the two letters that he referenced were wrong, and had mistakenly slighted him or his administration, then he had every right to express that -- just like they had the right to express their opinions. And that's all it was, two people's opinions. And I think everyone is willing to accept his Indiana infrastructure statistics as fact and not ""alternative facts,"" like the current administration in Washington seems to be fond of. But the very first sentence of your ""Guest Column"" was: ""An outbreak of amnesia seems to have descended on our western suburbs."" Congratulations, you're snarky and out of line from the get-go. But a few sentences later you top that with: ""I don't know what state or planet these gentlemen inhabited the last decade.""\Really, Mr. Daniels? You've been a successful state governor, currently president of a world-renowned university and that's what comes out of your brain? Extremely mean-spirited.\The third paragraph of Daniels' column begins: ""If, from their perches in prosperous Zionsville and Plainfield ..."" That is the second time that he referenced the two letter writers' geographical locations. The only reason to do that is if it was meant as a slam. Does he think that everyone in Zionsville and Plainfield agrees with these two gentlemen? Does he realize that he just dissed two fine Indianapolis suburbs? What does citing their locations accomplish? Nothing. What would it accomplish if I said "" here goes Daniels spouting off from his college president ivory tower?"" Again nothing. So why even include that? It serves no purpose, other than making Daniels look bad.\Daniels finishes his piece by insinuating that both letter writers were either intentionally being dishonest or were ""merely ignorant."" That is disgraceful. Does he think that it's OK to say things like that? To say that someone is either a liar or stupid? Daniels is suppose to be a role model. That is certainly not six paragraphs to be proud of. Insults, name-calling and mean-spirited sarcasm were not needed to make his points. Mr. Daniels, the people of Indiana expect better, and they deserve better. We expect you to be above this type of uncivil and disrespectful discourse. Apparently that's too much to ask.\Randy Mason\Franklin\Marsh employees have become family\David R. Livingston, a supermarket research analyst in referring to the closing of Indianapolis Marsh stores was quoted in the May 10 IndyStar as saying, ""if they close, really no one is going to notice too much because for all practical purposes, those stores have been closed now for a few years.""\Tell that to the nonstop flow of customers who continually shop at the Lockerbie Marsh store on New Jersey Street. With its superb butcher department, to its freshly maintained deli to its now-closed knowledgeable and skilled pharmacy, the shopping experience at this store was (and is) consistently high quality. Without exception, the staff is courteous, friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to assist the shopper. The store also has a long-standing record of employing those with special needs and to those of us who frequent the store, they have become part of the community of that store. When shopping at this store, one will see a diverse intergenerational population and a mix of socioeconomic backgrounds.\As a customer in this store for over a decade, this Marsh store is a stunning exception to his attribution that ""the Marsh stores have been looking bad and that customers have started going elsewhere."" I'm happy to spend a few extra seconds finding a parking spot and tracking down a shopping cart. It's my pleasure.\Barbara L. Wolf\Indianapolis\Ruling clarifies interaction of police, gun owners\On Monday, the Indiana Supreme Court issued its much-anticipated ruling in Thomas Pinner v. State, which addresses the issue of whether police officers may detain and question a person based only on a report that the individual has a gun. In agreeing with the Indiana Court of Appeals' decision handed down in August, the Supreme Court ruled that officers violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures when they detained and questioned Pinner after a taxi driver called 911 to report that Pinner had dropped a handgun when exiting a cab at a movie theater.\Under rules announced by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1968 case of Terry v. Ohio, a police officer may briefly detain and question a person if the officer has a ""reasonable articulable suspicion"" that the person is engaged in criminal activity (or in the words of SCOTUS, ""that criminal activity is afoot""). If the officer also has a reasonable suspicion that the person ""may be armed and dangerous,"" the officer may conduct a brief pat-down of the person's outer clothing to check for weapons. Together, this process is called ""stop and frisk"" or a ""Terry stop.""\Before the Indiana Supreme Court's ruling on Monday, there has been a long-standing debate in Indiana. On one side, many police officers and prosecutors have argued that a Terry stop is justified based on a report that a person is carrying a gun -- or an officer's own observation that the person has a handgun -- because the officer has a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person is carrying a handgun illegally until the officer confirms that the person has a handgun license. Defense attorneys and Second Amendment advocates have countered that the mere possession of a handgun, without some additional indication that such possession is illegal, does not justify the detention of the individual to investigate -- much like police are not allowed to randomly stop vehicles to confirm that a motorist has a driver's license.\In Monday's opinion, the court ruled that a police officer, based only on a tip that a person possesses a handgun, may not detain that person to confirm that he has a license to carry. Through its holding, the Supreme Court not only ended a long-standing debate, it completely destroyed one of the central arguments against Constitutional Carry in Indiana, which would end the requirement that law-abiding citizens obtain a License to Carry Handgun in order to possess a handgun in public or in a vehicle.\Some law enforcement officials have argued that the removal of Indiana's handgun licensing requirement would inhibit police officers' ability to investigate the legality of a person's possession of a gun. In the words of the Indiana Sheriff's Association, Constitutional Carry ""would negatively impact efforts to investigate individuals and determine if they are armed or not."" However, this argument has now totally evaporated, as the Supreme Court has ruled unequivocally that police officers may not ""investigate individuals"" by detaining them for questioning or conducting a ""stop and frisk"" based only on a report that the person is in possession of a firearm. As a result, it is hard to imagine a situation where Indiana's current licensing requirement would empower officers ""to investigate individuals to determine if they are armed or not"" -- absent a separate basis to believe a person is engaged in criminal activity, which would then justify a Terry stop in any event.\The Supreme Court's ruling constitutes a clear victory for the Constitutional rights of Indiana gun owners and provides needed clarity on the subject of law enforcement's interaction with armed Hoosiers. The decision also greatly enhances the arguments in favor of Constitutional Carry -- by completely eradicating one of the most vigorously asserted arguments against it.\Guy Relford\Carmel\General Assembly ruled by dollars, not voters\Late last month, your Indiana General Assembly voted to impose the largest gasoline tax hike in state history, right along with a mishmash of future tolls and license branch fee increases.\On the very same day, a majority of those exact same lawmakers voted to cut taxes for casinos. Let that fact sink in for second. As you prepared to pay more, casino owners in Las Vegas still figured out how to get a tax cut.\If you think we need a 10-cent gas tax hike for roads, some agree. With over $2 billion of your tax dollars already sitting in the state's bank, I would have done things differently, especially while big corporations and banks are seeing their taxes go down. But the votes are recorded, and people will judge the outcome. I hope for a good one.\However, many raised taxes with one hand while petting special interests with the other.\Earlier in the session, of course, the very first special interest served their own.\In the age of computerized redistricting, Republican majorities essentially have been choosing their own constituents with the help of tech wizards and political data. A simple and extremely popular bill would have ended the practice of politicians mapping out their own legislative districts.\After hopeful pronouncements and impassioned pleas from common-sense citizens, a single chairman took care of his partners and threw the bill in the trash. If you think our state legislature is losing its sense of proportion, you might be on to something. Intoxicated with power, too many have grown comfortably numb to how many constituents view their work.\For instance, during a tense few weeks in March and April, the Statehouse was in a tizzy. Closed-door meetings ensued. Tempers flared. Pronouncements were shouted.\A casual observer surely would have concluded that a momentous calamity was upon us. Perhaps the health care of our citizens was at stake? Or wages were falling behind inflation? Or Indiana's counties were losing population at an alarming rate?\Such an onlooker would have been wrong. Instead, it turns out that an unpopular gentleman was caught legally selling cold beer. Not just beer, mind you. Cold beer.\Millionaires on both sides hired other millionaires to make their case. With all that was spent on arm-twisting, one would think they all could have afforded to sue each other in court. Instead, they prodded every lawmaker they could corner between the elevator and the entrance.\There is nothing new about people pressing their case or supporting candidates and politicians who agree with them. It has been going on since elections were held and legislatures were built. More often than not, watchful media and self-policing between the two major parties have kept public decisions close to the public interest.\However, the era of one-party rule in Indianapolis has diminished restraints that once existed. Moreover, electoral successes can create an air of invincibility and selfish justification that leads to sloppy excess.\For instance, much of this session was dedicated to the reform of Indiana's ""vape shop"" regulations. Regrettably, this ""reform"" was necessitated by the previous year's brazen sneakiness, in which the legislature -- without public hearing -- created a favored monopoly to lord over the vaping industry.\And once again, monopolies did quite well this session. Seeing a threat to their only-game-in-town status, Indiana's utilities succeeded in choking off our solar panel industry in its bassinet. I heard from no one who worried that meddlesome solar enthusiasts were threatening Western Civilization, but it seems they upset someone important.\These cookies were baked beneath more transcendent pyramid schemes such as the profiteering of education, fee-raising toll road leases, out-of-state contractors, and private prisons-for-hire. On these matters, we can keep agreeing to disagree.\Whenever you are raising people's taxes, you had better be on your best behavior. The 2017 session of the Indiana General Assembly was not.\Scott Pelath\Indiana House Democratic Leader (Michigan City)\Purdue students should focus on unity, diversity\I am writing my own letter to Occupy Purdue.\I had hoped Indiana universities would not fall victim to the extreme left bully tactics we see on campuses like University of California, Berkeley.

His response seemed more than adequate.\If there is a ""series of racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic incidents"" taking place, then address those particular acts of the perpetrators.\Focus your energy on building a diverse community within the student body. Attacking the administration is a waste of time and energy. Bring students together for discussion and support, don't separate by group and play identity politics games. That will tear down the house.\And please -- study hard. This country needs strong minds who can reason, communicate and compromise. I will be praying for a cooperative spirit on Purdue's campus.\Stacia Belanger\Carmel\LETTERS TO THE EDITOR"
134,"DETROIT -- California has taken on the Motor City in a quest to clear its smoggy air.\Along the way the Golden State wants to get cleaner engines in every new vehicle in the country and spare the planet from the threat of global warming. While it all sounds doable -- and expensive -- the action is driving the automobile industry toward a controversial reckoning.\Auto executives insist they will square off in court before letting California impose rules that could drive up prices and depress sales of trucks, Detroit's only source of profits.\What happens has a bearing not only on Indiana drivers -- and the air around them -- but also the state's six truck assembly lines and the array of factories making parts for them.\It's too early to say how matters will sort out, but auto executives contend the effort under way in California could harm the truck market.\""It's another example of the regulatory climate in California that is not in the interest of our customers,"" said Richard Wagoner Jr., chief executive of General Motors Corp.\Detroit versus California\Detroit against California is just the latest round in a national debate over fuel economy.\Just last winter, the powerful automobile lobby fended off an effort to raise federal fuel standards on light trucks -- minivans, vans, pickups, sport-utility vehicles. Green groups such as the San Francisco-based Sierra Club had recommended that Congress close the so-called SUV loophole.\When Congress ordered conservation measures during a 1970s energy crisis, trucks were allowed lower fuel-economy standards because they were regarded as work vehicles. But stricter mileage rules were set for cars.\As cars became lighter and more fuel-efficient, sales of the larger trucks boomed, especially when the plusher 1990s sport-utilities appeared.\Last winter, environmentalists again sought tougher rules to save fuel. Congress left the 20.7-miles-per-gallon truck standard in place, however, while passing a new energy conservation bill.\Undeterred, environmentalists moved the fight to California and found more success by framing the issue as greenhouse gas.\Urged on by activists, California's General Assembly narrowly passed a global warming bill in July. Under provisions of the bill, new autos put on California roads after 2008 must reduce tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide, a so-called greenhouse gas regarded as a cause of global warming. Commercial vehicles are excluded from the new rule.\Gov. Gray Davis signed the bill, satisfying millions of Californians in smoggy cities who sensed that less greenhouse gas meant less smog. Both form when an engine burns fuel, although carbon dioxide, unlike smog, isn't a pollutant.\Carbon dioxide is a clear, odorless gas essential to life on the planet. What has worried scientists, though, is the increasing level of carbon dioxide. The invisible blanket is thought to trap the sun's heat near the ground, much like a greenhouse.\The warming trend\According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the last decade of the 20th century was the warmest ever recorded. Six of those 10 years set average temperature records. All 10 ranked among the 15 warmest years on record.\The dozen months since August 2001 collectively were the driest ever measured in the United States.\By July, half the states had moderate to severe drought. Globally, July was the warmest on record since 1880.\Overseas, rising temperatures have made global warming a front-burner issue.\Representatives from dozens of nations convened a 1997 global warming conference at Kyoto, Japan.\Japan and the European Union this year signed the Kyoto treaty, which requires steady reductions of their greenhouse gas.\However, President Bush's administration has pulled the United States out of the Kyoto discussions, citing economic objections.\The White House contends the 36 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions required of the United States would slow U.S. industry. Meanwhile, China and developing nations could step up output under the treaty.\Trailblazing bill\Although California's 24 million cars and trucks account for only a slice of the world's greenhouse gas, it's the first state to pass a global warming bill.\Auto executives responded adamantly: States shouldn't set rules on national industries regulated by federal agencies.\""We can't have 50 different states telling Detroit how to build vehicles. We can't operate our business like that,"" said Donn Walker, a GM spokesman in California.\General Motors and DaimlerChrysler AG said they will fight California in court to dismantle the law.\""We can't go in the opposite direction of our customers,"" said Robert Lutz, head of GM's North American operations. ""With gas at $1.20 a gallon, they should be forgiven for buying Lincoln Navigators and Hummer H2s.""\Ford Motor Co., however, has refused to join the lawsuit.\""One of the things we have to do is settle things down,"" said William Ford, chairman of Ford Motor.\The Dearborn automaker has no plans to immediately satisfy green groups by quickly incorporating fuel-saving technologies into its California fleet.\William Ford, however, has taken a role as Detroit's most environmentally sensitive auto executive. He said there's still room for discussion.\Ford's position leads automotive analyst Thad Malesh to expect a compromise outside the courtroom.\""You have two of the Big Three with divergent opinions. That alone should create an environment where they all need to sit down and talk this through,"" said Malesh, an engine analyst for market researcher J.D. Power and Associates of Agoura Hills, Calif.\What's next\Because auto companies are unlikely to make an advanced engine for only one state, a new set of engines could appear for the entire country.\""Potentially, if we do go forward in California, it would tip the balance toward more fuel- efficient vehicles,"" Malesh said. ""Consumers absolutely want to do this.""\What rankles Detroit, though, is the open-ended new law in California.\Nothing specifies how much emissions must be cut. That decision is left to California's Air Resources Board.\The law gives the agency until 2006 to set the rule. Then the auto companies have three years to come up with the appropriate technology.\Activists sense an opportunity to upgrade engines in those three years.\Although new technology would raise vehicle prices, activists say consumers would save money on gas.\""I think we could save a third of the fuel that already goes into cars and trucks by using the technology the companies already have on the shelf,"" said Sierra Club spokesman Dan Becker.\Among the items available are:\* Tires with low rolling resistance.\* Electronic controls that shut down half the cylinders in an engine at freeway speed.\* Systems that burn fuel more completely.\* Insulation on fuel lines.\* Continuously variable transmissions.\* Hybrid electric systems that use a small gas engine to back up the primary electric motor.\""You're going to see more creative combinations of technology,"" Malesh predicted. ""It doesn't have to be exotic. But it will give consumers choices.""\Hybrid solution?\Since the truck craze gripped America, few drivers have demanded gas-sipping little cars. Millions prefer light trucks, which burn more gasoline and consequently exhaust more chemicals into the air.\While truck engines are cleaner than they were a decade ago, there are so many more trucks that emission volumes haven't been sharply reduced.\And in a nation where gas is relatively cheap, fuel economy hasn't been high on the priority list of most drivers, said GM's Lutz.\That presents Detroit with a dilemma. If California's global warming bill pushes Detroit to ""greener"" engines, how does the industry convince consumers the higher cost of advanced engines is worth the extra money?\""The only answer is to bring energy prices to the level where the marketplace will make the right decision,"" Lutz said.\But in the absence of a federally imposed gas tax, Detroit might have to scramble to improve fuel economy for California's global warming bill.\One potential solution -- perhaps the most immediate at hand -- is the hybrid electric, which relies on a powerful electric motor backed by a small gas engine.\Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Co. already have two hybrid-electric sedans on the market able to go more than 50 miles on a gallon of gas.\Detroit's automakers are planning similar versions. The problem is cost. Honda and Toyota subsidize their hybrids to lower the price of what is essentially a slow-selling vehicle with two powerplants.\From Detroit's standpoint, gearing up a major hybrid campaign able to put the technology in millions of autos carries risks.\The automakers could shell out money on the technology. But what if consumers, who haven't shown much concern about higher mileage, are indifferent?\""If hybrid technology isn't accepted by customers, it's going to send us back to scratch our heads and ask, 'What do we do next?' "" Ford said.\The answer, he insists, is to sit down with California and figure out what to do.\Call Ted Evanoff at 1-313-417-9215.\*******************************************\A climate of controversy\California, in its quest for cleaner air, has placed itself in direct conflict with Detroit by passing a bill that would mandate higher fuel-economy standards after 2008.

135,"All of the U.S. House seats are up for grabs this year, and three are vying for the District 2 spot.\District 2, which covers north-central Indiana, represents Carroll County and part of White County in the Lafayette area.\Democrat Joe Donnelly is seeking re-election. He's being challenged by Republican Jackie Walorski and Libertarian Mark Vogel.\Here are takes from the other two candidates on a variety of issues facing Congress.\Editor's note: Vogel did not respond to repeated requests to participate in the survey.\1. In one sentence, tell why you are running for this office.\Donnelly: I'm running to be an independent advocate for job creation and economic growth in Indiana and to fight to preserve the livelihoods of all Hoosier working families and opportunities for their children.\Walorski: I believe government spending is out of control and that the economy is headed in the wrong direction. As a state representative, I have been part of the team that has turned Indiana around. My goal in Congress is to cut spending, create private sector jobs and defund the health care appropriation before the tax increases take effect.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\2. Name the two top priorities you would have in office? And how would you get those done?\Donnelly: Grow the Indiana economy by rewarding entrepreneurs who invest and take risks to protect and create quality jobs that cannot be outsourced. And cut federal deficits by reducing spending and utilizing proven budget tools that have helped successfully balance our budgets before.\Walorski: I want to create the environment where private sector jobs can thrive, i.e. back off unfair and unnecessary regulations and over taxation of small business. I also want to defund the Obama health care takeover and replace it with policies that address tort reform and portability.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\3. Give two things that separate you from your opponent.\Donnelly: I am 100 percent opposed to risky schemes that would undermine Social Security by privatizing it or gambling seniors' guaranteed benefits on Wall Street. And I am opposed to unfair trade agreements and corporate tax loopholes that ship Hoosier jobs overseas.\Walorski: I am a tax cutter with a voting record to back it up, and he is a tax spender. I have supported job ""creator"" legislation, he has supported and continues to support job-killing legislation.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\4. Deficit - What one specific action do you believe Congress should take to reduce or control the federal deficit? How will you get that done?\Donnelly: Reduce spending. I have already voted against $220 billion in new federal spending. I also support legislation to set strict limits on new spending that would cut spending by an additional $400 billion. And I support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that would balance budgets by 2020.\Walorski: Congress should freeze discretionary spending, audit every department and then cut where there is excess. I will file the bill that requires it.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\5. Job creation/stimulus - Would you have voted (or did you vote) for federal stimulus plans approved in Congress over the past two years? Why or why not?\Donnelly: I voted for the Recovery Act because we were on the verge of a second Great Depression threatening to wreck working families and businesses and inaction was not an option. The Recovery Act also cut taxes for 95 percent of Hoosiers.\Walorski: I would not have voted for bailouts. This nation is headed for $14 trillion of debt, nearly overtaking the GDP of the entire country. This concept was sold as a job ""creator"" and it has not produced private sector jobs. We need to cut taxes in this country and bail out the taxpayer.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\6. What's one thing you would do in office to promote job creation and stimulate the economy in your district? How would you get that done?\Donnelly: Oppose unfair trade agreements and tax loopholes that offshore Hoosier jobs. I will continue to oppose NAFTA-style ""free trade"" agreements that let other countries benefit at our expense. And I have already helped close some loopholes that encouraged big corporations to ship jobs overseas with $10 billion of your money.\Walorski: I would start by defunding the Obama health care takeover and taking needless and heavy handed regulations off of our small business employers. I would fight against job-killing legislation like card check and cap and trade. If we don't create a stable climate, employers are not going to invest in hiring, acquiring or research and development.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\7. War- Rate President Obama's plan on Afghanistan, on a scale from A to F. What, if anything, should be done differently in the next year?\Donnelly: With Hoosiers fighting in Afghanistan right now, I believe an ""A to F"" rating is not the most helpful way to assess what is a very complicated and important mission. But I will always back our troops and their families and see that they have every resource they need.\Walorski: I would give him a C. We need a more clearly defined mission and we need to provide our troops with the tools they need to succeed.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\8. Health care - Would you have voted for or against the health care legislation passed by Congress? Why or why not? If not, what other action would you propose for controlling health care costs?\Donnelly: I voted for the law because it ends some of the most abusive practices by private health insurance companies, closes the Medicare prescription drug ""donut hole,"" strengthens Medicare for current and future seniors, covers those previously denied because of pre-existing conditions and not a cent can be used for abortions.\Walorski: No, I would not have supported it and will lead the effort to defund it. I would suggest tort reform, purchasing power across state lines, transparency of pricing, and allowing competition to drive down costs.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\9. Immigration - Name two things the federal government can do to address questions with illegal immigration. How would you get those done?\Donnelly: First, I am opposed to any form of amnesty that would reward illegal immigrants with American citizenship. Second, we must devote more resources to border security, and I have helped increase Border Patrol funding by 23 percent and hire 5,300 new border agents, and I support hiring another 6,000 border agents.\Walorski: We need to eliminate the option of ""amnesty."" Until the federal government takes decisive action, the states should be allowed to invoke their sovereignty under the 10th Amendment.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\10. Social Security - What's the first thing Congress should do to address questions about the Social Security system's long-term viability?\Donnelly: We must recommit to Social Security's bedrock principle: no risk. We should scrap any talk of privatizing Social Security and instead consider what's already proven successful: a bipartisan commission in the 1980s successfully acted to strengthen Social Security and I would support creating such a commission now.\Walorski: For the first time in nearly 30 years, Social Security is running a deficit this year. With hundreds of thousands of fewer Americans working since the start of the recession, the greatest threat to protecting our seniors is a continuing weak economy. We must stop the job-killing policies, get our people back to work and keep our commitment to our seniors.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\11. Energy - Which of the following should Congress concentrate on first, production of more alternative and traditional energy sources, or ways to conserve energy? How would you get that done?\Donnelly: I voted against ""cap and trade"" and instead support an ""all in"" strategy that would increase domestic production of oil, gas and coal, as well as homegrown and clean energy like biofuels, wind and solar produced now in Indiana. This strengthens our national security and creates reliable jobs for Hoosiers.\Walorski: Congress should concentrate on domestic production and get this country off of the reliance on foreign oil by those who seek to destroy us. The country is big enough to allow for the growth of both traditional and alternative sources.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\12. Constituent services - Name two things you would do to remain connected to constituents in the district?\Donnelly: My home and family are in the district, so I come home every week to go to church and I spend every day possible working with constituents in all 12 north central Indiana counties. I also have accessible offices in Logansport, Kokomo, LaPorte, Michigan City and South Bend.\Walorski: My record shows that I have been extremely available to my constituents. I would actively hold town hall meetings in local communities, i.e. regularly scheduled meetings where people could come on a timely basis. I communicate by newsletter, e-mail, Facebook, telephone, and will go anywhere to meet with people in the district.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\13. Higher Education - Are you willing to raise and spend more to increase student aid for college? Why or why not?\Donnelly: Ensuring an affordable and quality higher education is within reach for every Hoosier is vitally important to our economy and the creation of good jobs. I have already helped to cut the interest rate on federal student loans in half and increase Pell Grants by a total of 37 percent.\Walorski: There is no reason to raise taxes in this country. We can provide needed dollars for student aid by reducing costs in other areas.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\14. Veterans - Given the high number of National Guard and reserve troops deployed from Indiana, what's your top priority for making sure returning veterans from recent service are taken care of at home?\Donnelly: As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I introduced legislation pending a House vote that would institute commonsense reforms to the VA disability benefits system that can cut wait times by months. A more efficient benefits system honors their service and meets their needs when they return home.\Walorski: We need to make sure that they have medical support and the other services they need when they arrive home, including jobs and/or job training. They should be able to go to the hospital of their choosing, in their hometowns, with their own physicians and family members there, instead of traveling around the State for proper care.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\15. Roads - Do you favor raising the gas tax to funnel more money to road improvement projects? Why or why not?\Donnelly: No. Hoosiers have seen gas prices rise too much as it is.\Walorski: There should be no tax increases in this next congressional budget. We, in Indiana, have a fully funded, 10-year transportation and infrastructure plan which includes building roads, connectors and bridges without raising taxes.\Vogel: Declined to respond.\Candidate bios\The job of each U.S. representative is to create, discuss and vote on bills and resolutions from their own chamber, as well as bills and resolutions from the U.S. Senate. Approved bills that are signed by the president become laws.\Each congressional member serves a two-year term. The salary in 2010 is $174,000.

136,"Micon vs. Basham: House District 26\False claims on Basham's tax stance\An Oct. 27 letter writer made several false claims. First, Connie Basham has repeatedly stated and made clear in her Project Vote Smart response that she does not favor increasing the state income tax or instituting a graduated income tax. Furthermore, Connie has a clear record of opposing new taxes like the trolley tax and the county wheel tax while serving on the Tippecanoe County Council. Connie, like state Rep. Sheila Klinker, would like to reduce or eventually eliminate the property tax. But for now, she opposes any tax changes until the state gets its fiscal house in order and balances the budget without raising taxes.\Joe Micon, on the other hand, favors a graduated income tax, which will increase the top tax rate a minimum of 30 percent, but much more likely 100 percent to 200 percent. The average top tax rate of the states that have a graduated income tax is 7.5 percent, and the highest is 11 percent. Indiana has a flat 3.4 percent income tax rate. Graduated income taxes are a sneaky way for politicians to extract more money out of the middle class by drastically increasing their taxes.\The letter writer is only right about one thing: Micon is consistent. He wants to increase state spending and raise our taxes, including the income tax and gas tax. Joe's wild and profligate spending promises are not possible, and won't be kept. We can't afford him representing us. Please vote for Basham for state representative, the only fiscally conservative candidate in this race.\Rick Miller\Lafayette\Defamation sealed my support\Due to circumstances beyond my control, my income is currently very limited. Normally I enjoy contributing to causes and ventures I deem worthy. In this heated political season, I had decided that I would not be able to support the candidates of my choosing. However, I did make one exception.\The evening I first saw the hideously negative anti-Joe Micon add on TV18, I found my checkbook. I feel Joe was defamed. I've known Joe for years, I've met Connie Basham; at various public forums, I've listened to them both. I liked them both. Now, the race for House District 26 has gotten personal. The only good thing I can say about it is that Basham showed some conventional wisdom in keeping her name off of it. Vicious, big-city mudslinging has arrived, courtesy of the Indiana Republican Campaign Committee.\I'm voting for Joe.\Greg Seiters\Lafayette\The hard truth on school spending\Joe Micon's TV ads say he favors smaller class size. This sounds great, but how will we fund the extra teachers and classrooms this will require? Ditto for the full-day kindergarten he wants right now.\Connie Basham hasn't been afraid to tell us what we need to hear: We have long been spending too much money and can't afford to start spending any more on these projects until our state is on firmer financial ground. Basham won't propose irresponsible fiscal moves that Indiana's citizens can't afford. She respects voters enough to tell us the truth, even if some people want to ignore it.\Karen Frank\West Lafayette\You might call that a tough choice\What to do, what to do. Vote for Joe Micon, who supports all those awful things like public education, the environment and higher education, but is a (gasp!) big, fat liberal; or vote for Connie Basham, who owns millions of dollars in real estate and believes that homelessness is a lifestyle choice. What a conundrum.\Magie Read\Battle Ground\Bring progressive thinking to the 26th\In the District 26 election, we have a clear and important choice. Joe Micon is the candidate who will represent the interests of our district in an exceptional manner. He is a progressive thinker who listens to the opinions of others before formulating decisions. Joe will work very hard for the interests of Purdue, which is so important for this community. And at the same time, Joe is a fiscal conservative who will ensure that any state expenditures are needed and well executed.\On the other hand, we have Connie Basham who has demonstrated over and over again that she does not even understand the issues. She deals from an ideological deck, without a reality check on the conditions in this district. Her most important policy proposal is to eliminate property taxes, which certainly would enrich her family's $17 million property interests. Meanwhile, the rest of us would face astronomical increases in our income and sales taxes. Do we really want a representative who puts personal gain ahead of the well being of the people of the district?\Yes, this is a very important choice. Whether you are Republican or Democrat, I urge you to vote for Micon, so that we will have a solid, hard-working representative who will be looking out for our interests.\Wally Tyner\West Lafayette\Taking Catholic vote question in whole\In recent weeks, there has been some discussion on this page concerning Catholic voters and their moral duty to adhere to church dogma. Most recently, an Oct. 29 letter states, ""If a candidate supports abortion or any other moral evil, it is not morally permissible for you to vote for that candidate. This is because in voting for such a person, you would become an accomplice in the moral evil at issue.""\However, the writer forgets to mention that Catholic dogma opposes not only reproductive rights and stem-cell research, but also denounces the death penalty, torture, social inequality and war. Because most candidates who claim to be pro-life are also pro-capital punishment, pro-war and against social justice, it seems impossible for Catholics to vote in the upcoming election without becoming ""an accomplice in the moral evil at issue"" in one way or the other.\Consequently, in order to square their votes with their conscience, Catholic voters need to consider church dogma in its entirety when going to the polls. Then they will realize that voting against Republican candidates cannot lead to eternal damnation.\Sabine Klein\Lafayette\Daniels knows debt, we know better\The Oct. 28 endorsement of Mitch Daniels for governor proves that nothing has changed at J&C in all the last 40 or 50 years. The only non-Republican endorsements I remember were Democrats the J&C knew couldn't be beat. This endorsement of Daniels, who should have been prosecuted for worse action than Martha Stewart ever done, takes the cake.\After his federal budget handling, which produced a huge deficit as a result of extreme tax cuts while financing a war, he has toured the state offering tax cuts and incentives for every corporate action if he becomes governor. On more than one occasion, he stated his desire to do away with property taxes, but offered no plan to replace the funds to maintain our schools, roads, parks, social services and pay the recent raises our legislators gave themselves.\All states but one are in debt now fulfilling the mandates of the federal government that hasn't provided the money promised. Daniels knows debt is no problem; he has made lots of it and our children will pay the rest of their lives.\Edward J. Viney\Bringhurst\No on one, yes on two public questions\On Nov. 2, voters must decide on three proposed amendments to the Indiana Constitution.\Indiana Farm Bureau opposes Public Question No. 1, which allows the legislature to exempt from property taxes business equipment, inventory and owner-occupied residential property.\We oppose this amendment because it does not require the legislature to provide another revenue source to replace any lost through exemptions, nor does it reduce the total tax levy.\This would, in effect, authorize relief for some property taxpayers at the expense of other residents - notably farmers, landowners and renters. Farm Bureau originally supported the amendment for its potential to reduce farm inventory taxes, but withdrew support after measuring the impact of reassessment and the $35,000 homestead exemption.\Farm Bureau supports Public Question No. 2, which allows the General Assembly to establish a uniform start date for terms of county offices such as clerk, auditor, sheriff and surveyor.\Our members also support Public Question No. 3, which amends the Constitution concerning gubernatorial succession. The Constitution currently gives the legislature authority to select a new governor if something should happen to both the governor and lieutenant governor. However, it does not establish who serves as governor in the interim before the legislature acts. The amendment corrects this oversight, establishing a line of succession that includes all statewide elected officials. Anyone elevated through this process would serve only until a successor is chosen.\We urge ""no"" votes on Public Question No. 1, and ""yes"" votes on Public Questions No. 2 and No. 3.\Don Villwock, president\Indiana Farm Bureau\More impressed than ever with Sanders\Having listened to the entire debate Thursday among the candidates for the 4th Congressional District, I am even more impressed than before with David Sanders. His responses to a set of tough questions posed by students of Plainfield High School were well thought out and articulate. And unlike Rep. Steve Buyer, he was not reading from a prepared script.\Ephraim Fischbach\West Lafayette\Half-hearted nod to Kerry not enough\The Journal and Courier's half-hearted, tepid endorsement of Sen. John Kerry for president reveals a terrible weakness of his candidacy - his lack of a coherent, clear vision for leading this country in a very difficult and dangerous time in its history. Truly, most people would be hard-pressed to state what Kerry is really for; his campaign has been extremely negative from the beginning.\There is another grave weakness: Kerry has virtually no executive experience. Half-heartedly electing a man without a clear vision of governance and with no executive experience is a recipe for disaster.\We live in a very dangerous world - one that will continue to be dangerous in the years ahead. President Bush is clearly the best choice in this election.\Harlan Day\West Lafayette\The unborn on the line in this election\In Proverbs 6:7, God tells us that one of the seven things he hates is ""hands that shed innocent blood."" In 2 Kings 21:16, we learn that King Manasseh of Judah ""shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end.""\I'm not sure how much blood it would take to fill Jerusalem, but I suspect that the blood of the 40 million babies aborted in this country since 1973 would be more than enough.\Our next president may appoint one or more Supreme Court justices and Sen. John Kerry has made it clear that any he appoints will be pro-abortion. Do we dare continue down this barbaric path of human sacrifice, hoping that God will continue to bless our nation?\Manasseh ignored God until, with a ring in his nose, he was led into Assyrian captivity. His story has a happy ending, however: When Manasseh humbled himself, God returned him to Jerusalem, and then he knew that the Lord is God.\It's not too late for our country to put a stop to this violent shedding of the most innocent blood imaginable - that of a baby not yet born.\Sharron McAfee\West Lafayette\Facts prove Bush's supporters wrong\Since the 2000 presidential campaign, I have been dumbfounded how anyone could support a incompetent nincompoop like George W. Bush for the most powerful office in the land.\Now, thanks to a study done by a joint program of the Center on Policy Attitudes and the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland, School of Public Affairs, I think I finally have an answer. Bush's supporters simply have a distorted perception of reality.\The study shows that the majority of Bush supporters hold the following views that are contrary to reality:\- 72 percent continue to believe that Iraq had actual weapons of mass destruction or a major program for developing them.\- 56 percent assume that most experts believe Iraq had actual WMDs.\- 57 percent believe the Duelfer report to Congress concluded Iraq had at least a major WMD program.\The facts prove them wrong on every count.\Sadly, Bush's supporters aren't even in touch with reality when it comes to Bush's own positions on foreign policy. According to the study, majorities of Bush supporters assume that Bush supports multilateral approaches to issues including, the International Criminal Court, labor and environmental standards in trade agreements, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the treaty banning land mines. In fact, Bush opposes them all.\Henry Mencken once said, ""No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" I guess we are about to see if that holds true when running for the White House.\Michael Hrejsa\Fowler"
137,"
SOUTH BEND -- The St. Joseph County Council District E race between Republican Stephen Herczeg and incumbent Democrat David Niezgodski likely will determine control of the council.
\
Right now, Democrats control the council by a 6-3 margin.
\
Redistricting, however, has resulted in a new makeup of some districts, most notably District C, which now takes in all of Harris Township and portions of Penn and Clay townships -- nearly all of the Granger area.
\
The new District C carries a heavily Republican flavor -- 79 percent of registered voters. That means Democrat Bridget Filipski faces an uphill battle in her campaign against Republican Dale DeVon.
\
If DeVon wins, there would be four Republican council members, including Henry J. ""Hank"" Keultjes, who is running unopposed for District B, Dennis R. Schafer and James Reinholtz. Both Schafer and Reinholtz are not up for re-election this year.
\
The four Democrats would be W. Randall Przybysz, who is running unopposed for District A, Joseph A. Baldoni, who is running unopposed for District H, Rafael Morton and Mark Catanzarite.
\
Herczeg is well aware of the political importance of his race. For the first time in recent memory, Herczeg said Republicans have a chance of controlling the council and its agenda. A Republican council also would act as a check and balance with the county commissioners, he added. Currently, two of the three commissioners are Democrat.
\
Niezgodski believes there has been a real cooperative effort among current council members.
\
""In working on the council, I have done my best not to work from the political realm and to work for the needs of the community,"" Niezgodski said.
\
When Niezgodski was elected four years ago, he vowed to be a strong voice on the council, even when addressing controversial issues. It wasn't long before Niezgodski had to face one of those issues -- the local option highway user tax, often referred to as the wheel tax, which he supported.
\
The council considered adopting the tax to replenish a reduction in state highway funding.
\
""Maybe some day we'll find another source to replace that degree of funding, but it will be very difficult,"" Niezgodski said. ""I'm open to any option short of the wheel tax, but the need is not going to go away.""
\
Herczeg said people already believe they are paying too much in taxes. Adoption of the tax was characterized as an emergency to cope with the loss of state funding. But Herczeg said there was no priority list for projects.
\
""I don't think it was researched well, and it was presented poorly,"" the retired school administrator said.
\
Herczeg said that though he can't support any new taxes right now, he is more inclined to support what he described as ""user fees,"" like adding to the state gasoline tax or creating a restaurant tax.
\
""I think if we look at the $58 million budget, we can perhaps find additional money or federal grants,"" Herczeg said.
\
Niezgodski cited his support of a common wage ordinance adopted by the council earlier this year. Niezgodski said the ordinance applies only to those businesses receiving tax abatements by requiring those companies receiving an economic benefit to pay a common wage to workers.
\
""With economic times the way they are, it can provide the fairest means for workers within St. Joseph County to have a level playing field and get those jobs,"" Niezgodski said.
\
Herczeg said he is running for the council because his career as an administrator, teacher and athletic coach has prepared him well to deal with the people and issues he will face.
\
""I believe that local government needs to have a new infusion of fresh ideas and new faces,"" Herczeg said. ""This is an opportunity to change the philosophy that has been in control of local government for a long time.""
\
Other races include:
\
Assessor: Republican Judith A. Leach is challenging incumbent Democrat David E. Wesolowski, who is seeking his fifth term.
\
Auditor: Democrat Michael C. ""Mike"" Eby is challenging Republican Karen E. Vargo. Eby currently serves on the County Council. The current auditor, Joseph F. Nagy, has already served two terms and is prohibited by law from seeking another term.

Q: Should the county restore the complete leaf pickup program? If so, where would you find the money to fund it?

A: If a permanent funding solution were to be established for road repair, money that commissioners redirected for road repair could be rededicated to fully restore the leaf pickup program.

Q: Is the countywide warning system now adequate and is the county well prepared to respond to an emergency, be it terrorist attack or weather-related?
\
A: Warning system is adequate for 85 percent of the county. While our police and firefighters are well trained, response between multiple agencies could be improved by a centralized dispatch center.

Q: Would you support a county tax on vehicles to meet road repair needs? If not, is there an alternative you would offer?

What is the best thing about Lafayette, and how would you preserve or improve it?\2. What is the worst thing about Lafayette, and how would you change it?\3. How much change should residents expect in who runs city departments? What criteria will you use to select a police chief, fire chief, city engineer and other department heads?\4. How much of a ""hands on"" mayor will you be? Give an example of what is done now that you would continue, or what isn't done now that you would start doing.\5. Given the fact that reassessment appears to have hit the city's oldest neighborhoods hardest, what can (or should) the city do to encourage people to buy and remodel homes in Lafayette's older blocks?\6. Is the city's infrastructure positioned to take care of its suburban growth? What more does the city need to do?\7. What are the two best things the city can do to generate job growth?\8. The city has a comprehensive, $50 million plan to develop the Wabash riverfront. Do you like the plan and how aggressively would you pursue it?\9. Do you believe the city is going in the right direction with its ""hilltop to hilltop"" concept for the downtown? Should the city do more and spend more to improve the downtown?\10. Would you be willing to go to the Tippecanoe County Council to lobby for a ""wheel tax"" if it meant more money to maintain Lafayette's streets?\11. What are the top two issues facing the city? And how do you plan to address them?\12. In your mind, what is the most significant difference between you and your opponent that makes you the best choice for mayor?\Answers\1. Our great community spirit and sense of working together has made Lafayette a leader in this state. The mayor is a leader of this community and must set an example and embody that spirit. That will be my mission as mayor.\2. I prefer to think in terms of areas of opportunity and improvement. My administration will concentrate on creating jobs, solving traffic problems and keeping our tax rate the lowest in the state.\3. I will immediately evaluate every city department, with the help of outside experts. I will seek out the most capable people I can find to run our city departments.\4. The mayor should find the absolute best people to run the city departments, and then let them do their jobs. As mayor, I will set overall direction and policy, and will make sure city departments are responsive to taxpayers.\5. The city now has the Small Business Investment Fund to help small businesses improve their property. We should implement a similar incentive program, as well as other long-term plans, that encourage reinvestment in our older neighborhoods.\6. Our growth has occurred because of the Heath-Decker administration's leadership in upgrading the wastewater plant, traffic planning and city parks development. We will continue these efforts, which will include a computerized traffic control system.\7. First, create a business-friendly climate that will attract jobs. My ""Open for Business Jobs Plan"" will do that. Second, keep our tax rate the lowest in the state. It is now, and I intend to keep it there.\8. This is a terrific 15-year plan, developed by outstanding professionals after much study, discussion and input from the public. Using innovative financing such as available federal and state funds, I will move forward on its implementation in a fiscally responsible manner.\9. A vibrant downtown is essential to our success. The city can maintain a customer-friendly downtown by the use of incentives for downtown business. Doing so will maintain the city center tax base, benefiting the entire city.\10. No, this is not the time for more taxes, and I will not support any new taxes. By using TIFs, EDIT monies and our operating budget, we can find other ways of funding our transportation plan without raising taxes.\11. Number 1: Jobs. I will implement my ""Open for Business Jobs Plan."" Number 2: Keeping our city tax rate the lowest in the state, which I intend to do.\12. First, my opponent says Lafayette should collaborate with Terre Haute. I say we can do better than that. Second, he advocates government-mandated wages, which will hurt our ability to attract jobs. I oppose them.\Tony Roswarski (D)\Age: 43 Address: 1910 Maple St.\Occupation: Captain, Lafayette Police Department\Community service: Lafayette City Council, District 6; Hanna Community Center board; Community and Family Resource Center board; Golden Broncho Club; Cary Home Advisory Board; Purdue University Community Relations Advisory Committee\1. The people of Lafayette have always been its greatest strength. To preserve this we must continue to promote families, education, a commitment to helping others and cultural activities.\2. I would like to see more people participate in their local government. I believe citizen participation is the key to good government. I will make city hall open and friendly so people feel comfortable participating.\3. A diverse citizens group will be established to look at departmental efficiency and department head recommendations. A department head's philosophy in working with our citizens will be of great importance when the decision is made.\4. I will be a working mayor that constantly checks city projects. I will make unannounced inspections of city departments to maintain the highest standard of quality and fair treatment of our citizens.\5. The community must pull together to continue to improve our older neighborhoods. Effective use of Community Development Blocks Grants, neighborhood association participation, and working with our state legislature to make responsible changes will be required.\6. The city's infrastructure must be continually evaluated to encourage residential, commercial and industrial growth. Those infrastructure improvements should be undertaken if they are reasonable and cost effective.\7. I have developed the ""Roswarski Means Business"" plan to create and retain jobs in our community. This plan is a comprehensive document that covers six main areas of economic development and will move Lafayette forward.\8. The plan is intriguing, but it is very expensive. I am for the development of the riverfront in a reasonable, cost-effective manner that will create economic development, recreational opportunities and protect the environment.\9. Coordination with West Lafayette and Purdue University makes sense. Maximizing everyone's resources to guarantee the highest quality of business and leisure opportunities in a cost-effective manner is essential.\10. No. Our citizens are already suffering from the tax burden of reassessment and a wheel tax at this time is simply not appropriate.\11. Retain our current, good-paying jobs and creating new jobs. Implementing the ""Roswarski Means Business"" jobs plan. Reducing city spending. I have advocated a total reform of the budgetary process.\12. Leadership skills managing large numbers of people. Experience in our neighborhoods as councilman. Extensive involvement in our schools. Comprehensive knowledge of public safety, homeland security. Commitment to a government that listens.\Lafayette City Council, At-Large\Three of the nine seats on the city council are elected at-large, meaning they represent the entire city. Voters will choose three of these six.\1. Is the city doing an adequate job in providing services (street maintenance, trash pickup, etc.)? What would you do as a council member to improve?\2. What have you done or will you do as a council member to improve the quality of life within your own district?\3. The city has a comprehensive, $50 million plan to develop the riverfront along the Wabash. Do you like the plan and how aggressively would you pursue it?\4. What is the best thing about Lafayette, and how would you preserve or improve it?\5. What is the worst thing about Lafayette, and how would you change it?\6. Would you support spending tax money on public art projects in Lafayette?\7. Are you willing to grant tax abatements to attract businesses or to encourage them to expand in the city? What is minimum a business must guarantee before you'd vote to grant an abatement?\8. What are the top two issues facing the city? And how do you plan to address them?\Answers\James Andrew (R)\Age: 54\Address: 620 Central St.\Occupation: CEO/Owner Henry Poor Lumber Co. and Home Works\1. Yes, always room for improvement. Lobby state to get more of our gas tax money returned so we can pave and repair more streets. Visit city departments regularly to keep updated on day-to-day operations.\2. Continue work on river development, lineal trails projects to maximize the recreational potential. Work with state to get property tax relief. ""We're Open for Business"" attitude to help maintain and create jobs.\3. I like the plan. Started working on development of the river as county councilman in late '70s. The river is our only natural resource in the county. Vision would include entire river, county line to county line.\4. The quality of life. This area continues to be a bright spot in our state's economic development. We have a wealth of resources and have been using them effectively and collectively to get things done.\5. I wouldn't classify the following as the worst problems in Lafayette, but rather situations that we should continue to work on: Air quality issues; support for local airport.\6. When a group of us went to Chattanooga, Tenn., to see its riverfront, we saw ""the arts"" very much included in process. Look to develop a similar project. I am not in favor of a tax that would support the arts.\7. Yes. There are a set of guidelines and principles used to grant tax abatements in the city. These should be followed. At a minimum, abatement must be used to maintain all existing jobs and create new ones.\8. Job creation, retention. Keep tax rate down. Be sure spending is investment in future; prevent having 20 years' worth of improvements to do in eight years.\Mike Dowler (R)\Age: 34\Address: 1118 Valley Forge Road\Ocupation: Deputy prosecuting attorney\1. Services improved under this administration while tax rates have dropped. We should continually survey residents and conduct efficiency reviews to ensure the best services are provided at the lowest cost.\2. As the only law enforcement officer running for council, voters can count on me to ensure we devote appropriate resources to keep our citizens safe and protect their property.\3. The plan is responsive to the concerns of our community, and we need to move forward wisely, so that we are good stewards of both our financial and natural resources.\4. Lafayette's community spirit. I would foster this through resolutions recognizing outstanding acts of local people to make their hometown Lafayette an even better place to live.\5. Communication between city hall and the people. I'll take the initiative to improve communication by going door to door year round, to talk issues with people on their doorsteps.\6. Taxes are for essential governmental functions like police and fire. Government can support arts more creatively than by taxing and spending, as we saw in the city's cooperation in ""Hog Wild!"" project.\7. Tax abatements are powerful economic development tools. They bring jobs and don't cost taxpayers a dime. Government-imposed wage rates stifle job creation, economic expansion. Everybody loses.\8. Jobs and taxes. Support Lisa Decker's Open for Business jobs plan. More jobs mean a better economy, which means lower taxes. Vote for Decker.\Lon Heide (D)\Age: 69\Address: 40 Gregory Court\Occupation: Retired owner, The Athlete at Lafayette Square\1. A plan is in effect to do road repairs and replacement. Should this be revisited? Trash pickup seems adequate, but certain areas of the city need special consideration (i.e. no alley pickup).\2. Promote neighborhood associations throughout the city. We have associations that are very efficient to prevent crime, vandalism, scams and protection for our senior citizens.\3. This is not a local tax cost. This will be funded by grants through the federal government and by donations from the private sector. If these funds aren't granted to Lafayette, then another area will reap the benefits.\4. It has hometown atmosphere and offers great fire and police protection. Recreation and entertainment for all ages. We received an All-American City designation in 1995, which all of Lafayette is proud of.\5. Traffic issues. I would work for better planning on road construction projects to ensure minimal traffic and business disruption.\6. Arts are a very important part of our community. Given budgets constraints, however, seek ways to work with Purdue, local art federation to seek funding without the need for an additional tax burden.\7. Yes, with livable wage and benefits. Growth doesn't mean a larger facility, but it does mean an increase in business and more job opportunities.\8. Controlled spending, traffic control. Work with large employers to stagger starting times, on incentives to employees to car pool (possibly free gas).\Kevin Klinker (D)\Age: 38\Address: 411 Valley St.\Occupation: Quality control lab scheduler, Eli Lilly, Tippecanoe Labs\1. Services have been adequate, but there is much room for improvement. I'll encourage more flexibility in the trash program, ensure services to recently annexed areas and hopefully add more police.\2. Create jobs through proactive economic development and partnering with Purdue, Ivy Tech, the Chamber, Greater Lafayette Progress, others. Beautify and better utilize the Wabash.\3. I support the linear park concept interconnecting parks throughout Lafayette, West Lafayette and the river corridor. This would likely need to be completed in phases due to the costs.\4. The ability of our community and neighborhoods to tackle difficult problems in a non-partisan manner. This is consistent with my beliefs on how to best solve important issues.\5. Recent job losses. We need to work hard to encourage local employers to stay and grow as well as recruit high-tech/high-wage jobs to the Lafayette area.\6. The arts are extremely important in promoting cultural diversity, making communities desirable to businesses. Prefer private funding; would encourage local companies to continue generous support.\7. Tax abatements are critical in recruiting and retaining businesses. I would ensure the city's return on investment and encourage good corporate citizenship (good pay and benefits, environmentally friendly).\8.Job creation: I will work with the partnerships mentioned in answer No. 2. Taxes: I will be fiscally conservative to keep taxes low.\Steve Meyer (D, incumbent)\Age: 44\Address: 1310 Southport Drive\Occupation: Attorney, Ball Eggleston Bumbleburg McBride Walkey & Stapleton\1. No, regarding street repair. We should seek input from neighbors and businesses affected by projects. Assess contractor penalties for delays or pay bonuses for work completed ahead of schedule.\2. As councilman, I worked to protect neighborhood parks and pools, preserve historic districts and represented cable customers in a franchise violation that led to a rebate for every customer.\3. Yes. Dedicate a park employee to coordinate and fund it. Protect environmental and property rights. Consider committing portion of increased property revenues to a fund to improve water quality.\4. Its people. Create a positive, energetic and tolerant atmosphere that attracts and retains creative, hard-working people who will live, work and invest in the community.\5. People feel disconnected and that their opinions are not welcome at City Hall. Invite input by seeking public opinion early and hold neighborhood meetings instead of at City Hall.\6. My wife and I support local art activities. However, I do not see room for public finding at this time given the economy and expected shortfall of state revenues.\7. Yes. Companies should fulfill promises, hire locals and offer a decent living wage in exchange for a tax break. They should return tax savings if they fail to honor promises.\8. Growth, financial stability. Carefully consider areas of expansion so city can deliver services. Budget properly, avoid unnecessary borrowing.\Steve Schreckengast (R)\Age: 50\Address: 1621 Skyline Road\Occupation: Co-founder and president of Citation Homes Inc.\1. I believe city services have improved over the last 71[currency] 2 years. I would utilize my business expertise to make government more efficient, not more costly.\2. I pledge to listen and work closely with all individuals and organizations that promote positive development of our neighborhoods and our historic downtown.\3. Support Wabash Riverfront Parks plan. Development of riverfront, like Railroad Relocation, should occur over time and utilize a variety of funding sources to minimize the tax burden.\4. For me it is the ""sense of community"" that makes Lafayette a great city. We have worldwide connections, but we still know and care about our neighbors.\5. Inconsiderate drivers are the worst thing about Lafayette. We need to do a better job of enforcing speed limits in our neighborhoods and encourage drivers to be more courteous.\6. My wife, Kelly, and I personally support numerous organizations involved with the arts. I do not believe in using tax dollars to directly fund these programs or organizations.\7. For Lafayette to stay competitive with other communities, we must have the ability to offer economic incentives. Companies requesting abatements must prove their value to the community.\8. Planning for future growth and preserving our older neighborhoods. If we invest in our community, employers and jobs will follow."
139,"The General Assembly is working on net metering, which allows electric customers to generate their own power and get credit on their monthly bills when they return extra electricity to the grid.\State Reps. Wes Culver, R-Goshen, and Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, teamed up on a bill that would expand net metering significantly in terms of eligible system size, and makes it possible for more Hoosiers to participate.\Under the bill, businesses, homeowners, churches, farms and local governments can take part.\In today's economy, a strong net-metering policy will give our businesses and farms an incentive to invest in renewable energy as it would reduce their electricity bills and potentially provide an additional source of revenue.\Passing an expanded net-metering bill this year has the potential to save Hoosier families, workers, businesses and governments thousands of dollars in energy costs.\It also is a good start in utilizing the renewable energy that exists right here in Indiana, such as power generated by biomass, solar and wind, while increasing our energy independence.\I hope area legislators will support this initiative and provide their support to pass a comprehensive policy on net metering that provides economic opportunity for us all.\Barry Rubin\West Lafayette\Parent-coaches can be unfair or biased\I realize there are some qualified and ethically moral parent-coaches who dedicate their time and talent unselfishly and without bias to their child's school basketball programs. Unfortunately, there are some who use their coaching positions merely to advance their own agendas -- to give their children, and children of their friends, an unfair advantage for privileges and opportunities.\What's most shameful is that those parent-coaches exclude or minimize opportunities for other children, some who have superior skills.\In my opinion, parent-coaches can harm their children by raising them to believe they're entitled to privileges and positions simply because their dad is a coach or because of their last name.\Don't they realize that children raised in an environment of entitlement often develop poor work ethics, not to mention the social prejudices passed onto them by the parents?\Are these parents so focused on their agendas that they truly don't realize how publicly transparent their intentions are? Have they no pride for how their actions are viewed by others or for the example they set for their children?\The social engineering that some parent-coaches practice in their personal and professional lives has no place in sports or in school. Those guilty of such selfish ethics should be ashamed, as should be the athletic departments of the schools that endorse them.\Rick North\Rossville"
140,"MUNCIE – Retired Ball State University professors Carolyn and John Vann used to attract crowds of several dozen people to meetings at which the couple would sign some up to add solar panels to their homes.\Nowadays, the two grass roots solar advocates are frustrated. ""We hold a meeting and no one comes,"" Carolyn Vann said.\A recent meeting at the Kennedy Library drew an audience of just two people, and they were invited by John Vann, who knew them from the YMCA.\The Vanns set up for a presentation in Yorktown and no one attended.\The couple attributes the lack of solar interest/awareness to net metering, which Indiana's Senate Bill 309 changed in 2017.\""That's one of the things that has made it more difficult for us,"" John Vann said. ""There was so much press coverage of the bill and so much debate, and now no one's talking about it.""\When Vann spoke to some BSU faculty members recently about going solar, he learned they mistakenly believed ""you don't get net metering any more.""\In fact, SB 309, championed by the state's powerful utility industry, phases out net metering — which requires utilities to pay solar users for any excess energy that is created by their solar panels — but it didn't immediately eliminate net metering.\The program was intended to provide an important incentive for Hoosiers to install expensive solar panels and produce their own energy that is better for the environment.\Thanks to SB 309, there was a rush to install solar panels before December of 2017 because customers who entered into net metering contracts before that date were able to continue their contracts for 30 years (until July 1, 2047).\But customers who still sign up before July 1, 2022, can continue net metering until July 1, 2032 — or 14 years from now, or 13 years from next year and so on until 2022, when the benefit would amount to 10 years.\It's important for potential solar customers to know three things, John Vann said. Carolyn listed them: net metering it still available; a federal solar tax credit allows you to deduct 30 percent of the cost of installing a solar energy system from your federal taxes (the deduction drops to 26 percent for systems placed in service after the end of 2019 and to 22 percent for systems placed in service after the end of 2020); and you can get a group discount of 20 percent by purchasing a solar system through Solarize ECI.\""Then there are four things,"" John Vann added. ""The fourth is: businesses, including farms, can depreciate the solar system. So they get the federal tax credit and and can depreciate it in as little as one year.""\There are really more than three or four benefits to going solar. For example, solar installations don't increase the assessed value of a home for property taxation purposes but typically add 15 percent to the sales price of a home, according to the Vanns.\Carolyn Vann is a retired biology professor. John, her husband, is a retired marketing professor. Both are deeply concerned about climate change. During a recent interview, Carolyn said, in reference to the phaseout of net metering in 2032, ""We'll be dead by then,"" referring to death from climate change, not natural causes.\In 2006, when John Vann met and became one of former Vice President Al Gore's climate-change messengers, he told The Star Press, ""I've become convinced there is nothing more important as a threat to humanity than global warming.""\The Vanns were invited last year to Indianapolis for an organizational meeting of Solarize Indiana. ""We went seeking more information, not thinking of starting a unit here,"" John Vann said. (Muncie surgeon) John Eliades also attended.\""It started in Bloomington,"" Carolyn Vann said of the Solarize initiative. ""They're way ahead of this stuff. They've done hundreds of installations.""\Solarize ECI was an offshoot started and operated by the Vanns and other grass roots volunteers who are unpaid. The Vanns pay expenses out of their own pockets and have had trouble finding meeting places at no cost.\Solarize Indiana sent out requests for proposals to solar companies in the Midwest, looking at reliability, product quality, tenure in business and lowest group pricing. From those companies, Solarize ECI chose to work with Icon Solar, Cincinnati.\More than 40 homeowners in East Central Indiana have installed solar panels through Solarize ECI, receiving group pricing 20 percent below what they would have to pay if they didn't go through Solarize ECI.\The Vanns themselves participated, getting 30 solar panels, for which they paid about $26,000 before the federal tax credit; they will end up paying about $16,000.

""We hold a meeting and no one comes,"" Carolyn Vann said.\A recent meeting at the Kennedy Library drew an audience of just two people, and they were invited by John Vann, who knew them from the YMCA.\The Vanns set up for a presentation in Yorktown and no one attended.\The couple attributes the lack of solar interest/awareness to net metering, which Indiana's Senate Bill 309 changed in 2017.\""That's one of the things that has made it more difficult for us,"" John Vann said. ""There was so much press coverage of the bill and so much debate, and now no one's talking about it.""\When Vann spoke to some BSU faculty members recently about going solar, he learned they mistakenly believed ""you don't get net metering any more.""\In fact, SB 309, championed by the state's powerful utility industry, phases out net metering — which requires utilities to pay solar users for any excess energy that is created by their solar panels — but it didn't immediately eliminate net metering.\The program was intended to provide an important incentive for Hoosiers to install expensive solar panels and produce their own energy that is better for the environment.\Thanks to SB 309, there was a rush to install solar panels before December of 2017 because customers who entered into net metering contracts before that date were able to continue their contracts for 30 years (until July 1, 2047).\But customers who still sign up before July 1, 2022, can continue net metering until July 1, 2032 — or 14 years from now, or 13 years from next year and so on until 2022, when the benefit would amount to 10 years.\It's important for potential solar customers to know three things, John Vann said. Carolyn listed them: net metering it still available; a federal solar tax credit allows you to deduct 30 percent of the cost of installing a solar energy system from your federal taxes (the deduction drops to 26 percent for systems placed in service after the end of 2019 and to 22 percent for systems placed in service after the end of 2020); and you can get a group discount of 20 percent by purchasing a solar system through Solarize ECI.\""Then there are four things,"" John Vann added. ""The fourth is: businesses, including farms, can depreciate the solar system. So they get the federal tax credit and and can depreciate it in as little as one year.""\There are really more than three or four benefits to going solar. For example, solar installations don't increase the assessed value of a home for property taxation purposes but typically add 15 percent to the sales price of a home, according to the Vanns.\Carolyn Vann is a retired biology professor.\John, her husband, is a retired marketing professor. Both are deeply concerned about climate change. During a recent interview, Carolyn said, in reference to the phaseout of net metering in 2032, ""We'll be dead by then,"" referring to death from climate change, not natural causes.\In 2006, when John Vann met and became one of former Vice President Al Gore's climate-change messengers, he told The Star Press, ""I've become convinced there is nothing more important as a threat to humanity than global warming.""\The Vanns were invited last year to Indianapolis for an organizational meeting of Solarize Indiana. ""We went seeking more information, not thinking of starting a unit here,"" John Vann said. (Muncie surgeon) John Eliades also attended.\""It started in Bloomington,"" Carolyn Vann said of the Solarize initiative. ""They're way ahead of this stuff. They've done hundreds of installations.""\Solarize ECI was an offshoot started and operated by the Vanns and other grass roots volunteers who are unpaid. The Vanns pay expenses out of their own pockets and have had trouble finding meeting places at no cost.\Solarize Indiana sent out requests for proposals to solar companies in the Midwest, looking at reliability, product quality, tenure in business and lowest group pricing. From those companies, Solarize ECI chose to work with Icon Solar, Cincinnati.\More than 40 homeowners in East Central Indiana have installed solar panels through Solarize ECI, receiving group pricing 20 percent below what they would have to pay if they didn't go through Solarize ECI.\The Vanns themselves participated, getting 30 solar panels, for which they paid about $26,000 before the federal tax credit; they will end up paying about $16,000. The couple live in Henry County and had their panels mounted on a barn, though they provide electricity to their house.\Solar panels also can be mounted on the rooftops of garages, houses and other buildings (not on a north-facing, however) or ground mounted.\The Vanns say they installed more solar panels than normal for a residence.\For example, Solarize ECI volunteer Sheryl Swingley, a lecturer in the journalism department at Ball State, paid a more typical $12,000 for her residential solar system and received a $3,600 tax credit.\John Vann contacted The Star Press after being interviewed to add this thought: ""I know we talked a lot about the financial benefits of solar, but our major motivation is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""\A solar installer climbs the roof to install panels on an Indiana home.\Courtesy of Solarize ECI\CREDIT: Seth Slabaugh"
142,"""I have not looked to Illinois for guidance policy on anything because I've rarely found a time when they've done anything right.""\That scathing review comes from Sen. Brandt Hershman, R-Wheatfield, who authored the latest legislation determining net metering in the state of Indiana. The conservative lawmaker looked at a number of other states as he considered how and to what extent Indiana should phase out net metering — the credit given to solar customers for excess energy they produce — in the state.\The move was staunchly opposed by solar customers and installers, and an IndyStar investigation has revealed that the new law has created uncertainty and upheaval to a once-promising industry.\It may not always be sunny in the Midwest, but states across the region are looking for ways to capture the rays that do reach them. Here's a look at what they're doing:\• Illinois: An effort to repeal net metering narrowly failed late last year. But what lawmakers here did pass was the Future Energy Jobs Act, which went into effect in June. Among the many provisions, including $750 million devoted to renewable energy jobs training, the law establishes a ""community solar"" program aimed at bringing solar panels to all income levels. It also mandates that 25 percent of two utilities' energy come from renewable sources by 2025, and requires that 4,300 megawatts of new solar and wind be built in the state by 2030.\• Ohio: A bill that would have frozen Ohio's renewable portfolio standards was vetoed by the governor in December. Debates around their net metering are similar to those heard here in Indiana: Residential generators are putting financial burden on those who don't generate. As recently as last year, American Electric Power cited this argument when they asked the state regulators to approve an increase on the fixed charge customers receive on their bill, no matter their energy use.\• Iowa: Last summer, the Iowa Utilities Board ordered two investor-owned utilities to create pilot programs for net metering, which will be in place for three years while the state studies the effects of the policy. As part of the order, the Board increased the capacity of net metered facilities to generate. Any excess generation is set to be cashed out on an annual basis.\• Minnesota: This state stands out as the only one to employ the policy of aggregate net metering, which allows a single generating customer to offset the energy use of multiple meters on their property. Beyond that, solar power in Minnesota is growing at break-neck pace, with the state's solar energy capacity raising 80 percent in the first quarter of 2017, according to the Star Tribune. They are also home to the Minnesota Energy Storage Alliance, which views the state as a leader in the battery storage industry, the latest frontier in renewable energy efficiency.\• Michigan: Earlier this year, the Michigan Public Service Commission started a process to examine how to equitably implement self-generation policy in the state. The review period will be overseen by a group of diverse stakeholders who will also be tasked with determining if solar generators are in fact subsidized by other ratepayers.\• Wisconsin: The fight over distributed solar here came down in the arena of fixed charges. In 2014, the state granted a 75 percent to 85 percent increase in the monthly fixed charge for two utilities, though a judge later threw out one of those approvals. Still, electricity prices in Wisconsin are some of the highest in the region, which helps drive customers to solar.\Emily Hopkins covers the environment for the IndyStar.

143,"More than 75 bills related to the environment have been filed at the Indiana General Assembly, a swell that was somewhat unexpected in a year when lawmakers are facing major issues such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, racial inequality and widespread economic hardship.\Some of the bills could mean big steps forward for reducing Indiana's carbon emissions footprint, boosting ""green"" industries in the state and cleaning up Indiana's water and air.\On the other end of the spectrum, other bills could repeal entire laws protecting the state's natural wetlands or potentially limit Hoosiers' ability to protect themselves from factory farm pollution.\Here's what you need to know about the bills with the biggest potential for impacting Indiana's environment.\Water\How to protect and regulate Indiana's waters is proving a hearty subject of debate this legislative session.\Most notably, Senate Bill 389 would repeal the state's wetlands law and strip protections for as much as 80% of Indiana's wetlands, It is moving through the Senate with what appears to be strong Republican support. The bill has over 22 co-authors, according to a statement from author Sen. Chris Garten.\Environmentalists strongly oppose the bill, which they say could have significant impacts on Indiana's water quality, wetlands and flood mitigation.\Also on the table are bills that tackle wastewater issues in Indiana.\Two bills, House Bill 1038 and SB 419, would require inspections of septic systems before selling a property, in hopes of cutting down on the hundreds of thousands of septic systems failing in the state. Another, SB 348, would establish a wastewater task force to evaluate state wastewater needs, an issue that is likely to be exacerbated with increased rainfall as climate change progresses.\CAFOs and right to farm\Bills related to factory farming in Indiana pop up every year, and this year is no exception. There are two bills that would bolster regulations of concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs. One, SB 29, would require annual inspections and the other, HB 1472, would provide greater protections to neighbors of the farms — which was the subject of a lawsuit last year that went all the way to Indiana's Supreme Court.\These types of bills have continued to be defeated in Indiana's Republican-led General Assembly in recent years.\On the other side, there are two bills — HB 1380 and SB 411 — that advocates worry would limit their legal recourse options and further strip Hoosiers' rights to protect themselves against neighboring factory farms. And one resolution, Senate Joint Resolution 14, could actually enshrine the rights of farming operations in Indiana's Constitution.\Hemp\Several bills proposed this session, including HB 1224, HB 1046, SB 273, and HB 1233, tackle issues facing the hemp industry. The industry is new to Indiana and has the potential, some predict, to bring millions in revenue into the state in the coming years.\Of major interest is smokable hemp, also known as craft hemp flower. Hemp flower looks and smells much like marijuana, but contains a far lower concentration of THC, the part of the cannabis plant that gets users high.\Under current law, possession, manufacturing or delivery of hemp flower is banned. In many other states and federally, however, it is not. Industry advocates say decriminalizing hemp flower will help Indiana growers regain a competitive edge nationally.\But opponents of the change point out that differentiating between marijuana and hemp flower is difficult for law enforcement officers, and decriminalizing hemp flower could further complicate marijuana regulation.\Energy Task Force legislation\Indiana's 21st Century Energy Task Force, a nearly two-year effort to help chart a course for Indiana's energy future and find the right fuel mix for the state, wrapped up last year. The group laid out some key findings and priorities to focus on for this legislative session, which are laid out across several bills.\HB 1220 would reestablish the task force to tackle topics — net metering, energy efficiency, etc. — that weren't discussed in the first term. Another, HB 1381, would create some standards for where wind and solar projects can be located so that rules are more consistent across the state.\The others are a bit more complicated: HB 1520 would create some metrics to ensure that utilities are providing the most reliable electricity, while SB 386 would create a pilot program on how to pay for coal plants that have been retired early, as a way to help with the transition away from fossil fuels.\Coal ash\What to do with the massive amounts of coal ash piled up in pits across the state — of which Indiana has more of than any other state — has long been a point of contention. This year, however, is the first that this debate is coming to Indiana's General Assembly.\There are two bills, both from Democrats in Northwest Indiana, that would add requirements intended to better protect public health and prevent groundwater contamination. More specifically, SB 367 and HB 1469 would govern how utilities must close their coal ash ponds and dispose of the ash, requiring them to excavate the ash and store it in a dry and lined landfill.\Lead, radon and pesticides\The issue of lead levels in school buildings returns to lawmakers' attention this session. Last year, a bill requiring mandatory testing in schools statewide passed through the legislature shortly after IndyStar reporting showcased lead exposure in Marion County schools.\This year, HB 1045 would require testing of drinking water in preschool and childcare facilities, and another, HB 1087, would require a school corporation to ensure their plumbing products are lead-free. Yet another bill, HB 1341, would require testing school buildings for another danger: radon, a radioactive gas linked to cancer.\Outside of school buildings, SB 227, which has already cleared the Senate, would allow the state chemist more control over enforcing pesticide violations.\PFAS chemicals\Growing concern about a family of synthetic ""forever chemicals"" called PFAS contaminants has prompted two bills tackling different aspects of the issue.\States around the country started regulating these long-lasting chemicals, which have been tied to maladies ranging from cholesterol to cancer. The Biden administration has also promised to tackle them on the federal level. The chemicals have been found in Indianapolis' tap water.\Last year, a bill limiting the chemicals' use in firefighting foam passed through the legislature without friction. This year, lawmakers are hoping to set maximum contaminant levels for PFAS chemicals in public water systems with HB 1129, and to begin testing for the contaminants in acting and former military members, who are likely to be exposed to the chemicals on military bases, through SB 1568.\Renewable and other energy\Rooftop solar continues to grow in Indiana — but not nearly as fast as it could, advocates say, if the state hadn't phased out a key incentive meant to help more people install the renewable energy source.\The General Assembly passed a law a few years ago to eventually remove net metering from the state. Each year since, bills have been proposed to reinstate the incentive or allow more people access.\This year is no different. Three bills — SB 420, SB 249 and HB 1394, the latter two from Republicans — would extend the deadline for net metering. Some have made the argument that this is needed to delay the phase out until the task force can take a look at the policy and make some recommendations.\Another bill, HB 1191, would prevent a city or town from banning any particular fuel source as energy for buildings in its area. Though the bill does not specify a particular type of fuel, the bill's author has made it clear it's to keep governments from banning natural gas.\Electric Vehicles\Indiana has long been known as the ""Crossroads of America"" with its numerous highways spanning across the state. But if it is to keep its crossroads crown, then experts, environmentalists and energy advocates all agree that Indiana must work to electrify its roads.\There are a couple bills this session that would work to expand electric vehicle infrastructure across the state. The hope is that it will encourage more drivers to choose electric vehicles and create the potential economic growth that comes with it.\HB 1385 would allow utilities to create a pilot to establish an infrastructure program for electric vehicles. The other, HB 1168, focuses more on the manufacturing side of things, helping the auto manufacturers that call Indiana home to build out their ability to produce more electric vehicles.\Transportation\Bills with the potential to expand — or stall — public transportation across Indiana are moving through the legislature this year.\For Indianapolis residents, SB 141 could have a significant impact. The bill would withhold income tax revenue from Marion County if the county doesn't raise the amount of revenue required for assistance on a transportation project. That could endanger the Blue and Purple bus lines set to come to the city in the coming years.\On the other end of the spectrum, SB 9 would create an Indiana passenger rail commission for developing rail projects around the state and region.\Public transportation, in particular passenger rails that connect travelers to nearby cities, is touted as a major method for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. When the legislature halted funding for Amtrak's Hoosier State line in 2019, environmentalists criticized the decision for its impact on the state's emissions footprint.\Climate Change\Almost two thirds of Indiana is farmland, and some Indiana lawmakers want to put that land to work — sequestering greenhouse gases, that is. SB 373 would bring a carbon market to Indiana to pay farmers for methods that help to capture carbon in the soil.\Carbon markets, which have also been proposed by the Biden administration, have potential to be a source of income for farmers while also reducing emissions footprints. But skeptics question the logistics and fairness of implementing a carbon credit system.\Another bill, SB 121, would require Indiana University to study ""green"" industries and how they could impact Indiana's economic growth. HB 1344 would require the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to create a grant program for local governments to conduct greenhouse gas inventories.\Building and development\With HB 1342, more public buildings may be certified with LEED standards, the world's most widely used rating system for ""green"" buildings.\The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to measure the costs and benefits of building or upgrading public buildings with LEED standards, which include energy efficiency requirements. Indiana has historically ranked low among states when it comes to LEED-certified space per person.\Another bill, HB 1055, would establish a watershed development commission that could help to create flood control and drainage plans for watersheds across the state.\Recreation and wildlife\Indiana's forests have been a topic of much debate over the last several years, as some log cuts in state forests have left the public frustrated and concerned about wildlife habitat. State officials, environmentalists and industry can't seem to decide how the state's land and its wildlife should be managed.\Two bills proposed this year would set aside areas within state property, with HB 1222 geared toward protecting old growth areas and HB 1292 on preserving habitat for wildlife. The bills would also create some standards and requirements around how those areas are to be managed and used by state agencies.\Similar legislation has been unsuccessful in past years, but has continued to garner more support with every session.\Contact IndyStar reporter London Gibson at 317-419-1912 or lbgibson@gannett.com.

145,"As the gubernatorial race heads into its final month, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and Democratic challenger Dr. Woody Myers have mapped out strikingly different strategies to grow jobs while protecting the health and environment of Hoosiers.\Indiana's environmental issues have not let up much in recent years. The state is a top producer of carbon emissions and continues to struggle with widespread air and water pollution. At the same time, the cost of energy is rising and the impacts of climate change are hitting harder than ever before.\Holcomb, a lifelong Hoosier and a veteran of the U.S. Navy, doesn't list the environment as one of the top issues in his campaign. Before becoming governor four years ago, he worked as an adviser to former Gov. Mitch Daniels and formerly served as chairman of the Indiana Republican Party. He was lieutenant governor for a year under former Gov. Mike Pence.\Myers, a physician by trade and third-generation Hoosier, calls the environment one of the top-five is sues of his campaign, and criticizes Holcomb's record. He was appointed as the state health commissioner by former Gov. Robert Orr in 1985. He also ran against Andre Carson for Indiana's 7th Congressional District in 2008.\IndyStar questioned them about the environmental problems they believe are facing the state, as well as what they would like to see in Indiana's environmental future.\When it comes to energy and regulation, the candidates took different approaches. But there also were a few topics on which Holcomb and Myers agreed. Both acknowledged that public health and racial justice are tied to the environment, and pledged to address pollution that disproportionately affects marginalized communities.\IndyStar's environmental team sought interviews with Holcomb and Myers last month. Myers made himself available for a 45-minute interview and offered specific details related to issues such as energy and funding for the state environmental agency. Holcomb declined IndyStar's request for an interview. He also asked that IndyStar limit questions to fewer than 10, which he answered via email.\Here's what the candidates had to say.\Indiana is one of the country's top emitters of carbon dioxide, a climate change-causing greenhouse gas, according to a national energy agency. The state is also seeing effects of climate change, particularly with increased rain and flooding that affected the state's corn and soybean crops last year.\Such changes are expected to grow more severe and frequent, according to research by the Purdue Climate Change Research Center. Furthermore, when it comes to stewardship of the environment, Indiana has been ranked last or close to last on various surveys. On both issues, the candidates differ significantly.\Woody Myers\Climate change is among Myers' top priorities, according to his campaign website, along with education, healthcare, the economy and workforce. His campaign defines the climate crisis as both a national security and public health threat.\He echoed that sentiment during his interview, referencing the wildfires that are currently raging along the West Coast: That is ""partially our fault because we are not contributing to a reduction of consumption of fossil fuel as aggressively as we should. And it's wreaking havoc in our environment.""\Myers, 66, says his generation should take more responsibility on the issue.\""My generation, in essence, is part of the blame. We should have acted sooner, but it's not too late,"" Myers said. ""So it's my generation that ought to be the lead in fixing it.""\Myers said he feels the governor has put too little energy and attention into environmental stewardship, saying that ""we have had insufficient focus on the environment in Indiana.""\Some of the specific tenets of Myers' plan include doing an inventory of the state's greenhouse gas emissions and establishing reduction targets. He also wants to invite companies to purchase carbon offsets and enhance reforestation efforts.\Gov. Eric Holcomb\Holcomb's stance on climate change is a bit less clear. The governor's campaign website does not list the topic among his top-five priorities, which include the economy, workforce development, infrastructure and the drug epidemic. In fact, IndyStar could find no mention of the climate or environment on his website.\In response to a question about the environmental issues that were most important to him, Holcomb cited being responsible stewards of the state's natural resources and continuing to make improvements to the air and water. However, the words ""climate change"" were not among them.\When asked his beliefs on climate change and the role of humans in causing it, Holcomb said that ""while the extent of the contribution is debatable, especially depending on where on the planet you are, it's reasonable to assume that human activity contributes to changes in our climate over time.""\IndyStar asked the governor about the amount of attention he has given to environmental issues, referencing the roughly 30 seconds of a previous 26-minute State of the State address in which he talked about clean coal. Holcomb pushed back at the idea that his administration cares less about the environment: ""I don't accept the premise that environmental issues aren't a focus of my administration,"" he said. ""I could devote a full 26 minutes on the environment and just might consider doing so!""\In his response to IndyStar, Holcomb mentioned several environmental achievements under his administration. He touted his commitment to planting one million trees in five years, and is already a fifth of the way there, calling them ""natural scrubbers."" The state recently established two new state forests, though some advocates are concerned this will give the state more timber to harvest. He also said that Indiana is using more than $40 million from a legal settlement with Volkswagen to improve air quality — funds that can only be spent for such programs and policies under terms of the settlement.\""That's just part of our environmental record,"" Holcomb said.\More than half of Indiana's energy today still comes from coal, though some utilities have announced plans to retire their coal plants in the coming decade. Historically, Indiana's reliance on coal has kept energy prices low, and the state has used its cheaper-than-average energy to attract businesses. But over the last 10 years, Indiana's energy costs have risen by nearly 30% and it now finds itself in the middle of the pack compared to other states.\Many environmental advocates point to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, as cheaper than fossil fuels, and point out that the energy industry is transitioning on its own. Indiana lawmakers are in the midst of a task force to determine the state's energy policy for the future, though past policy decisions have slowed the transition from away from coal.\Gov. Eric Holcomb\When it comes to energy, Holcomb supports an all-of-the-above approach. This type of energy strategy includes renewable energy, but keeps fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal in the mix, as well. In the governor's 2017 State of the State address, he said that ""Indiana runs on coal.""\And he continued that sentiment in his responses to IndyStar, saying that his ""team is committed to supporting Indiana's most abundant and reliable energy sources, including the most allweather-reliable sources such as clean coal and gas."" That energy mix is ""helping to keep energy costs low for Hoosiers,"" according to Holcomb.\In 2017, the governor signed into law a bill that phased out net metering, a policy to make rooftop solar more affordable for homeowners — becoming one of a few states to do so. This year, he also signed a law that slowed the transition from coal and last year backed an ultimately unsuccessful bill that would have prevented new renewable projects.\Holcomb has said that he doesn't believe the environment and economy need to be at odds: ""We've shown in Indiana that we can have a roaring economy [prior to the pandemic] while also improving and conserving the environment."" He points to the fact that more than 80% percent of the state is farm or forest land.\Woody Myers\Myers is all about renewable energy, he told IndyStar: ""We still burn too much coal in Indiana, and it's time for us to declare that we are moving away from coal and we're not going to protect it anymore.""\Myers acknowledges that the state won't be able to ""get completely away"" from fossil fuels today, as there needs to be more developments in battery storage and grid updates. Still, ""the goal is to do that at one point,"" Myers said, ""but we can make much more progress now.""\In the meantime, Myers wants to bring back net metering as well as bring back a policy on energy efficiency and establish renewable standards. He also wants to put solar and wind on government buildings and properties such as correctional facilities, to establish rebates and credits for renewable technologies and to create incentives for renewable manufacturers to locate in Indiana.\Myers said he believes shifts to clean energy can create a boom in jobs and help grow the economy. There already are more jobs in Indiana in clean energy than in the coal industry, and Myers said he wants to focus on helping those coal communities transition to new, clean opportunities.\Indiana has one of the largest carbon emissions footprints in the country, at 176 million metric tons in 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Indiana ranks 8th in the country for total carbon emissions, but when factored for emissions per person, it outranks almost every other state, including Texas, Illinois and Florida. Indiana's average emissions per square mile is the highest of the top 10 states with the most total emissions.\In the last decade, funding for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management has fallen by 20%, even as state spending grew by 17%, with much of the loss affecting pollution control programs. The agency's staff also lost 150 employees in that time, causing many environmental experts to question whether the agency has the resources it needs to accomplish its job.\Air quality is not the only issue handled by IDEM. Many wastewater plants and industrial facilities in Indiana remain in significant noncompliance of the Clean Water Act, and even more are listed by the Environmental Protection Agency as having ""high priority violations"" of the Clean Air Act.\Gov. Eric Holcomb\Holcomb has in the past supported President Donald Trump's push to deregulate emissions from coal-fired power plants and other sources, in 2017 applauding his decision to reverse regulations on greenhouse gases.n He holds strong on that support today, after the Trump administration moved forward on dozens of rollbacks that experts say will likely lead to more air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\Holcomb argues that removing ""one-size-fits-all overregulation"" from the federal government will allow the state and Hoosier taxpayers to pursue the all-of-the-above energy mix, which he described as diverse and balanced.\""States know how to best craft environment policies that balance their needs. I support efforts by the current administration to return more authority, on a number of issues, back to the states,"" Holcomb said in an email. ""My point is, hold us accountable for our footprint.""\Holcomb last year signed a bill that would allow for an increase in IDEM permitting fees to offset the agency's funding decrease, but environmental advocates said that bill really only held the IDEM budget at its 2018 levels — still 20% lower than they were a decade before.\When asked whether he would consider reinstating funding for the environmental agency, Holcomb did not answer with a yes or no. Instead, he said the air and water are the cleanest they have been since the Clean Air and Water Acts, both passed between 40 and 50 years ago. He also said the Indiana Finance Authority has helped cities and towns save millions by upgrading water and sewer systems.\""My Administration doesn't measure our effectiveness by the number of dollars or personnel,"" Holcomb said in an email. ""We've got a great team at IDEM and they're continuing to make significant contributions to our state. ... We want to make sure we continue doing all our parts to keep improving our environment community by community.""\Woody Myers\Although he did not specifically respond to the rollbacks, Myers does not share Holcomb's positive view of Trump's approach to environmental issues.\""Trump is wrong,"" Myers said. ""He's wrong about so many things, but his denial of climate change is a part of the major problem in our environment. It's just wrong, climate change is real.""\Regarding environmental regulation within the state, Myers said he would also reinstate funding for IDEM.\Myers said if he is elected, he will ensure that IDEM was ""re-energized"" to address the state's issues.\This might entail ensuring that IDEM takes a look at current regulations, he said, to ensure that they are up-to-date with most recent recommendations and data. Myers said he would also work to make sure that IDEM hears public input, so that people feel they have voice in the decisions that are being made by the environmental agency\""IDEM needs a shot of epinephrine,"" Myers said, referencing the chemical also known as adrenaline. ""IDEM will get more resources, IDEM will get more attention, IDEM will do its job."""
146,"As the gubernatorial race heads into its final month, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and Democratic challenger Dr. Woody Myers have mapped out strikingly different strategies to grow jobs while protecting the health and environment of Hoosiers.\Indiana's environmental issues have not let up much in recent years. The state is a top producer of carbon emissions and continues to struggle with widespread air and water pollution. At the same time, the cost of energy is rising and the impacts of climate change are hitting harder than ever before.\Holcomb, a lifelong Hoosier and a veteran of the U.S. Navy, doesn't list the environment as one of the top issues in his campaign. Before becoming governor four years ago, he worked as an adviser to former Gov. Mitch Daniels and formerly served as chairman of the Indiana Republican Party. He was lieutenant governor for a year under former Gov. Mike Pence.\Myers, a physician by trade and third-generation Hoosier, calls the environment one of the top-five issues of his campaign, and criticizes Holcomb's record. He was appointed as the state health commissioner by former Gov. Robert Orr in 1985. He also ran against Andre Carson for Indiana's 7th Congressional District in 2008.\IndyStar questioned them about the environmental problems they believe are facing the state, as well as what they would like to see in Indiana's environmental future.\When it comes to energy and regulation, the candidates took different approaches.

At the same time, public outcry over systemic racism has also dominated much of the political conversation after the killing of George Floyd resulted in widespread protests over police brutality.\In the following months, the environmental community was also pushed to reflect on inequity within itself, as well as place higher priority on the systemic racism that puts Black communities at higher risk from pollution, hazardous waste and climate change. Air pollution has also been tied to more severe cases of COVID-19, which has also disproportionately impacted Black populations.\Dr. Woody Myers\Myers, previously the State Health Commissioner, at one point oversaw both the state health department and IDEM. During that time he said he saw the way that the environment directly impacted public health, such as how air pollution can lead to respiratory issues and heart problems.\""Another reason we care about the environment is because we care about health, right. So we've got to make sure that there is a linkage,"" Myers said. ""Everything has to have public health, I think, as its core.""\Citing the historic\ contamination in East Chicago neighborhoods that resulted in hundreds of children, mostly in Black communities, being affected by lead poisoning, Myers acknowledged that public health and the environment play a role in racial justice, as well.\Gov.

He said that could include environmental justice, telling IndyStar that ""all aspects of inequity are on the table."" A new chief equity, inclusion and opportunity officer will work with IDEM in the future, he said.\Investments in the environment will also benefit public health, which Holcomb said is a point of focus for him, through cleaning up soil, air and waterways.\""I do see the connection environmental factors have on public health, and we're making progress on improving both,"" he said in an email.

147,"Indianapolis Colts games. Cigar bars. Cocktail lounges and dinners at Indy's top spots.\It may sound like the life of a top CEO or a major celebrity. But in fact, it's all in a day's work for some Indiana legislators.\An IndyStar review has found that as the General Assembly was considering crucial energy legislation, utilities and their political action committees poured millions into the legislative body in the form of gifts, entertainment, campaign contributions and lobbying.\Gifts and entertainment? Check. During the 2015, 2016 and 2017 reporting periods, investor-owned utilities and the organization that represents them spent more than $109,000 entertaining Indiana General Assembly legislators. More than $32,000 was spent entertaining members of the Senate and House committees focused on utility legislation.\Campaign contributions? Check. Since the latest net metering policies were enacted in Indiana in 2011, political action committees representing Indiana's five investor-owned utilities have poured nearly $1.7million into state candidates.\Lobbying? A big check. From 2014 to the first half of 2017, utilities spent $2.78million on lobbying. More than $530,000 was spent in the first reporting period of 2017 alone, which included the 2017 legislative session and the months leading up to it.\But if money played any role in the passage of a crucial solar energy bill, so did words. One word in particular. Mimicking what has become a national strategy, utility leaders in Indiana, with the support of some Republican lawmakers, strategically rebranded net metering from an ""incentive"" to a ""subsidy.""\The issue at hand was a bill whose most controversial provision was to phase out net metering — the practice of requiring utilities to compensate customers who produce more energy than they consume, usually from rooftop solar panels. The passage of that bill, Senate Bill 309, has thrown Indiana's burgeoning solar installation industry into a pit of uncertainty.\""In the hallways, the lobbyists for the energy supply and utilities were telling legislators, 'Oh, it's a huge subsidy and all we're doing is subsidizing these wealthy people who can install,' which is far from the truth,"" said Sen. Mark Stoops, D-Bloomington, who voted against SB 309. ""That whole question of whether it was subsidized was blown out of proportion and was not accurately represented.""\Some would argue that net metering reflects Hoosier values, given it is a state founded on the pioneer principle of self-sufficiency. For the private homeowner who can make the investment, rooftop solar can mean relying less on the utility's grid for electricity, saving money on bills and earning tax credits from the federal government. It also helps the environment by producing clean energy.\But while some view rooftop solar as an innovative technology that is revolutionizing the electric industry, others fear it could change the way customers rely on the grid, inviting the end of the era of utilities' hold on how homeowners get their electricity.\The disruption that energy self-generation could cause to the industry is not likely to materialize instantaneously, but utilities are taking the long view. In each of their SEC filings, Indiana's investor-owned utilities — Duke, Indiana Michigan, Indianapolis Power & Light, NIPSCO and Vectren — list a form of self-generation or distributed generation among the ways that the companies could lose revenue.\For several years, Indiana believed in the value of incentivizing rooftop solar. The state implemented net metering in 2005, and in 2011, under Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission moved to make more solar customers eligible for the credit.\But then things changed. A 2013 report written for the Edison Electric Institute, a national organization representing investor-owned utilities, called distributed solar generation one prominent example of a ""threat to the utility model."" A year later, the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council used information from the EEI to craft model legislation to phase out net metering.\In 2015, Indiana legislators took their first shot at doing away with the program.\""I knew this was a push nationwide through the American Legislative Exchange Council, and energy companies and utilities were framing this as a subsidization issue,"" Stoops said. ""Pretty much a cut-and-paste ALEC bill with cut-and-paste ALEC arguments going on across the country, and Indiana was happy to play along.""\It would have allowed utilities to set their own rates and apply charges to customers who generate their own power. As in the case of SB 309, critics called that bill premature, and said that getting rid of net metering when Indiana's solar industry was in its infancy was like ""killing a fly with a sledgehammer.""\At least 50 people appeared at a February 2015 committee hearing to speak out against HB 1320, far outnumbering those who came in favor of the bill. Yet only eight opponents to the bill were allowed to speak before Rep. Heath VanNatter, then vice chair of the committee, cut public comment short.\VanNatter's treatment of the public comment process presented a procedural problem for the bill. According to those familiar with the process, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, declined to bring it to the floor for fear of a procedural boondoggle. So they left the bill where it was.\It would be two years before the next fight over net metering would be waged. In the meantime, Indiana utilities and the organization that represents them, the Indiana Energy Association, targeted lawmakers.\VanNatter, who still serves on the House Committee on Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications, was the top recipient of gifts and entertainment furnished by utilities. During the 2015, 2016, and 2017 reporting periods, he was treated to roughly $5,300 worth of meals, Colts games and other entertainment including at least one WWE match, which he and his son attended in March. Members of his family also were top recipients. In all, he and his family were recipients to nearly $8,500 in treats in a two-and-a-half year period. VanNatter, R-Kokomo, declined a request to be interviewed about gifts he received.\VanNatter also was a top recipient of campaign contributions. Since 2011, his campaigns received about $42,000 from PACs representing Indiana utilities. Other top recipients are also notable to the net metering process: Koch, author of the first anti-net metering bill, received more than $34,000 from utility PACs, as did Sen. James Merritt, R-Indianapolis, the current chair of the Senate Utilities Committees. Sen. Brandt Hershman, R-Wheatfield, author of SB 309 and former member of the Senate Utilities Committee, received at least $61,000.\The heavy presence of lobbyists was felt in the state house.\""(There's) no question, the utility lobby greatly overstated the potential impact that customer generators were having on the grid from an electricity rate perspective,"" said Jesse Kharbanda, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council. ""Secondly, you have much greater access by the utility lobby to key decision makers than any other stakeholder groups — we were outnumbered.""\That said, lobbying is commonplace on any number of issues before lawmakers. So, too, are gift-giving and donating to lawmaker campaigns. Also, net metering certainly wasn't the only issue of consequence for the energy industry from 2015-17, though it was a significant one.\""From a lobbying standpoint, I would tell you that it's really important for people to engage in the legislative process,"" said Mark Maassel, president of the utility lobby group Indiana Energy Association, who testified in favor of the solar bill earlier this year. ""We saw this as an important issue so the answer is yes, we did engage.""\Still, it was hardly a slam dunk for proponents of the bill. Homeowners, small business owners and environmental advocates staunchly opposed the bill, testifying at hearings that went on for as long as six hours. When the bill was finally brought to a vote, it won in the House by only 13 votes — a slim margin for Indiana's Republican-ruled House of Representatives.\At the same time that investor-owned utilities were sinking money into politicians, they and their allies were testifying against net metering in the name of protecting customers from cost-shifts — an issue they framed as preventing lower income consumers from subsidizing wealthier ratepayers who can afford solar panels.\""It becomes inherent in the calculations that people without solar are paying more than people who do have solar, in terms of really paying for the cost of the grid,"" said Maassel.\It's true that people who don't generate their own energy pay for some of the immediate costs that net metering customers don't. But studies suggest that when a market isn't overly saturated, the cost shifts are in fact minimal.\""Whether net metering really accounts to cost-shifting will depend on the rate structure and the high levels of penetration,"" said Kerwin Olson, executive director of consumer advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition. ""But in the state of Indiana we are nowhere near that — not even close.""\In Arizona, a favorite example cited by Maassel, Hershman and other proponents of the bill, the solar industry is much more developed. There were 84,750 net metering customers in that sunny state at the end of 2016, compared to Indiana's 1,116.\Hershman and Massel concede that Indiana isn't in the same boat as other states, and they emphasize that it was the rate of growth that makes them believe now was the time to act.\Despite the small size of Indiana's solar industry, the cost-shift or subsidy was the main issue backers of the bill brought to the floor, and pro-utility resources backed their claims. A 2016 paper from the pro-utility EEI — which was among the information Hershman provided to IndyStar when asked about his research behind the bill — put it this way: ""(T)he intent of net metering was to incentivize early adopters, not create huge subsidies from one group of customers to another.""\""If really you put pen to paper in Indiana right now and asked, 'Are these people really not paying their fair share?' I think it's so marginal it's not even worth looking at,"" Olson said. ""(It would amount to) maybe a nickel a year.""\While the argument over cost-shifting and subsidies took center-stage last March, it became apparent that there was another issue backers were advocating for: certainty in the utility market.\In March, Maassel told the general assembly, ""Our industry is in the midst of a very significant transition.""\Rep. Matt Pierce put it another way.\""This bill is a classic example of an entrenched old industry trying to do all it can to hobble a new and emerging industry,"" the Bloomington Democrat said, ""because the new industry will mess up its business model.""\That business model is slow to change course, according to Allyson Mitchell, director of sustainability with Prosperity Indiana, a group that foster economic development at the community level.\""Utilities are titanics, and they don't shift their business model well. Their entire model is based on the idea that the more energy that is demanded, the more they need to build things and the more that increases their bottom line,"" Mitchell said. ""From our perspective, 309 is another way of keeping the barriers to self-sufficiency and self-reliance in place.""\According to a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's Electricity Markets & Policy Group, the real drivers of changes in electric retail prices are capital expenditures — which can include investments in new power plants or even solar farms. Even when the Lab projects a 10 percent penetration rate for net-metered solar power (Indiana's penetration rate is less that 1 percent), it accounts for less of a cost-shift than capital expenditures.\Utilities can reclaim the cost of capital expenditures through rate increase requests put in front of the IURC. In 2015, the IURC approved a rate case for one Indiana utility to recover $38 million for solar investments. Capital expenditures tend to be how utilities make their profits.\Even before the first anti-net metering bill was brought into consideration in 2015, the IURC had a built-in mechanism for revisiting and reviewing the credit offered. The rules stated that, once net metering hit a certain level of saturation, the commission would review the policy.\They did this once before, in 2011. At the time, the commission traveled across the state to gather information about net metering. They concluded that it was in the state's interests to expand the program and allow more people to take advantage of the incentive.\In many other states, the regulatory body is the one that sets the rate for net metering. In Indiana, the commission is set up like a court of law. Utilities or customers submit briefs to the agency, providing testimony and evidence. It's based on this evidence that the IURC will make a decision to, for example, allow a utility to raise its rates in order to cover the costs of a capital investment or settle a dispute between a customer and a utility.\""The whole purpose of taxpayers funding the IURC is to develop a sound data-driven approach to public policy,"" said Kharbanda.\Net metering would not have its day in court — and the fact that no study was done on the status of net metering in Indiana concerned some lawmakers and opponents of the bill.\""A study is necessary when there are questions around a particular issue. In my particular viewpoint, if you look at the economics of net metering, it is very clear that there is a subsidy,"" Maassel said. ""The general assembly is in the ideal spot to say that this the kind of signal we want to send, this is the kind of encouragement we want to send. It's not based strictly on economics, it's based on the policy of Indiana and that's fine.""\Hershman said lawmakers did study a range of resources when crafting the policy, including news articles and a Government Accountability Office report on net metering, materials he provided to IndyStar upon request. But when asked about certain components of the bill, like how he reached the rate structure for net metering that will be in effect after the grandfathering period comes to a close, he responded with a verbal shrug.\""It was entirely arbitrary,"" he said. ""It's a public policy decision, as is everything else.""\Emily Hopkins covers the environment for IndyStar. Contact her at (317) 444-6409 or emily.hopkins@indystar.com.

Holcomb said this deregulation allows states to develop polices that best suit their needs.\Holcomb's Democratic opponent Dr. Woody Myers, on the other hand, wants to move the state aggressively toward renewable energy sources and get ""completely away"" from fossil fuels. He would reinstate net metering – a policy that makes rooftop solar more affordable for homeowners, which Holcomb started to phase out in 2017 – and put wind and solar on government buildings and properties.\Biden similarly wants to move toward clean energy in the coming decades, and believes that there is economic growth in making that transition. His $2 trillion climate plan includes additional investment in renewables, as well as further innovation and infrastructure in the field.\Trump has taken a deregulation approach to environmental policy, moving to roll back nearly 100 environmental rules in the past four years. Many of those are still in progress or being fought in court.\He's said that this stance prioritizes economic growth for industry and utility companies, but environmentalists worry the rollbacks could lead to worsening air quality in Indiana, one of the most coal-reliant states in the country. At a national level, research has shown these rollbacks could release significantly more greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the air.\Biden's climate plan would see a carbon-free energy sector across the country by 2035. But in Indiana, which ranks highly in the country for coal consumption, this is a tight time frame.\About 59% of the state's electricity comes from coal, while renewables accounted for only 7%. Although several utilities already plan to move away from coal in the next decade, others might not do so for another 20 years.\One thing Biden's plan does not include, to the dismay of some, is a carbon tax, which would tax greenhouse gas producers for their emissions.\Biden has made addressing climate change a major part of this platform, laying out ambitions to achieve net-zero emissions in the U.S. by 2050.\Woody Myers also lists climate as one of his top priorities, and said he considers the climate crisis as both a public health and national security threat.\Gov. Holcomb does not list climate change as a top priority, and has said the extent of human contribution is debatable, although it's ""reasonable to assume that human activity contributes to changes in our climate over time.""\President Trump has a starkly different stance on climate change, dismissing the science and calling it a hoax in the past.

150,"Chris Rohaly is no stranger to the sun. His hands have the faint resemblance of worn leather. And there are the lines converging at the crease of his eyes.\You could call the 56-year-old Kokomo resident a farmer. He harvests the sun.\Specifically, he is the owner of a solar energy company. But it's not his work installing solar panels that has him up before sunrise. It's the threat of no longer having work that keeps this small business owner from a restful sleep.\""A solid night's sleep has gotten a lot harder to come by in the last few months,"" Rohaly said. ""Are we going to be able to satisfy and keep the promises to all these people we've committed to by the end of the year? Am I going to be able to grow the jobs for my crew and my business into something more meaningful and permanent?""\The source of Rohaly's concern — and that of many other small business owners — is Senate Bill 309. The law, championed by the state's powerful utility industry, phases out net metering, which requires utilities to pay solar users for any excess energy that is created by their solar panels. The program was intended to provide an important incentive for Hoosiers to install expensive solar panels and produce their own energy that is better for the environment.\Rohaly, who is the co-founder of Green Alternatives, Inc., is among thousands of solar providers and their employees, as well as ratepayers, consumer and environmental advocates, schools and municipalities, who are anxiously watching what will happen when the law, passed in May, begins phasing out net metering on Jan. 1, 2018.\The law was pitched as a way to level the playing field between solar customers and the state's investor-owned utilities, who maintain net metering is an unnecessary subsidy paid for by other ratepayers. But an IndyStar investigation that looked at how such laws have played out in other states and how the law already is having an impact here suggests SB 309 could put an entire industry at risk of stagnation at best — and, at worst, collapse.\Among IndyStar's findings:\The phasing out of the incentive robs those considering solar of hundreds, if not thousands, in potential savings over the years. Already, solar companies told IndyStar that some would-be customers have decided to no longer choose the solar option — a decision that could stall Indiana's move toward cleaner, renewable energy.\Solar energy is increasing significantly across the U.S., so much so that the federal government says solar installers are the nation's fastest-growing occupation. But in a state where the governor and the general assembly tout the importance of small business and job growth, SB 309 is potentially a job killer. Fewer solar customers means fewer solar jobs.\An arbitrary deadline tucked into the law has created a short-term flood of customers trying to reap the full benefits of the incentive before it goes away. Problem is, Indiana's fledgling solar industry is not able to handle the crush, sending jobs and money to solar companies in neighboring states.\The utility companies' concern over a financial impact that net metering will have on other ratepayers has not yet happened and is likely overstated, leading some experts to tell IndyStar that the law was a premature, and perhaps, unnecessary preemptive strike seemingly designed less to protect ratepayers' wallets than the utility industry's bottom line.\Indiana's energy companies see it much differently. They believe the doomsday predictions about the impact of phasing out net metering is exaggerated. And while they acknowledge that net metering is not yet a burden for nonsolar ratepayers, it is prudent to act now before that happens.\""This has been an issue in front of the general assembly for several years now and the perspective in the industry remains the same: Indiana doesn't really have a problem right now with net metering,"" said Mark Maassel, president of the Indiana Energy Association, a lobbying group that represents the utility industry. ""But we are in a position to address the subsidies inherent in net metering now.""\While utility officials may disagree with solar companies and environmentalists about the impact of SB 309, all parties agree that solar is an increasingly important source of renewable energy. Solar puts more control back in consumers' hands over where their energy comes from and how much they pay for it. It puts skilled workers in high-paying jobs in the country's fastest growing occupation field. It puts fewer pollutants in the air than traditional fossil fuels that are burned for electricity. And solar puts Indiana on the map as an innovative and technology-focused economy.\The argument is squarely about whether net metering is necessary to push solar forward in Indiana.\Rep. Ron Bacon, R-Chandler, who has 96 solar panels on his property near Evansville, believes it is.\""I come from coal country down here, and still my constituents were heavily against this bill, and I even lobbied the governor after it passed that we didn't want him to sign it,"" Bacon said. ""We need to incentivize individuals and businesses and schools to be more self-sufficient.\""With 309 we are sending the wrong message, one that we are not for technology growth, expanding small business or a clean environment. The industry is growing rapidly, or right now it is. But what will happen after this policy? We don't know.""\Net metering, in its simplest form, credits customers for excess energy they produce that flows back to the grid — thus helping to offset electricity they consume from the utility at other times.\More than 40 states have some variation of the rule.\Indiana's policy is more than a decade old, but its most recent iteration was passed in 2011 under former Gov. Mitch Daniels. At that time, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission established more groups, such as businesses and municipalities, eligible for net metering. The body also increased the size or capacity of solar systems that could be credited at retail rates.\The IURC oversees the state's five investor-owned utilities: Duke Energy, Indianapolis Power and Light, Indiana Michigan Power, Northern Indiana Public Service Company and Vectren Energy.\""At the time we, had a net metering rule that was very restrictive and getting D's and F's in state rankings,"" said Laura Arnold, current president of the Indiana Distributed Energy Alliance, Inc. and someone who has worked in the utility and renewables field for more than 20 years.\""Then after 2011 we went to a solid B grade,"" she said, ""and people could get the return on their investment.""\Coupled with the decreasing cost of panel technology and rising electricity rates, this policy helped foster a small but growing market and the industry to serve them. In each of the last five years, the number of net metering customers across all major utilities grew by nearly 100 or more and by as many as 250 in 2016, according to reports by the commission.\But then came Senate Bill 309.\The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb in May and implemented July 1, set a deadline: Install solar panels by Dec. 31 to be locked in to the current incentive for 30 years. Meaning for every bit of energy a homeowner produces but doesn't use and sends back to the grid, the utility would credit them at the same price a customer buys electricity.\But for homeowners who miss that deadline, the incentive is reduced. Any homeowner who installs between next year through 2022 will receive that same rate only until 2032. Put another way, a homeowner who installs panels by Dec. 31 receives the incentive for 30 years; a homeowner who installs it the next day would receive the incentive for just 15 years.\All installations that occur after 2022 will receive the wholesale rate — a lower amount that utilities buy electricity for from the market — plus an additional 25 percent.\""Those changes, at best, cut in half a consumer's available amount of net metering, and throws their return on investment completely out of whack,"" said Allyson Mitchell, director of sustainability at Prosperity Indiana. ""Just when we were getting to a point where a much greater percent of the population was becoming able to pursue solar, then our state cuts that off again.""\Some installers have crunched the numbers.\For an average residential rooftop solar installation that is a net zero system — meaning it uses the amount of electricity it produces — the owner would pay about $200 a year in net metering and associated fees if grandfathered in to the current rates, according to Alex Jarvis, owner of Solar Systems of Indiana. With the new policy, the same system would cost its owner roughly $450 each year in billing.\That's a hard sell after Jan. 1, the installer of 10 years said.\That deadline also has had an unintentional effect: It's created an artificial explosion of demand.\Rohaly said his business is seeing more than double the activity it did this same time last year. Phil Teague of Rectify Solar said the third quarter is often his busiest, and this year it was busier than ever. Jarvis' small crew has worked 12-hour days, seven days a week in recent months.\Solar advocates, such as Arnold and Mitchell, as well as the installers, welcome this boom in business. Still, they don't want it to be misconstrued.\""We are riding the solarcoaster,"" Jarvis said. ""It's going up right now, but it will go down.""\Everyone is along for the ride — including customers.\The utility giants said they were just trying to keep the car from derailing, according to Maassel, to whom the energy companies pointed to speak on their behalf.\There is a fixed fee on every utility bill for infrastructure and maintenance, including solar owners' bills. Still, Maassel said that amount is not enough to cover those costs — thus this amounts to a subsidy or cost-shifting when nonsolar owners must make up the rest to maintain the grid.\When asked for specific numbers or dollar amounts being shifted in Indiana, however, he wasn't able to say.\Maassel acknowledges no study was completed to inform the new law. He also admits the impact on the state's ratepayers at the moment is negligible, because so few solar customers are connected to the grid.\So few, in fact, that the total customers participating in net metering in Indiana numbered only 1,116 as of last year — out of the more than 1.5 million residential, commercial and industrial customers to which the utilities supply electric services. The roughly 15,500 kilowatts of solar energy they generated in 2016 contributed less than a half percent of the utilities' peak load.\This comes in stark contrast to Arizona, to which Maassel pointed as an example of cost-shifting, where just one utility has more than 50,000 net metering customers and one gigawatt — or one million kilowatts — of solar on their system.\""But that was the advantage Indiana had,"" he said — to make this change early, before the numbers became noticeable.\That change came too early, according to many experts and advocates.\They acknowledge that a net metering incentive is not meant to be available forever, said Sean Gallagher, vice president of state affairs at Solar Energy Industries Association. But industry practices recommend reviewing and adjusting the policy when solar generation has reached around 4 percent or 5 percent of a state's electricity. Not Indiana's 0.3 percent.\""It's disappointing and really premature,"" Gallagher told IndyStar. ""Trying to chop off the head of solar prematurely doesn't really benefit anyone — not the growing industry, not really even the utilities and certainly not the customers.""\That means all customers, whether or not they have or are interested in solar.\Excess electricity from homes with solar goes to their neighbors first, which can be particularly helpful during those hot, air conditioning-heavy peak times.\Janet McCabe, of Indianapolis, had been considering solar for a while. As a former official in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's air quality office, she knows the importance of transitioning to cleaner energy sources.\Just 200 kilowatt hours of green energy each month — about 20 percent of an average residential customer's electricity use — helps to avoid 4,800 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to Duke Energy's own documents. This equates to taking one passenger car off the road for one year.\Air quality benefits provided by the growth in renewables can amount to more than $30 billion in savings from avoiding premature deaths and other pollution damages, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\McCabe worries what fossil fuels Indiana, historically a coal heavy state, will rely on if clean energy isn't encouraged. Her and her husband's solar plans were put into overdrive when SB 309 was passed.\""Like most homeowners, we had a list of house projects that are substantial in capital,"" she said. ""But this absolutely moved to the top of the list with the time pressure to get the most significant benefit.\""It's not that there is no benefit or advantage to solar after this year, it just steps down quite dramatically,"" she continued. ""From my experience, there are many states that seem to be much more encouraging of customer-generated and clean energy than Indiana.""\At its core, according to Kerwin Olson with the Citizens Action Coalition advocacy group, Indiana's new law removes customers' choice and their ability to be more self-sufficient.\""I don't think 309 will kill solar in Indiana,"" Olson said. ""What it will do is kill customer-owned solar.""\By killing customer-owned solar, it cripples the industry that serves those customers, as well.\""The economic implications of this bill were just not thought through,"" said Jesse Kharbanda, director of the Hoosier Environmental Council. ""I don't think lawmakers really appreciated the potential of the solar industry to Indiana.""\That potential, arguably, is massive.\Solar installers are the fastest growing occupation in the U.S.: The nearly 113,000 solar jobs in 2016 are expected to more than double in the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Approximately 2,700 of those jobs are in Indiana, the Solar Jobs Census reports, which is up from roughly 1,500 in 2015.\Yet, many of those new jobs in the state could be gone next year, as businesses are forced to lay off employees or move most of their work to other states.\""It's given us all ulcers and is a nagging fear for me,"" said Rohaly, the solar provider from Kokomo. ""This year we won't buy new equipment that we had planned to phase out so that I can hold back as much as possible to keep the payroll going as long as possible.""\Such was the case in Nevada — a more advanced market at nearly 8 percent saturation — after a decision that removed net metering. Half a dozen solar companies closed up shop, there was a more than 40 percent drop in solar installations and thousands of people lost their jobs, according to Lauren Randall, director of public policy at solar company Sunrun, which packed up its Nevada operations. Such ripple effects and customer backlash led the legislature to reinstate a net metering policy in June, Randall said, and the industry is rebounding — including the return of Sunrun.\Sen. Brandt Hershman, R-Wheatfield, who authored SB 309, does not believe the crickets next year will be as loud as installers and advocates fear. Yet some installers, including Rohaly, said they have received calls where individuals are no longer interested after learning it is too late to meet the Dec. 31 deadline and the panels would have to be installed in 2018.\""Net metering and the availability of it has been a critical driver, if not a necessary condition, of the growth of the solar market,"" said Galen Barbose, a research scientist on electricity markets and policy at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab.\The dropping prices of solar panels and related technology should help to make the investment more affordable in place of net metering, according to the utilities and Hershman.\That does not take into account, however, an international trade case where officials recommended Tuesday to limit imports on certain solar components and impose tariffs up to 35 percent on some products. Depending on President Donald Trump's ruling on these recommendations, Indiana stands to lose several hundred solar jobs, according to estimates by the solar industries association.\Hershman said the deadline, which he acknowledges was set arbitrarily, is nonetheless beneficial to provide Hoosiers with a sense of finality and certainty.\The only thing Indiana installers feel certain about is the need to diversify in the future to be able to survive — and that includes expanding their business to other states.\Indiana already is losing jobs to other states. Why? Indiana's solar industry is not large enough to accommodate that sudden crush of customers caused by the net metering deadline.\Wallace McMullen, chair of the state's Solar Energy Society, said he knows of at least one firm based out of Lexington, Ky., that has been the ""big beneficiary of the rush to install solar in Indiana.""\Even worse, the tremendous bump the industry is seeing in Indiana right now isn't accompanied by the same level of job growth. Not even close.\Rohaly said he has brought on a couple part-time workers, but with the explicit understanding the positions are only temporary. The owner of Indianapolis' Rectify Solar said he likely will have to bring in a California team to help complete his company's installations.

151,"From his backyard, Bruce Pfeffer can look up and see 32 solar panels mounted on the roof of his ranch house -- panels that soak up the sunshine and convert it into electricity.\When his solar system generates more electricity than he uses, the excess flows back into the grid for use elsewhere, and Pfeffer gets credits on his electric bill from Indianapolis Power & Light Co. The electric meter on his house keeps score.\""It was very cool at the beginning to watch the dial stop and spin backwards,"" Pfeffer said.\He and his wife, Amy Beth Kressel, use the electricity they generate to help power their house, located off Spring Mill Road on the Northwestside, and fuel their Think City two-seat electric car in their garage.\The system was expensive, about $30,000, or about as much as a new car. And so far, the savings are relatively modest, a few hundred dollars a year. So even with federal tax credits and a small grant from IPL, the system will take decades to pay for itself.\But more and more people around Indiana are starting to generate their own electricity, motivated by environmental concerns and feelings of energy independence.\The arrangement is known as ""net metering,"" allowing customers to offset part of their energy costs and feed the excess back to the utility for credit.\From 2010 to 2011, the number of Indiana customers taking part in net metering rose from 199 to 298 -- a 50 percent increase, according to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.\The maximum output from those renewable facilities increased by 136 percent, from 783 kilowatts to 1,852 kilowatts.\It's not just households taking part. Schools, churches, apartment complexes, government buildings and commercial properties are jumping into the game, installing solar panels, wind turbines and other renewable energy systems, lessening their dependence on the electrical grid.\It's the beginning of a big change here. For years, Indiana lagged the nation in net metering and received low marks from renewable energy advocates. ""Freeing the Grid,"" an annual report, regularly gave Indiana ""D"" and ""F"" marks.\But the most recent report, issued last week, awarded Indiana ""B"" grades in two broad categories, net-metering policies and interconnection procedures. That big leap earned Indiana the ""most improved"" ranking among all 50 states in the report, published by the Network for New Energy Choices and The Solar Vote Initiative.\Some local environmental groups are hailing Indiana for starting to catch up. They expect the numbers to multiply in coming years as more households and large commercial customers jump on board.\""It's good for Indiana, good for the environment, good for customers,"" said Bowden Quinn of the Sierra Club's Hoosier chapter.\Expanding program\A big reason for the improvement: the state's decision last year to expand net metering to allow commercial and industrial customers to participate through a rule approved by the IURC. Previously, only residential customers and K-12 schools could take part in net metering.\The IURC also expanded the maximum size of an eligible facility from 10 kilowatts (an average house uses between 3 and 5 kilowatts) to 1 megawatt (enough for a factory).\But Indiana still has a long way to go, and other states remain far ahead. Massachusetts, for example, allows up to 10 megawatts for net metering by a municipality or other government entity -- the equivalent of powering tens of thousands of households. It allows up to 2 megawatts for other large users.\And not all renewable energy advocates are sold that Indiana is pushing hard enough in this direction. They say Indiana has been dragging its feet and warn that recent improvements are not cause for a huge celebration.\""When you've been at the bottom of the barrel for so long, the only direction is up,"" said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana.\For years, Indiana had one of the weakest net-metering laws in the nation. Efforts to expand the program died in the 2009 and 2010 legislative sessions despite bipartisan support. Some lawmakers wanted to limit net metering here to 200 kilowatts, saying it was enough capacity for every homeowner and most businesses.\Others wanted to let customers generate as many kilowatts as they wanted. They said that utilities opposed an expansion because they were concerned about losing large customers.\""Utilities were really scared about it,"" said state Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, a longtime advocate of net metering.\Cautious utilities\Some utilities admit they opposed any huge increase in net metering. ""It would reduce revenues to the utility,"" said John Haselden, principal engineer for regulator affairs at IPL.\But he pointed out that his company expanded its net-metering limits from 10 megawatts to 50 megawatts two years ago.\Another limitation in Indiana: only customers of the five investor-owned utilities (IPL, Duke Energy, Vectren, North Indiana Public Service Co. and Indiana Michigan Power Co.) are automatically eligible. The rural power cooperatives, which serve about 500,000 customers, are not required to take part.\Even so, Indiana is still ahead of some states. Alabama, Idaho, Mississippi, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas have no statewide net metering. More than a dozen states have no formal procedures on what kind of renewable technologies are eligible.\Some energy contractors in Indiana that install the solar panels, wind turbines and other technology, say they are seeing more business in the past year or so and expect that to increase.\""You're going to see larger industrial customers take advantage of net metering and large installations at school systems, potentially,"" said Travis Murphy, business development manager at Johnson Melloh Solutions, an energy contractor. The company, located near Indianapolis International Airport, recently installed a 5-kilowatt solar array on its property to help provide savings for itself.\But some utilities don't sound so sure that a flood of new customers will begin installing solar panels or wind turbines. IPL has only 12 customers signed up for net metering, representing just a speck of its 470,000 customers. Duke Energy, which has more than 700,000 customers, says only 160 participate in net metering, including 18 schools and 29 businesses.\And most customers still use more electricity than they generate with net metering. At Vectren, only three of the 22 customers signed up for net metering generate more electricity than they use, said Chase Kelley, a company spokeswoman. Altogether, they generate only about 9,000 kilowatt hours, not enough to power one house for a year, she said.\Meanwhile, the upfront installation cost is large, the savings are modest and the reliability is spotty.\""The wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine in Indiana,"" she said.\Still, some customers that have switched over say they are glad they did. Joe Smiddie-Brush installed 10 solar panels last week at his home in the Broad Ripple area after thinking about it for years. He spent about $13,000 and expects to break even in a dozen years or so.\Gary Hobbs installed eight solar panels last fall at an apartment complex he owns near 46th Street and Arlington Avenue, called Staughton Senior Community, as a part of a major upgrade. He said he already has seen up to 40 percent savings on his electricity bills.\""I've been very happy with it,"" Hobbs said. ""I think more people should consider it.""\The Louisville Courier-Journal contributed to this story.\Call Star reporter John Russell at (317) 444-6283. Follow him on Twitter @johnrussell99.\Want to plug into the grid?\Here are a few things to consider if you want to install a renewable energy system under net metering:\You will have to pay all installation costs, which can easily top $20,000 for a dozen solar panels and related equipment on a single-family house. You also will be responsible for any maintenance fees and the cost of connecting to the grid.\You will need to find a contractor or installer to do the work. Many offer payment programs or lease-to-buy options. Search the Web under ""energy contractors"" or ""renewable energy installers.""\You will have to apply through your electric utility. The utility will want to know the name of your contractor or installer, and what kind of renewable energy system you are considering. It might ask you to provide a diagram of the electrical equipment.\The utilities will conduct a technical review of your plan and will require you to sign interconnection and net-metering agreements.\If you belong to a rural electric cooperative, you might not be eligible for net metering. Only Indiana's five investor-owned utilities are required to offer net metering.\To find specific information from your utility, visit your utility's website and search under ""net metering."""
152,"""We need to incentivize individuals and businesses and schools to be more self-sufficient.""\Rep. Ron Bacon\INDIANAPOLIS – Chris Rohaly is no stranger to the sun. His hands have the faint resemblance of worn leather. And there are the lines converging at the crease of his eyes.\You could call the 56-year-old Kokomo resident a farmer. He harvests the sun.\Specifically, he is the owner of a solar energy company. But it's not his work installing solar panels that has him up before sunrise. It's the threat of no longer having work that keeps this small business owner from a restful sleep.\""A solid night's sleep has gotten a lot harder to come by in the last few months,"" Rohaly said. ""Are we going to be able to satisfy and keep the promises to all these people we've committed to by the end of the year? Am I going to be able to grow the jobs for my crew and my business into something more meaningful and permanent?""\The source of Rohaly's concern — and that of many other small business owners — is Senate Bill 309. The law, championed by the state's powerful utility industry, phases out net metering, which requires utilities to pay solar users for any excess energy that is created by their solar panels. The program was intended to provide an important incentive for Hoosiers to install expensive solar panels and produce their own energy that is better for the environment.\Rohaly, who is the co-founder of Green Alternatives, Inc., is among thousands of solar providers and their employees, as well as ratepayers, consumer and environmental advocates, schools and municipalities, who are anxiously watching what will happen when the law, passed in May, begins phasing out net metering on Jan. 1, 2018.\The law was pitched as a way to level the playing field between solar customers and the state's investor-owned utilities, who maintain net metering is an unnecessary subsidy paid for by other ratepayers. But an IndyStar investigation that looked at how such laws have played out in other states and how the law already is having an impact here suggests SB 309 could put an entire industry at risk of stagnation at best — and, at worst, collapse.\Among IndyStar's findings:\The phasing out of the incentive robs those considering solar of hundreds, if not thousands, in potential savings over the years. Already, solar companies told IndyStar that some would-be customers have decided to no longer choose the solar option — a decision that could stall Indiana's move toward cleaner, renewable energy.\Solar energy is increasing significantly across the U.S., so much so that the federal government says solar installers are the nation's fastest-growing occupation. But in a state where the governor and the general assembly tout the importance of small business and job growth, SB 309 is potentially a job killer. Fewer solar customers means fewer solar jobs.\An arbitrary deadline tucked into the law has created a short-term flood of customers trying to reap the full benefits of the incentive before it goes away. Problem is, Indiana's fledgling solar industry is not able to handle the crush, sending jobs and money to solar companies in neighboring states.\The utility companies' concern over a financial impact that net metering will have on other ratepayers has not yet happened and is likely overstated, leading some experts to tell IndyStar that the law was a premature, and perhaps, unnecessary preemptive strike seemingly designed less to protect ratepayers' wallets than the utility industry's bottom line.\Indiana's energy companies see it much differently. They believe the doomsday predictions about the impact of phasing out net metering is exaggerated. And while they acknowledge that net metering is not yet a burden for nonsolar ratepayers, it is prudent to act now before that happens.\""This has been an issue in front of the general assembly for several years now and the perspective in the industry remains the same: Indiana doesn't really have a problem right now with net metering,"" said Mark Maassel, president of the Indiana Energy Association, a lobbying group that represents the utility industry. ""But we are in a position to address the subsidies inherent in net metering now.""\While utility officials may disagree with solar companies and environmentalists about the impact of SB 309, all parties agree that solar is an increasingly important source of renewable energy. Solar puts more control back in consumers' hands over where their energy comes from and how much they pay for it. It puts skilled workers in high-paying jobs in the country's fastest growing occupation field. It puts fewer pollutants in the air than traditional fossil fuels that are burned for electricity. And solar puts Indiana on the map as an innovative and technology-focused economy.\The argument is squarely about whether net metering is necessary to push solar forward in Indiana.\Rep. Ron Bacon, R-Chandler, who has 96 solar panels on his property near Evansville, believes it is.\""I come from coal country down here, and still my constituents were heavily against this bill, and I even lobbied the governor after it passed that we didn't want him to sign it,"" Bacon said. ""We need to incentivize individuals and businesses and schools to be more self-sufficient.\""With 309 we are sending the wrong message, one that we are not for technology growth, expanding small business or a clean environment. The industry is growing rapidly, or right now it is. But what will happen after this policy? We don't know.""\Net metering, in its simplest form, credits customers for excess energy they produce that flows back to the grid — thus helping to offset electricity they consume from the utility at other times.\More than 40 states have some variation of the rule.\Indiana's policy is more than a decade old, but its most recent iteration was passed in 2011 under former Gov. Mitch Daniels. At that time, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission established more groups, such as businesses and municipalities, eligible for net metering. The body also increased the size or capacity of solar systems that could be credited at retail rates.\The IURC oversees the state's five investor-owned utilities: Duke Energy, Indianapolis Power and Light, Indiana Michigan Power, Northern Indiana Public Service Company and Vectren Energy.\""At the time we, had a net metering rule that was very restrictive and getting D's and F's in state rankings,"" said Laura Arnold, current president of the Indiana Distributed Energy Alliance, Inc. and someone who has worked in the utility and renewables field for more than 20 years.\""Then after 2011 we went to a solid B grade,"" she said, ""and people could get the return on their investment.""\Coupled with the decreasing cost of panel technology and rising electricity rates, this policy helped foster a small but growing market and the industry to serve them. In each of the last five years, the number of net metering customers across all major utilities grew by nearly 100 or more and by as many as 250 in 2016, according to reports by the commission.\But then came Senate Bill 309.\The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb in May and implemented July 1, set a deadline: Install solar panels by Dec. 31 to be locked in to the current incentive for 30 years. Meaning for every bit of energy a homeowner produces but doesn't use and sends back to the grid, the utility would credit them at the same price a customer buys electricity.\But for homeowners who miss that deadline, the incentive is reduced. Any homeowner who installs between next year through 2022 will receive that same rate only until 2032. Put another way, a homeowner who installs panels by Dec. 31 receives the incentive for 30 years; a homeowner who installs it the next day would receive the incentive for just 15 years.\All installations that occur after 2022 will receive the wholesale rate — a lower amount that utilities buy electricity for from the market — plus an additional 25 percent.\""Those changes, at best, cut in half a consumer's available amount of net metering, and throws their return on investment completely out of whack,"" said Allyson Mitchell, director of sustainability at Prosperity Indiana. ""Just when we were getting to a point where a much greater percent of the population was becoming able to pursue solar, then our state cuts that off again.""\Some installers have crunched the numbers.\For an average residential rooftop solar installation that is a net zero system — meaning it uses the amount of electricity it produces — the owner would pay about $200 a year in net metering and associated fees if grandfathered in to the current rates, according to Alex Jarvis, owner of Solar Systems of Indiana. With the new policy, the same system would cost its owner roughly $450 each year in billing.\That's a hard sell after Jan. 1, the installer of 10 years said.\That deadline also has had an unintentional effect: It's created an artificial explosion of demand.\Rohaly said his business is seeing more than double the activity it did this same time last year. Phil Teague of Rectify Solar said the third quarter is often his busiest, and this year it was busier than ever. Jarvis' small crew has worked 12-hour days, seven days a week in recent months.\Solar advocates, such as Arnold and Mitchell, as well as the installers, welcome this boom in business. Still, they don't want it to be misconstrued.\""We are riding the solarcoaster,"" Jarvis said. ""It's going up right now, but it will go down.""\Everyone is along for the ride — including customers.\The utility giants said they were just trying to keep the car from derailing, according to Maassel, to whom the energy companies pointed to speak on their behalf.\There is a fixed fee on every utility bill for infrastructure and maintenance, including solar owners' bills. Still, Maassel said that amount is not enough to cover those costs — thus this amounts to a subsidy or cost-shifting when nonsolar owners must make up the rest to maintain the grid.\When asked for specific numbers or dollar amounts being shifted in Indiana, however, he wasn't able to say.\Maassel acknowledges no study was completed to inform the new law. He also admits the impact on the state's ratepayers at the moment is negligible, because so few solar customers are connected to the grid.\So few, in fact, that the total customers participating in net metering in Indiana numbered only 1,116 as of last year — out of the more than 1.5 million residential, commercial and industrial customers to which the utilities supply electric services. The roughly 15,500 kilowatts of solar energy they generated in 2016 contributed less than a half percent of the utilities' peak load.\This comes in stark contrast to Arizona, to which Maassel pointed as an example of cost-shifting, where just one utility has more than 50,000 net metering customers and one gigawatt — or one million kilowatts — of solar on their system.\""But that was the advantage Indiana had,"" he said — to make this change early, before the numbers became noticeable.\That change came too early, according to many experts and advocates.\They acknowledge that a net metering incentive is not meant to be available forever, said Sean Gallagher, vice president of state affairs at Solar Energy Industries Association. But industry practices recommend reviewing and adjusting the policy when solar generation has reached around 4 percent or 5 percent of a state's electricity. Not Indiana's 0.3 percent.\""It's disappointing and really premature,"" Gallagher told IndyStar. ""Trying to chop off the head of solar prematurely doesn't really benefit anyone — not the growing industry, not really even the utilities and certainly not the customers.""\That means all customers, whether or not they have or are interested in solar.\Excess electricity from homes with solar goes to their neighbors first, which can be particularly helpful during those hot, air conditioning-heavy peak times.\Janet McCabe, of Indianapolis, had been considering solar for a while. As a former official in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's air quality office, she knows the importance of transitioning to cleaner energy sources.\Just 200 kilowatt hours of green energy each month — about 20 percent of an average residential customer's electricity use — helps to avoid 4,800 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to Duke Energy's own documents. This equates to taking one passenger car off the road for one year.\Air quality benefits provided by the growth in renewables can amount to more than $30 billion in savings from avoiding premature deaths and other pollution damages, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\McCabe worries what fossil fuels Indiana, historically a coal heavy state, will rely on if clean energy isn't encouraged. Her and her husband's solar plans were put into overdrive when SB 309 was passed.\""Like most homeowners, we had a list of house projects that are substantial in capital,"" she said. ""But this absolutely moved to the top of the list with the time pressure to get the most significant benefit.\""It's not that there is no benefit or advantage to solar after this year, it just steps down quite dramatically,"" she continued. ""From my experience, there are many states that seem to be much more encouraging of customer-generated and clean energy than Indiana.""\At its core, according to Kerwin Olson with the Citizens Action Coalition advocacy group, Indiana's new law removes customers' choice and their ability to be more self-sufficient.\""I don't think 309 will kill solar in Indiana,"" Olson said. ""What it will do is kill customer-owned solar.""\By killing customer-owned solar, it cripples the industry that serves those customers, as well.\""The economic implications of this bill were just not thought through,"" said Jesse Kharbanda, director of the Hoosier Environmental Council. ""I don't think lawmakers really appreciated the potential of the solar industry to Indiana.""\That potential, arguably, is massive.\Solar installers are the fastest growing occupation in the U.S.: The nearly 113,000 solar jobs in 2016 are expected to more than double in the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Approximately 2,700 of those jobs are in Indiana, the Solar Jobs Census reports, which is up from roughly 1,500 in 2015.\Yet, many of those new jobs in the state could be gone next year, as businesses are forced to lay off employees or move most of their work to other states.\""It's given us all ulcers and is a nagging fear for me,"" said Rohaly, the solar provider from Kokomo. ""This year we won't buy new equipment that we had planned to phase out so that I can hold back as much as possible to keep the payroll going as long as possible.""\Such was the case in Nevada — a more advanced market at nearly 8 percent saturation — after a decision that removed net metering. Half a dozen solar companies closed up shop, there was a more than 40 percent drop in solar installations and thousands of people lost their jobs, according to Lauren Randall, director of public policy at solar company Sunrun, which packed up its Nevada operations. Such ripple effects and customer backlash led the legislature to reinstate a net metering policy in June, Randall said, and the industry is rebounding — including the return of Sunrun.\Sen. Brandt Hershman, R-Wheatfield, who authored SB 309, does not believe the crickets next year will be as loud as installers and advocates fear. Yet some installers, including Rohaly, said they have received calls where individuals are no longer interested after learning it is too late to meet the Dec. 31 deadline and the panels would have to be installed in 2018.\""Net metering and the availability of it has been a critical driver, if not a necessary condition, of the growth of the solar market,"" said Galen Barbose, a research scientist on electricity markets and policy at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab.\The dropping prices of solar panels and related technology should help to make the investment more affordable in place of net metering, according to the utilities and Hershman.\That does not take into account, however, an international trade case where officials recommended Tuesday to limit imports on certain solar components and impose tariffs up to 35 percent on some products. Depending on President Donald Trump's ruling on these recommendations, Indiana stands to lose several hundred solar jobs, according to estimates by the solar industries association.\Hershman said the deadline, which he acknowledges was set arbitrarily, is nonetheless beneficial to provide Hoosiers with a sense of finality and certainty.\The only thing Indiana installers feel certain about is the need to diversify in the future to be able to survive — and that includes expanding their business to other states.\Indiana already is losing jobs to other states. Why? Indiana's solar industry is not large enough to accommodate that sudden crush of customers caused by the net metering deadline.\Wallace McMullen, chair of the state's Solar Energy Society, said he knows of at least one firm based out of Lexington, Ky., that has been the ""big beneficiary of the rush to install solar in Indiana.""\Even worse, the tremendous bump the industry is seeing in Indiana right now isn't accompanied by the same level of job growth. Not even close.\Rohaly said he has brought on a couple part-time workers, but with the explicit understanding the positions are only temporary. The owner of Indianapolis' Rectify Solar said he likely will have to bring in a California team to help complete his company's installations. And Bob McKinney, president at Johnson-Melloh Solutions, said he is looking to hire full-time employees, but it is a ""tough landscape"" to bring someone to Indiana when they see the changes under bill 309.\""For being 'A State that Works,' why do we have to work so hard to provide jobs?"" McKinney asked. ""Since when did economic choice and opportunity become a bad thing — I just keep coming back to why this is so hard to do here.""\This is the first of two stories examining the solar industry in Indiana and the effects of Senate Bill 309.

153,"INDIANAPOLIS – Indianapolis Colts games. Cigar bars. Cocktail lounges and dinners at Indy's top spots.\It may sound like the life of a top CEO or a major celebrity. But in fact, it's all in a day's work for some Indiana legislators.\An IndyStar review has found that as the General Assembly was considering crucial energy legislation, utilities and their political action committees poured millions into the legislative body in the form of gifts, entertainment, campaign contributions and lobbying.\Gifts and entertainment? Check. During the 2015, 2016 and 2017 reporting periods, investor-owned utilities and the organization that represents them spent more than $109,000 entertaining Indiana General Assembly legislators. More than $32,000 was spent entertaining members of the Senate and House committees focused on utility legislation.\Campaign contributions? Check. Since the latest net metering policies were enacted in Indiana in 2011, political action committees representing Indiana's five investor-owned utilities have poured nearly $1.7million into state candidates.\Lobbying? A big check. From 2014 to the first half of 2017, utilities spent $2.78million on lobbying. More than $530,000 was spent in the first reporting period of 2017 alone, which included the 2017 legislative session and the months leading up to it.\But if money played any role in the passage of a crucial solar energy bill, so did words. One word in particular. Mimicking what has become a national strategy, utility leaders in Indiana, with the support of some Republican lawmakers, strategically rebranded net metering from an ""incentive"" to a ""subsidy.""\The issue at hand was a bill whose most controversial provision was to phase out net metering — the practice of requiring utilities to compensate customers who produce more energy than they consume, usually from rooftop solar panels. The passage of that bill, Senate Bill 309, has thrown Indiana's burgeoning solar installation industry into a pit of uncertainty.\""In the hallways, the lobbyists for the energy supply and utilities were telling legislators, 'Oh, it's a huge subsidy and all we're doing is subsidizing these wealthy people who can install,' which is far from the truth,"" said Sen. Mark Stoops, D-Bloomington, who voted against SB 309. ""That whole question of whether it was subsidized was blown out of proportion and was not accurately represented.""\Some would argue that net metering reflects Hoosier values, given it is a state founded on the pioneer principle of self-sufficiency. For the private homeowner who can make the investment, rooftop solar can mean relying less on the utility's grid for electricity, saving money on bills and earning tax credits from the federal government. It also helps the environment by producing clean energy.\But while some view rooftop solar as an innovative technology that is revolutionizing the electric industry, others fear it could change the way customers rely on the grid, inviting the end of the era of utilities' hold on how homeowners get their electricity.\The disruption that energy self-generation could cause to the industry is not likely to materialize instantaneously, but utilities are taking the long view. In each of their SEC filings, Indiana's investor-owned utilities — Duke, Indiana Michigan, Indianapolis Power & Light, NIPSCO and Vectren — list a form of self-generation or distributed generation among the ways that the companies could lose revenue.\For several years, Indiana believed in the value of incentivizing rooftop solar. The state implemented net metering in 2005, and in 2011, under Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission moved to make more solar customers eligible for the credit.\But then things changed. A 2013 report written for the Edison Electric Institute, a national organization representing investor-owned utilities, called distributed solar generation one prominent example of a ""threat to the utility model."" A year later, the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council used information from the EEI to craft model legislation to phase out net metering.\In 2015, Indiana legislators took their first shot at doing away with the program.\""I knew this was a push nationwide through the American Legislative Exchange Council, and energy companies and utilities were framing this as a subsidization issue,"" Stoops said. ""Pretty much a cut-and-paste ALEC bill with cut-and-paste ALEC arguments going on across the country, and Indiana was happy to play along.""\It would have allowed utilities to set their own rates and apply charges to customers who generate their own power. As in the case of SB 309, critics called that bill premature, and said that getting rid of net metering when Indiana's solar industry was in its infancy was like ""killing a fly with a sledgehammer.""\At least 50 people appeared at a February 2015 committee hearing to speak out against HB 1320, far outnumbering those who came in favor of the bill. Yet only eight opponents to the bill were allowed to speak before Rep. Heath VanNatter, then vice chair of the committee, cut public comment short.\VanNatter's treatment of the public comment process presented a procedural problem for the bill. According to those familiar with the process, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, declined to bring it to the floor for fear of a procedural boondoggle. So they left the bill where it was.\It would be two years before the next fight over net metering would be waged. In the meantime, Indiana utilities and the organization that represents them, the Indiana Energy Association, targeted lawmakers.\VanNatter, who still serves on the House Committee on Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications, was the top recipient of gifts and entertainment furnished by utilities. During the 2015, 2016, and 2017 reporting periods, he was treated to roughly $5,300 worth of meals, Colts games and other entertainment including at least one WWE match, which he and his son attended in March. Members of his family also were top recipients. In all, he and his family were recipients to nearly $8,500 in treats in a two-and-a-half year period. VanNatter, R-Kokomo, declined a request to be interviewed about gifts he received.\VanNatter also was a top recipient of campaign contributions. Since 2011, his campaigns received about $42,000 from PACs representing Indiana utilities. Other top recipients are also notable to the net metering process: Koch, author of the first anti-net metering bill, received more than $34,000 from utility PACs, as did Sen. James Merritt, R-Indianapolis, the current chair of the Senate Utilities Committees. Sen. Brandt Hershman, R-Wheatfield, author of SB 309 and former member of the Senate Utilities Committee, received at least $61,000.\The heavy presence of lobbyists was felt in the state house.\""(There's) no question, the utility lobby greatly overstated the potential impact that customer generators were having on the grid from an electricity rate perspective,"" said Jesse Kharbanda, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council. ""Secondly, you have much greater access by the utility lobby to key decision makers than any other stakeholder groups — we were outnumbered.""\That said, lobbying is commonplace on any number of issues before lawmakers. So, too, are gift-giving and donating to lawmaker campaigns. Also, net metering certainly wasn't the only issue of consequence for the energy industry from 2015-17, though it was a significant one.\""From a lobbying standpoint, I would tell you that it's really important for people to engage in the legislative process,"" said Mark Maassel, president of the utility lobby group Indiana Energy Association, who testified in favor of the solar bill earlier this year. ""We saw this as an important issue so the answer is yes, we did engage.""\Still, it was hardly a slam dunk for proponents of the bill. Homeowners, small business owners and environmental advocates staunchly opposed the bill, testifying at hearings that went on for as long as six hours. When the bill was finally brought to a vote, it won in the House by only 13 votes.\At the same time that investor-owned utilities were sinking money into politicians, they and their allies were testifying against net metering in the name of protecting customers from cost-shifts — an issue they framed as preventing lower income consumers from subsidizing wealthier ratepayers who can afford solar panels.\""It becomes inherent in the calculations that people without solar are paying more than people who do have solar, in terms of really paying for the cost of the grid,"" said Maassel.\It's true that people who don't generate their own energy pay for some of the immediate costs that net metering customers don't. But studies suggest that when a market isn't overly saturated, the cost shifts are in fact minimal.\""Whether net metering really accounts to cost-shifting will depend on the rate structure and the high levels of penetration,"" said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition. ""But in the state of Indiana we are nowhere near that — not even close.""\In Arizona, a favorite example cited by Maassel, Hershman and other proponents of the bill, the solar industry is more developed. There were 84,750 net metering customers in that sunny state at the end of 2016, compared to Indiana's 1,116.\Hershman and Massel concede that Indiana isn't in the same boat as other states, and they emphasize that it was the rate of growth that makes them believe now was the time to act.\Despite the small size of Indiana's solar industry, the cost-shift or subsidy was the main issue backers of the bill brought to the floor, and pro-utility resources backed their claims. A 2016 paper from the pro-utility EEI put it this way: ""(T)he intent of net metering was to incentivize early adopters, not create huge subsidies from one group of customers to another.""\""If really you put pen to paper in Indiana right now and asked, 'Are these people really not paying their fair share?' I think it's so marginal it's not even worth looking at,"" Olson said. ""(It would amount to) maybe a nickel a year.""\While the argument over cost-shifting and subsidies took center-stage last March, it became apparent that there was another issue backers were advocating for: certainty in the utility market.\In March, Maassel told the general assembly, ""Our industry is in the midst of a very significant transition.""\Rep. Matt Pierce put it another way.\""This bill is a classic example of an entrenched old industry trying to do all it can to hobble a new and emerging industry,"" the Bloomington Democrat said, ""because the new industry will mess up its business model.""\That business model is slow to change course, according to Allyson Mitchell, director of sustainability with Prosperity Indiana, a group that foster economic development at the community level.\""Utilities are titanics, and they don't shift their business model well. Their entire model is based on the idea that the more energy that is demanded, the more they need to build things and the more that increases their bottom line,"" Mitchell said. ""From our perspective, 309 is another way of keeping the barriers to self-sufficiency and self-reliance in place.""\According to a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's Electricity Markets & Policy Group, the real drivers of changes in electric retail prices are capital expenditures — which can include investments in new power plants or even solar farms. Even when the Lab projects a 10 percent penetration rate for net-metered solar power (Indiana's penetration rate is less that 1 percent), it accounts for less of a cost-shift than capital expenditures.\Utilities can reclaim the cost of capital expenditures through rate increase requests put in front of the IURC. In 2015, the IURC approved a rate case for one Indiana utility to recover $38 million for solar investments. Capital expenditures tend to be how utilities make their profits.\Even before the first anti-net metering bill was brought into consideration in 2015, the IURC had a built-in mechanism for revisiting and reviewing the credit offered. The rules stated that, once net metering hit a certain level of saturation, the commission would review the policy.\They did this once before, in 2011. At the time, the commission traveled across the state to gather information about net metering. They concluded that it was in the state's interests to expand the program and allow more people to take advantage of the incentive.\In many other states, the regulatory body is the one that sets the rate for net metering. In Indiana, the commission is set up like a court of law. Utilities or customers submit briefs to the agency, providing testimony and evidence. It's based on this evidence that the IURC will make a decision to, for example, allow a utility to raise its rates in order to cover the costs of a capital investment or settle a dispute between a customer and a utility.\Net metering would not have its day in court — and the fact that no study was done on the status of net metering in Indiana concerned some lawmakers and opponents of the bill.\""A study is necessary when there are questions around a particular issue. In my particular viewpoint, if you look at the economics of net metering, it is very clear that there is a subsidy,"" Maassel said.\Hershman said lawmakers did study a range of resources when crafting the policy, including news articles and a Government Accountability Office report on net metering, materials he provided to IndyStar upon request. But when asked about certain components of the bill, like how he reached the rate structure for net metering that will be in effect after the grandfathering period comes to a close, he responded with a verbal shrug.\""It was entirely arbitrary,"" he said. ""It's a public policy decision, as is everything else."""
154,"The beginning of 2018 was quiet for the once-booming solar industry in Indiana – ""crickets"" quiet. Installations slowed and installers were forced to lay off employees.\It seemed that some of their worst fears were coming to fruition: The state's 2017 decision to pass Senate Bill 309, striking down an incentive for homeowners to install solar panels, would upend the industry just as it was starting to grow.\Meanwhile, across the state line, Illinois' solar industry was a national leader, growing 37 percent in one year and casting a dark shadow on Indiana.\So, lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill aimed at restoring the incentives. ""We wanted to restart that conversation because this is still an open wound for many people,"" said one those lawmakers, Sen. J.D. Ford. Removing the incentives, he said, ""took the legs out from the industry.""\But their proposal – Senate Bill 430 – is not expected to see the light of day. Sen. Jim Merritt, R-Indianapolis, chairman of the Senate Utility Committee and Indianapolis mayoral candidate, said he will not give Ford's bill a hearing.\""I think we need to give this some time for us to see where we went wrong and where we went right,"" he told IndyStar. ""I'd like to give 309 some time to see if we did in fact dampen down the solar industry. And that's why I didn't hear the bill this year.""\The year before the legislature passed SB 309, which removed the incentives, Indiana's solar industry was among the fastest growing in the country. The industry added 1,100 solar jobs in 2016, growing the industry by 72 percent, according to the Solar Foundation. The state's residential solar capacity also doubled between 2016 and 2017.\But as talks of ending so-called net metering surfaced, everything changed. Under net metering, utility companies were required to pay customers the retail rate for any electricity their solar panels put back on the energy grid. Utilities fought the system, arguing those customers should only receive the wholesale rate, which is much lower.\And net metering died in Indiana.\In 2017, the growth rate of Indiana's solar industry dropped 93 percent. That year, the state added only 75 jobs. Installers rushed to get jobs done under the wire for residents racing to get solar panels before the law's Dec. 31 cutoff to be grandfathered in for the most robust net metering incentives. But with the new year came little new work.\""2018 actually exceeded our fears in terms of negative impact, the first half of the year especially,"" said solar installer Chris Rohaly, who owns and operates Green Alternatives Inc. He had to lay off three people last year.\""It was a real blow for our financial health,"" he added, ""and we are still trying to dig out of that hole.""\Tariffs levied by the Trump administration only added to their misery, causing a national slowdown in solar installation, said Sean Gallagher, vice president of state affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association. He said the tariffs, which made solar panels and related parts more expensive, will result in a nationwide $8 billion loss in solar investment by 2022.\Indiana did not suffer the worst fate in 2018. The solar industry still grew 12 percent, while some states saw declines. Still, Indiana's growth pales compared to the growth happening next door in Illinois, where the industry experienced a 37 percent job boom during the same period.\""Federal policy provides the baseline"" for the industry, Gallagher said. ""How solar really does in a particular state really depends on the policy the state implements.""\In 2016, the Illinois legislature passed the Future Energy Jobs Act, a sweeping package of policies and incentives aimed at boosting renewable energy and the related jobs.\The incentives from the law are funded by ratepayers, and amount to a few bucks a month.\It's important to note that Illinois' utilities are deregulated, so the markets function differently than those in Indiana. But some of the policies fueling Illinois' renewable transition have been tried in regulated and deregulated states alike.\Notably, the Illinois law mandates that 25 percent of the state's electricity come from renewable sources by 2025, and that it increase the state's solar capacity more than 40 times by 2030. It introduced a community solar program to help schools and neighborhoods take advantage of solar power and net metering, which is also available to residential customers.\Indiana once pursued similar policies, but retracted some or enacted toothless versions of others. In addition to nixing net metering in 2017, Indiana remains the only Midwestern state with no way of enforcing its renewable energy goals.\So when Gallagher looks at Illinois, he's not surprised to see that solar installations have started to skyrocket, along with the jobs needed to complete them.\""All those new jobs are a result of people getting ready to go out and implement these programs,"" Gallagher told IndyStar. And what Illinois did was in ""pretty stark contrast to what Indiana did in 2017,"" he added.\That's when the state legislature passed a law to phase out net metering. An IndyStar review of the industry in that same year found that the legislation was likely premature and highly disruptive to a still-developing industry.\In fact, most of the growth Indiana installers experienced last year was due to increased demand in Illinois and other neighboring states with proactive policies, industry experts said. Local installers agreed, saying that is where they are doing many of their jobs.\Jim Straeter, an installer and founder of Ag Technologies Inc., is one such installer who said he has made a conscious effort to expand outside of Indiana because of SB 309. He said the amount of solar his company sold in 2018 was ""definitely down.""\""Illinois now has the reputation of leading the Midwest in renewable policy implementation,"" Straeter said. ""Indiana is solidly on the bottom as far as reputation in renewable implementation goes as we are the only state that has enacted negative policy legislation in the Midwest in recent years.""\SB 309's author, then-Sen. Brandt Hershman, argued net metering was no longer needed to create a solar power incentive. While solar panels were expensive when net metering went into effect, the price had dropped due to a flood of imports.\But by the time the the bill took effect, tariffs had begun to change the equation, making solar panels more expensive again.\Asked in January 2018 whether the tariffs would lead Indiana to reconsider net metering, Merritt, the net metering law's co-author, said he'd have to wait and see.\""We need to give (solar) as much of a push as possible,"" he told IndyStar then. ""We'll monitor it, and if it does change the financial landscape, then we'll act.""\A year later, Ford, D-Indianapolis, would argue the financial landscape has changed and Indiana's industry is struggling. But Merritt said it is too soon to tell.\""I think what we need is at least two years, maybe five years, for everything to settle out,"" Merritt said this week. ""Let's give it some room to find out if we put a complete damp blanket on solar.""\Other states have not been so reluctant.\It took Nevada lawmakers just one year to reinstate its net-metering program after its removal prompted installers to cease operations and customers to complain. And after a steep drop from 2016 to 2017, the state saw a sharp jump in residential installations last year once the program was reintroduced.\Many solar industry experts and advocates say utilities have wanted to keep residential installations to a minimum so they can add renewable energy sources to their portfolio and charge customers more for it. In Indiana, utility solar installations more than doubled in 2018 after net metering ended.\As SB 309 was being considered in 2017, utilities and their political action committees poured millions into the legislature in the form of gifts, entertainment, campaign contributions and lobbying, according to an IndyStar analysis.\Sen. Mark Stoops, D-Bloomington, who is a co-author on Ford's bills to reinstate net metering, said ""the state of Indiana is stepping on competition"" to help the utilities.\Merritt, who chairs the Senate Utilities Committee, has received more than $80,000 in campaign contributions since 2010 from Indiana's five investor-owned utilities and the Indiana Energy Association.\Defending his independence, Merritt said his ""friends in the utility industry weren't too happy"" when he proposed an unsuccessful bill in 2009 that would have expanded net metering.\""I can't speak to campaign contributions,"" he said. ""But I know what I'm doing here and support net metering and support solar.""\Merritt said he wants to see the state's more than 3,000 solar jobs double. Still, he said he is ""satisfied with our measured approach.""\Ford and others see it differently. His bill has bipartisan support with co-authors Sen. Vaneta Becker, R-Evansville, and Sen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette. Both Becker and Alting voted against 309, which passed the Senate handily. The vote in the House, however, was much narrower – 56-43 – which surprised many.\It was a controversial bill then and remains a contentious issue, Stoops said, which is exactly why he thinks SB 430 should be heard.\""If it got a hearing, I think many people would wake up,"" he said. ""I think a lot of the people who felt it was a bad idea would show up.""\Emily Hopkins and Sarah Bowman cover the environment for IndyStar.

156,"When Doug Miller saw his district would grow by 43 students this year, he was thrilled.\But such unabashed optimism wouldn't have been the case just one year ago; it would have been tempered by worries about whether the Sheridan Schools superintendent could afford to hire enough teachers to greet them at the classroom doors.\Would he have to pull some funds from other sources and programs? Or would he have to crowd some students into other classrooms?\This year, however, is not last year. This year, Miller's school system has solar panels.\Or as he views it: This year he has flexibility, freedom and opportunities.\For schools and towns and churches, solar becomes a way to reduce and stabilize the utility and electricity line item in their budgets, which allows those funds to go toward other expenses — most often services.\""Having solar allows us to move with greater freedom and assurances to cover the costs of new people when we need them,"" said Miller, who created and hired for three new positions this year: two elementary school teachers and a special education teacher at the secondary level. The superintendent acknowledged that with new students the district receives additional per-pupil funding from the state, but it doesn't cover everything.\""Solar frees up funds when we have such tight budgets for those educational activities and expenditures — whether people or programs — that are important things you can have in school to help and serve kids,"" he added. ""And our job is to serve kids.""\As schools, municipalities and community organizations such as churches are increasingly asked to do more with less, they say solar energy provides an easy and straightforward way to do that.\But many worry that a new state law that goes into effect Monday could drastically curtail future opportunities for new non-residential customers to take advantage of the savings and stability of going solar. At best, the new law — Senate Bill 309 — reduces the financial incentive that comes with installing solar panels. At worst, it could make that current incentive unavailable to new non-residential customers within just a couple years, throwing into question their ability to invest in the technology.\""Everybody would support cost-saving measures on schools and city governments,"" said Kerwin Olson, the executive director of the consumer advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition. ""No question one of the most powerful ways to do that is the self-generation of solar power.\""Solar is a creative solution to save enormous amounts of money and redirect that income to public services,"" he added. ""To restrict that doesn't make any sense at all.""\SB 309, championed by the state's powerful utility industry, phases out net metering. In its simplest form, net metering requires utilities to credit solar customers for excess energy they produce that flows back to the grid — thus helping to offset electricity they consume from the utility at other times.\That setup was intended to provide an important incentive for Hoosiers to install expensive solar panels and produce their own energy that is better for the environment. For schools and towns and churches, it also was a way to reduce and stabilize the utility and electricity line item in their budgets, which for many is often the second-biggest expense behind the cost of employees.\Then SB 309 was pitched as a way to level the playing field between solar customers and the state's investor-owned utilities, who maintain net metering is an unnecessary subsidy paid for by other ratepayers.\The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb in May and implemented July 1, set a deadline: Install solar panels by Dec. 31 to be locked in to the current incentive for 30 years. Meaning for every bit of energy a customer produces but doesn't use and sends back to the grid, the utility would credit them at the same price a customer buys electricity.\But for those who miss that deadline, the incentive is reduced. Put simply, anyone who installs panels by Dec. 31 — today — receives the incentive for 30 years; an installation after today would receive the incentive for just 15 years.\Customers who install between 2018 through 2022 will receive that same retail rate only until 2032. All installations that occur after 2022 will receive the wholesale rate — a lower amount that utilities buy electricity for from the market — plus an additional 25 percent.\For schools and towns, that 15-year difference in the grandfathering period could translate into something much bigger.\""The question on everyone's minds is how big of a difference is there really between 15- and 30-year net metering?"" asked Geoff Greenfield, president and founder of solar installer Third Sun Solar. ""And we don't quite know the answer yet, because we are moving from a guarantee and a known to something that is more vague.""\That ambiguity is precisely part of the problem.\Non-residential customers such as schools and churches are looking at larger systems that are more expensive and can often take around 20 years to pay off, according to Greenfield, who has worked with many groups in this category.\""They have a fiduciary responsibility to manage their budget for taxpayers and stakeholders, so the shorter grandfathering period makes it much harder for them to make a fully informed decision,"" Greenfield told IndyStar. ""It further complicates something that was already complicated.""\Sheridan Schools is financing its 6,200-panel project with a 20-year loan, Miller said. The district was the first in the state to become 100 percent solar, meaning it creates enough energy to power all of its buildings, when its system became operational nearly a year and a half ago.\The net metering income from its panels helps cover the fixed monthly loan payments, which often are less than the fluctuating — and hard to budget for — electricity bills the district was paying before.\""Energy costs are something that fluctuates and I could see rate increases each year, which is hard on a budget,"" the superintendent said. ""But now over the course of the next 20 years, the cost to turn the lights on in the building will remain flat, and that gives me an advantage.""\Miller was not at the helm when the decision to install the panels was made, but he said he is confident that having net metering was factored in to the financing they received.\Cindy Whitaker at St. Peter's United Church of Christ in Carmel echoed that thought, saying it would have been a harder sell for the congregation to support and fund its solar project without the longer net-metering.\Luckily, her church was able to move up the second part of its project when the law was put in place. Nearly 11,000 pounds of solar equipment were installed on the church roof, maxing out its space, just 10 days before the deadline.\""It's not just the economic thing to do, but it's the moral thing to do for our environment,"" said Whitaker, who has panels on her own home. ""The reason normal electricity is cheap is because we are not paying the full cost of the energy; we are not paying for the pollution it creates.""\Many, however, are not in a position to expedite their projects as St. Peter's did.\""If a school corporation or a city government wasn't already going down that path when the bill took effect,"" Laura Arnold said, ""then they would have a very difficult, if not impossible, time getting it done in time.""\Analyzing the numbers, holding public forums for comment, securing financing and going before a board or council for discussion and approval can make for a multiple-month process, according to Arnold, president of the Indiana Distributed Energy Alliance, Inc.\Miller said his district's process from first board meeting presentation to completed installation was 10 months. And he considers that fast.\A Hamilton County project has not been quite so swift: years in the making, in fact.\The solar project was first brought before the County Council in 2013, according to county buildings and grounds director Steve Wood, but the cost of the system was too expensive at the time. But with the price of panels going down and costs to the growing county going up — not to mention the introduction of SB 309 — the project was revisited and ultimately approved in 2017.\""We wanted to get out ahead of this as much as possible,"" Wood said, even though it is unlikely the county will have all 8,777 panels online before the end of the year. The panels are being installed across the county's correctional facilities.\""It's not just about today and a reduction right now,"" he added, ""but it's about the future because costs are only going up.""\Other groups that weren't farther along have had to press pause altogether, said Greenfield of Third Sun.\""We've seen people put the brakes on and say, 'We need to better understand the impact on the financial return of going solar,'"" the installer said, ""and I think the brakes are still on and they are waiting and watching.""\Gary Conner of North Lawrence Schools finds himself in that limbo.\The superintendent of the southern central school system said it began discussing solar right when SB 309 was moving through the statehouse. He sees its potential benefits — especially for a smaller and more rural district absent a growing tax base — but said the district needs to better study if it could be feasible.\""The modification of the statute and time parameters is a critical factor in looking at what we may want, consider or even do because it impacts the return on investment and the financing we might be able to get,"" said Conner, who has visited the Sheridan Schools' solar array.\""Seeing what they had in place,"" he added, ""it made us think about some of the possibilities that could be.""\But if school districts, churches and other public entities want to wait and see the longer-term effects of net metering before going forward, they could end up being left with not just a reduced time period for the benefit, but perhaps a reduced rate as well.\The law provides for the reduced incentive for systems installed after 2017 and before 2022, but it also establishes a limit on the amount of energy produced by non-residential customers that is eligible for the incentive. Once that cap is reached, utility companies no longer have to provide current net metering rates to new non-residential solar customers.\""The problems that the schools and cities and towns will face,"" Olson said, ""is that there won't be any available capacity.""\And how soon might that happen? Some utilities could reach that cap as early as 2018 or 2019, according to conversations Olson has had with the energy companies.\That means any school, municipality or church that installs after the cap would be denied the retail net metering rate, potentially several years before the 2022 deadline. Instead, those new customers would receive the wholesale rate plus 25 percent.\The state's utilities — Duke Energy, Indianapolis Power and Light, Indiana Michigan Power, Northern Indiana Public Service Company and Vectren Energy — told IndyStar they could not predict when they might reach those caps. Nonetheless, their spokespersons did say they have numerous projects coming online as the year draws to a close, including some large ones that will push them closer to that limit.\Residential customers face a cap of their own. Yet their systems are much smaller — at roughly five kilowatts, it would take dozens to equal the energy production of an average school or municipal solar array — and therefore not at all close to approaching the cutoff point in the near future.\For those organizations that have managed to already install solar, the benefits they see are well worth it.\For churches such as St. Peter's UCC, the progressive perspective not only helps attract more people to their pews but the panels also can enable them to expand their mission work in the future.\For counties such as Hamilton, the savings from solar make it possible to continue providing the services residents expect, as well as add those that come with rapid population growth.\""With the recession we had to cut a lot of budgets and lay folks off, and I can't help but think how we could have avoided that if we had some of these savings then,"" said Wood, the buildings director. ""Now we are having to build out our corrections complex, so how do we absorb those costs without the ability to control our own operations?""\And for schools such as the Delphi district, the trending technology provides a learning opportunity that can be folded into their curriculum. Not to mention relief from a budget already stretched beyond its limits.\Despite seeing declining enrollments, superintendent Greg Biles saw his electricity bill grow by more than $50,000 in the last year. In other words, the Delphi schools' solar system could not have come at a better time, Biles said — and he hates to think where they would be without it.\""Facing a reduced budget, reduced programs,"" the rural school leader said, ""and as a result of the reductions, we would be losing even more students to the neighboring schools that may be able to provide programs that we cannot offer.""\Biles said his solution would be to exclude school corporations from SB 309. Though not quite to that extreme, Rep. Dave Ober of Albion said that he is drafting some legislation to help.\The Republican — who chairs the House utilities and energy committee and was a proponent of SB 309 — plans to introduce a bill that would grandfather schools and municipalities for 20 years. The intention, he said, is to give them more time to make these decisions that take longer than their ""nimble"" private counterparts and more time to see the returns on their investment.\""Hopefully this legislation will open the door for them to build things that will help alleviate some pressures on budgets and free up money to go toward the educational mission of our school districts,"" Ober told IndyStar. ""And I hope it will be useful for some of the school corporations and municipalities who were thinking about doing it but weren't able to get things in place.""\The bill's author, Sen. Brandt Hershman, said he believes the phasing out period over the next five years creates a ""substantial window of time"" to allow homeowners as well as schools and others to install solar panels.\""This is more than sufficient time to allow for payback of installation costs of panels,"" the Buck Creek Republican said, ""based on independent research."" (Hershman announced his retirement from the general assembly this month.)\But several other state legislators are in favor of putting more power and more options back into the hands of these groups.\Rep. Ron Bacon, R-Chandler, said it is critical to incentivize schools and towns to be more self-sufficient. And Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, is glad schools are getting heard, even if she feels it's a bit late.\Though solar proponents and advocates would welcome this change, they also emphasize that solar still shines a light on some worthy opportunities. They just might look a little different, according to solar installer Johnson-Melloh, such as installing a smaller system that wouldn't produce as much excess but costs less.\That's precisely what Hamilton County did. Their government was considering building an additional solar array field before SB 309 went into effect, Wood said.\Miller of Sheridan Schools said he still is a bit puzzled by the law, but doesn't think that should stop anyone.\""Sure, without net metering in place it's not as positive and takes some of the advantage away from solar, but I still think it's a positive overall for a school or municipality or any entity to have a system in place,"" the superintendent said. ""It's business as usual in our buildings and the lights are on for our students.""\Still, Miller said he sometimes catches himself thinking they shine just a bit brighter.\Call IndyStar reporter Sarah Bowman at (317) 444-6129.

157,"""Having solar allows us to move with greater freedom and assurances to cover the costs of new people when we need them.""\Doug Miller\Sheridan Schools superintendent\When Doug Miller saw his district would grow by 43 students this year, he was thrilled.\But such unabashed optimism wouldn't have been the case just one year ago; it would have been tempered by worries about whether the Sheridan Schools superintendent could afford to hire enough teachers to greet them at the classroom doors.\Would he have to pull some funds from other sources and programs? Or would he have to crowd some students into other classrooms?\This year, however, is not last year. This year, Miller's school system has solar panels.\Or as he views it: This year he has flexibility, freedom and opportunities.\For schools and towns and churches, solar becomes a way to reduce and stabilize the utility and electricity line item in their budgets, which allows those funds to go toward other expenses — most often services.\""Having solar allows us to move with greater freedom and assurances to cover the costs of new people when we need them,"" said Miller, who created and hired for three new positions this year: two elementary school teachers and a special education teacher at the secondary level. The superintendent acknowledged that with new students the district receives additional per-pupil funding from the state, but it doesn't cover everything.\""Solar frees up funds when we have such tight budgets for those educational activities and expenditures — whether people or programs — that are important things you can have in school to help and serve kids,"" he added. ""And our job is to serve kids.""\As schools, municipalities and community organizations such as churches are increasingly asked to do more with less, they say solar energy provides an easy and straightforward way to do that.\But many worry that a new state law that goes into effect Monday could drastically curtail future opportunities for new non-residential customers to take advantage of the savings and stability of going solar. At best, the new law — Senate Bill 309 — reduces the financial incentive that comes with installing solar panels. At worst, it could make that current incentive unavailable to new non-residential customers within just a couple years, throwing into question their ability to invest in the technology.\""Everybody would support cost-saving measures on schools and city governments,"" said Kerwin Olson, the executive director of the consumer advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition. ""No question one of the most powerful ways to do that is the self-generation of solar power.\""Solar is a creative solution to save enormous amounts of money and redirect that income to public services,"" he added. ""To restrict that doesn't make any sense at all.""\SB 309, championed by the state's powerful utility industry, phases out net metering. In its simplest form, net metering requires utilities to credit solar customers for excess energy they produce that flows back to the grid — thus helping to offset electricity they consume from the utility at other times.\That setup was intended to provide an important incentive for Hoosiers to install expensive solar panels and produce their own energy that is better for the environment. For schools and towns and churches, it also was a way to reduce and stabilize the utility and electricity line item in their budgets, which for many is often the second-biggest expense behind the cost of employees.\Then SB 309 was pitched as a way to level the playing field between solar customers and the state's investor-owned utilities, who maintain net metering is an unnecessary subsidy paid for by other ratepayers.\The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb in May and implemented July 1, set a deadline: Install solar panels by Dec. 31 to be locked in to the current incentive for 30 years. Meaning for every bit of energy a customer produces but doesn't use and sends back to the grid, the utility would credit them at the same price a customer buys electricity.\But for those who miss that deadline, the incentive is reduced. Put simply, anyone who installs panels by Dec. 31 — today — receives the incentive for 30 years; an installation after today would receive the incentive for just 15 years.\Customers who install between 2018 through 2022 will receive that same retail rate only until 2032. All installations that occur after 2022 will receive the wholesale rate — a lower amount that utilities buy electricity for from the market — plus an additional 25 percent.\For schools and towns, that 15-year difference in the grandfathering period could translate into something much bigger.\""The question on everyone's minds is how big of a difference is there really between 15- and 30-year net metering?"" asked Geoff Greenfield, president and founder of solar installer Third Sun Solar. ""And we don't quite know the answer yet, because we are moving from a guarantee and a known to something that is more vague.""\That ambiguity is precisely part of the problem.\Non-residential customers such as schools and churches are looking at larger systems that are more expensive and can often take around 20 years to pay off, according to Greenfield, who has worked with many groups in this category.\Sheridan Schools is financing its 6,200-panel project with a 20-year loan, Miller said. The district was the first in the state to become 100 percent solar, meaning it creates enough energy to power all of its buildings, when its system became operational nearly a year and a half ago.\The net metering income from its panels helps cover the fixed monthly loan payments, which often are less than the fluctuating — and hard to budget for — electricity bills the district was paying before.\Miller was not at the helm when the decision to install the panels was made, but he said he is confident that having net metering was factored in to the financing they received.\Cindy Whitaker at St. Peter's United Church of Christ in Carmel echoed that thought, saying it would have been a harder sell for the congregation to support and fund its solar project without the longer net-metering.\But if school districts, churches and other public entities want to wait and see the longer-term effects of net metering before going forward, they could end up being left with not just a reduced time period for the benefit, but perhaps a reduced rate as well.\Several state legislators are in favor of putting more power and more options back into the hands of different groups.\Rep. Ron Bacon, R-Chandler, said it is critical to incentivize schools and towns to be more self-sufficient. And Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, is glad schools are getting heard, even if she feels it's a bit late.\Miller of Sheridan Schools said he still is a bit puzzled by the law, but doesn't think that should stop anyone.\""Sure, without net metering in place it's not as positive and takes some of the advantage away from solar, but I still think it's a positive overall for a school or municipality or any entity to have a system in place,"" the superintendent said.

158,"RICHMOND – A Quaker church has hopes its efforts to harness solar energy to power its building will inspire other not-for-profits, individuals and businesses in the area to follow suit.\The installation of about 130 solar panels on the roof of First Friends Meeting, 2010 Chester Blvd., is more than halfway complete, with plans for the work to be finished in the coming weeks. First Friends is among a small handful of local organizations to independently utilize renewable energy to power their facilities.\Lincoln Blake, who is a co-clerk for the church and overseeing the project, said he is hopeful the panels will help the congregation lower its electricity bill by more than $2,000 per year, while also highlighting what is widely considered to be an important part of the Quaker faith: stewardship of the environment.\""This grows out of the Quaker concern for stewardship of the Earth,"" he said. ""We consider (Earth) to be a great gift and something we should take care of. This is just one small way we can do that more effectively.""\Blake said he considers taking care of the environment to be a non-political issue, and something for which everyone should have a greater concern.\""The general consensus is that care of the Earth is a Quaker belief,"" he said. ""Acknowledging there's a wide array of views on an issue like this ... we feel if we can do something to help preserve the Earth, I think our congregation is going to take any measure it can to do that.""\Blake said First Friends initially considered solar energy several years ago, but could not justify spending hundreds of thousands on the installation of panels that would produce a limited amount of energy.\""About 10 years ago, we had an initial interest in solar energy, but at that point it proved far too expensive,"" he said. ""So we laid it down, ... The cost has significantly dropped since then, so it became affordable — feasible.\He said First Friends is paying about $70,000 to have these panels installed, and they're expected to last for about 30 years. This includes about $28,000 from congregation members, another $30,000 from the Quigg Foundation and the rest from the not-for-profit's own First Friends Foundation.\Installation of the panels was expected to be completed by the end of December, but poor weather prevented that from happening. The panes are being installed by Rectify Solar out of Indianapolis.\The building, which First Friends moved into in the late 1990s, is owned by Friends Fellowship Community Inc., the Quaker neighborhood that sits along the west side of Chester Boulevard south of Reid Health. First Friends Meeting has a 100-year lease on the building, for which they pay about $1 per year.\Blake said the project should be finished by the end of February, at the latest. The panes are arranged along the south-facing slant of the roof.\He said the use of the panels also won't remove First Friends entirely from the grid; he said they will instead act as a supplement to the service the church receives from Richmond Power & Light.\He said he is hopeful the year-over-year savings — up to $2,000 on a yearly bill that averages about $4,000 — will initially allow the group to put money back into the foundation. Beyond that, Blake said he isn't certain what will be done with the savings, or if they'll simply go into the church's general fund.\""We'll be saving money, certainly, but what we will do with that hasn't been determined yet,"" he said. ""Our biggest goal with this project is that we'll inspire others to follow our lead, even if its on the individual level.""\He said the expected savings are expected to come through for the church, which last year had an annual budget of under $100,000, in the next seven to nine years.\""It takes a little bit of time, but we are confident we'll be able to save money in the long run,"" he said. ""It's an important step for us and something our congregation fully supported.""\Blake said he sees a good opportunity for local businesses and others to look into installing solar panels on their own buildings, even if it's just a few. He said local utility companies offer net-metering as an incentive for those who do install panels.\Net-metering allows customers with solar panels and other renewable energies to connect to the power grids of public utilities, giving them a way to transfer surplus power onto the grid; this gives the customers an opportunity to offset the costs of power used from the grid.\The state of Indiana last year passed a law limiting the amount of energy that can be matched through net-metering, SB 309, though Blake said the rule only applies to investor-owned companies, which Richmond Power & Light is not.\While RP&L does offer net-metering to its customers, nobody who receives power through the utility has yet requested the service, general manager Randy Baker said.\He said he sees the efforts by First Friends as being a good first step for those in the area interested in pursuing renewable energy sources, but also said it may in the long run have an impact\""We do our own net-metering for anything below 10 kilowatts,"" Baker said. ""We don't have anyone using the service right now.""\First Friends itself far exceeds the 10 kilowatt limit, as the church's new panels have a capacity of up to 30 kilowatts.\""This is a really good incentive for people who want to embrace environmentally-friendly means of energy production,"" Blake said.\Because the group's capacity exceeds what can be matched by RP&L, First Friends must use a net-metering service provided by the Indiana Municipal Power Agency, which offers a match of 32 cents for every watt sold to them.\Blake said while the savings are limited for larger groups, such as the church, he is hopeful people will still consider investing in forms of alternative energy.\""It strikes me as remarkable that nobody else in Richmond has done this yet,"" he said. ""Our hope is to try and promote the use of solar energy moving forward. We really think it's an effective way of saving money and preserving the environment more effectively.""\First Friends revisited the idea of installing panels after seeing them in use by a Quaker church in Winchester, which had been using solar energy for a short period.\As far as renewable energy in Richmond goes, the concept is nothing new, though it's had limited applications in recent history. There is a solar park located near the RP&L headquarters along U.S. 27 South that is owned by IMPA. The park, introduced in 2014, contains about 4,000 solar panels.\IMPA is also considering adding a second solar park, this one at the former New Creations site by Interstate 70. The 44 acres of land would have up to 28,000 panels, which would be able to power up to 1,000 homes. That project is expected to be completed later this year or in early 2019.\The city of Richmond also has a large, standalone solar panel on the southeastern side of its building.\There are, however, a limited number of organizations and individuals who have invested in solar energy in any capacity. Among them are Cope Environmental Center and the owner of a home on the far east side of town. Both structures are technically located outside of Richmond city limits, Blake said.\Baker said he thinks the church's efforts to adopt solar energy may begin a new trend in the area when it comes to renewables, but the full effects of the group's efforts remain to be seen.\It's also unclear what impact the recent announcement by the Trump administration, which will impose 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels, may have on the future of renewable energy usage in the United States, including Wayne County.\The tariff was imposed in part as an effort to encourage overseas producers of the cells to move manufacturing operations to the United States, though an industry trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, said the move could cost up to 23,000 American jobs. The figure has so far not been independently verified.\The tariff, according to a U.S. Trade Representative fact sheet, will decline by five percent each year during a four-year period, from 30 percent down to 15 percent.\Baker did not speak on what he thinks the impact of the tariff may be, but said he believes the future of energy generation and consumption may come from renewable sources.\""I think that distributed energy, whether by solar or wind, is going to be a thing in the future,"" Baker said. ""I actually thought 15 years ago, we'd have more of it than we do now. But I still think it's moving in that direction.""\Mickey Shuey is the business reporter at the Palladium-Item.

The Indiana solar market is particularly sensitive to these kind of price changes, due to the low cost of electricity in the state.\Just the suggestion of the tariffs had an effect on the market, according to Colin Smith, a solar analyst for GTM Research.

That was a relief to Phil Teague, who owns solar installation companies in Indiana and California. Teague predicts that, if adopted, the ITC's recommended tariffs won't have a devastating effect on his business.\President Trump, however, is not required to adhere to the ITC's recommendations. The administration has not commented publicly on how the president may rule, but details about the case suggest that he may be in favor of tariffs.

(Hershman announced his retirement from the general assembly this month.)\""I think that if the underlying assumptions used in the analysis of the payback period was significantly changed by federal activity,"" Hershman said, ""it would be appropriate to take a look at it.""\The tariff case comes at a time when Indiana's solar market is still reeling from a new law that phases out an incentive for residential solar installation. Part of the law included a grandfather period that expires at the end of the year, which sent Hoosiers rushing to overwhelmed solar installers who then had to turn some clients away.\The incentive, called net metering, dictates that ratepayers with solar panels should be compensated for the energy they produce at the retail rate rather than the wholesale rate. Net metering is viewed by the solar industry as an important tool that allows homeowners to receive a faster return on what's often a hefty investment.

The review also found that at the same time Indiana legislators were pushing the bill, the lawmakers, including Hershman, received thousands from investor-owned utilities in the form of campaign contributions and lobbying-related entertainment, including sporting event tickets and meals at Indianapolis' top restaurants.\Although energy produced in Indiana by renewable resources is still minuscule compared to energy produced by coal, residents and companies are increasingly looking to wind and solar to generate their power. Energy produced by both utility- and small-scale solar facilities grew 53 percent from September 2016 to the same month in 2017. Small-scale solar generation, which represents a tiny portion of energy production in the state, doubled in that same time period, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\Despite the possible setbacks, GTM's Smith thinks that America's solar industry at large will continue to grow, even if that growth is slowed by the tariff or other anti-solar legislation. One reason is the fact that solar energy is just so cheap to produce when compared to fossil fuels.\""It's going to be really hard to squash the industry when the alternative is going to cost the ratepayer,"" Smith said.

Energy produced by both utility- and small-scale solar facilities grew 53 percent from September 2016 to the same month in 2017. Small-scale solar generation, which represents a tiny portion of energy production in the state, doubled in that same time period, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\Despite the possible setbacks, GTM's Smith thinks that America's solar industry at large will continue to grow, even if that growth is slowed by the tariff or other anti-solar legislation. One reason is the fact that solar energy is just so cheap to produce when compared to fossil fuels.\""It's going to be really hard to squash the industry when the alternative is going to cost the ratepayer,"" Smith said. ""Despite having several heart attacks myself over the past few months, I think in the end we're still going to see it move forward.""\Emily Hopkins covers the environment for IndyStar.

161,"A proposed ordinance in front of the council would make changes to how Richmond Power & Light handles those customers who use solar panels to generate more power than they need\RICHMOND — At most Richmond Common Council meetings, the sparse audience is made up almost entirely of city department heads and other employees.\But this week, nearly all of the seats in the chambers were filled as proponents of solar power turned out to urge council members not to do away with the city's rules regarding net metering.\A proposed ordinance in front of the council would make changes to how Richmond Power & Light handles those customers who use solar panels to generate more power than they need to use themselves.\Under the current rules adopted in November 2010, customers who generate excess power are given a one-to-one credit for each kilowatt hour produced more than what they need for their own homes.\That ordinance sets a cap on the number of kilowatt hours that can be produced under the net metering program, effectively creating a limit of 16-20 homes that could take advantage of the situation.\The proposed ordinance would line up RP&L with the rules used by the Indiana Municipal Power Agency, of which RP&L is a member.\Under those guidelines, customers would be reimbursed in cash by IMPA for those excess kilowatt hours at a wholesale rate plus 25 percent instead of the current higher retail rate.\IMPA's plan also doesn't put any limitations on the number of customers that can be part of the program.\But it's the change in the rate of reimbursement that was a main reason that motivated many of the folks to turn out Monday night. They say the new rate would change the math for deciding whether to install solar panels at someone's home.\""I understand that they're not trying to discourage solar, but unfortunately, it's a side effect of this that it is very discouraging to homeowners because there are pretty exact calculations on how you get a return on investment on solar installations and that includes net metering. So you're leaving it for more wealthy people to be able to install if you have things like this in place,"" said Alison Zajdel, a former executive director of Cope Environmental Center and the current chair of the city's Environmental Sustainability Commission.\""I know this community is concerned about the environment. We all drink the same water. We all breathe the same air. We want a healthy environment. I think this ordinance makes a statement, and it's the wrong statement.""\In the time since the city's net metering program was put into effect, only one customer has signed up to be part of the program, but there are reasons for that that go beyond any possible lack of interest in solar power generation, according to those who spoke to council Monday night.\""Eight years ago, solar panels were prohibitively expensive for any but the most wealthy users,"" said Caleb Smith, an employee of the Richmond Parks and Recreation Department who was speaking as a private citizen.\""As costs have begun to decrease along with the advantages of net metering, solar has become financially feasible for more individuals.""\Council member Ron Oler pushed back on that line of thinking, suggesting the current rules actually favor the more wealthy when it comes to installing solar panels.\""It seems to me if we don't do this, only the first 16 to 20, only the wealthiest will be able to afford this and everyone else will be excluded,"" he said.\""So we need to do something. It may not be like this, but if we do nothing, ... we're actually hurting the middle to other classes.""\Among those who spoke against the proposed ordinance was Laura Ann Arnold, an Indianapolis resident who serves as president of a group called the Indiana Distributed Energy Alliance. She argued IMPA's rules are written to favor the agency's own plans for solar power, such as the new installation being built at the former New Creations property of Richmond's far-east side.\""IMPA is not necessarily anti-solar, but they're anti-individual solar ownership, and that is very clear in all of their policies,"" Arnold said.\""I believe in energy freedom. I believe in customers having the right to choose and to take personal responsibility for those own consumption and for their own energy futures.""\Proponents of the rule changes have said the lower reimbursement rates are similar to what any other power generator would receive when selling their electricity on the open market.\They also argue that solar customers who generate all of their own power don't then share the costs for maintaining the entire electrical grid.\In the end, council decided to hold the ordinance instead of moving it ahead for a final vote. At the earliest that won't come until the July 2 meeting because four members of the council will miss the group's next meeting on June 18.\The move also will allow the city's Environmental Sustainability Commission to discuss the ordinance and make any recommendations it might have for council.\""We think that's the best path moving forward. It allows us to digest what we've heard here tonight and do some further research,"" Council President Jamie Lopeman said.\A proposed ordinance in front of the council would make changes to how Richmond Power & Light handles those customers who use solar panels to generate more power than they need"
162,"In a time when money is tight and natural resources are precious, Hoosiers continue to waste significant amounts of both because energy conservation has gained so little traction in Indiana.\Take net metering, the process by which property owners who generate their own electricity through windmills, solar panels or other means receive credits for the excess energy they ship back to utilities. Indiana has one of the weakest net-metering standards in the nation, limiting homes and schools to only 10 kilowatts a month. By comparison, Kentucky has set a limit of 30 kilowatts, Illinois 40 kilowatts and Ohio has no specified limit.\And, unlike in most states, utilities in Indiana can exclude businesses, which potentially could generate considerable amounts of power, from net-metering programs.\Although both the Indiana House and Senate passed bills this year that would have strengthened net-metering requirements, the legislation died in conference committee.\Such setbacks are common in Indiana, which has been slow to embrace everything from energy-efficient buildings to mass transit. Environmental leaders use the word glacial to describe the state's pace on conservation measures.\Yet, given their fiscal, environmental and even security benefits, steps that promote better energy efficiency should bridge most political and philosophical divides.\On the federal level, Indiana Republican Sen. Richard Lugar has made conservation one of the pillars of his newly introduced energy legislation. Although some Democrats and environmental groups have criticized Lugar's overall approach as too weak, they've applauded the energy-efficiency provisions of the bill. As a result, with Congress seemingly deadlocked over a comprehensive energy bill, Lugar's plan has gained traction because he included elements both Democrats and Republicans can support.\That approach -- find common ground and act on it -- makes sense on the state and local levels as well.\In Indianapolis, common ground would mean finally building a functional bus system, expanding trails, adding bike lanes, and building and fixing sidewalks. The assumption that residents are forever wed to their cars has not been tested here because few people have a functional alternative to driving.\On the state level, it would mean giving Central Indiana leaders permission to stage a referendum on creation of a regional transit authority, the first step to establishing rail and bus lines that would connect the suburbs and the urban core.\And it would mean finally approving the net-metering legislation, which died in the Statehouse this year and last year, during the 2011 session.\Debates over how much and what types of coal to burn, where and whether to drill for oil, and how to set limits on greenhouse gases likely will continue unabated, all while vast amounts of energy are wasted unnecessarily.\The pursuit of greater energy efficiency won't end those arguments, but it could move the nation, state and city closer to the goals of a cleaner environment and a healthier population.\gary varvel"

Jesse Kharbanda, director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, came to The Herald-Times earlier this week to answer questions in an online chat.
\
HEC is Indiana's largest statewide environmental organization, based in Indianapolis. Its focus issues include renewable energy, transportation, sustainable food and agriculture, clean water, global climate change, open spaces and a generally healthy environment.
\
Here's an excerpt of the discussion. Questions came from online readers. The entire chat transcript is at HeraldTimesOnline.com/earth.
\
QWhat is your opinion of so-called ""clean coal""?
\
A We don't think that the term is accurate, even for the most advanced coal technologies. Advanced coal will likely facilitate more high-sulfur coal mining, which as you know will pave the way for the destructive and harmful coal mining that we're seeing in West Virginia. Furthermore, even newer coal technologies, while they have a lower carbon footprint per megawatt hour, will still emit massive amounts of new greenhouse gas emissions. And there is the weakly regulated matter of coal ash, and the real risks that it could pose to our groundwater and streams. The electricity sector needs to face a price on carbon so that we can substantially shift financial resources to much cleaner energy resources.
\
QCould you briefly outline the future transportation needs for Indiana and how you think they should be funded.
\
AOur state is facing an increasingly aging population, a young professional base that is hungry for meaningful public transit, a sizable percentage of our workforce (nearly 10 percent in Indianapolis alone) without access to a car, business professionals who want to avoid the hassle of congestion; and Hoosiers who treasure the pristine quality of rural countryside who don't want to be overrun by noisy, dirty truck pollution. All that means that we have to significantly rethink how we fund transportation in Indiana. Right now, astonishingly, we spend 97 percent of our funds on highways, roads and bridges - and therefore, a pittance on public transit and rail as well as bikeways and greenways, from a state perspective. Furthermore, when it comes to Major Moves - the biggest infusion of cash into transportation in Indiana in decades - that money has imprudently emphasized building more roads and bridges than maintaining what we have. This latter concern will imperil both safety and economic development across our state over time. Our organization believes that the money currently being spent on new terrain I-69 should be spent on repairing our crumbling infrastructure and building a much more diverse set of transportation options. Changing our transportation vision calls on Hoosiers across the state to demand change - holding press conferences in front of crumbling infrastructure and discussing how economic development could be imperiled if we stick to a transportation vision that presently seems little different from the 1950s.
\
Q Aside from I-69, what specifically has HEC achieved at the Indiana Statehouse in terms of environmental progress? What intra-Statehouse alliances does HEC have to move Indiana forward?
\
A We're a broad-based organization so we have championed a diversity of initiatives: bills to reduce our dependence on coal (renewable electricity standard, net metering, property assessed clean energy bonds), provide Hoosiers more options to automobiles (public transit funding, high-speed rail funding), and find smart ways to clean our waterways (reducing manure runoff from factory farms, curtailing phosphorus runoff from homes that excessively apply phosphorus-containing lawn fertilizers). On energy, we've achieved a voluntary clean electricity standard (very weak, but a start); on transit, we've successively defended cuts to state transit funding, and on water, we've helped to close a loophole that led to imported manure dumping in our state; none of these were achieved by HEC only - but with many partners and supportive legislators. There isn't a bill that we will go solo on. On clean energy, it has involved partnerships with Sierra Club and clean energy businesses; for transit, it has encompassed public health and economic development groups; and water initiatives, several different conservation groups. We hope that you will attend our legislative forum on Dec. 1 at the University of Indianapolis.
\
QWhen will the price of residential solar power stop falling? I would hate to invest now, only to have the same system cost $1,000 less in a year or two.
\
A The rise of solar manufacturers in China has been a game-changer for the U.S. solar market, causing the price of panels to fall dramatically in the past five years and therefore also the costs facing homeowners and businesses. And with coal electricity's price going to continually rise - due to tightening public health safeguards, globally higher coal prices - solar will become even more compelling, especially in Indiana. If you expect to live in your place for another five years, I hope that you'll pursue it. You'll be an inspiration to your neighbors, which is hard to quantify!!
\
Q If I have to choose between conventionally grown produce and organic produce, which should I choose?
\
AI wish I had a general answer; if the local operator employed organic methods, that would seem to be the best pathway: consumers could build relationships with local producers (helping to ensure high standards of accountability) and the transportation environmental life cycle impact would of course be lower. While many local producers might be very conscientious in their methods, one cannot romanticize, of course. We've come to know of a couple of smaller producers in Indiana, for example, who have been indifferent to how they apply manure to their property, causing a great deal of physical and mental distress to their neighbors.

164,"When Ikea in Fishers opens this fall, it likely will be outfitted with thousands of solar roof panels that will generate enough energy to power a hundred homes, despite a controversial bill in the legislature that critics say will dissuade solar energy investment.\A spokesman for the Swedish furniture maker said a decision would be made in the spring about whether to power the store with solar, as Ikea does with 90 percent of its outlets, including the last three built in California, Washington, and Columbus, Ohio.\""It's a fair conclusion that the Indiana store will probably have solar"" said Ikea spokesman Joseph Roth.\Roth said a solar power bill in the Indiana General Assembly won't be a factor in the company's calculation. Senate Bill 309 would eliminate a discount homeowners and businesses receive when they buy back extra energy they had sent to the electric grid because they had generated more than they needed.\Opponents of the bill said it would discourage homeowners, businesses and schools from switching to solar energy because it will cut into their electric savings. Some larger users, such as schools, say it could cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars over several years.\""This bill fundamentally and significantly changes the compensation for investing in new energy production,"" said Kerwin OIson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition. ""It is having a chilling effect on homeowners, businesses and schools.""\Ikea, though, would not be affected by the rule change because it never produces more power than it needs and, therefore, doesn't send any electricity to the grid. Roth said Ikea's solar energy provides 20 to 60 percent of the electricity a store needs, with the rest being drawn from the local utility grid.\""We use solar to supplement the energy we take from the grid, not replace it,"" Roth said.\A typical Ikea store has about 4,000 rooftop solar panels that generate more than a megawatt of energy. But the store uses an enormous amount of energy for lighted displays, kitchen service and air conditioning, so even a megawatt, which is enough to power about 100 homes, doesn't provide enough juice for everything.\The company touts itself as an environmentally conscientious corporation that is ""about living within the limits of the planet and protecting the environment,"" according to its sustainability strategy.\At least one local company has a bid on the Fishers Ikea job. Bob McKinney, president of Johnson Melloh Solutions in Indianapolis, said his company is talking to a general contractor in California that Ikea favors, REC Solar, to negotiate what type of subcontract work it can do on the Fishers store.\""Our bid was to construct, engineer and do everything, but they like to use REC so we'll see what they want us to do,"" McKinney said.\Ikea would not disclose how much it costs to install solar panels or what the cost savings would be. But at Sheridan Schools in Hamilton County, Johnson-Melloh built a 1.8 megawatt system that costs $4.3 million over 20 years for installation, operation and maintenance. Sheridan schools business manager Robin Popejoy said the system will save $4 million to $5 million over 25 years, and estimated SB 309 would cost the district up to $900,000 in that time.\More and more school districts, in fact, are switching to solar to keep their budgets under control. It's why Sheridan Community Schools Superintendent Dave Munday and seven other superintendents testified in opposition to SB 309.\""It would cut into our savings significantly,"" he said.\SB 309 would do away with the current energy credit borrowing system called ""net metering,"" in which solar producers provide their extra energy to the utilities for a certain price and buy it back at the same price when they need it.\The pending legislation would require solar producers to give up their energy at a lower price and buy it back at a rate 70 percent higher.\Mark Maasel, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said the current system is unfair to the utilities because solar users are dumping electricity into the grid but not paying for its maintenance.\""If you use it, you should help pay for it,"" he said, though he acknowledged that the extra electricity doesn't put added stress on the grid.\But Olson of the Citizens Action Coalition said the solar users are assessed a monthly service fee just like regular electrical user and use the grid much less.\It's the second straight year utilities are backing a bill to eliminate the net metering system. An even more onerous provision was dropped from this year's legislation. The so-called ""buy-all, sell-all"" plan would have required solar users to send all their energy to the grid at the wholesale rate and buy it all back at a higher price.\Partly in response to the schools' concerns, legislators will let Sheridan and others who already have solar stay on the current system for 30 years, and those who get solar before 2022 can continue net metering until 2032. But anyone installing solar after 2022 will have to pay the new rate.\Mundy said solar not only cuts costs, but is helping the environment and teaching the students a science lesson at the same time.\""I have received many letters of praise from residents and farmers,"" he said. ""Environmentally, it is the perfect thing to do in a farm community.""\Call IndyStar reporter John Tuohy at 317 444-6418. Follow him on Twitter: @john_tuohy."
165,"As the gubernatorial race heads into its final month, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and Democratic challenger Dr. Woody Myers have mapped out strikingly different strategies to grow jobs while protecting the health and environment of Hoosiers.\Indiana's environmental issues have not let up much in recent years. The state is a top producer of carbon emissions and continues to struggle with widespread air and water pollution. At the same time, the cost of energy is rising and the impacts of climate change are hitting harder than ever before.\Holcomb, a lifelong Hoosier and a veteran of the U.S. Navy, doesn't list the environment as one of the top issues in his campaign. Before becoming governor four years ago, he worked as an adviser to former Gov. Mitch Daniels and formerly served as chairman of the Indiana Republican Party. He was lieutenant governor for a year under former Gov. Mike Pence.\Myers, a physician by trade and third-generation Hoosier, calls the environment one of the top-five issues of his campaign, and criticizes Holcomb's record. He was appointed as the state health commissioner by former Gov. Robert Orr in 1985. He also ran against Andre Carson for Indiana's 7th Congressional District in 2008.\IndyStar questioned them about the environmental problems they believe are facing the state, as well as what they would like to see in Indiana's environmental future.\When it comes to energy and regulation, the candidates took different approaches. But there also were a few topics on which Holcomb and Myers agreed. Both acknowledged that public health and racial justice are tied to the environment, and pledged to address pollution that disproportionately affects marginalized communities.\IndyStar's environmental team sought interviews with Holcomb and Myers last month. Myers made himself available for a 45-minute interview and offered specific details related to issues such as energy and funding for the state environmental agency. Holcomb declined IndyStar's request for an interview. He also asked that IndyStar limit questions to fewer than 10, which he answered via email.\Here's what the candidates had to say.\Indiana is one of the country's top emitters of carbon dioxide, a climate change-causing greenhouse gas, according to a national energy agency. The state is also seeing effects of climate change, particularly with increased rain and flooding that affected the state's corn and soybean crops last year.\Such changes are expected to grow more severe and frequent, according to research by the Purdue Climate Change Research Center. Furthermore, when it comes to stewardship of the environment, Indiana has been ranked last or close to last on various surveys. On both issues, the candidates differ significantly.\Woody Myers\Climate change is among Myers' top priorities, according to his campaign website, along with education, healthcare, the economy and workforce. His campaign defines the climate crisis as both a national security and public health threat.\He echoed that sentiment during his interview, referencing the wildfires that are currently raging along the West Coast: That is ""partially our fault because we are not contributing to a reduction of consumption of fossil fuel as aggressively as we should. And it's wreaking havoc in our environment.""\Myers, 66, says his generation should take more responsibility on the issue.\""My generation, in essence, is part of the blame. We should have acted sooner, but it's not too late,"" Myers said. ""So it's my generation that ought to be the lead in fixing it.""\Myers said he feels the governor has put too little energy and attention into environmental stewardship, saying that ""we have had insufficient focus on the environment in Indiana.""\Some of the specific tenets of Myers' plan include doing an inventory of the state's greenhouse gas emissions and establishing reduction targets. He also wants to invite companies to purchase carbon offsets and enhance reforestation efforts.\Gov. Eric Holcomb\Holcomb's stance on climate change is a bit less clear. The governor's campaign website does not list the topic among his top-five priorities, which include the economy, workforce development, infrastructure and the drug epidemic. In fact, IndyStar could find no mention of the climate or environment on his website.\In response to a question about the environmental issues that were most important to him, Holcomb cited being responsible stewards of the state's natural resources and continuing to make improvements to the air and water. However, the words ""climate change"" were not among them.\When asked his beliefs on climate change and the role of humans in causing it, Holcomb said that ""while the extent of the contribution is debatable, especially depending on where on the planet you are, it's reasonable to assume that human activity contributes to changes in our climate over time.""\IndyStar asked the governor about the amount of attention he has given to environmental issues, referencing the roughly 30 seconds of a previous 26-minute State of the State address in which he talked about clean coal. Holcomb pushed back at the idea that his administration cares less about the environment: ""I don't accept the premise that environmental issues aren't a focus of my administration,"" he said. ""I could devote a full 26 minutes on the environment and just might consider doing so!""\In his response to IndyStar, Holcomb mentioned several environmental achievements under his administration. He touted his commitment to planting one million trees in five years, and is already a fifth of the way there, calling them ""natural scrubbers."" The state recently established two new state forests, though some advocates are concerned this will give the state more timber to harvest. He also said that Indiana is using more than $40 million from a legal settlement with Volkswagen to improve air quality — funds that can only be spent for such programs and policies under terms of the settlement.\""That's just part of our environmental record,"" Holcomb said.\More than half of Indiana's energy today still comes from coal, though some utilities have announced plans to retire their coal plants in the coming decade. Historically, Indiana's reliance on coal has kept energy prices low, and the state has used its cheaper-than-average energy to attract businesses. But over the last 10 years, Indiana's energy costs have risen by nearly 30% and it now finds itself in the middle of the pack compared to other states.\Many environmental advocates point to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, as cheaper than fossil fuels, and point out that the energy industry is transitioning on its own. Indiana lawmakers are in the midst of a task force to determine the state's energy policy for the future, though past policy decisions have slowed the transition from away from coal.\Gov. Eric Holcomb\When it comes to energy, Holcomb supports an all-of-the-above approach. This type of energy strategy includes renewable energy, but keeps fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal in the mix, as well. In the governor's 2017 State of the State address, he said that ""Indiana runs on coal.""\And he continued that sentiment in his responses to IndyStar, saying that his ""team is committed to supporting Indiana's most abundant and reliable energy sources, including the most allweather-reliable sources such as clean coal and gas."" That energy mix is ""helping to keep energy costs low for Hoosiers,"" according to Holcomb.\In 2017, the governor signed into law a bill that phased out net metering, a policy to make rooftop solar more affordable for homeowners — becoming one of a few states to do so. This year, he also signed a law that slowed the transition from coal and last year backed an ultimately unsuccessful bill that would have prevented new renewable projects.\Holcomb has said that he doesn't believe the environment and economy need to be at odds: ""We've shown in Indiana that we can have a roaring economy [prior to the pandemic] while also improving and conserving the environment."" He points to the fact that more than 80% percent of the state is farm or forest land.\Woody Myers\Myers is all about renewable energy, he told IndyStar: ""We still burn too much coal in Indiana, and it's time for us to declare that we are moving away from coal and we're not going to protect it anymore.""\Myers acknowledges that the state won't be able to ""get completely away"" from fossil fuels today, as there needs to be more developments in battery storage and grid updates. Still, ""the goal is to do that at one point,"" Myers said, ""but we can make much more progress now.""\In the meantime, Myers wants to bring back net metering as well as bring back a policy on energy efficiency and establish renewable standards. He also wants to put solar and wind on government buildings and properties such as correctional facilities, to establish rebates and credits for renewable technologies and to create incentives for renewable manufacturers to locate in Indiana.\Myers said he believes shifts to clean energy can create a boom in jobs and help grow the economy. There already are more jobs in Indiana in clean energy than in the coal industry, and Myers said he wants to focus on helping those coal communities transition to new, clean opportunities.\Indiana has one of the largest carbon emissions footprints in the country, at 176 million metric tons in 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Indiana ranks 8th in the country for total carbon emissions, but when factored for emissions per person, it outranks almost every other state, including Texas, Illinois and Florida. Indiana's average emissions per square mile is the highest of the top 10 states with the most total emissions.\In the last decade, funding for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management has fallen by 20%, even as state spending grew by 17%, with much of the loss affecting pollution control programs. The agency's staff also lost 150 employees in that time, causing many environmental experts to question whether the agency has the resources it needs to accomplish its job.\Air quality is not the only issue handled by IDEM. Many wastewater plants and industrial facilities in Indiana remain in significant noncompliance of the Clean Water Act, and even more are listed by the Environmental Protection Agency as having ""high priority violations"" of the Clean Air Act.\Gov. Eric Holcomb\Holcomb has in the past supported President Donald Trump's push to deregulate emissions from coal-fired power plants and other sources, in 2017 applauding his decision to reverse regulations on greenhouse gases.n He holds strong on that support today, after the Trump administration moved forward on dozens of rollbacks that experts say will likely lead to more air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\Holcomb argues that removing ""one-size-fits-all overregulation"" from the federal government will allow the state and Hoosier taxpayers to pursue the all-of-the-above energy mix, which he described as diverse and balanced.\""States know how to best craft environment policies that balance their needs. I support efforts by the current administration to return more authority, on a number of issues, back to the states,"" Holcomb said in an email. ""My point is, hold us accountable for our footprint.""\Holcomb last year signed a bill that would allow for an increase in IDEM permitting fees to offset the agency's funding decrease, but environmental advocates said that bill really only held the IDEM budget at its 2018 levels — still 20% lower than they were a decade before.\When asked whether he would consider reinstating funding for the environmental agency, Holcomb did not answer with a yes or no. Instead, he said the air and water are the cleanest they have been since the Clean Air and Water Acts, both passed between 40 and 50 years ago. He also said the Indiana Finance Authority has helped cities and towns save millions by upgrading water and sewer systems.\""My Administration doesn't measure our effectiveness by the number of dollars or personnel,"" Holcomb said in an email. ""We've got a great team at IDEM and they're continuing to make significant contributions to our state. ... We want to make sure we continue doing all our parts to keep improving our environment community by community.""\Woody Myers\Although he did not specifically respond to the rollbacks, Myers does not share Holcomb's positive view of Trump's approach to environmental issues.\""Trump is wrong,"" Myers said. ""He's wrong about so many things, but his denial of climate change is a part of the major problem in our environment. It's just wrong, climate change is real.""\Regarding environmental regulation within the state, Myers said he would also reinstate funding for IDEM.\Myers said if he is elected, he will ensure that IDEM was ""re-energized"" to address the state's issues.\This might entail ensuring that IDEM takes a look at current regulations, he said, to ensure that they are up-to-date with most recent recommendations and data. Myers said he would also work to make sure that IDEM hears public input, so that people feel they have voice in the decisions that are being made by the environmental agency\""IDEM needs a shot of epinephrine,"" Myers said, referencing the chemical also known as adrenaline. ""IDEM will get more resources, IDEM will get more attention, IDEM will do its job.""\As the COVID-19 pandemic has upended lives this year, attention on public health has taken precedence in much of the political sphere. At the same time, public outcry over systemic racism has also dominated much of the political conversation after the killing of George Floyd resulted in widespread protests over police brutality.\In the following months, the environmental community was also pushed to reflect on inequity within itself, as well as place higher priority on the systemic racism that puts Black communities at higher risk from pollution, hazardous waste and climate change. Air pollution has also been tied to more severe cases of COVID-19, which has also disproportionately impacted Black populations.\Dr. Woody Myers\Myers, previously the State Health Commissioner, at one point oversaw both the state health department and IDEM. During that time he said he saw the way that the environment directly impacted public health, such as how air pollution can lead to respiratory issues and heart problems.\""Another reason we care about the environment is because we care about health, right. So we've got to make sure that there is a linkage,"" Myers said. ""Everything has to have public health, I think, as its core.""\Citing the historic\ contamination in East Chicago neighborhoods that resulted in hundreds of children, mostly in Black communities, being affected by lead poisoning, Myers acknowledged that public health and the environment play a role in racial justice, as well.\Gov.

166,"RICHMOND – An audience of solar power supporters that filled Council Chambers on Monday night got what it was looking for when Richmond Common Council members voted down proposed changes to the city's ordinance regarding net metering.\The vote brought a temporary end to discussions that began a month ago about the ordinance that would have made changes to how Richmond Power & Light handles those customers who use solar panels to generate more power than they need to use themselves.\Solar power supporters turned out in force for last month's public hearing on the matter, saying the new rules were likely to discourage more people from installing solar panels at their homes.\Under the current rules adopted in November 2010, customers who generate excess power are given a one-to-one credit for each kilowatt hour produced more than what they need for their own homes.\That ordinance sets a cap on the number of kilowatt hours that can be produced under the net metering program, effectively creating a limit of 15-20 homes that could take advantage of the situation.\The proposed ordinance would have lined up RP&L with the rules used by the Indiana Municipal Power Agency, of which RP&L is a member.\Under those guidelines, customers would have been reimbursed in cash by IMPA for those excess kilowatt hours at a wholesale rate plus 25 percent instead of the current higher retail rate.\IMPA's plan also doesn't put any limitations on the number of customers that can be part of the program.\After last month's public hearing, Common Council held the proposed ordinance on second reading, giving the city's Environmental Sustainability Commission a chance to look over the possible changes and report back to the council.\Alison Zajdel, a former executive director of Cope Environmental Center and the current chair of the environmental commission, told council members Monday the commission believed a compromise between the current ordinance and IMPA's rules could be worked out given more time to discuss the issue.\""Basically, we want to come to a compromise ordinance,"" she said. ""We're going from the current ordinance that's in place, which is — we think — very pro-environment, very favorable to one that is — in our opinion — the opposite.\""More than anything we just want to slow down and explore some options and make sure that we've thought through everything fully and that we can come to some kind of agreement.""\Most council members agreed the net metering rules didn't need to be addressed at this time, which would allow for more discussions in the coming months and eventually a new version of the ordinance to be written.\""When we get to that maximum load (of households that can be part of the current net metering program) ... then we can address it again, two, four, five, six even 10 years from now, however long it takes to hit that number of homes,"" Council member Ron Oler suggested.\Bruce Wissel cast the lone vote in favor of the proposed ordinance, citing — among other things — his belief that the current rules could lead to higher costs for non-solar RP&L customers.\""The individual suppliers will not be responsible for the maintenance of grid, which is the highest inflationary cost that we're facing each year. They're not responsible for compliance issues, expenses of regulatory agencies, personnel, distribution costs, transmission costs. Those costs will have to be passed on to other (ratepayers),"" he said.\""I can't think of any business model that suggests you buy power — a limited shelf product — on the demand of the seller at a higher cost than you can buy it on the open market, pay for the costs of the storage, the staff, the personnel, the physical plant and expect to stay in business very long.""\Several council members praised the way members of the environmental commission worked with council and RP&L to discuss the ordinance and thanked the audience for providing feedback on the issue.\The sentiment was shared by Zajdel.\""It's really nice to be able to work through something as a partner with the environmental commission and the council,"" she said. ""That's been helpful, and it's something we want to continue.""\Contact Jason Truitt at (765) 973-4459 or jtruitt@pal-item.com.\CREDIT: Jason Truitt"
167,"Jesus' birth was chaotic. So is telling his message in pandemic\Christmas this year looks nothing like what we expected.\For those of us in the church, it's especially weird. Christmas is supposed to be a time of packed sanctuaries, glorious music, delightful children's pageants and magical candle lighting.\This year? We're attempting to translate all of that into shaky smartphone videos, glitchy livestreams, staticky conference calls, ever-evolving social media, weather-challenged drive-in gatherings and more – none of which were covered in our seminary classes. This is not the Christmas we planned.\And yet, has Christmas ever gone according to plan? If our nativities are to be believed, Jesus was born in a serene, peaceful setting. Our Christian Scripture tells a different story, though – one with unplanned pregnancies, undesirable birth accommodations, political tensions and social unrest.\It was messy, hard and definitely not according to plan, but this is the way God chose to come into the world. That's Christmas.\With Indiana having recently led the nation in COVID-19 cases per capita, we, as clergy and faith leaders, must change our plans. A faithful response to this historic pandemic does not require recklessly risking others' lives (including the lives of clergy) in the name of doing God's work.\We should not be planning in-person, indoor gatherings, we should be honoring hospital restrictions on visiting our parishioners even when it's painful, and we need to find new ways of connecting with and caring for our people that don't require our physical presence. For many of us, that turns the traditions of Christmas – and all of our conventional ways of pastoring – upside down.\The birth of Christ changed our paradigm 2,000-plus years ago, and it continues to do so today as we learn to rely on technology for creative connection and on colleagues such as hospital chaplains to faithfully extend the ministry of presence when we cannot.\Loving your neighbor in different, uncertain, messy, challenging ways is the spirit of Christmas. When the angel visited Mary, she was afraid because her life would be disrupted, her childhood would come to a close, and persecution for being an unwed mother was a real possibility.\There are a lot of easier ways the Christmas story could have unfolded. Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, the Magi: This wasn't their plan, but they adapted and good news was born into the world.\There are a lot of easier ways we could be ""doing church"" these days, but we have the same opportunity. We can adapt and find ways to be the church even while physically separated, and good news will again be birthed in our world.\That's Christmas.\The Rev. Ronnie Bell\Cumberland United Methodist Church\The Rev. Mary Dicken\Meridian Street United Methodist Church\Solar customers with excess power will soon lose way to sell it\Sarah Bowman does a great job articulating the energy roadmap laid out by Indiana's 21st Century Energy Task Force.\Unfortunately, the task force neglected to address the pressing issue of net metering set to expire in the spring of 2021.\Net metering allows homeowners and businesses with solar to sell excess energy to utility companies. Customers are typically paid with credits that can be applied to purchase energy when solar is not as robust.\This simple exchange can have an astounding impact. By applying the concept of private ownership, homeowners and businesses simultaneously save money by selling their energy and contribute to a cleaner environment. Without such a practice, homeowners and businesses will be putting energy onto the grid without compensation.\Ending net metering will inhibit homeowners and businesses from achieving the full benefits of their investment, and will terminate a market-based incentive for solar.\I urge the co-chairs of the energy task force, Republican state Sens. Ed Soliday of Valparaiso and Eric Koch of Bedford, to protect constituents' ability to sell their own energy, and pause the phaseout of net metering until this issue is discussed at further length by the task force.\Blake Gardiner\Munster, Indiana\Side effect of canceling surgeries: Patients forfeit their deductibles\I work in medical billing, and I am very concerned for our citizens who may have to forfeit their deductible due to Gov. Eric Holcomb's freeze on some hospital surgeries.\I am astutely aware that most insurance companies do not have the best interest of their clients in mind. These are my concerns: I know it will be almost impossible to get the insurance companies to allow a deductible to roll over to 2021 unless some order/bill/law is affecting their actions.\Also, many people's plans change on Jan. 1. If their procedure isn't covered by their new insurance carrier, are there any safeguards for Hoosiers to get their old policy to cover these procedures after the new policy begins?\If you consider the fact that many people's deductibles are $3,000, a scenario in which only 10 people lose their surgery appointment for the year essentially puts $30,000 of profit into the health insurance industry's pockets (plus the money they save by not paying for the surgeries). A hundred missed surgeries would be $300,000 of profit for the industry and money out of Hoosiers' pocketbooks.\Of course, the number continues to grow the more that people that are affected by this.\Some people may be under the impression that these types of surgeries are facelifts or something of that frivolous nature, but these are surgeries such as mastectomies, knee replacements and other needed surgeries. This is not a trivial issue.\I would like to know if you are doing anything to protect Hoosiers? From what I know about the parameters of insurance policies, action must be taken before Jan. 1 if there are going to be protections created for the people impacted by this.\Have our legislators taken any action to protect Hoosiers affected by this, or is this just another burden that citizens will have to shoulder in this pandemic?\Amanda McKinley\Bloomington\Comparison of WWII and pandemic is appreciated\I appreciated the Dec. 10 letter by the Rev. Susan Marie Smith in which she compared the sacrifice of the population during the four years of World War II with how people are reacting to the pandemic now.\What are the reasons that we see people ignoring science and common sense and pleas of our government to protect themselves and others from the virus?\Is science not receiving the respect it deserves in schools so people ignore or lack the most basic information.\Is it our more diverse culture that keeps us from coming together in actions that could have lessoned the virus spread? Do the minority who put personal liberty over personal responsibility just have a bigger presence?\How will the social history of 2020 be written?\Carolyn Curry\Indianapolis\Doyel column on COVID-19 and sports brings pandemic into focus\Wow, as with every day now, I read IndyStar while watching the news almost addicted to what is happening here with the virus. As everyone knows, the virus has impacted every part of what we consider a necessary part of our life.\The sports section is not my first choice as I approach the news every day unless Gregg Doyel has an article. And as much as I respect this bright, compassionate and fair commentator, he really hit a home run recently, if I can say that.\I had kids in football and a grandson who played some college ball. So I know what sports can offer young people and what they can add to their young lives. However, as I have been asking for months, how can we continue to spend the millions of dollars and effort on keeping sports afloat when thousands die every day?\Doyel does not often move into the political theater going on now, but his article on a visit to a local hospital asked every question I have been asking for months. I applaud that he is willing to lend his voice to this unnecessary and continuing effort to support a leisure activity while families everyday lose loved ones, jobs and homes and go without necessary food and income.\Doyel's question to a nurse about how often she gets tested for COVID-19 and the answer probably says it best. ""I haven't been tested since May."" Good job, Gregg Doyel, shame on our coaches, colleges, owners and even those who attend to watch players risk their lives for our entertainment\K. Jane Adcock\Plainfield\The Electoral College is ridiculous. Indiana has path out if it wants it.\Since the Electoral College has now met to formally ratify President-elect Joe Biden's victory, let us consider how utterly ridiculous this method is for choosing a president.\In 2016, President Donald Trump received nearly 3 million fewer votes nationwide and won the Electoral College 306-232. This year, Biden won by the same total, 306-232, while winning the popular vote by over 7 million.\Regardless of party, anyone who can count should recognize that a system in which these two vote margins are awarded the same ""score"" is absurd. It is little better than a roulette wheel at reflecting the actual will of voters.\While we should eventually ratify a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College, that will take time. Until then, Indiana should do its part to rid us of this useless anachronism by joining the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

168,"
It's already clear that passing a budget and making property tax reform part of the constitution will be the entrees on the legislative menu in the Indiana House this year.
\
What isn't clear quite yet are the side dishes -- the bills that might not get as much attention but that, if successful, will still have the force of law behind them.
\
And local state representatives have a buffet of ideas they'll be serving up as the 2009 General Assembly gets under way today.
\
* Welfare drug tests: State Rep. Tim Neese, R-Elkhart, wants to mandate random drug testing for welfare recipients.
\
Neese said if taxpayers can be screened at their workplaces, then those who receive the benefits of tax dollars also should be screened.
\
""I offered this last year and it did not get a hearing,"" he said, declining to speculate on its chances this year. ""I'm not going to play a numbers game. I'm just going to author it and hopefully it does get assigned to a committee.""
\
* Renewable energy: State Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Jimtown, hopes to introduce a bill offering incentives for companies to invest in renewable energy -- something she recognizes will be tough to do during a difficult budget year.
\
""There's no money in the budget to fund things like tax credits,"" she said.
\
But when President-elect Barack Obama takes office Jan. 20, the federal government will likely push a lot of money for renewable energy, she said.
\
""Indiana should be positioned to be on the front line of receiving jobs from that,"" she said. ""It's where the federal government is going; it's where we need to go.""
\
* Energy and environment: State Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, says he wants to establish a renewable energy standard in Indiana -- a rule that would require utilities to have a certain portion of their power generated from renewable sources.
\
And he wants to improve net metering rules, he said. That would allow businesses, homes and schools to build their own power sources, such as solar panels, and have their meter roll backward when they're generating excess energy.
\
""When I started (in the House), there were only a few states that had decent net metering,"" Dvorak said. ""Indiana's now one of the worst in the country when it comes to net metering.""
\
* Worker classification: Companies that deal with construction work have been known to misclassify employees by saying they're not really on the payroll, but are independent contractors, said state Rep. David Niezgodski, D-South Bend.
\
But the companies, in many cases, still supervise the workers and set the terms of their workday, he said.
\
A bill he plans to introduce would help state agencies communicate with one another about worker classifications so that investigations into the practice can move forward.
\
And, Niezgodski stresses, it's not meant to target independent contractors.
\
""There are good people out there, and that's how they want to work,"" he said. ""This doesn't include that type of thing.""

169,"Some play offense. Some play defense. At times, some are talented enough to play both.\The same is true for my colleagues in the Indiana General Assembly and our state's delegation in Congress, as we are handed possible increased federal carbon dioxide (CO2) regulations.\Whether it comes in the form of rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or ""cap-and-trade"" legislation from Congress, few states are more and jeopardized by CO2 regulation than Indiana.\Coal is the single largest domestic source of man-made CO2 and Indiana utilities use enormous amounts of it. It's the least expensive and most reliable way to produce electricity. That's why Indiana enjoys some of the lowest electric rates in the nation and why so many energy-intensive, heavy industries have traditionally located here.\How can we deal with the possibility of increased federal CO2 regulations without fumbling our efficiencies, our economy or our environment?\We need to be key players -- and smart, engaged ones.\CO2 regulation will force Indiana's utilities to use less coal. Since every available alternative to coal will increase electric bills, our challenge is to find reliable, low-cost alternatives.\Abandoning coal is not the answer. Coal is a major Indiana industry, employing thousands of Hoosiers and generating millions in wages and tax revenue. I strongly endorse research into technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration that would allow the continued use of coal as a major source of clean power.\Continuing to demonize nuclear power isn't the answer either. Nuclear power provides safe, CO2-free and emissions-free power to millions.\And we shouldn't ignore perhaps the simplest way to reduce CO2: Use less electricity. Conservation is good for the environment and good for consumers' pocketbooks.\There also is a role for CO2-free ""renewable"" sources of electricity such as wind and solar technology. We must recognize, though, that they are intermittent sources of power that require backup sources of power when the wind and the sun refuse to cooperate. That's why we must guard against relying too heavily on renewables until advancing technology increases their reliability or storage.\That is also why I am supportive -- but cautious -- about the use of programs that provide a financial incentive to use renewables. For example, ""net-metering"" programs allow you to install your own source of electric generation, such as solar panels or small wind turbines, and sell any excess power to your local utility. Indiana now allows net metering up to 10 kilowatts. I favor increasing that tenfold to 100 kilowatts.\Gov. Mitch Daniels recently stated at a conference for developers of wind energy components: ""Our strategy for energy in this state is an all of the above strategy . . . as a state and frankly as a nation, we have to be committed to pro-growth strategies or we can't pay for the debts we have now, let alone the investments we want to make in the future.""\I believe Indiana will be best served by an energy game plan that encourages a wide variety of players and choices."
170,"Since 1990, Indiana's 21st Century Scholars program has helped thousands of low-income Hoosier students aspire to and afford a college education. Nearly 110,000 21st Century Scholars are enrolled across the state from seventh grade through college, and more than 30,000 students have earned a degree using the 21st century scholarship.\Over the past several years, the program has evolved with a single goal: to ensure more scholars are prepared to successfully complete college. Scholars are now required to earn a 2.5 high school GPA, and the most significant change has been the addition of the Scholar Success Program (SSP). The Scholar Success Program, approved by the General Assembly in 2012, is made up of 12 college and career readiness activities -- three per year -- scholars must complete during high school to earn their scholarship.\The activities, created by a diverse group of educators and community partners, are steps all college-bound students should take, such as visiting a college campus, researching college costs, exploring career paths and filing out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Nearly all activities can be completed independently, and scholars have flexibility in completion. For example, they can visit a college campus virtually if they are unable to visit in person.\In the past, too many of Indiana's 21st century scholars started college but didn't finish. It's imperative we provide scholars with the ability to succeed in college, and that means arming students with the knowledge of how to thrive on a college campus -- including not only an academic and career plan, but things as simple as providing an avenue for tutoring and guidance. Across the state, we're hearing from educators and partners that these supports are crucial to scholars' success.\The clock is ticking for Indiana's class of 2017 21st Century Scholars. Current high school seniors are the first group of scholars required to complete the Scholar Success Program. To date, 84 percent of senior scholars have ScholarTrack accounts to track their activity progress, and 27 percent have completed all 12 activities, up three percentage points from December 2016. Scholars who do not complete all required activities by June 30 of their senior year will not receive their scholarship. While current scholars are on track to surpass the historic average of students who receive the scholarship, we must persist in efforts to improve this number.\The Commission for Higher Education continues to partner with community organizations, businesses and schools across the state to ensure scholars have every opportunity to complete the required activities. Thousands of emails, phone calls and text messages are being sent, and events are being held throughout Indiana to assist scholars in completing their activities.\We know that the path to success for Hoosiers and our state comes through completing education beyond high school, and we believe the Scholar Success Program is an essential way to keep scholars on track. As more jobs in Indiana and the nation require a quality credential, we must double down on efforts that ensure more Hoosiers are prepared for a 21st century career.\Teresa Lubbers\Commissioner, Indiana Commission for Higher Education\Pre-K should be expanded in Indiana\As pediatricians, we recognize how critical high-quality early childhood education is to the health and development of Indiana's children. As Indiana lawmakers consider expanding access to high-quality pre-kindergarten in our state this year, we hope to see an expansion that matches the significant impact early childhood education has on young children.\The Indiana chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics supports the expansion of high-quality pre-K because it is vital to the healthy development and future success of our children. Research has shown that high-quality preschool education is associated with greater academic success, higher high school graduation rates, increased years of education completed, higher earnings, reduced juvenile crime, decreased adolescent pregnancy rates, decreased need for future special education services and a significant rate of return on investment.\Evaluation of the two Indiana high-quality pre-K pilot programs, Indiana Early Education Matching Grant (EEMG) and On My Way Pre-K (OMW), have been very promising. These programs have demonstrated improved kindergarten readiness skills, including language, early literacy and social skills. Participating families have also reported beneficial outcomes, such as use of positive parenting techniques and improved earnings and/or educational opportunities. Recent research has determined that the return on investment for high-quality pre-K in Indiana is $4 for every dollar spent.\However, there is a significant need for expanding access to affordable high-quality pre-K programming throughout the state. According to the 2017 Indiana Early Learning Advisory Committee Annual Report, there are more than 27,000 low-income four-year-old Hoosier children who are not in a high-quality subsidized pre-K program, such as Head Start, Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) program, EEMG or OMW. Currently, there are still nine counties with no high-quality program options for families. These statistics are made even more alarming by the fact that 51 percent of young children under five years of age in Indiana live in low-income families. Of those children, 26 percent are living in poverty. Moreover, in 2015-16, 5 percent of children in Indiana were retained in kindergarten, costing the state $24 million.\The evidence clearly shows that investment in high-quality pre-K is vital to the well-being of Hoosier children and their families. Failure to support optimal learning environments in this critical early childhood period, especially for those children living in low-income households who encounter the greatest school readiness challenges, has long-term adverse implications throughout a child's lifetime. The Indiana chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports expanding access to high-quality pre-K as an effective way of promoting the health, development and learning of Hoosier children. We look forward to working with Indiana lawmakers, the All IN 4 Pre-K coalition and others to find the best path forward.\Kathleen Swec, MD, FAAP\Early Brain and Childhood Development Committee Chair\Indiana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics\Council should adopt\transit plan\As our City-County Council works to determine whether to enact the .025 percent local income tax for the Marion County Transit Plan, I'd like to point out some key considerations:\First, on Nov. 8, Marion County voters said loud and clear that they want the tax enacted. By a nearly 60-40 percent margin, voters said they're willing to pay to improve the woefully inadequate transit system in our city.\Second, while Indianapolis' growth over the past few decades has been extraordinary, it's sometimes easy to forget that significant parts of our community do not fully participate in the benefits of that growth. This must change so we can extend the benefits of living in Indianapolis to all parts of Indianapolis. One key to doing that is accessible and affordable mass transit.\I'm not suggesting that transit is the one factor that determines success, but transportation barriers can create heightened challenges for marginalized populations, including many of the disconnected young men OpportunIndy seeks to link to community resources. Access to high-quality jobs, higher education, health care and nutritious food helps to define quality-of-life for residents -- and transit expands such access.\This can be especially true in Indianapolis, a geographically large city where, if your neighborhood does not have basic amenities, you must travel a long way to access them. While travel time to jobs and services has proven to be a key indicator in economic mobility, a recent Brookings study shows that only one-third of all jobs in metropolitan Indianapolis can be reached via transit in 90 minutes, and only 42 percent of working-age residents live near a transit stop (the national average is 69 percent). The study ranked Indy's metro area 64th out of the top 100 metro areas for transit coverage and transit job access.\The result is a city where owning an automobile is imperative, whether you're trying to reach a job in the city's core or one out on the edges of the region. However, when you consider that the cost of owning a car is typically about $8,000 a year, and that roughly a third of Indianapolis households have a median income of less than $30,000, you see that owning a car is out of reach for many.\That's why Indianapolis must embrace mass transit, starting with the Marion County Transit Plan, which begins the process of launching Indy Connect, the regional vision for transit. With greater frequency of services and more stops and more service at key times of the day, an investment in this plan will pay solid returns.\Most notably, perhaps, it will put us on the road to engaging previously excluded segments of our community in our collective progress and create a community more attractive to young workers, tourists and other visitors. These investments are essential to the city's regional and global competitiveness.\Please join me in urging your City-County councilor to enact the transit tax. To learn how to contact your councilor, go to indy.gov/council.\Michael R. Twyman\Executive Director, OpportunIndy\Republicans look for\better health care plan\Eight in 10 Americans believe we should significantly change or repeal Obamacare.\Why?\It's forcing millions of Americans and Hoosiers to make very tough choices.\Families and individuals covered through their employer are forced to make the difficult choice: pay their premium each month or pay their bills. Rising premium costs have far outpaced the growth of paychecks meaning less take-home pay. At the same time, deductibles, the amount of money paid before insurance kicks in, are skyrocketing. Deductibles are up 63 percent since 2011.\People covered through the health care exchanges are facing a different choice: keep their trusted doctor or find a more affordable, different plan. In Indiana, four of the eight plans available on the exchanges last year are no longer an option for Hoosiers. As a result, 68,000 Hoosiers lost their plan. Additionally, in one third of the country -- including five states -- Americans have access to only one insurer in 2017.\Families who are working to support themselves and don't qualify for Medicaid are facing the toughest choice of all: pay a premium they can't afford or go uninsured altogether while paying the federally-mandated penalty. Nearly the same number of Americans chose to pay the penalty for not having insurance as those who received a subsidy last year. To put this choice in perspective, the average 2017 deductibles for individuals and families on an Obamacare ""bronze plan"" are $6,000 and $12,000 respectively. For a family making $50,000 a year, that's no better than going uninsured.\The reality is that Obamacare turned the entire health care system on its head and still left nearly 30 million Americans uninsured. Of the 20 million Americans covered under the law, half were thrown into traditional Medicaid, a failing program that studies show leaves patients worse off than their uninsured counterparts. Furthermore, estimates show that as many as 5 million Americans lost their coverage and were forced into the exchanges as a result of the law.\Increased out-of-pocket costs, limited choices and restricted access are not the changes we were promised when Obamacare was signed into law in 2010.\For these reasons and others, we agree with the majority of Americans who want relief from Obamacare. Doing nothing at this point would be irresponsible.\So, Congress took the first procedural steps to repeal and replace Obamacare with a better health care system that puts health care decisions back where they belong: in patients' hands. As we move forward, we are committed to ensuring that every American has access to quality, affordable health coverage. We all agree that a smooth transition is critical. Any changes should take place over time, and we will not pull the rug out from under anyone.\Claims that millions of Americans will lose coverage are simply not true. Without a doubt, some Americans benefited from the law, and we are committed to protecting those Americans. However, far more Americans have been upended by the law, and we are working to bring them relief.\As we are in the process of repealing Obamacare, we will also rebuild our health care system with our ideas, some of which are included in ""A Better Way Agenda."" These ideas include protecting coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions and allowing people under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' health care plans. In fact, our health care proposals have always included these ideas -- before Obamacare, during debate of the law and they remain a priority today.\We are committed to working with all of our colleagues and the Trump-Pence Administration to build a health care system that works better for you. Please take the time to look at some of our ideas, available online at better.gop.gov. We want to hear your insights and ideas about how we can improve health care for everyone. We are determined to provide relief to the millions of families facing tough choices as a direct result of Obamacare, and we hope that you'll work with us to achieve our goal of more affordable, accessible health care that offers you and your family better options.\Rep.

We have been looking forward to using the sun's energy to produce most of our electricity from our own rooftop. But now our state legislature may prevent us from doing so.\Senate Bill 309 is scheduled for a hearing Feb. 2, and if passed will permanently ban net metering after 10 years or when solar energy equals 1 percent of the utility's production, whichever comes first. This would drastically alter the economics of rooftop solar. Ending net metering, which was dramatically improved under Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels just six years ago, will seriously harm the rooftop solar industry in Indiana. Also, if this bill passes, it will cause us to have to reconsider investing in solar since it will affect the long-term viability of our investment.\Solar is a fast-growing industry, growing 10 times faster than the private sector overall. SB 309, promoted by Indiana utility monopolies, is designed to kill the competition by virtue of state law.

Yet, even while operating under such restrictions, legislators have an opportunity to adopt several important proposals, including ethics reform.\Here is The Star Editorial Board's legislative agenda for 2010:\More ethical government: Even House Speaker Pat Bauer, a longtime opponent of restrictions on lobbyists' influence over legislators, now acknowledges that the Statehouse has been compromised.\""It was apparent the level of pressure exerted by special interests put a cloud over the legislature's ability to respond to the concerns of Hoosiers,"" Bauer wrote concerning last year's session in an op-ed published in The Star in November.\The General Assembly should adopt five common-sense reforms to reduce the level of influence that special interests hold over lawmakers:\Legislators may not accept any gift worth more than $50 in value from registered lobbyists.\Lobbyists must disclose the value of goods and services offered to individual legislators or groups of lawmakers, including meals, tickets to sporting and entertainment events, or other gifts.\Legislators may not accept gifts, including payment of travel-related expenses, from businesses, organizations or individuals that do business with the state.\Legislators may not accept meals, tickets to athletic games or other events, or any other gift valued at more than $50 from state universities or colleges.\Former legislators may not work as registered lobbyists until one year after they leave office.\Better representation for voters: Lawmakers have a prime opportunity to end the discredited practice of gerrymandering ahead of redistricting in 2011. The best means to ensure fairness and impartiality in drawing district maps is to assign the job to an independent commission. It may be possible, according to research by the Brennan Center for Justice, to create such a commission without having to pursue a constitutional amendment. Legislators should create a system for drawing district maps that fosters competitive elections, encourages qualified candidates to seek elected office and protects voters' ability to make a difference on Election Day.\More efficient local government: Indiana taxpayers continue to pay for far more government than they need. In a year when state and local budgets are squeezed tight, townships are still sitting on more than $200 million in reserves. If they were ready to put the public's best interests ahead of their political allies' concerns, lawmakers would finally eliminate township government this year. That's not likely to happen, however.\Instead, legislators at least need to trim around the edges by adopting three modest reforms:\Township advisory boards should be abolished. It's a step that would save taxpayers money without sacrificing oversight or transparency.\Poor relief, now dispensed inefficiently and unevenly by 1,008 township trustees, should be consolidated on the county level, a move that likely would improve service and reduce costs.\School board elections should be shifted from the May primary to the general election in November to assure better voter turnout and raise the profile of these important races.\A cleaner environment: In a state where air and water quality rank among the worst in the nation, environmental initiatives deserve far more attention than they have received from the General Assembly and the governor. One measure that could help promote use of wind and solar power involves so-called net metering, which allows consumers to send excess power that they generate back onto the electrical grid. Legislators should increase the current 10-kilowatt cap on net metering to 1,000 kilowatts.\Better schools: Modest steps are again the most likely avenues for progress, in this instance because of a lack of money. One proposal that deserves strong bipartisan support centers on closing loopholes that allow abusive teachers to escape accountability. Lawmakers should ensure that school districts have access to all the information they need about a prospective employee's background before they make a hire. The legislature also should eliminate off-the-record agreements that allow districts to remove substantiated reports of misconduct from employees' files without conducting a formal hearing.\Safer children: The General Assembly achieved a welcome advancement last year when it set up an office of ombudsman to make the Department of Child Services more accountable to the public. Now, legislators should give the ombudsman the necessary resources, including sufficient legal authority, to make a real difference."

Thousands of jobs could come to Indiana's manufacturing sector if the state pays more attention to green jobs, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful and former U.S. Rep. Jill Long Thompson said Wednesday.
\
Employees in so-called ""green"" jobs work to improve energy efficiency. The category includes everything from the laborers who erect wind turbines and install solar panels to the engineers who develop the technology in the first place.
\
Indiana, Long Thompson said, is rife with opportunity for the positions. She cited a study by the Blue Green Alliance -- a partnership between the United Steel Workers and the Sierra Club -- that says Indiana could see as many as 25,180 new jobs from wind turbine manufacturing alone.
\
The state Republican Party, meanwhile, pointed to steps Gov. Mitch Daniels has taken during his term that it says put him ""ahead of the curve"" on green jobs.
\
Long Thompson's plan centers around a program she calls ""Green Boost,"" which will offer $500 one-time tax credits for any new green job created at certain companies.
\
It also would direct about $17.5 million from the state's 21st Century Research & Technology Fund toward start-up companies developing new technology and conducting energy research.
\
State retirement funds, such as the Public Employees' Retirement Fund and the Teachers' Retirement Fund, would be encouraged to invest in Indiana companies developing alternative energy.
\
And Long Thompson would seek to create a Clean Energy Fund by redirecting $10 million per year from existing incentive programs. That money would instead be used to invest in clean technology.
\
The bottom line, Long Thompson said, is creating jobs for Indiana.
\
""For economic development to work, it's important to put together policies that stimulate growth in jobs of the future and jobs that are good for the state,"" she said.
\
The state GOP released talking points in advance of Long Thompson's Wednesday news conference, detailing Daniels' work in the area of clean energy and job creation.
\
The memo pointed to alternative energy facilities popping up around the state, including nearly 20 biofuels plants and a 750-megawatt wind farm in Benton County that began construction in 2007.
\
And the list of Daniels' work creating green jobs goes on, said Cam Savage, his campaign spokesman.
\
""None of these things were going on prior to his election,"" Savage said. ""The governor's going to continue to work on these issues with the goal of making sure every Hoosier has the standard of living they deserve and the clean environment we all want.""

Green jobs
\
What's a green job?
\
Any job that exists to improve energy efficiency or the environment. Green jobs can range from building wind turbines to researching new alternative fuels.
\
The proposal
\
Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Jill Long Thompson's plan includes the following steps:
\
* Start a ""Green Boost"" program, which offers a one-time $500 tax incentive to certain companies creating green jobs.
\
* Direct half of the $35 million in the state's 21st Century Research & Technology Fund to new businesses that are doing environmental research in Indiana.
\
* Create a Clean Energy Fund using $10 million per year from existing incentive programs.
\
* Get state retirement funds to invest in companies creating green jobs.
\
* Improve something called ""net metering,"" where those who generate more power and contribute it to the power grid would have utility bills reduced.
\
* Change government policy, including requiring new state facilities to meet energy efficiency standards, and requiring that new state vehicles be able to run on alternative fuels.

173,"As a 32-year-old woman, beginning her second trimester with her first baby, I urge our lawmakers to leave reproductive rights in the hands of women and their doctors and vote against House Bill 1211.\I am terrified but also already attached to this baby. Which means I want whatever is best for them, and if in the future that means making a difficult decision, I will. Conditions like spina bifida, trisomy and osteogenesis imperfecta are life-threatening, debilitating ailments that should not be forced on anyone – child or caregiver/parent.\The majority of the complex birth defects – which often can result in stillbirths, severe medical risk to the mother and child, or severe health complications as a child – are not able to be detected until an anatomy ultrasound, which is typically done between 18-20 weeks (well into second trimester).\I am sure any woman at 20-plus weeks would be heartbroken to have to terminate a pregnancy or lose a baby. I can also assure you we have more of a connection to this child than any politician and want what's best for the child, which, yes, could involve termination.\As men who will never understand this, leave reproductive rights to women and their doctors.\Jordan Knutson\Westfield\I support hate crime legislation for Indiana but only if it would also add white people to the list of those with protected status. After all, there are times when white people are killed by members of the LGBTQ community as well as members of the African-American community because of some perceived slight leading them to hate white people. But then I guess if everyone is included as protected groups, all we will have done is increase sentences for all crimes. If that is our intention, then why not just do that. Seems only logical to me.\William Fullerton\Brownsburg\As the city is poised to spend outrageous yet inadequate sums on street repair, I'm adding my voice to the chorus of those who are asking for more information. Does the city require paving materials and best practices consistent with our climate and heavy truck traffic? Are drainage issues resolved before repaving? Are substandard contractors eliminated from the bidding process? Are competent city engineers monitoring and inspecting jobs before the contractors are paid?\Some of the repaving work I've seen appears to show problems immediately or within one or two years. In short, are street funds being spent wisely? Are we getting what we pay for?\Toni Sekula\Speedway\More guns beget more violence. Yet many of our leaders continue to turn their backs on our children regarding this issue.\Placing guns in schools is absolutely the wrong move. Many guns retrieved by youth are often because guns are not secured or they have been provided access.\Passing a current House Bill 1253 and placing more guns in the schools, will open Pandora's box by increasing the likelihood of greater access. You can count on more shooting and accidents within our schools.\As we have witnessed time and time again, not all ""good guys"" are the ones who obtain guns. Additionally, as an educator in the field of mental health during Columbine, we learned that using external forces such as metal detectors, no tolerance policies and an increased presence of security officers only served to make schools feel like unsafe and hostile environments.\Our money would be better spent providing support toward increased mental health prevention and resources, rather than gun training. Our true national emergency should be about our children being brutally murdered by daily gun violence on our city streets and mass shootings in our schools.\Let's get this right; our kids are depending on it.\Wendy Marencik\Bloomington\Sarah Bowman and Emily Hopkins' Feb. 18 article, ""Dark days linger for state's solar industry,"" raises concerns about Sen. Jim Merritt's qualifications as a mayoral candidate for Indianapolis.\Near the conclusion of the article Merritt admits that he received $80,000 in campaign contributions from Indiana utilities and the Indiana Energy Association after he proposed an unsuccessful bill in 2009 that would have expanded net metering. The timeline shows that he worked against solar energy following the contributions, although he states '""I can't speak to campaign contributions,"" and ""But I know what I'm doing here and support net metering and support solar.""\He says he supports solar power, yet his action of not giving Senate Bill 430, which would restore incentives to install solar panels, a hearing, contradicts this statement. There appears to be a discrepancy between what Merritt says and what he does when it comes to ""the once-booming solar industry in Indiana.""\Elizabeth Masur\Indianapolis\Please support Indiana Senate Bill 369. I lived in Lafayette, Ind., for 36 years, was born there, met my wife and had three kids there. We still have a lot of family and friends in Indiana and now we need your help.\On April 26, 2017, my 16-year-old son, Davis Cripe, went to heaven because he drank an energy drink.\Davis was amazing and he was strongly against drugs and alcohol because he knew they were dangerous and illegal. We knew energy drinks were not healthy, but we had no idea that just one could be lethal. These drinks contain high levels of caffeine and other herbal stimulants that are very dangerous, and because of their dangers, the manufacturers themselves only recommend they be sold to adults – yet they are being sold to kids of any age. Why?\Dozens have lost their lives and many more go unreported. In 2011, 20,783 people visited an emergency room because of an energy drink. Every major medical organization is against these drinks for adolescents and other countries have begun to ban them.\Indiana Senate Bill 369 would ban the purchase of an energy drink for anyone under the age of 18. We live in South Carolina and are introducing a similar bill. State by state we must fight to protect our children and force the FDA to regulate these drinks.\I pray that you will step up and let your voice be heard in order to protect our children.\Please contact your lawmakers and let them know you support Bill 369.\Sean Cripe\Chapin, S.C.\As 2020 approaches, let us all remember how the Progressive Movement celebrated the loss of jobs in Long Island. Amazon was willing to bring $27 billion in collected taxes over the next 10 years to one of the most vulnerable areas in New York City.\Mayor Bill de Blasio said the money would have bettered schools, roads and public transit systems. The 25,000 employees coming with an average salary of $150,000 each would have produced a renaissance locally, where new restaurants and service-style industries would have popped up creating better job opportunities for those who currently live there locally. Property values would have skyrocketed, and those who previously saw little equity in what they own would have found a substantial increase in their own personal wealth.\But all of this is now a fantasy as Amazon, under attack from local politicians, walked away. After all, who would want to invest billions in a place where the elected officials are trying to run you out?\Rust-belt states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania have been hit hard by jobs leaving their state for decades. We in the Midwest have fought hard to adjust to the decline of manufacturing, and since 2016 it feels as though we have taken a turn for the better.\So as the 2020 election is on the horizon, let us in the Midwest remember how progressive liberals celebrated the loss of job and economic opportunity for their communities; because if they win the White House, we will all share in Long Island's fate.\Ryan Secord\Greenwood\Our country is at dire risk of extremism, and it's an extremism of lies and ignorance and rejection of facts. Our president, Donald Trump, believes himself above the law and in receipt of facts that simply do not exist.\He turns to right-wing pundit entertainers for counsel and maintains an unceasing assault upon upon our institutions and allies. He flatly denounces truth as fake news.\He is normalizing intolerance, racism and bigotry and now claims the right to control funding reserved by the Constitution to our Congress.\How long will we tolerate this? The wall he insists upon is separating us off from the world at a time when precisely the opposite is required.\America's enemy is not opposing political views, our media or our allies. Our enemy is our own apparent willingness to countenance the ignorant, malicious fool in the White House.\Paul Miner\Lizton, Ind."
174,"A double whammy by Republicans threatens to decimate solar power in Kentucky, just as it's gaining a tiny toehold in the state, the industry and solar advocates fear.\President Donald Trump's new 30 percent tax on cheaper, imported solar panels announced this past week is bad enough for the growing businesses that have been installing solar panels across the state, said Steve Ricketts, co-owner and general manager of Solar Energy Solutions, with offices in Louisville and Lexington.\Now a bill introduced this past week by Kentucky state Rep. Jim Gooch, R-Providence, could be the death knell for hundreds of jobs and some small businesses, said Ricketts, a past board member of the Kentucky Solar Energy Society. The bill threatens to slash by more than two-thirds the amount of money residential solar customers can get back from utilities for producing electricity the homeowners don't need, adding several more years to the time needed for solar investments to pay for themselves, he added.\""It's a real one-two punch,"" Ricketts said of the Trump tax and the Kentucky bill.\Gooch, a longtime coal advocate and utility ally, did not immediately return requests for comment. But state utilities back his bill, and Chris Whelan, a spokeswoman for LG&E and KU Energy, said Gooch's House Bill 227 is a matter of fairness.\She said the bill ""protects all Kentuckians who do not want, or cannot afford, private solar energy by removing the unfair subsidy for private solar customers.""\It would also make sure ""future solar customers more fairly share in the costs necessary to maintain the energy grid.""\The national, industry-backed Consumer Energy Alliance is also weighing in, saying the bill will ""help make sure your energy costs are affordable.""\Solar advocates say they expect the bill to go before the Natural Resources and Energy Committee, which next meets on Feb. 1.\People already participating in what's called ""net metering"" in Kentucky would see no change for 25 years, according to the bill, which would go into effect almost immediately — on July 15 of this year.\But Ricketts said the Kentucky bill's language is vague enough to raise questions even about the grandfather clause that protects existing solar customers.\He argues that utilities underestimate the value of residential solar and called for an independent study before lawmakers act. Solar power in Kentucky is just a ten-thousandth of Kentucky's electricity mix, he said.\""This,"" he said of Gooch's bill, ""is a sledgehammer to kill an ant.""\The Frankfort fight is part of a national battle.\Solar power has been on a roll as the cost of solar panels has dropped and as they have become more efficient. But there's also tension between solar advocates and utilities, with utilities fighting to make sure all their fixed administration and power line maintenance costs are shared among all their customers.\In Indiana, a new law last year phases out net metering over five years, and Ohio just reduced how much utilities must pay for electricity generated on people's homes and businesses.\It's part of a national attack on solar by utilities, said Sarah Lynn Cunningham, a Louisville engineer and president of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, which advocates for environmental issues in Frankfort.\""They are trying to extend their monopolies into competing technology,"" she said.\Environmental advocates and solar businesses defeated a similar bill in Kentucky last year. ""But this one is worse,"" she added.\Not only would it reduce credits to customers with solar panels from a rate of about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour to about 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, it would also end the practice of rolling over savings from season to season.\Some people who spent thousands of dollars on solar systems for their homes do so because they're concerned about the environment and prefer to support a clean, renewable energy instead of dirtier, fossil fuels. Many, however, look at the bottom line, and that calculation could now change significantly.\As solar has improved, those investments can now be paid off in about a decade, he said. Gooch's bill could extend that to as much as two decades, he added.\The Trump move could add at least 10 percent more to the cost, he said.\Cunningham said she'd been conflicted about Trump's tax on cheaper foreign-made solar panels because it could encourage domestic production of solar panels. She said she bought solar panels made in the United States for her home, even at somewhat higher cost. But, she said she's been convinced that the president's move will also damage the rise of clean, solar energy.\Trump had long promised to boost manufacturing by cracking down on Chinese imports, and the solar case gave him his first big chance to do so, USA TODAY reported. Supporters say the tariffs will create U.S. manufacturing jobs.\But the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said Monday that Trump's decision eliminate 23,000 solar industry jobs this year nationally.\James Bruggers: 502-582-4645; jbruggers@ courier-journal.com; Twitter: @jbruggers; Support strong local journalism by subscribing today: www.courier- journal.com/jamesb."

Ryan Dvorak had worked for U.S. Rep. Tim Roemer for five years, four of them spent in Washington, and his father had long served in the Indiana General Assembly.
\
Still, he says he had not thought about entering politics himself. But that changed with the convergence of several factors in 2001.
\
His father, Michael, was planning to leave the state House and run for St. Joseph County prosecutor, creating an open seat that some were asking him to pursue. Roemer was planning to retire, and Dvorak didn't much feel like taking a congressional staff position with some other congressman.
\
And then came the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
\
""It was a chaotic mess and it really changed the fabric of the city there,"" Dvorak recalled recently during an interview in his historic North Shore Drive home. ""There were the anthrax attacks around that time. Marines were rolling down the street in Humvees. It was a surreal environment. Guys in bubble suits walking down hallways and sealing off offices.
\
I just thought, you know, this is a good time to come home.""
\
Nearly a decade later, Dvorak, 37, is in his fifth term occupying the House seat his father left, and now has his eyes set on becoming South Bend's next mayor. He will face Barrett Berry, Pete Buttigieg and Mike Hamann in the May 3 primary election.
\
He feels his life has prepared him well for the office.
\
He was born near San Diego, while his father was in law school and his mother, Kathleen, was an undergrad. When he was 3, the family moved back to South Bend, his parents' home town. And the family grew.
\
Dvorak is the oldest of eight siblings - seven boys and a girl. They lived in the city until he reached seventh grade, then moved to Granger, where he graduated from Penn High School, lettering in soccer and tennis.
\
Dvorak said he was ""always a big reader"" and was ""into everything"" in high school. From Penn he went on to the University of Notre Dame, earning a bachelor of philosophy degree.
\
Right out of Notre Dame, he went to work for Roemer, starting off in the South Bend office for a year and then spending four years in Washington, ultimately rising to senior legislative aide. He worked on issues that included the work force, trade, the military, science and energy. He traveled around the country and took rides on high-tech military machines, to obtain a real-world understanding when it came time to work on military appropriation bills. He also went on overseas trips when NATO was considering bringing on new members, he said.
\
Moving from Congress to the Indiana General Assembly, he was in for a bit of a culture shock. At the Statehouse, there are far fewer resources at lawmakers' disposal, and legislators are only part-time. He quickly realized that lobbyists and special interests occupied that vacuum, and in effect are ""the institution."" Many General Assembly members rely on them for the research needed to draft legislation, Dvorak said.
\
He said he was among a small group of members who successfully pushed for lobbyist reforms, requiring more disclosure of gifts to lawmakers.
\
He also has been proud, among other things, of his efforts to make businesses eligible for net metering, which redistributes energy created by solar and wind energy back into the power grid; bills to clean up brownfield sites; and the law that more closely monitors retail sales of methamphetamine precursors.
\
He earned a law degree while serving in the General Assembly by attending night classes at Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis. He now practices with the law firm of May Oberfell Lorber, where he specializes in business law.
\
Dvorak said he decided to run for mayor upon learning that Mayor Stephen Luecke would not seek re-election.
\
""This is a critical time in our city,"" he said. ""I think I have the breadth and depth of experience to do the job correctly. I know about policy at the federal level, at the state level, and at the local level with the private sector. I've got a strong understanding of how the community works.""
\
He said his experience in Washington and Indianapolis would aid him in running the city administration.

176,"When the 2021 legislative session began, more than 75 bills related to the environment had been filed in Indiana's General Assembly.\But as the session passes its halfway point, more than two-thirds of those bills are now dead. Thirteen alone died in the House Environmental Affairs Committee, which did not hear any of the bills assigned to it.\Many of those lost were issues that have been pushed by environmentalists for years. Some others could have had negative impacts on the environment.\Here's what you need to know about some of the more notable bills that have landed in this year's legislative graveyard.\Water\Environmentalists and experts estimate as many as 200,000 septic systems in the state are failing, polluting water sources and potentially risking human health.\Two bills – House Bill 1038 and Senate Bill 419 – that would have tackled this issue in Indiana died in the House and Senate Environmental Affairs committees. Both would have required inspections of septic systems before selling a property, a simple step that environmental advocates say would help locate and mitigate those that are failing.\Versions of these bills have been proposed in previous years as well, to no success.\CAFOs and right to farm\Balancing rights between property owners and factory farms in Indiana is an issue that has made it all the way to the state Supreme Court. Still, interested groups on both sides are trying to find the middle ground – which was the subject of five bills in this year's session.\Two would have bolstered regulations of concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs: SB 29 would have required annual inspections and HB 1472 provided protections to neighbors of the farms.\On the other side of the debate were HB 1380 and SB 411, which advocates worried would strengthen the protections of factory farms. Senate Joint Resolution 14 could have actually enshrined the rights of farming operations in Indiana's Constitution.\In the end, none of them got out of committee.\Hemp\HB 1233 would have established standards for testing hemp for THC, the chemical in cannabis that gets users high. Hemp and marijuana are the same plant, cannabis. If the plant has 0.3% THC or less, it's hemp. Any higher, it's marijuana.\Sometimes hemp plants come in ""hot,"" meaning they have a higher level of THC than is allowed. This bill would have provided that a grower who grew a plant with THC as high as 1% would not be found guilty of negligently violating THC requirements.\The bill died in the House Agriculture and Rural Development committee without being heard.\Coal ash\Indiana has more pits holding the toxic byproduct from burning coal than any other state in the country. The ash has contaminated groundwater across the state and utilities are now looking to close these ponds down.\SB 367 and HB 1469 would have required the state to clean up the ash in what environmentalists say is a more protective way ––digging up the ash and moving it to a lined landfill out of the floodplain. Neither got a hearing in the environmental committees of their respective chambers.\Pollutants\Five bills tackling pollutants from lead to toxic ""forever chemicals"" failed to advance.\Two bills addressing lead exposure in school, preschool and child care facility buildings (HB 1045 and HB 1087), and one addressing toxic PFAS chemicals in public water systems (HB 1129), died in the House Environmental Affairs Committee\HB 1568 would have tested PFAS exposure in former and current military members, who are more likely to be exposed due to the contaminant's use on military sites. And HB 1341 would have tested for radon, a radioactive gas linked to cancer, in school buildings. They failed to get hearings in other committees.\Renewable and other energy\Ever since the General Assembly passed a law phasing out a key financial incentive called net metering for homeowners installing rooftop solar, bills have been filed that would reinstate it. Three bills this year – SB 249, HB 1394 and SB 420 – again attempted to extend the deadline for this incentive, but all three failed.\Electric vehicles\Electric vehicles and the stations to charge them are a bit of a chicken and egg issue. Customers don't want to buy electric vehicles without the infrastructure to charge them, but companies don't want to invest in that infrastructure without knowing there will be more drivers of electric vehicles.\HB 1385 would have allowed utilities to create a pilot to establish an infrastructure program for these vehicles. It got a hearing in the House Utilities committee, but failed to get a vote after getting bogged down in questions about whether utilities should have a monopoly or face competition.\Transportation\SB 9 would have created an Indiana passenger rail commission for developing rail projects in Indiana and nearby states. Passenger rails and other public transportation could play a key role in reducing carbon emissions from vehicles. It didn't get a hearing.\Climate change\SB 121 would have required Indiana University to study ""green"" industries and their impact on Indiana. It died in committee. So did HB 1344, a bill that would have established a grant program under Indiana Department of Environmental Management to fund local governments' greenhouse gas inventories.\Building and development\LEED certification is the world's most widely used rating system for ""green"" buildings – and HB 1342 would have required the state Office of Management and Budget to consider upgrading state buildings to these standards. Indiana has historically ranked low in this area. It didn't get a hearing.\Recreation and wildlife\Indiana's forests have been a topic of much debate over the past several years, as some log cuts in state forests have left the public frustrated and concerned about wildlife habitat. State officials, environmentalists and industry can't seem to decide how the state's land and its wildlife should be managed.\Two bills proposed this year would have tried to address those topics. HB 1222 would have set aside areas within state property geared toward protecting old growth areas, and HB 1292 focused on preserving habitat for wildlife.\Neither of those bills, however, got a hearing in the House Natural Resources Committee.\Call IndyStar reporter Sarah Bowman at 317-444-6129 or email at sarah. bowman@indystar.com.

177,"More than a third of the food we eat is reliant on pollinators such as butterflies and bees. But pollinator habitat is disappearing – and backyards could play a role in bringing them back.\There are an estimated 40 million acres of lawn and turf grass in the lower 48 U.S. states, about 2% of the country's land area. In some states that percentage is higher, like in Indiana, where about 5% of land area is turf grass. Grass offers almost no ecological value, said Ethan Olson, director of native landscapes at Keep Indianapolis Beautiful.\And not only are backyards full of grass, they are also often home to invasive plants such as honeysuckle or Bradford pear trees, which take over natural landscapes and choke out native plants that act as habitat for pollinators. Research indicates about 80% of invasive woody species in Indiana come from the landscape trade.\The impact of your backyard invasive plants, Olson said, can throw off balance for not only native plants, but also the bugs that eat them, the animals that eat those and then the humans that rely on those animals.\""When we begin losing our native plants,"" he said, ""we begin to lose everything else.""\But yards don't have to have a negative impact on the environment. Hoosiers who put in pollinator-friendly species and native plants could help save butterflies and bees essential to our ecosystem.\This edition of the Scrub Hub will answer questions from readers Cindy and Wendi from Indianapolis, who asked us how to plant environmentally friendly alternatives to lawns of grass. If you're about to pick up some spring landscaping, here's what experts say you should – and shouldn't – put in your yard.\The short answer\The first thing to do is make sure you're not planting invasive plants.\Laura Essex, landscape designer and owner of Favor Native, said it's as simple as Googling the plants you're considering before you buy them to make sure they're not invasive. Just because it's for sale in the garden section doesn't mean it will be good for the environment, she said.\""People, when they start to garden, they go to their local nursery and they pick up what looks good, you know, because it's easy,"" Essex said. ""But at the same time as we're introducing natives and beneficials, we also need to stop and shut off that spigot of bad plants in our yard.""\Invasive plants don't just disrupt ecosystems, they're also costly to get under control. In 2019, Carmel Clay Parks and Recreation spent more than $140,000 on invasive alone.\Although the state passed a rule last April banning the sale or transfer of 44 different species of invasive plants, many others are still on the market in Indiana.\Claire Lane, an urban conservationist with Hamilton County's Soil and Water Conservation District, advised staying away from Bradford pear or Callery pear trees, bamboo, Chinese silvergrass, Burning bush and Mimosa trees.\The best thing to do, Lane said, is to plant native plants when you can.\""The best choice is to just choose natives,"" Lane said. ""We know more about them and how they function in our ecosystem.""\For specific native plant recommendations from experts, keep reading.\The long answer\When Laura Essex moved into her home 11 years ago, it had a typical suburban lawn full of grass, dotted with a few shrubs.\""And that was it,"" she said. ""When I looked out my window in the spring, in the summer, in the early fall, there was nothing moving out there. No bees and butterflies.""\After researching the decline in monarch butterfly populations, which have fallen by 80% in the eastern U.S. since the mid-'90s, she realized she could do something about it.\Now, her business Favor Native strives to produce environmentally friendly landscaping, favoring native plants where possible. She acknowledges that some people will assert you need to be strict about using only native plants, but she sometimes includes non-native plants because they still may have beneficial qualities such as nectar for pollinators.\If it's between planting a non-native plant that's not invasive and just leaving grass, she said, don't pick the grass.\""Human beings have had a pretty big negative effect on the species that are on the planet,"" she said. ""Habitat loss is a huge problem. ... I think we have to all start noticing that and start seeing that we have to think kind of bigger picture.\About 90% of insect herbivores have to get their food from a very narrow spectrum of plant resources, Olson said. This means it's not easy for them to find food when their species they typically rely on disappear.\""The main takeaway with planting native plants within your yard is you are literally providing the lifeblood for entire ecosystems,"" Olson said.\If you're feeling overwhelmed, it's understandable, Essex said. An easy way to start might be picking a native plants vendor and taking a walk through to see which plants you like.\The Indiana Native Plant Society keeps a directory of vendors online at indiananativeplants.org. Keep Indianapolis Beautiful also runs a native plant nursery, which takes orders online.\You can also reach out to your local Cooperative Invasive Species Managment Area, or CISMA, Lane points out. These groups are scattered across the state and help to manage invasive species in their area.\""My biggest advice would just be don't be intimidated by the scope of the issue,"" Lane said.

""It's always covered in bees and butterflies,"" she said.\Spiderwort: Essex prefers the Ohio variety of spiderwort because it does not recede itself quite as much.\Coneflowers: ""They're just covered in pollinators,"" said Essex, who said she prefers the purple variety.\Blazing star: Blazing star flowers are some of the more showy plants recommended by Essex, reaching as tall as three or four feet with its bright, almost fluffy-looking bunches of flowers.\Joe Pye weed: These delicate-looking plants bloom in the summer.\Cardinal flowers and Great Blue Lobelia: These shockingly red and blue flowers are a favorite of hummingbirds, Essex said.\Serviceberry tree: Serviceberry trees produce beautiful white flowers in the spring and the berries are delicious too, Olson says\Dogwood tree: Like Serviceberry trees, Dogwoods produce showy flowers and could be an alternative to the invasive Bradford pear, Olson said.\Yellowwood tree: Every few years, Olson said, Yellowwood trees are laden with big, drooping white flowers and make great ornamental trees.\Oak tree: Olson said people often focus on ornamental trees, but sturdy trees like oaks can support hundreds of of species of moths and butterflies.\Prairie dropseed: Instead of planting invasive Chinese silver grass, Prairie dropseed grass will look almost identical, Lane said.\Winterberry: This plant, with its bright pops of color, is a good alternative to invasive Heavenly bamboo or Japanese barberry, Lane said.\Wild ginger: If you're looking for a replacement for English ivy and winter creeper, Lane said you might consider wild ginger for more eco-friendly results.\Welcome to the Scrub Hub!\If you're dying to understand how recycling facilities sort their materials or why exactly people keep talking about net metering, ask us!\IndyStar environmental reporters Sarah Bowman and London Gibson are now launching a question-and-answer series called The Scrub Hub.

A dozen energy-related businesses in Indiana recently formed the Renewable Energy Association to lobby for more government action in the environmental field.
\
""Some organizations in Indiana started contacting each other to form a group so we could push Indiana government and legislators toward more investment for renewable energy,"" says Nathan Vogel, director of research at Inovateus Development in South Bend, which also belongs to national organizations and other state organizations.
\
Other Michiana businesses in the association are Home & Mobile Energy of Middlebury and Michiana Solar Products Co. of Goshen.
\
Members of the group have testified in behalf of legislation proposed by state Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, who says his efforts have been stymied by the power of utility companies in the legislature.
\
Dvorak and others say the state is unprepared for federal mandates that they expect eventually will govern greenhouse gas emissions.
\
""I've always had an interest in energy issues,"" said Dvorak, who focused on the subject when he was working with U.S. Rep. Tim Roemer. ""It's a particular type of problem for Indiana. Most of the power that's generated is from coal-fired plants.""
\
That energy is cheap -- although its costs are beginning to rise because of federally required pollution controls -- and the historic low cost of the high-polluting energy makes alternatives harder to support.
\
Indiana ranked 49th -- above only West Virginia -- in a Forbes ranking of states by environmental quality last year.
\
Vogel said the association wants to sponsor a renewable-energy fair or expo. The group will also push for legislation on tax credits for homeowners and businesses that install environmentally friendly devices.
\
""That's usually what happens in most states,"" he said, adding that Louisiana gives a 50 percent credit on installation of certain energy-saving features, not counting a federal tax credit that is capped at $2,000.
\
The push for utility regulation includes both ""net metering"" -- allowing homeowners or businesses to sell the excess energy they generate to utilities -- and requiring utilities to use cleaner alternatives for some of their energy production.
\
Dvorak is advocating for those and other goals in the legislature.
\
""He's one of the few that is pushing renewable energy,"" Vogel said. ""Most people in Indiana can't see beyond coal and corn. Indiana's all coal, and that's the dirtiest fuel we have out there.""
\
Dvorak said the fight is difficult because of the state's situation. Relative low cost for coal makes alternatives less attractive in Indiana than in states where energy costs are higher and alternatives such as abundant sunlight are available.
\
""I've been trying to work on some renewable-energy issues,"" he said. ""It's been an uphill climb. It's a fight to go up against the utility companies. In Indiana, the utility companies have a lot of sway in the legislature. It's very frustrating.""
\
Among the proposals he is pushing would be mandates for electrical companies.
\
Legislation would require that the companies' portfolios include 6 percent clean energy - and ""clean coal"" could account for half of that number.
\
""We worked on that last year, and maybe the year before,"" Dvorak said, but the legislation has not passed.
\
""Twenty-six other states have a mandatory Renewable Electricity Standard, or RES,"" said Laura Ann Arnold, an organizer of the association.
\
""Whether or not Indiana adopts an RES will impact future investment in wind power, solar, hydro or biomass generators to generate electricity in our state,"" Arnold said.
\
""I believe that the green economy, including renewable energy, will create more than a million new jobs and help our environment at the same time,"" added Terrence Black, an association member. ""Establishing a Renewable Energy Standard is an important first step. There is no downside to this.""

181,"I don't know about you, but I don't like being last in anything. I don't like being next to last or even in the bottom tier of anything.\But in many ways being last or in the bottom tier seems to suit Hoosiers just fine, particularly when it comes to areas such as the environment and public transportation. Consider:\Last week we reported that Indiana was given an ""F"" grade by the Network for New Energy Choices -- for something called ""net metering,"" which allows homeowners and businesses producing their own electricity to get a credit on their utility bills for the energy they produce. Ours is the only state not requiring utilities to offer that option to business.\Also last week, we reported that Indianapolis is 41st out of 50 of the largest cities in solid waste recycling.\Earlier this month, we reported that Indianapolis' IndyGo is one of the worst big-city bus systems in the country. The size of our bus fleet, compared with other large cities, tied for last with Eugene, Ore., a city a fraction our size.\We are in the bottom 10 of states in the percentage of adults with college degrees.\The education attainment of our public school students is mediocre at best, somewhere in the ""C"" grade range among states.\We make tradeoffs, you may argue. Indiana may not invest in such things as environmental improvements and transit, but we're also a low-tax state, which means good news for businesses that provide high-paying jobs.\But then how do you explain that personal incomes in Indiana are lower than those of most other states that score higher in the areas I mention above?\In this category we not only are lagging; we are losing ground.\Latest U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis information, also recently reported in The Star, says Indiana's rank in per capita income fell to 40th in 2009, compared to 37th in 2007.\We print these kinds of figures not because we delight in the negative but because in an era when we compete not just on a national but a world stage, we need to be aware of the art of the possible.\What does this kind of information tell us about ourselves? How should we as Hoosiers respond? Is it acceptable to be mediocre, at best, in so many categories?\You tell me.\The primary election is a little more than one week away and we have a deal for you. In addition to print reports on key issues, races and candidates, we also offer a full rundown on every race on our website, IndyStar.com.\Go to ""Election 2010: Build Your Own Ballot"" on the home page, enter your address, and you'll find complete information on every race in your jurisdiction -- from U.S. Senate to county offices to township constable and small claims judge.\Review the qualifications of those seeking office, then record your choice. Print the ballot and on May 4 take it with you to the polling place.\It's all private -- your address is used only to get you the right information -- and your choices are not recorded by anybody but you.\Read as much as you can about the candidates and discuss what you know with family, friends and neighbors.

183,"Indiana's energy future hangs in the balance: How much coal the state will burn and how many wind turbines and solar panels will be built remains to be seen.\The Indiana 21st Century Energy Task Force has been working to answer those questions over the last 18 months. It has held nine meetings and now has just one left until the group's final report and recommendations to the state's legislature are due by Dec. 1.\The task force – which is made up of legislators and governor-appointed experts in the field – has received testimony and heard presentations from dozens of analysts and experts, state agencies, company representatives, industrial groups and advocacy organizations as part of the process.\All of them have shared their view of where Indiana's energy landscape currently is, and where they think it could and should go.\Here's a sample of what some of the contributors and task force members have said they want for the state going forward.\The NAACP: Denise Abdul-Rahman spoke on behalf of the Indiana chapter of the NAACP. She emphasized the importance of transitioning to new energy sources, and building an energy system that provides equitable access and delivery of electricity. She included some specific recommendations such as establishing mandatory targets for energy efficiency and renewable energy.\She also said she'd like to see creation of what she called ""Green Zones,"" where highly polluted and economically depressed neighborhoods are transformed into vibrant areas with green business practices, a healthier environment and strong economy. She said clean energy sources and jobs can be a key component.\Phil Powell, task force member: Powell is a professor of business economics and public policy at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business. After all he's learned during the task force, he said there are three main points that are a priority for him. The first is that he would like to give the state's utility regulatory agency a clearer mandate on what they are looking for when it comes to reliability, accompanied with various tools to meet it.\He also wants to see the state help utilities finance the costs of retiring coal plants early and maintaining affordability as the state transitions to renewables. Several states across the country have implemented similar securitization legislation. Powell also wants to provide assistance to workers and communities impacted by closing coal plants, as well as communities that have faced pollution from these facilities.\Indiana Coal Council: During the most recent task force meeting, the Coal Council proposed legislation that would create a ""glide path"" to control the transition away from coal over a defined period. More specifically, the legislation would establish minimum energy standards – which the Coal Council called ""resilience requirements"" – that utilities would have to meet over the next 15 years.\It would require utilities to get a set amount of their energy from coal at the beginning and only a certain amount from renewable and other energy resources, including natural gas. Then, as the years go on, the coal requirements would steadily decrease while renewables would be allowed to steadily increase.\Citizens Action Coalition: Kerwin Olson, the executive director of consumer advocacy group, said he would like to see the state reexamine its energy efficiency policy and recognize the value of distributed generation – the generation of power near to where it will be used, rather than at large, centralized facilities. Putting solar panels on roofs is one source of distributed generation. To Olson, that includes reinstating net metering, or adopting some other incentive to encourage solar installation.\He also wanted to place a focus on affordability for residential customers. Olson said he feels discussions of cost are often centered on industrial and commercial customers, forgetting the everyday ratepayer. He wants mechanisms for the regulatory commission to consider customers' bills when looking at utilities' requests for more money.\Jim Merritt, former task force member: Merritt, a former state senator representing Indianapolis, retired from the General Assembly this year. Prior to retirement, the Republican senator served on the task force and as the chair of the Senate Utilities Committee. Though he no longer has a say in the final report, he said he would really like to see the state invest in the development of battery storage to help increase the use and reliability of renewables.\He said he also wants to see the state create a framework for local ordinances on renewable energy. Right now, regulations and requirements differ from county to county, and Merritt said it would be helpful to have consistency across the state to encourage wind and solar companies to invest in Indiana.\Indiana Industrial Energy Customers: Indiana is a major manufacturing state, and many of those companies are members of the Indiana Industrial Energy Customers group, or INDIEC. The organization said it wants to see any policy out of the task force reflect the state's current commitment to supplying reliable energy, which manufacturers need for their process. INDIEC also wants to see more opportunities for self-generation and sustainable resources, a growing concern among investors.\In order to find that balance, the industrial group wants to recognize the value of state agencies such as the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the Utility Forecasting Group.

185,"The average American throws out roughly four pounds of trash every day: Food they don't eat, packaging for items they buy, things they no longer use. With more than 330 million people in the United States, that's enough waste to fill more than 60,000 garbage trucks on a daily basis.\Some of it is recycled, and some of it is donated. Most of it, however, piles up in landfills that are scattered across the country.\There are at least 2,000 active landfills across the United States with thousands more that are no longer in use.\In Indiana, there are more than 30 tons of trash per person in our landfills. That's more than most states, according to recent data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\But what happens to all that trash that sits there?\That's what we'll be looking at for this installment of the Scrub Hub: What happens when all the waste decomposes? And how big of a contributor are landfills to climate change?\Short answer: Landfills\contribute to climate change\Landfills produce gas. For those of you thinking about the smell that wafts out of your garbage can every time you open the lid, that probably comes as no surprise.\But what you might not know is that gas – predominantly methane – is a major contributor to climate change. In fact, landfills are one of the top emitters of methane gas, along with natural gas systems and leakage, as well as livestock digestion and manure management.\According to a 2018 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 18% of U.S. methane emissions come from landfills.\Greenhouse, or climate change-inducing, gases are most commonly associated with carbon dioxide. While methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, it's more powerful, according to Indiana University professor John Rupp. It's actually more than 25 times as effective at trapping in heat, making it a major greenhouse gas.\Methane is produced from a type of bacteria called methanogens, which feed on organic materials that are made up of carbon. Think food waste, cardboard and paper products, even things like plastic bottles, Rupp said – all things there are plenty of in landfills.\These microbes don't produce methane at first, according to Gabe Filippelli, a professor of earth sciences at IUPUI.\""But as the landfill ages, the bacteria that produces methane starts to chew away at the trash and give off lots of methane,"" Filippelli said. ""They can eat almost anything, and they thrive in an environment like a landfill where it's sealed up and there's very little oxygen to it.""\Long answer: Capturing landfill gas as alternative like natural gas\How the country has managed methane from its landfills, and why, has changed over time, Rupp said.\Several decades ago, society looked to manage it from a safety standpoint, he said.\That's because methane is a flammable gas with the potential to catch and explode. In an effort to prevent that, landfill operators would try to capture methane gas and flare it off, or burn it in a controlled way.\This would also help with the smell, according to Curt Publow with South Side Landfill in Indianapolis.\But over time, there has been more of an understanding of how landfills and methane contribute to climate change, Rupp said. With that, there is also a question of what to do about it and how to reduce those emissions.\""It's a tough challenge,"" Rupp said, ""but it's an addressable problem.""\There are two main ways, according to Rupp, one that's more proactive and one that's more reactive. On the front end, states can look at better managing what comes into the landfills and diverting food waste and other materials that are prime grub for methanogens. Instead, those should be sent to compost or for recycling.\Several states such as Maryland, Vermont and California have started to pass laws about diverting certain waste streams from landfills.\There's also something that landfills can do on the back end: They can capture the gas and reuse it just like natural gas, which is becoming an increasingly used technique, Publow said. That's what South Side Landfill does.\Beginning in the 1980s, South Side installed a gas collection system to capture and help burn off the gas. It's a system of wells that are drilled into the waste and a pipe is inserted into that with a filter around the pipe, Publow said.\It's a perforated pipe that allows the gas to flow in – similar to a drainage tile system under a field, Filippelli added, but vertical.\A few years after that, the landfill began using the captured methane to provide heat and energy to the greenhouse operation across the street, Publow said.\The system continued to develop, then providing the landfill gas to Rolls Royce in the late 1990s, which they used to replace coal in their on-site boilers. South Side provided that fuel for nearly 20 years, Publow said.\Then, in 2019, the methane collection took another step by building a processing facility on-site to turn the landfill gas into something called renewable natural gas, Publow said. All the wells throughout the landfill are networked back to a compressor station where there's a pump that pulls the gas out of the landfill and pushes it downstream for processing.\At the plant, there are different kinds of membranes and filters to separate the methane from the other compounds in the gas. That concentrates the gas so it is around 95% pure methane, Publow said: ""As far as being able to use it, it's a direct replacement for natural gas.""\The gas from the plant ultimately is used as motor fuel for the transportation sector, which can also help reduce emissions from trucks that would normally be powered by diesel fuel.\The plant produces the equivalent of about 8 million gallons of diesel fuel a year. And in 2020, South Side Landfill prevented 19,000 tons of methane from being released into the atmosphere, Publow said.\""I think that this type of an operation where we can take something that historically was thought of as potentially a nuisance and turn it into an actual drop-in energy source,"" Publow said, ""I think that that's a really good way to use a resource that we have.""\This, of course, is just an overview to get you thinking.

189,"new taste\Since opening in January, RP's Pizza on Wheeling Avenue has at times seen more business than it knows what to do with.\The restaurant, featuring four large booths for seating, as well as an outdoor patio for use during nice weather, is located on a busy corner several blocks north of downtown Muncie. And while it took more than a year to open, it's finally doing great things.\I took several trips to RP's Pizza over the past several weeks to learn about the food and the people who make it.\Food\Overall, the food is exactly what you'd expect from a mom-and-pop-style pizza place, and perhaps better. Though it's not a reasonable expectation to get your food within 10 minutes of ordering at RP's, what you get when you do receive your order is something special.\Pizza: Unlike what's found at many of the standard pizza places found around town, RP's pizzas are superb, from start to finish. The hardy crust offers a taste-rich surface for the combination of fresh toppings -- including locally sourced meats -- cheeses and a very earthy pizza sauce. The pizza makers are well trained in how to properly handle the pies, too, ensuring the perfect bake with each pizza. As far as prices go, the pizzas aren't the cheap $5 large cheese pizzas you'll get at a national chain. They cost a bit more than that; the one-topping (after cheese) 10-inch pizza costs about $9, while the four-topping 16-inch pie costs $21. It's worth the price, however.\Wings: The most popular side, the wings are different from what you'll get from anyplace else, too. Hand-breaded and deep-fried -- not baked -- the wings come with any of six sauces, many of them made in-house.\""They're not the healthiest thing on our menu, but they sure are good,"" Luke Parsons, general manager at the store, said. ""We really take pride in the fact we came up with a lot of these sauces ourselves and people really seem to like them.""\Other items: The menu boasts at least two dozen other specialty items aside from wings and pizza, and they all seem to have a draw for customers. There are burgers, salads, sandwiches and even wraps, all of which are made-to-order. Their prices range from $6 to $10.\The beverages served by RP's, which includes Pepsi products and half-a-dozen domestic beers and boxed wines, are all fairly inexpensive as well; the beer is either $3 or $3.50 per can. The wine is $4 per glass for dine-in.\Service/Atmosphere\Though at times busy, the customer service aspect of RP's Pizza is outstanding. They pay attention, as one would expect, to what the customer is asking for and they ensure the final product is what was expected. And where some restaurants have passive, disconnected servers, RP's has an engaging staff that not only maintains friendly conversation with visitors who strike it up, but also willfully engage the customers in casual discussions.\There is often music playing over the speakers and ESPN on the televisions, opposite each other in the dining area. The overall atmosphere is something unique, if slightly cramped. It's likely the vibe will be even more greatly enhanced come the summer. Parsons told The Star Press the patio will be used during the summer months for music performances and other activities.\""We're really excited about being able to give that sort of environment for customers, I think it's going to draw in big crowds.""\Despite the potential popularity of the restaurant, which is already garnering a lot of attention from locals, there is only so much space available. It's rarely easy to find a parking place in the lot -- let alone knowing if where you're parking is even a true parking space. Parsons said the lot will be repaved, mercifully, this summer.\RP's Pizza has the potential to be one of the area's biggest restaurant success stories in several years, bringing it in line with the likes of Mancino's and Pizza King, each local favorites in their own right. But RP's is also far different from either of those restaurants. It operates independently of anything other than what its customers want. The owner, Ron Parsons, doesn't have a keen feeling for gimmicks, but he does have a sense of what might make customers happy, and he gives that to them.\RP's, like other mom-and-pop style restaurants, has that X-factor that you don't get with other places. It has a great atmosphere, great people and superior food. Nevermind the parking lot issues; it's definitely worth a trip to check the place out.\To order from RP's Pizza, call 765-218-1846.

190,"MUNCIE -- Longtime plans to construct a wind farm in Randolph County have been put off, at least for now, because Indiana officials are so far unwilling to commit to more renewable energy across the state.\""I think this is starting to get in the way of bringing projects to fruition, not just in Randolph County but across the state,"" said Kevin Law, director of the Randolph Economic Development Corp. in Winchester. ""The Randolph County project has not been canceled, but it is being back-burnered for a project in Ohio, which recently adopted a (Renewable Portfolio Standard). We are losing our competitive edge.""\About 30 states have enacted a RPS, which requires utilities to increase the amount of wind or other renewable energy in their electricity portfolio until they reach a specified target by a specified date. Ohio's RPS, for example, calls for 25 percent renewable electricity by 2025.\Indiana has 30,000 MW of total installed electricity generation capacity, of which wind comprises 1,036 MW. That's less wind power than has been installed in Illinois (1,548 MW), and Minnesota (1,796 MW), both of which have a RPS. But Indiana's wind capacity is more than in some Midwestern states that have a RPS, including Ohio (8 MW) and Michigan (143 MW).\The wind energy that has been constructed so far in Indiana has all been in West Central Indiana, Law noted, which he compared to low-hanging fruit because that area has greater wind resources than other areas of Indiana.\Randolph County has worked diligently to attract wind energy investment. Developers have leased tens of thousands of acres from local landowners for prospective wind farms. The Area Plan Commission has crafted a pro-wind zoning ordinance that encourages wind development. The Randolph County commissioners have contracted with the legal team that facilitated the developments of wind farms in White and Benton counties.\Now, just six months before the construction of a 100 megawatt (MW) phase of a wind farm was scheduled to begin, a developer has issued a 12-month project delay, Law said.\Indiana has a robust transmission network, adequate wind resources, and open agricultural areas suitable for development, Law said.\""Unfortunately, wind development is driven as much by policy as it is by the physical environment,"" Law said. ""The lack of a policy is something that could very well interfere with, if not cancel, wind projects in this part of the state. Is it worth the risk to not have a policy? Does Indiana want to take the gamble and see what happens, or be aggressive, competitive and pro-business?""\Most wind farms are built by developers who then sell the electricity to utilities, Law said. ""The RPS guarantees developers the ability to sell their power back to the grid,"" he said. ""If a developer can build 50 miles from Randolph County in a state where utilities are required to purchase the electricity, it takes away our competitive edge.""\In January, Jane Jankowski, the press secretary for Gov. Mitch Daniels, told The Star Press: ""Gov. Daniels supports establishing a state renewable energy standard that would take into consideration the full array of renewable and alternative energy sources, including clean coal.""\Clean air advocates responded by saying coal is not renewable. Renewable energy is wind, solar, geothermal and biomass.\The American Wind Energy Association said many of the wind energy projects being built in Indiana are being built to satisfy other states' renewable energy standards, so it is state RPSs that are in fact driving the market.\Contact reporter Seth Slabaugh at 213-5834.\Coal-dependent states\States highly dependent on coal for electric power in 2005\StatePercent dependency\West Virginia98%\Wyoming97%\Indiana96%\North Dakota95%\Utah93%\Kentucky87%\RPS states\Examples of states with Renewable Portfolio Standards requiring electric utilities to use wind and other renewable resources to serve an increasing percentage of total demand:\StateTarget\Ohio25% by 2025\Illinois25% by 2025\Michigan10% by 2015\Pennsylvania18% by 2020\IndianaNo RPS\Source: Windiana 2010 conference"
191,"""I just think he was always fascinated by technology as a little kid. And I think there was something about learning something new that we didn't know anything about.""\Cynthia Baker,\on her son Zack\""I'm pretty passionate about unlocking the potential high school (students) have to do awesome stuff.""\Zack Baker\At age 18, Zack Baker has already sold an app to schools -- including his alma mater, Noblesville High School -- that over 13,000 students are now using.[para] Even before that, he was paid to make a phone app for the law firm Church, Church, Hittle and Antrim. He was a freshman in high school at the time.[para]But that's not where his passion for programming started. He also created a computer game.[para]In seventh grade.[para]This year's Rookie of the Year during TechPoint's Mira Awards, which honor the Indiana tech industry, is a self-taught code writer with an entrepreneurial flair who sees his lack of knowledge on just about any subject as an irresistible challenge.\What got him started coding was a book he found in the Hamilton East Public Library when he was in fifth or sixth grade. The idea of the book, called ""Modding Doom,"" was to teach people how to create modifications on ""Doom,"" a first-person shooter game released in the '90s.\""I'm paging through this book and I'm realizing I don't know a single word on any of these pages,"" Baker said. ""Which is kind of scary to me, because there is this whole thing out here that I don't know.""\So he did what most wouldn't expect from a kid his age. He found ""Coding for Dummies"" and started learning. A couple of years later, he created his first computer game, ""Block Attack,"" whose object was to collect as many blocks as possible before the opponent caught you.\After that, Baker never looked back.\""I just think he was always fascinated by technology as a little kid,"" said Cynthia Baker, his mother. ""And I think there was something about learning something new that we didn't know anything about. I would often take the kids to the library, and I always encouraged all my kids that there is a big wide world out there with lots of ideas.""\Zack Baker was initially self-taught, but the summer before his freshman year he went to a coding camp. His training led to the creation of ""RPS Free,"" a fairly generic version of Rock, Paper, Scissors for phones. Still, it was an app with his name on it in the app store.\That app led to the one he created for the law firm. He heard at his high school that the firm was looking for someone to code an app, and he applied.\For Baker, high school was an ideal time to develop coding skills.\""I have free time as a high schooler that I don't have as I get older and the responsibilities pile on,"" he said. ""So when I have these free evenings where I can choose to do whatever I want and I spend the time building this business, it's a really cool time to start doing this, I think.""\Sophomore year, Baker's school gave each student and teacher an iPad, leaving room for Baker to demonstrate his coding abilities and start the project of which he is most proud.\""Everyone has an iPad and we're all using them for tons of stuff, whether it's doing homework or submitting assignments or taking quizzes, but at the same time we're using these paper hall passes, which everybody hates and can steal,"" Baker said. ""So why are these not different?""\He talked with one of his teachers, who prompted him to create an app for the school. Within a year, students were using PassWhiz, which gives students electronic passes.\While the application is free to download for students, schools must sign up for a PassWhiz account. This lets them track pass usage and see when students are out of class at any time. Prices vary by the size of the school, but it usually costs between $500 and $2,000 per year.\PassWhiz now serves a couple of schools in Indiana and has branched out to Pennsylvania and Georgia, Baker said. The company has made more than $5,000 so far. MostBeastly Studios, a local development company, worked with Baker to roll out PassWhiz 2.0 in early July, an upgraded version of Baker's original, which as Baker said, ""is not built by a 15-year-old me in study hall."" They took all of his original code and used a more secure back end.\Later in his sophomore year, Baker met Eric White, president of local tech company Motile. Baker became a computer programmer for the company and credits White as being one of his many mentors. He also named Mike Kelly, managing partner of DeveloperTown, and Bill Clark, who started Indy business Pivot22, as local tech mentors.\Baker's ability to code at a young age isn't what impressed White so much -- it was his character.\""To me it didn't matter if he was 16 or had a college degree,"" White said. ""What's really rare about him is he has a really good balance of technical ability, but then also the ability to understand people and work collaboratively. He comes up with new ideas all the time. ... He's extremely energetic and very self-motivated.""\Baker has found his way into a multitude of tech initiatives, from co-host of a podcast on entrepreneurship in education, to a partner at a software consulting service, Baker Stone Group. He also works at Codelicious, a company that teaches students how to code.\In high school, Baker started a code club that would meet every other day in study hall to work on games and programs. The club later turned into Teen Tech Help, which gave students the opportunity to provide technology help at a library -- the same one in which Baker first found the coding book -- and senior citizen centers.\""I'm pretty passionate about unlocking the potential high school (students) have to do awesome stuff,"" he said.\Baker isn't the only young programmer in the area. MostBeastly Studios CEO Brandon Boynton, a graduate from Pendleton, created an app to report bullying, called The Bully Box, when he was in high school. Hunter Stone, a Noblesville graduate, also started programming at a young age. He worked with Baker to start Baker Stone Group and also works at Codelicious.\So what's next for Baker?\This fall he'll be attending the University of California, Berkeley, just outside Silicon Valley.\He won the Cal Alumni Leadership Award, which recognizes students who ""demonstrate innovative, initiative-driven leadership impacting their academic, work or community environments.""\But his major won't be computer science.\Just as he did in elementary school, Baker became interested in something he knows nothing about: cognitive science.\""Lately the pie has been changing from less computer programming to more of the entrepreneurial business side of things, because I just think that stuff is really interesting, too,"" Baker said. ""So I'm trying to explore that as I move forward.""\After college, he's hoping to bring back that knowledge to Indy's tech field, contributing to an industry that has already taught him so much.\Call IndyStar reporter Kaitlin Lange at (317) 444-6487.

192,"Two wind energy projects planned for Tippecanoe County are facing stiff headwinds that could block further development.\Lack of funding has put on hold a 100-megawatt energy park proposed for farmland owned by Purdue University and nearby privately owned property.\And the status of a plan to build a 133-turbine park in an area southwest in the county is in the air, although the reasons are less than clear.\Matthew DaPrato, a wind energy analyst with IHS Emerging Energy Research, said these projects and others that miss out on a federal wind energy production tax credit set to expire at end of this year will likely struggle to secure financing and agreements with utilities to sell their power.\""It will change the equation,"" DaPrato said. ""In Indiana, I would not expect to see any built next year without the credit there.""\Without a power purchase agreement, developers cannot attract tens of millions of dollars, or more, from funders to purchase and install turbines.\DaPrato said utility companies across the country are currently signing power agreements with developers because they are locking in on low prices.\A combination of the Production Tax Credit, which will expire at the end of 2012 unless Congress renews it, increased turbine efficiency and lower turbine manufacturing costs is making the cost of wind megawatts per hour competitive.\The lack of the wind farm subsidy is already having an effect. A wind farm in western Boone County was canceled recently by enXco, a French energy company.\""Regulatory uncertainty"" over the fate of the federal renewable energy tax credit was a factor in the decision, a company spokeswoman said.\Indiana is at a disadvantage, DaPrato said, because lawmakers have not adopted a mandatory renewable energy portfolio standard. In 2010, Indiana passed a voluntary goal for utilities in the state to produce 10 percent clean energy by 2025.\Some other states, such as Illinois, have a mandate.\""Without the RPS, there is nothing to guide utilities,"" he said, referring to the renewable energy portfolio.\Looking to 2013\Performance Services, an Indianapolis-based engineering and construction company, has been seeking financial backers and a power purchase agreement since early 2011 for a turbine park planned for the Animal Sciences Research and Education Center, 10 miles northwest of West Lafayette, and on private land in western Tippecanoe County.\This week Scott Zigmond, vice president of sales and marketing for Performance Service, said he remains committed to the project, though the original goal of breaking ground this year won't be meet.\""Now we don't see a full project in 2012,"" he said, ""but we are planning on a full one in 2013.""\The company is paying leasing fees to 19 landowners in the northern part of the section.\""The process is, now we have to get a utility company or utility companies ... to agree,"" Zigmond said. ""From that, we would go into financing.""\Ken Sandel, Purdue's director of physical and capital planning, said the university's financial interest is as landowner. The Purdue Research Foundation is overseeing the lease of land.\""Our primary interest in this is the research, not only in the engineering research in the turbines and turbine technology, but the impact on the environment and agricultural,"" he said.\Sandel said Purdue remains committed to work with Performance Services.\Southside questions\The story of delay and uncertainty is similar for Invenergy Wind LLC of Chicago, which has floated plans to build 133 turbines in an area of southwest Tippecanoe County along with parts of Montgomery and Fountain counties.\Chuck Shelby, a farmer who lives on South County Road 400 West, is one of more than 200 people to sign easement agreements with Invenergy for its 45,000-acre Tri-County Wind Project. Shelby has continued to receiving leasing fees, though he is not sure where the project stands.\""I have a lot of the same questions others have,"" he said. ""We have not heard from them in awhile.""\County Commissioner Tom Murtaugh said it has been months since the county spoke with the company.\""We don't know what is going on,"" he said, ""if it is on hold or if it is canceled.""\Last summer county commissioners approved giving wind farm developers 18 months to get their first generator up and running once their projects in the county are approved.\Invenergy opened a downtown office several years ago. It was closed in late 2011.\""Our development efforts in central Indiana continue to be supported out of our offices in Chicago,"" spokeswoman Alissa Krinsky wrote in an email.\In a statement provided to the Journal & Courier, Kevin Parzyck, Invenergy's vice president of development for the central region, said the company continues to evaluate the impact of uncertainty in the wind energy Production Tax Credit.\""The project is pursuing necessary federal, state, and local permits, and we are actively meeting with potential counterparts about purchasing power and renewable energy credits from the facility,"" the statement said.\Contributing: The Indianapolis Star\ID_Code: BY-204040311"

194,"Indianapolis granted millions in tax breaks from 1997 through 2001 for the promise of 14,000 new jobs, a total that rivals the work forces of the city's biggest companies.\But an analysis by The Indianapolis Star found mixed results among businesses that get the breaks, known as property tax abatements, and discovered that dozens have not filed up-to-date progress reports detailing their job creation.\Sixty-three companies promised to create 10,704 new jobs and retain 22,981 workers in exchange for $147 million in tax breaks, according to the analysis of documents covering nearly 90 percent of the total value of abatements during the five-year period. So far they have actually created 8,689 jobs and retained 22,142 others, although the deadline hasn't passed for some companies that received abatements.\The analysis goes only as far as 2001 because that year produced the last batch of companies that have been asked to fill out job-creation surveys.\Tax incentives have long been used as an economic development tool by many local and state governments across the nation. Businesses avoid paying some property taxes for a fixed length of time in return for building or expanding.\However, critics say many companies might have expanded even without tax incentives. They say the forgone tax dollars translate into reduced funding for schools and government services. And some worry that governments do not follow through to ensure that the businesses rewarded with abatements keep their promises of new jobs.\The tax breaks became an issue this year when two major Downtown Indianapolis redevelopment projects -- the proposed Simon headquarters and the new Conrad Hotel -- received more than $12 million in property tax reductions.\Companies reviewed by The Star had active abatements in 2003 and filed mandated job-creation surveys either in 2003 or 2004. Those companies created or kept more than 30,000 jobs in Indianapolis -- the equivalent of about 6 percent of all employment in the city.\But at least 46 companies did not file job-creation surveys this year -- making up-to-date tracking impossible. Combined, those companies were approved for more than $60 million in tax cuts.\City officials said they are making efforts to bring those companies into compliance. They also said overdue files were not a problem because the city is only now wrapping up enforcement from 2002.\Lack of response did not surprise Jack Miller, the Indiana coordinator for the Alliance for Democracy, a national nonprofit advocacy group, who said poor oversight raises larger questions about whether tax breaks work.\""What they're doing is they're taking away money that ought to be spent on the public,"" Miller said. ""For every dollar you take away in abatement, that's a dollar you could spend on the public.""\Mayor Bart Peterson, who made limiting abatements a theme of his 1999 campaign, said the city takes enforcement seriously and that tax breaks have been pulled for companies that don't file on time.\""I don't think there's any excuse for them to (have to) be pushed,"" Peterson said. ""They're receiving local taxpayer assistance in return for bringing in jobs . . . and they ought to do what they've agreed to do.""\A job from an abatement\For Cheryl Chandler -- who helps make sports jerseys and T-shirts at Reebok's Far-Eastside factory -- the city's investment is personal. She owes her job to it.\""It's constant production,"" said Chandler, 44, who moves the clothing from a silk-screen machine -- which applies the names of athletes and team logos -- to a dryer.\She said she took the job at Reebok about a year ago after being laid off by another company that was forced to downsize.\In 2001, the city reduced Reebok's tax bill by $112,000. The savings prompted the hiring of 288 workers -- including Chandler -- which is significantly more jobs than the 45 the company promised to create.\The Indianapolis Metropolitan Development Commission this year signed off on a $3.8 million abatement for mall owner Simon to build a new headquarters across Washington Street from the Statehouse. Also, the Conrad Hotel -- already under construction at Washington and Illinois streets -- was approved for an $8.3 million break.\Despite the reductions, those projects still will pay $12.3 million in property taxes over the next 10 years -- a significant amount, given that no tax has been collected on either site in years, property records show.\Meanwhile, the two companies will invest $137 million in the new buildings and have promised to create 281 new jobs.\Citywide, from 2000 through 2002, companies that received abatements promised to spend $1.3 billion on new buildings, expansions or other projects.\Incentives gone sour\At times, deals made by governments to spur economic development can go sour.\State and local officials are still reeling from a deal made with United Airlines in 1991 to open a maintenance hub at Indianapolis International Airport. Although abatements were not included, the company received $300 million in government building subsidies and other assistance and promised to create 7,500 jobs.\Instead, last year, United announced it would close the facility.\Because it failed to meet job targets, United has paid $34 million in penalties, $12 million of which went to the city.\But the company is still on the hook for another $100 million -- payments now tied up in bankruptcy court.\Peterson said he believes the city has gotten better at enforcing job-creation goals since he took office. The job-creation survey companies are required to fill out, for example, is new -- though it augments a similar report required by the state.\""Until this administration got here, there really wasn't follow-up,"" the mayor said. ""We're getting funds back from people that we didn't before.""\Taking it back\Since Peterson was first elected, the city has collected $2.7 million from 11 companies that either left town or fell short of job goals -- though $2 million of that came from USA Group, a financial company.\On Wednesday, the city's development commission will hear proposals to terminate three abatements.\The city also is handing out fewer long-term, 10-year abatements in favor of shorter, three- and six-year deals, which are easier to track, partially because they are less likely to run over multiple mayoral administrations.\Shorter abatements have been successful in many cases.\Group Athletica, the Reebok subsidiary where Chandler works, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000 and was about to close shop when it was purchased by the sports apparel giant in 2001.\As part of the purchase, the struggling company needed to expand, and that required a tax break. The company received a seven-year abatement and used the savings to expand its warehouse and buy silk-screen machines.\But not every abatement has resulted in gangbusters expansion.\Covance Inc., a company that analyzes blood and urine samples for drug trials, received a 10-year, $4.7 million break in 2000 and is among the companies that did not file a job-creation survey this year.\Covance has a good excuse, a spokeswoman said, because the company never went forward with expansion. Abatements kick in only when the property is improved, so Covance still is paying its usual share of taxes.\Abatements spark growth\A 2001 study of Indianapolis tax breaks by the Center for Urban Policy and the Environment found that the city's abatements are generally successful at stimulating growth but also found that many of the companies that got them already were well-established here.\The most prominent example is Eli Lilly and Co., which received $162.8 million from 1999 to 2003 to create 7,500 jobs, retain 8,700 and invest more than $1 billion in Marion County over a 10-year period.\Although it's impossible to know whether companies that received abatements would have expanded without them, this is exactly the test several experts said elected officials must attempt when weighing applicants.\But no mayor can risk letting a company such as Lilly relocate -- no matter how slight the chance -- said Sam Nunn, research director at the Center for Urban Policy.\In some cases, decisions to grant abatements can be based more on politics than economics, Nunn said.\""Abatements are a political reality . . . and sometimes they can work,"" he said.\In Reebok's case, the tax break made a difference. A factory on the verge of closing is now a thriving cacophony of embroidery machines, forklifts and trucks waiting for boxes full of jerseys.\Blake Lundberg, vice president and general manager, wouldn't go so far as to say the tax credit was the main reason for his company's success. But it was one factor that helped it latch on to a surge of new business.\""We've had increased business needs,"" he said. ""Business was good. It continues to be good.""\___________________\Property tax abatements awarded, 1997 to 2001\Here's a look at some of the abatements handed out by the city that were still active in 2003.\Company - Savings to company - Jobs* - Cost per job\FedEx (RPS), Shipping - $908,000 - 166 - $5,470\Praxair Surface Technologies, protective coatings - $247,000 - 201 - $1,228\Carrier Corp., heating and cooling systems - $689,958 - 1,469 - $469\Flutes, Cardboard manufacturer - $152,900 - 54 - $2,831\*Includes promised, retained and created.\Source: Department of Metropolitan Development; Star analysis by John Fritze\Abatements in 2004\The city has handed out $15.5 million in property tax abatements so far in 2004 to create 975 jobs ? about $16,000 per new job.

St. Vincent Hospital - $116,562 - 1 - 70\5 years, millions of dollars in tax cuts\From 1997 through 2001, Indianapolis companies received millions in property tax cuts in exchange for creating new jobs and retaining others. An analysis showed that at least 8,600 jobs have been created through those cuts.\Year - Abatements - Promised to create - Promised to retain - Cost per job - Actually created - Actually retained\1997 - $2.3 million - 293 - 1,006 - $1,747 - 367 - 1,080\1998 - $13.1 million - 801 - 5,109 - $2,222 - 978 - 4,632\1999 - $34.2 million - 1,018 - 3,530 - $7,527 - 965 - 3,335\2000 - $2.3 million - 515 - 978 - $1,522 - 241 - 924\2001 - $5.1 million - 577 - 3,658 - $1,209 - 749 - 3,471\Eli Lilly* - $90.3 million - 7,500 - 8,700 - 5,574 - 5,389 - 8,700\*Includes several years of abatements for Eli Lilly and Co. that cannot be separated by year. Note: Data include abatements handed out in the year listed but still active in 2003. Anticipated job figures based on ?Statement of Benefits? maintained by the Department of Metropolitan Development. Actual job figures based on 2002 and 2003 city surveys filed by the companies. Does not include companies that did not file job-creation reports.\Abatement surveys\Companies that receive a property tax abatement from the city are supposed to file an annual report showing whether they have met their job-creation goals. Many have not filed that report this year.\Total number of abatements: 94\Amount of those abatements: $70.9 million\Abatement reports that were filed or not filed by companies in 2004:\Did file: 48 Worth $10.2 million, 51%\Did not file: 46 Worth $60.5 million, 49%\Abatement reports that were filed or not filed by companies in 2003 or 2004:\Did file: 80 Worth $57 .million, 85%\Did not file: 14 Worth $13.9 million, 15%\Note: Data are for companies that received an abatement during the period 1997 to 2001 and had an active abatement in 2003. Does not include Lilly.\Local salaries\To receive a tax break, companies must report salary information for the workers affected by the abatement. Here?s a look at average salaries at some of those companies.\Speedway Engine Development\Engine builder\$82,118\Eli Lilly and Co.\Pharmaceutical maker\$74,326\TransCorr\Trucking company\$58,156\Allison Transmission\Transmission builder\$56,430*\National Starch & Chemical\Grain and chemical company\$52,728\*5902 Decatur Blvd. location\Note: Based on a 52-week year and 40-hour week; compiled from ""current"" employee average wage data for only those companies that filed city job-creation surveys.\Source: Department of Metropolitan Development, Star analysis by John Fritze\How the analysis was conducted\The Indianapolis Star analysis includes companies that received abatements from 1997 to 2001, the most recent year a company could receive an abatement and still be required to file a job-creation survey.\Abatements vary in length, but the analysis considers only abatements that were active in 2003 -- the most recent possible -- because companies were required to file 2003 job-creation surveys this year.\In some findings, terminated companies and those that did not file job-creation surveys in 2003 or 2004 were not included. Residential abatements were stricken when possible.\In cases in which a 2004 city survey was not filed, the analysis relies on 2003 filings or the state's CF-1 form, filed with the county auditor. In some findings, data for Eli Lilly and Co. were separated because the company did not set job-creation goals for individual abatements.\The city could not detail savings-to-company terms for nine abatements for which companies filed job-creation reports. Those abatements are not included.\Companies have a wide range of successes, failures\When awarding property tax abatements, the city considers job creation, location, the breadth of investment and the type of work a firm does. Results have been mixed. Here are some examples:\Trucking school exceeds goals\*C1 Professional Training Center, 3603 E. Raymond St., a company that trains truck drivers, received a six-year abatement in 1997 for $165,000. The company built a new office complex and a driving course. The project was expected to create 15 new jobs but, instead, C1 hired 77 new people at an average wage of $12.40 an hour. Despite sustaining heavy damage in May's tornadoes, the company has exceeded its original 98-job goal.\Economy squashes expansion plans\* Covance, 8211 SciCor Drive, a firm that analyzes blood and urine samples for drug trials, received a 10-year, $4.7 million break in 2000 and is among the companies that did not file a jobs report. However, the Far-Westside company never went forward with its expansion because of the tough economy. In that case, the abatement never kicked in because the property was never improved.\Developer promises to retain 844 jobs\* Shopping mall giant Simon was approved for a $3.8 million abatement to build a new headquarters across Washington Street from the Statehouse -- a project it said will retain 844 positions and create 41 new jobs at an average wage of $21.15 an hour. Plans for that project still are being developed, but company officials hope it will open in 2006.\Interstate Castings falls short\* The city did not have a job-creation report on hand for Interstate Castings, 3823 Massachusetts Ave., but company officials said they filed one in February. The company received a $52,000 abatement in 1998 and promised to keep 48 jobs. A job-creation report faxed to the city earlier this month showed the company fell about five jobs short of that goal. A company official said no one lost a job because of the abatement and that the company was doing the best it could in the current economy.\Lilly pledges to invest $1 billion\* Eli Lilly and Co. received more property tax abatement than any other company in Indianapolis: $162.8 million from 1999 to 2003 to create 7,500 jobs, retain 8,700 and invest more than $1 billion in Marion County over a 10-year period.\____________________\Call Star reporter John Fritze at (317) 444-2752."
