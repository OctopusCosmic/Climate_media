On her first public visit to Connecticut since joining the Obama administration as a top air pollution official, Gina McCarthy declared a year-old program to reduce greenhouse gases a success, raising millions for energy efficiency projects in the state.
\
McCarthy, the former state Department of Environmental Protection commissioner, said auctions of carbon emission allowances - designed to curb emissions scientists say are contributing to global warming - are not raising energy costs, as some had feared.
\
""It has generated millions of dollars that the state has invested primarily in energy efficiency projects, and those have achieved significant greenhouse gas reductions as well as traditional pollutants,"" McCarthy said after a speech in Cromwell at an energy conference sponsored by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
\
McCarthy now serves as assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
\
The carbon allowances are purchased in auctions by power companies, manufacturers, financial services companies and individuals, with the proceeds going into programs to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
\
Connecticut was among the first states to participate in a ""cap-and-trade"" program as part of a coalition of 10 Northeastern states. Other regional coalitions have been formed in the West and Midwest, and there is support in Congress to create a federal program.
\
So far, there have been five auctions involving Connecticut, raising $21 million for projects in the state, according to a DEP spokesman.
\
Of the $21 million, about a quarter, or $5.2 million, went to the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, helping fund 19 solar-energy projects at 11 schools, three town halls and one affordable housing project.
\
Those projects eliminated 17,200 tons of greenhouse gas, equivalent to the annual emission from about 2,800 cars or a power plant producing electricity annually for 2,164 homes, according to the DEP. The rest of the money went to utilities, including Connecticut Light & Power and United Illuminating, for consumer and commercial energy-efficiency projects, the DEP said.
\
The auctions are held quarterly.
\
""From the state's perspective,"" McCarthy said, ""both the environment and energy folks, tve auction has worked exceedingly well.""

The steps detailed Tuesday by President Obama to slow the progress of climate change while lessening its disastrous effects mirror, in part, existing state and regional efforts to limit greenhouse gases and support renewable energy.
\
The White House said the president's plan will set up carbon emission standards for existing and new power plants, which release a third of all greenhouse gases in the United States. It puts $8 billion in loans to energy-efficiency projects, directs the federal government to permit more renewable energy projects on government-owned land, and launches a number of efforts to prepare vulnerable areas for the impacts of climate change.
\
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said in a written response, ""Our energy agenda is very much aligned with plans laid out today by the president.""
\
In the Northeast, power plants participate in a cap-and-trade program that requires power plants of a certain size to buy carbon offsets for their emissions. Connecticut has one of the most progressive clean energy goals in the country, requiring that 20 percent of its energy come from renewables by the end of the decade. And the state's green bank -- the Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority -- is bringing private money into the equation, lessening the burden for state subsidies.
\
Joel Gordes, one of five co-authors of Connecticut's first climate change legislation in 1990 and principal of energy consultant Environmental Energy Solutions, said, ""We've been well ahead because we've been interested in reducing our nitrous oxides and sulfur oxides for years, and that meant cleaning up the (power) plants"" and reducing greenhouse gases.
\
""And the cleaner we are, the more the onus is on other parts of the country to keep up with us,"" Gordes said.
\
State and regional support of renewable energy programs also springs from the high energy prices that residents pay, which slims the gap between traditional electric sources and renewable ones.
\
""Connecticut is emerging as a national model for what it takes to build a clean energy future that is responsive to ratepayers and the need to grow our economy and create jobs,"" Malloy said. ""The initiatives that the president has offered today will support our efforts and put Connecticut and the entire nation on a path to a more secure and sustainable future.""
\
Obama plans to expand a federal energy-efficient building program that pushes for commercial, industrial and multifamily buildings to be 20 percent more energy-efficient by 2020. Northeast states, by comparison, have increased investments in energy efficiency by 350 percent since 2005, according to Environment Northeast, an environmental advocacy and research nonprofit.
\
""States have developed innovative policies that demonstrate how emissions reductions and economic growth can go hand-in-hand,"" Environment Northeast President Daniel Sosland said in a written statement.
\
Under the region's cap-and-trade program, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, power plants have cut carbon emissions by 44 percent since 2005, and revenue from the carbon credits have added $1.3 billion to states' clean energy programs, Environment Northeast said.
\
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, responding to the president's speech Tuesday, said the nation needs to train its focus on the impacts of climate change.
\
""Anyone who questions whether we must act needs not look beyond the recent rash of unprecedented severe weather events that have devastated communities across the country,"" he said. ""From Superstorm Sandy, which wrought havoc in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, to last month's lethal, destructive Oklahoma tornadoes, severe, large-scale weather is the new normal.""
\
He said the call for attention to climate change and energy goals also should note that the president's nominee to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, long has been stalled in the U.S. Senate.
\
""She is a natural and necessary partner in the effort President Obama outlined today, and I urge my colleagues once again to act immediately to approve her nomination,"" Blumenthal said.

The contrast could not be more striking: Every Democratic candidate for president has put forward an aggressive package of policies and statements on global warming and has made it a cornerstone of his or her campaign.
\
Of the Republicans, just one, John McCain, comes close to matching the Democrats' fervor for the issue. The GOP contenders focus instead on policies aimed at achieving energy independence - a goal that dates to the energy crisis of the 1970s.
\
The contrast in this primary season reflects an ongoing divide in the nation. Twice as many Democrats as Republicans say the environment will be a very important factor in their vote this year, according to a survey taken in October for the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
\
That split also appears between liberals and conservatives in both parties.
\
While environmental issues in general rank lower than the more immediate concerns of most citizens - the war in Iraq, the economy, health care, jobs, terrorism - the subject is gaining attention.
\
Most Americans - three-quarters or four-fifths, depending on the survey - now say they believe global warming is happening. How much we have to do about it and how urgently are in dispute.
\
Here are summaries of where the candidates stand on environmental issues, primarily on global warming and what to do about it. For more detail, go to the candidates' own websites. To get an idea of what is on the minds of the electorate, check out www.people-press.org.

THE CHALLENGE FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT
\
Whoever is elected this year will face a huge political battle over climate change, whatever he or she may believe. Those urging action say we must start now to avoid the worst effects of global warming. But many others, in Congress and the among the public, adamantly oppose any substantial effort.
\
There's no shortage of people willing to help. The bipartisan Presidential Climate Action Project already is compiling a program for the 44th president - a list of goals and options to get the ball rolling in the first 100 days.
\
What may be in short supply, though, is the political will for a fight, given other pressing issues such as the economy and the war in Iraq.
\
""The task for the next president is going to be negotiating a deep and difficult international agreement to reduce these carbon emissions,"" says author Bill McKibben, co-founder of Step It Up, a global warming activist group. ""It's going to require devoting an enormous amount of political capital - it's going to have to be one of two or three issues that matter to them. So far, there's no real sign of that.""

Levels of greenhouse gas emissions in Connecticut have been pushed back to where they were decades ago, but much more needs to be done to meet the state's climate goals, a new state report says.
\
Investments in energy efficiency, a regional shift to natural gas use for electricity, and slowed economic output between 2007 and 2010 were major contributors to the steep slide in the production of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change during that period, the report said.
\
The decline first dipped the state's greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels in 2008, two years ahead of the goal. Connecticut's next goals call for it to be 10 percent below those levels in 2020 and 80 percent below by 2050.
\
""Additional action will be required to achieve the state's target,"" said the state's report on greenhouse gas emissions. The report is required by the state Global Warming Solutions Act of 2008.
\
The report was dated Monday, the day the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency put forward new rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the country's power plants by 30 percent in the next decade and a half.
\
""There are strong indications that this climate progress is being and can continue to be accomplished while simultaneously assuring that Connecticut enjoys a cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy future, supporting economic growth and job growth, and providing improved quality of life,"" the report said.
\
In 2010, Connecticut produced 41.38 million metric tons of greenhouse gases across sectors including transportation, power, residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture and waste. In 1990, greenhouse gas emissions were 43.75 million metric tons.
\
Greenhouse gas production from the power and commercial sectors fell the steepest in the past two decades, while transportation, the largest category for the emissions, and commercial sectors grew by 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively.
\
Declines in the commercial sector were caused by less overall energy use and fuel switching from oil to natural gas, the report said.
\
Although meeting the state's goal for 2010 two years early is welcome news to state officials, more recent trends underline how further reducing emissions could prove more difficult.
\
One reason is that the economy is expanding, not declining as it did during the years leading up to 2010. As businesses increase operations or new firms open shops, demand for electricity will grow, increasing overall emissions. As the economy turned the corner at the end of 2009 and into 2010, carbon emissions in Connecticut began to tick up slightly, according to the state report.
\
Lauren Savidge, a staff attorney and energy specialist for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, called the report encouraging, but added that it also highlighted how far the state has left to go.
\
Although the state is comfortably on its way to meeting its 2020 goal -- having emissions of just 39.38 million metric tons of carbon dioxide -- the 2050 goal will take much more work. By then, the state needs to have just 9.25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
\
""Connecticut needs a firm plan to reach our legally mandated 2050 target,"" Savidge said. ""A detailed plan with short- and long-term goals will create exciting opportunities for innovation and economic growth while cleaning our air and mitigating climate damage.""
\
Much of the decline in the power sector can be attributed to a regional cap-and-trade program that required power plants to buy offsets for their carbon dioxide emissions. Proceeds from the purchases are reinvested by the eight Northeastern states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to fund efficiency programs or renewable energy projects.
\
Promotion of the state report coincided Friday with the release of results from the most recent auction of carbon credits from the cap-and-trade program. The 24th auction since its founding in 2009 raised $90.7 million for member states by selling 18.1 million carbon credits at $5.02 a piece.
\
Cumulatively, the auctions have raised $1.75 billion.
\
Peter Shattuck, director of market initiative for Environment Northeast, an environmental advocate, said that the regional program ""has demonstrated that emissions can come down rapidly and affordably in the electric sector.""
\
Over the course of the program, electricity prices in the region have fallen by 8 percent.

\
NEW HAVEN -- Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Foley told a group gathered at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies Monday that he did not know if human activity was related to rising temperatures around the globe.
\
Foley, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dan Malloy and independent candidate Tom Marsh appeared separately in a forum on the environment, energy and the economy sponsored by 10 environmental and planning groups and were not all asked the same questions.
\
Foley said he wasn't a scientist and did not know the cause of global warming, but he supported energy policies that reduce U.S. dependence on fossil fuels for national security reasons. ""I believe the data shows temperatures are rising,"" he said.
\
Foley said he supported the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, of which Connecticut is a member, to reduce carbon emissions. He characterized the effort as a ""stealth tax,"" but felt it was more responsive than any national cap-and-trade initiative.
\
All three men felt that the state Department of Environmental Protection was unresponsive and took too long to give answers to permits that involved pollution emissions and hazardous waste.
\
""We need more timely rendering of decisions,"" Malloy said. ""We need to hold ourselves to high standards and timeliness is one of those standards."" He added, however, that there are ""too few examiners"" and the state has to make available ""appropriate levels of staffing."" Malloy charged that the Republican administrations going back 15 years have ""purposefully underfunded"" the department.
\
Moderator Nancy Cohen, environmental reporter for National Public Radio, said the DEP has 10 percent fewer staff members than it did in 2003.
\
""I have complaints all over state government that there aren't enough staff. But that's attitudinal. We simply need to do more with less,"" Foley told the audience of about 150 students, professors and environmental activists. He said he has heard complaints that it has taken up to 19 months to get a permit.
\
Foley and Malloy pledged to do more to reclaim brownfields, particularly in the cities, while they also favored continued investment in open space, at a time when real estate costs are down.
\
Both major candidates opposed wind farms in Long Island Sound, while Malloy said siting along parts of the shoreline or other areas under study was more appropriate.
\
Asked if he would agree to a moratorium on more energy plants in highly polluted areas, Malloy addressed the use of peaking plants. He said they are used infrequently, and he would need more information before he would agree to an overall ban.
\
Marsh, the first selectman of Chester, said the state has no cohesive energy plan; ""there is no clear direction, there is no policy and there is no leadership.""
\
As a leader of a small rural community, Marsh said decisions on funding for items such as sewage treatment plants are arbitrary, but he felt home rule, where the towns are partners with the state in protecting assets, such as the wetlands, was working appropriately.
\
The forestry school is one of the main centers in the country studying climate change. Gordon Geballe, associate dean at the school, said candidates can't be expected to be experts in all fields, but ""the preponderance of the evidence worldwide by scientists is that human activity is causing temperature rise and climate change.""

The upcoming election and the war in Iraq weren't the hottest topics at Alma Pagels School Friday afternoon when U.S. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, I-Conn, spoke to a class of fifth-graders about another issue he holds near and dear: global warming.
\
Standing before the class, Lieberman talked about the impact of climate change on the environment and his hopes of success for a bill targeting greenhouse gas emissions, believed to be a cause of global warming. Lieberman sponsored the bill along with Republican Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia.
\
""I'm an independent Democrat. I like to work with someone in the other party, Republicans, because that's the way you get things done. You don't get enough votes otherwise,"" he told the students.
\
The bill passed the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee in December and Lieberman said he is now working to convince other senators to vote for the bill, which would institute a cap-and-trade plan aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
\
He said the bill should come up for a vote in the Senate in May.
\
While the students responded with their own questions and ideas about global climate change, they also managed to sidetrack the senator with questions about the upcoming election.
\
""Have you ever made a bill with Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John McCain?"" one student asked, drawing good-natured laughter from the senator.
\
""You know the interesting thing, I've done a bill with every one of them,"" he said, adding: ""I decided to support Senator McCain just because I think he's the best but Senator Obama and Senator Clinton are wonderful senators and they are great people. This is going to be a really important, interesting election.""
\
Lieberman also pointed out that Obama, Clinton and McCain are co-sponsors on his global warming bill.
\
""Incidentally, President Bush has not been doing really enough, in my opinion, about global warming,"" he added.
\
The students also did their homework on the subject of global warming and were prepared to show the senator what they've learned.
\
One girl raised her hand and defined the issue: ""Global warming starts melting icebergs and it causes more water in the ocean and it can cause more floods,"" she said.
\
""That's right, exactly,"" Lieberman responded. ""How does global warming happen?"" he asked next.
\
""Too many gases build up,"" one boy said.
\
Lieberman then explained the process of global warming, from the warming of the atmosphere by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to its effects on the planet's climate.
\
Lieberman gave the example of maple syrup producers in northern New England seeing decreases in production because of shorter winters.
\
He talked about robins in Connecticut staying longer during the year due to the warmer temperatures and pollution in Long Island Sound.
\
Lieberman said in his lifetime, one of the most effective things government has done is to begin to try to clean up the environment by passing environmental laws.
\
But he acknowledged that the fight has just begun.
\
""The problem of global warming is really the big problem of the next century,"" he said.
\
One of the other highlights of the senator's talk was his emphasis on a new section of his Senate Web site called the Red White and Blue Project, which offers learning resources for students.
\
The page, accessed through www.lieberman.senate.gov, allows visitors to track bills and learn about the government process.
\
He offered some general words of wisdom for the children as they grow up.
\
""It's really important that you learn about how the government works and at least be an informed voter because what I always say to people is that whether you are involved in government or not it's going to decide what kind of life you are going to have,"" he said.

Thanks, Gov. Rell
\
Gov. M. Jodi Rell's decision to move forward on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is the most forward-looking, significant energy and environmental policy Connecticut has seen in 50 years. Her leadership and that of her state Department of Environmental Protection commissioner, Gina McCarthy, should make every resident of Connecticut proud.
\
RGGI is an agreement among at least six states to cut greenhouse gas in the Northeast. By creating a cap and trade program, RGGI will drive innovation, while cleaning up our environment. It will also help secure our nation's energy independence by reducing our use of fossil fuel. But RGGI also places Connecticut and other Northeast states in an unprecedented leadership position.
\
Two weeks ago, nearly 160 nations got together in Montreal to try to address the problem of global warming. Many were looking to the United States to lead, and felt a great sense of disappointment to instead see the United States standing on the sidelines. Yet I and other Americans who attended the conference were able to urge people to look beyond Washington, D.C., to find states like Connecticut that are creating models for leading the world on this issue.
\
Future generations will be thankful to Gov. Rell and other governors in the Northeast for moving forward with this historic agreement to curb harmful greenhouse gases.

\
Geology professor Robert M. Thorson should stick to studying rocks, because when he talks about sentient beings, he quickly loses his way.
\
He portrays hunting as an irresistible instinct that is ""the ultimate in male bonding"" and satisfies something in our psyche. Somehow the vast majority of men and women have no such urge to murder. Some instinct.
\
In his world, one has either to hunt or to eat the flesh of an animal that someone else has killed on his behalf. Millions of us choose to do neither and we're getting along just fine.
\
Thorson claims that he is for the ethical treatment of animals and that we must be compassionate to other creatures. He has a funny way of showing it.

What Is Bysiewicz Thinking?
\
Connecticut is in the process of selecting a vendor to provide electronic voting machines.
\
One vendor under consideration is Diebold, a name that always pops up when election controversy starts to swirl.
\
Diebold is the same company whose CEO, Walden W. O'Dell, abruptly resigned Dec. 12. He is the same CEO who promised to deliver Ohio's electoral votes to President Bush in 2004.
\
Connecticut shouldn't be entrusting fair election results to a manufacturer who promised a fixed outcome in Ohio. Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz and the people weighing this decision should distance themselves and Connecticut's voters from any equipment that is suspect.
\
Nothing would dampen enthusiasm to vote faster than people hearing how their vote can be easily changed after they leave the polls.

Tax Relief For Whom?
\
So the House has passed a tax cut with savings, it is claimed, for all classes of Americans. The devastated Gulf Coast will get breaks related to the hurricane damage, the middle class will get relief from the alternative minimum tax and the wealthy will get lower rates on investment income. Fair? But the hurricane relief is a one-time measure. The middle-class relief has a one-year expiration -- the threat of the alternative tax will loom again next year. Yet the investment tax break benefiting largely the rich has a duration of no less than five years.
\
I offer two predictions. One, that the House next year will have another round of extended tax breaks for rich Americans that last for five years (or more) while the middle class and poor will be lucky to get an extension of this year's temporary relief; and it will be promoted as a measure benefiting all Americans. Two, that our kids, seniors and the poor will bear the long-term cost of the deficit generated by these payouts to the wealthy and that any objection to its manifest unfairness will be labeled ""class warfare.""

Supports Principal
\
I am writing regarding the article ""Altercation At School Raises Questions"" [news story, Dec. 16]. Patrick Milling, vice principal of Bloomfield's Carmen Arace Middle School, ""put his hands on [a] student's shoulders to prevent him from walking away [from a discussion]."" Mr. Milling has been placed on paid administrative leave and is facing a termination hearing before the board of education as a result of his actions.
\
Today's youth are running rampant. Thugs, hoods and gangs are thriving for many reasons. One is that the family unit has faced a steady decline over the past 50 years, with divorce rates soaring. Another reason is that many kids are being raised by single parents (usually the mother) with no father figure to guide them. Finally, the most obvious reason is the complete lack of discipline by adult authority figures.
\
I'm not implying that Mr. Milling should have struck the student, or whipped his behind with a switch like they did in the olden days. But there needs to be some intelligent thought behind implementing rules designed to prevent child abuse when the child in question is larger than many adults and packing a concealed box-cutter ""for protection."" Mr. Milling deserves praise for his actions, not a termination hearing.

Lure The Penguins To Connecticut
\
With the news recently about the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team looking to relocate, one can't hope but wonder if it could move to Connecticut. I think Connecticut and Hartford should try to lure the team here.
\
Since the Whalers left, this state has been looking for a team to support. The Connecticut Sun has been very good recently, but they don't create a sense of state pride like the Whalers did. Every time I go to a UConn basketball or football game, I see people wearing Whalers apparel.
\
I think the state should do whatever they can to try to lure the Penguins to Connecticut. Picture Sidney Crosby, the NHL's next Wayne Gretzky, playing his home games in Hartford. He has already been a hit in Pittsburgh and would be a huge attraction in Connecticut. That would truly be an amazing sight.

WEST HARTFORD - In the waning minutes of Monday's debate among the four people running in the 1st Congressional District, one of the candidates noted that voters have a clear choice.
\
A cliche? Perhaps.
\
But this year, it also happens to be true. The candidates include a Republican engineer, businesswoman and master gardener who is new to elective politics; an art teacher and peace activist who is the Socialist Party's nominee; and a veteran journalist and recent law school grad running on the Green Party line. They are each seeking to unseat John Larson, a Democrat who has represented the suburban Hartford district since 1998.
\
The debate, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, was a free-wheeling affair. The auditorium in West Hartford Town Hall was packed with partisans and some of them cheered, clapped and snickered loudly.
\
Topics ranged from health care overhaul to defense spending to the environment; Larson received the bulk of the attacks. As the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, he was a key player in securing passage of the health care bill, and on Monday the sweeping legislation drew criticism.
\
""I certainly applaud the goals of the health care legislation,"" Republican Ann Brickley said. ""My problem is that this health care legislation is going to push an even larger problem onto the next generation because it does nothing to lower costs.""
\
Chris Hutchinson, the Socialist candidate, criticized the health care bill for not going far enough. He advocates free, universal coverage and would pay for it by slashing the military budget and ending the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
\
Ken Krayeske, the Green Party candidate, questioned Larson about his attendance at soirees in Washington and Napa Valley, Calif., where he mingled with lobbyists and raised hundreds of thousands for the Democratic Party. He urged voters to look beyond the two leading political parties.
\
""In 2006, the voters of Connecticut and voters of the United States threw out the Republicans because they were doing a bad job,"" Krayeske said. ""In 2010, the voters of this country now want to throw out the Democrats. Unfortunately, the only people that they're talking about replacing the Democrats with are the people who got us into this mess in the first place. We need to look at alternate options.""
\
Larson defended his record and focused on the Republicans, who ""want to go back to the Bush years,"" he said. ""They want to go to the period where we had record deficits. ... They want to go back and repeal health care. ... I say no to that."" Larson also accused the GOP of wanting to privatize Social Security and Medicare.
\
The candidates also sparred on taxes and the economy. Krayeske backs raising the minimum wage while Hutchinson proposed taxing those earning more than $250,000 a year at a rate of 100 percent. (Those who earn $50,000 or less would pay no taxes under his plan.) Brickley's views are in line with most of her fellow Republicans: She believes now is not the time to raise anyone's taxes. Larson supports extending the Bush-era tax cuts only to those earning $250,000 or less.
\
There was a difference of opinion on energy policy and the environment as well. Brickley spoke out against cap and trade, which calls for limiting carbon emissions by allowing companies to trade carbon allowances. She also expressed skepticism about the effect of global warming on humans.
\
""I see Ms. Brickley likes to garden but she doesn't think global warming is real,"" Krayeske quipped. ""She likes to keep her fingers in the dirt but her head in the sand.""

As lawmakers in Washington finally move to catch up with most of the rest of the world in trying to halt global warming, they have only to look to Connecticut and other Northeastern states for a model of how to get started.
\
The states' pioneering Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is the first plan of its kind in the U.S. to order absolute reductions in carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for heating up the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
\
California has the only other plan comparable to RGGI. That state's law was signed last September in a ceremony that included telephoned congratulations from British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
\
The idea behind both plans is as simple as it is new: If global warming has transformed CO[subscript 2] into a harmful pollutant, then the right to discharge it should cost something.
\
""We've been letting companies emit CO[subscript 2] for nothing,"" said Derek Murrow, a policy expert for Environment Northeast who helped plan RGGI.
\
""The state is creating a system to force companies to look at the value of CO[subscript 2]. It is creating a new good, which is air quality.""
\
Timetable For Reduction
\
RGGI calls for its member states to cut CO[subscript 2] emissions from large electric power plants 10 percent by 2019, and to create a market through which permits to emit the gas will be traded like any commodity.
\
Power plants no longer will be allowed to emit as much carbon dioxide as they want to produce electricity. Instead, RGGI caps their emissions at roughly present levels beginning in 2009, then lowers the cap. Plants exceeding their cap must buy extra permits or pay a penalty, while plants reducing emissions can sell their surplus permits.
\
Beginning now, each state must draft regulations to comply with RGGI's rules. One critical decision still to be made is how each state will distribute its annual allotment of CO[subscript 2] permits, which altogether could be worth more than $700 million.
\
Looming over these discussions -- besides Connecticut, the other member states are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts -- is a new, heightened urgency about global warming.
\
Since RGGI planning began three years ago, scientists have found more evidence, in melting Arctic ice and threatened wildlife, that the climate is changing faster than they had predicted. Some warn that the level of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere is nearing a tipping point that will guarantee dangerously high temperatures far into the future -- no matter how deeply emissions are cut.
\
From its inception, RGGI has been watched in Europe, where a $19 billion-a-year emissions trading market already exists, and in Washington, where bills proposing so-called ""cap-and-trade"" systems similar to RGGI's have languished -- until now.
\
The new speaker of the U.S. House, Nancy Pelosi, wants to create a select committee on climate change. Sens. Joe Lieberman, John McCain and Barack Obama have filed what has been dubbed the ""flagship"" of several new cap-and-trade bills.
\
And last week, on the eve of the State of the Union address, some of the country's biggest corporations, including DuPont and General Electric, joined environmental groups in urging President Bush to support a national cap-and-trade system.
\
As expected, Bush ignored the call, though he did speak of the need ""to confront the serious challenge"" of climate change. His refusal to make the U.S. a partner along with most of the world's nations in the Kyoto Protocol on global warming underscores RGGI's importance.
\
""What I find really exciting and significant about RGGI,"" said Bradford Gentry, co-director of Yale University's Center for Business and the Environment, ""is that as a political statement and laboratory for figuring out how to [limit greenhouse gases], this is one of the two most important initiatives in the U.S.""
\
The other plan is California's, which seeks to cut emissions from an array of sources 25 percent by 2020. But RGGI is more detailed, Gentry said, and ""important as an experiment that's ongoing around the world"" to attach a cost to CO[subscript 2].
\
Gary Yohe, a Wesleyan University economist who is a contributing author to a major U.N. report on climate change due Friday, said RGGI ""gets the train moving out of the station in the U.S., and that's what needs to happen.""
\
""If you don't start immediately, you're swimming upstream,"" Yohe said. ""If you don't start now the adjustment later will be bigger.""
\
Energy, Economics
\
And Environment
\
The involvement of academics like Gentry and Yohe in global warming points to another aspect of RGGI's significance. It marks the convergence of global warming science with economics, especially energy economics.
\
Connecticut's environmental protection commissioner, Gina McCarthy, said RGGI has led her into a close collaboration with Donald Downs, chairman of the state Department of Public Utility Control, who is struggling with rising rates and demand for electricity.
\
""I'm doing my best to get the environmental world to understand the energy world is part and parcel of the environmental world,"" McCarthy said. She linked global warming's higher temperatures to the state's summertime electric power and air pollution crises and to the 2003 heat wave in Europe blamed for at least 22,000 deaths.
\
""If you believe climate is becoming warmer and that it will result in [extreme] fluctuations, then we have to consider energy as an essential policy driver from the public health and environmental perspective,"" she said.
\
If RGGI works as intended, it will shift power generation from dirtier plants to cleaner ones and ultimately raise the cost of electricity. The high end estimate given in an RGGI fact sheet is $16 a year for an average household bill.
\
Making electricity more expensive is not something RGGI planners like to admit they are doing. They prefer to talk about how cap-and- trade systems use market forces to put a ""price on carbon.""
\
Energy Poker
\
On Dec. 14, McCarthy opened an RGGI briefing at DEP headquarters by telling several dozen representatives of environmental groups, power companies and lobbying firms: ""I believe there are two extreme values to RGGI. One is to put a price on carbon and drive this issue regionally and nationally, and the other is reducing demand.""
\
The briefing, on one of the many mild days in a record warm December at the end of a year that would be declared the warmest ever in the U.S., marked the start of negotiating the regulations that will determine how RGGI works in Connecticut.
\
Many rules remain to be decided, but the ""biggest fracas,"" as one power company executive later said, is likely to be over how the state parcels out its CO[subscript 2] permits.
\
To understand what's at stake, imagine a poker game that begins with Connecticut holding all the chips -- each good for one ton of CO[subscript 2] emissions.
\
In theory, the state could simply push all its chips, or permits, across the table to power companies and let them start playing, or trading, among themselves without having to ante up any money. This is what happened with a cap-and-trade program begun in the 1990s for the pollutants that cause acid rain.
\
RGGI, however, prevents such a giveaway. It requires a state to keep at least 25 percent of its chips and cash them in to benefit consumers in the form of rebates or energy conservation projects. Some states, such as New York, which first proposed RGGI, are leaning toward keeping 100 percent of their chips for such purposes. At the briefing, McCarthy said ""100 percent is not unreasonable for Connecticut.""
\
In actuality, the state will cash in the permits it chooses to keep by auctioning them off. With beginning auction prices estimated at $2 to $5 a ton, the value of Connecticut's yearly allotment of permits -- equal to 10,695,036 tons of CO[subscript 2] emissions -- could top $50 million.
\
Not surprisingly, environmental groups are pressuring the states to sell all their permits, as are some industrial customers. But they differ on whether the proceeds should be used for rebates, or for programs that would further reduce emissions.
\
""The majority should go to energy efficiency and clean energy technology. It's a better cost savings than a direct rebate [to consumers],"" said Sarah Murdock, a senior policy adviser for the Nature Conservancy.
\
Among those worried about RGGI's cost is Eric Brown, associate counsel for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, which opposed the state's joining.
\
""We already have a big conservation program. What RGGI would add to that is a mystery to me,"" Brown said.
\
""They talk about $52 million [for Connecticut's permits]. Where's that going to come from? They say it's going to come from the auction of allowances. You're putting a price on carbon. So somebody's going to have to pay that price. What are the utilities going to do?""
\
Spokesmen for two companies that own electric plants in the state, Power Service Enterprise Group of Newark, N.J., and NRG Energy of Princeton, both said a 100 percent auction will make their plants more expensive to operate and put them at a disadvantage in the deregulated electric market, where generators bid to supply power daily.
\
If plants in the RGGI states become too uncompetitive, it could lead to lower-cost electricity being imported from coal-burning plants outside the region, and outside its emissions controls.
\
Avoiding this ""leakage"" is perhaps the most troublesome obstacle still facing RGGI.
\
""The bottom line is if you raise the price of carbon, what it is likely to do is increase the cost of electricity, but not change the emissions output very much,"" said Steve Corneli, vice president of regulatory and government affairs for NRG Energy. ""RGGI, while well- intentioned, is a regional program for a global problem.""
\
Corneli said his company favors a mandatory emissions policy on the federal level. So do environmentalists, who admit that RGGI's 10 percent goal is modest at best.
\
Murdock, of the Nature Conservancy, said RGGI is ""going to do little to get us any sort of reductions in atmospheric concentrations.""
\
Still, she said, ""This is a very good first step, because you're establishing something that hasn't been established before. ... The Nature Conservancy has invested so much time and effort in RGGI because we view it as an incredibly important precedent. We do see it as driving federal action, and federal action is essential.""
\
McCarthy, the DEP commissioner, said she considers RGGI a good model for a national cap-and-trade system, and she worries that Congress may rush ahead with a weak alternative.
\
In her view, no cap-and-trade program by itself can cut emissions as much as scientists believe is necessary to reverse the buildup of greenhouse gases.
\
RGGI, in fact, is just one component of a climate change plan adopted by the state in 2005 that calls for a wide array of measures, most of them voluntary, to reduce emissions. The plan's long-term goal is similar to California's and Europe's: an 80 percent reduction by mid-century.
\
The uncertainty that bedevils scientists and policy-makers alike is whether even that is enough.
\
`Scary' Numbers
\
Once added to the atmosphere, greenhouse gases linger there for many years. Over the past half century, concentrations of CO[subscript 2], the most abundant, have increased about 30 percent, to 380 parts per million, and the average global temperature has increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit. At the current rate of emissions, many climate experts say a rise to 450 parts per million is inevitable, driving temperatures up another degree or two.
\
""When you look at those numbers, it's pretty scary,"" Murdock said. ""If we hit 550 parts per million, that's where people start to talk about the potential for catastrophic changes.""
\
McCarthy said arresting global warming requires a positive vision about energy that so far has eluded policy-makers.
\
""We convince people this is a big issue, but we don't offer them a big solution,"" she said.
\
""It's frustrating for someone like me who's been in the business a long time because what you need to do to address climate change is what you need to do to address every other environmental problem we face. ... It's really getting us to rethink how we live.""
\
Meanwhile, there's RGGI.

I don't know what we should do about making sure that Social Security and Medicare survive, but to say that this is an issue that's too important for the campaign trail is preposterous.
\
But that's the argument Republican Senate candidate Linda McMahon's campaign is making.
\
I want to know what the candidates are saying about these important programs and anything else that comes up - including questions about Richard Blumenthal's military record. The McMahon campaign, however, released a memo Wednesday repeating that Social Security and Medicare are off limits.
\
Apparently, when you are a millionaire CEO, you can decide what the rest of us are allowed to talk about.
\
""Washington's gross partisanship over the years is precisely the reason for the public's broad dissatisfaction with government today,"" McMahon's press secretary, Ed Patru, declared in the memo. ""Voters want Republicans and Democrats to work together to strengthen programs like Medicare and Social Security.""
\
I agree. And I'd like to know what both candidates think. Before I vote. What, for example, are we going to do about having fewer working people to support all the old retired folks?
\
McMahon - who mailed me a voters guide on something called ""cap and trade"" the other day - will comment on every controversial topic from Obamacare to building a mosque near ground zero. But she is mum on Medicare and Social Security. Patru says this is because these topics ""must be divorced from the hyper-partisan environment of the campaign trail, and must necessarily occur in the legislative arena.""
\
I'd argue that more people in Connecticut want to know whether Linda would support a plan to privatize Social Security than care about cap and trade.
\
""This is a campaign. You don't go into a job interview and say part-way through, 'Give me the job and then I will talk about it,' "" Blumenthal spokeswoman Maura Downes told me. ""He believes that it is important for the people of Connecticut to know where he stands on the issues.""
\
Interestingly, one of the themes of the McMahon campaign is that we don't know where Blumenthal stands on some issues and, in fact, we might not really know the real Dick Blumenthal.
\
During a visit to a senior center this week, Blumenthal was pretty clear: he promised to fight all efforts to ""privatize"" Social Security.
\
The McMahon campaign, meanwhile, assures us that she will not ""play games"" with this issue. Certainly she knows that some leaders of her own party were still pushing a Bush-era plan to privative Social Security this year.
\
We need to know how Sen. McMahon would view an idea like that. Before she gets the job.

HARTFORD >> Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has announced he has committed the state to sign onto the Under 2 MOU (memorandum of understanding), a global compact among cities, states and provinces around the world to limit the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), according to a press release from the governor's office.
\
Signatories agree to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels or to limit to two metric tons CO2 equivalent per capita by 2050, the release said. Connecticut's own climate reduction target by law requires emissions reductions of at least 80 percent economy-wide from 2001 levels by 2050, according to the release.
\
Malloy's announcement coincides with the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP 21, which is meeting in Paris this week, the release said.
\
Connecticut expects to achieve its emissions reduction goal through a comprehensive set of policies and programs, consistent with MOU requirements, the release said. The levels are considered necessary to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, such as a significant sea level rise that would inundate coastlines around the world, create prolonged extreme weather, cause mega-droughts and lead to food scarcity.
\
""Connecticut has set an aggressive goal for reducing carbon emissions to combat climate change - and is determined to do so in a manner that improves our environment and air quality while increasing our energy security, building our economy, and creating jobs,"" the release quotes Malloy as saying. ""We are making strong progress on all fronts and our state has emerged as a national leader on climate action.""
\
The governor said climate change is happening whether Connecticut reacts to it or not, according to the release, so the state would be wise to take action to address the challenge in a responsible and thoughtful way, and by working with others who have signed the Under 2 MOU.
\
The state is achieving carbon emissions reductions as a result of a variety of programs and policy commitments, the release said, including:
\
-- climate leadership through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the nation's first market-based, regulatory, cap-and-trade programs to reduce emissions from large fossil fuel-burning plants in the Northeast. Connecticut is a founding member, the release said. Emissions from the power sector in Connecticut declined by 34 percent from 1990 to 2012, the release stated.
\
-- a clear focus on energy efficiency, for which Connecticut has doubled its investment in cost-effective, energy-saving initiatives, according to the release. Lifetime energy savings in 2014 resulted in savings of fuel for heat and power that avoided emissions of 3.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, the release said. That's the same, it said, as removing more than 466,000 cars from the road.
\
-- deployment of renewables supported by innovative financing programs offered by the Connecticut Green Bank, the first institution of its kind in the nation, the release said. The state has seen a ten-fold increase in in-state renewables in the last three years, according to the release. In addition, Connecticut has committed to buying power for the first time from regional wind and solar projects. That saves ratepayers money and puts the state on track to meet the goal of sourcing 20 percent of the state's electricity needs from Class I renewables by 2020, the release said.
\
-- supporting alternatives in transportation, since that sector accounts for about 40 percent of the state's carbon emissions, the release said. Connecticut has been focused on highway improvements to speed traffic flow and reduce congestion; public transit projects; and encouraging the prevalence of electric vehicles, the release said.
\
Connecticut joins New Hampshire, California, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington as an American state to sign the agreement, according to the release. The Under 2 MOU has now been signed or endorsed by 65 jurisdictions representing 20 countries and five continents, collectively representing 588 million people, the release said.

It wasn't really about winning, anyway. So nobody's crying over the Friday defeat of a Senate bill to counter global warming. Not even Sen. Joe Lieberman, whose name was on it.
\
The bill to slash industrial carbon emissions - a massive and deep-reaching piece of legislation known as the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act - was the 2008 shot at doing something about the climate warming trend. As expected, it burned out.
\
But the politics is in the details, and in its parliamentary demise, this bill may have set up what the governmental fix is going to look like when there's a president in office who might actually sign it.
\
""It may be a small step for mankind,"" said Lieberman, ""but it's a giant step for the United States Senate.""
\
There were some significant firsts. This is the first major climate bill that made it out of committee and into a Senate floor debate - even if it was cut short by partisan sniping. And the registered support of 54 senators marks the first time that most of the Senate was willing to get behind such a measure (including both presidential contenders Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama).
\
""We know we're going to have a president who is supportive of doing something,"" said Jessie Stratton, deputy director of Environment Northeast, a nonprofit advocacy group, who had come to Washington from Connecticut to meet with Lieberman's staff on the bill.
\
She wasn't terribly disappointed after the Friday morning vote came up short; she and other environmentalists were already putting their hopes into next year and the possibility of even stronger legislation. ""We'd like to see something that's a far better bill,"" she said - especially beefing up the bill's focus on energy-efficiency improvements.
\
Lexi Shultz, deputy director of the climate program for the Union of Concerned Scientists, agreed. More work on efficiency is needed, she said, and on renewable energy (natural resources like sun and wind that won't run out).
\
""It's clear that we couldn't have gotten the bill enacted,"" she said. President Bush has routinely opposed the idea of a cap-and-trade system for ""greenhouse gas"" emissions in which companies would buy and trade emission credits. And it was never thought likely to get through both chambers of Congress, anyway. But, Shultz said, ""a hundred senators got more serious about looking at climate solutions than they ever had before.""
\
As she and others lobbied those senators, none seemed to deny that global warming is real, she said. So, when the senators showed up on the chamber floor early Friday to announce their ayes and nays, the subsequent failure struck her as success. ""This vote was about getting to the details.""
\
The vote that killed the bill was a cloture vote, a procedural step that would have required 60 senators to vote in favor if debate on the bill were to continue. The vote went 48-36, but the yes side actually had 54. (Some didn't show up for what was an inevitable loss.)
\
The arguments against the bill were vigorous - and a sample of what will emerge again next year. First, the Republican opposition argued, the bill sets up a potentially enormous new bureaucracy with authority over trillions of dollars. Second, it slams industry with major costs. Third, companies will choose to move out of the country rather than comply, because the unilateral move won't be matched in other markets. And finally, many opponents argued that it wouldn't work, that its goals just aren't possible.
\
Lieberman and the bill's other major boosters, Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and John Warner, R-Va., spent months to convince their 54 senators. ""It was worth it,"" Lieberman said. ""The global-warming crisis wasn't created in a day, and it's not going to be solved in a day.""
\
While this national debate boiled, Connecticut's governor actually signed the state's own emission-capping program into law this week - an even stronger measure than the failed federal bill. It's uncertain how a future federal law could interact with the state's rules, or whether it might even replace them. But for now, Gov. M. Jodi Rell termed it: ""leading the way for the rest of the nation.""
\
The last time Lieberman was defending climate legislation in the Senate, it was the similar McCain-Lieberman bill in 2005, which pulled in 38 votes. Lieberman said this week's debate ""sets the table for next year."" He hopes to see the question return to the Senate by the spring.
\
Until then, he wants the polluting industrial facilities to admit where the movement is going. ""This should say to them that global-warming legislation is going to be adopted, probably next year."" They have to decide, he said: keep trying to fight it, or pitch in on a solution.
\
Though he saw his bill struck down by party wrangling, the Connecticut senator seemed to be in a jovial mood Friday. ""Fifty-four senators agreed the globe is warming,"" he said. ""On balance, it gets our country off to a start.""

Large electric utilities are obstructing a 2-year-old plan by Connecticut and eight other states to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, environmental groups who helped formulate the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative charge. Governors from Delaware to Maine initiated the plan, which they intended on finishing by April. Negotiations continued past a self-imposed August deadline into November as power plant owners, state officials, and 27 environmental groups continue to debate details.
\
Representatives from the power generation industry contend that the plan would increase the cost of electricity in Connecticut by about 20 percent and would contribute little to solving the global problem.
\
A national rather than regional plan is necessary to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from all sources, they said. Utilities also object to features in the draft report.
\
The Connecticut Business and Industry Association opposes the plan as a measure that would increase energy prices and the cost of doing business.
\
Eric Brown, associate counsel of the CBIA, said the plan would have no effect on Midwestern power plant pollution and little effect here, while making the state less appealing to prospective industries.
\
Christopher Phelps, legislative advocate for the Conn-PIRG environmental group, said plant owners NRG and Dominion are holding up the process.
\
""It's outrageous. States have come up with a plan that's doable to reduce emissions in a smart, cost-effective way,"" he said.
\
Carbon dioxide emissions do need to be reduced, said Caroline Angoorly, vice president for environment and new business at NRG Inc. in Princeton, N.J.
\
""NRG supports a national carbon dioxide program. The problem with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is that it's setting up 'Balkanization.' Cap and trade would increase the price of power and encourage importation of power from other plants,"" she said.
\
Under the proposed plan, carbon dioxide emissions would be allowed to increase by 4.5 percent. Levels would then be frozen and reduced by 10 percent by 2020.
\
Power plants in the nine states produce about 150 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, including 9 million tons in Connecticut.
\
Under the ""cap and trade"" plan power plants would be receive ""credits"" for the carbon dioxide they emit. Those that lowered emissions would be able to sell the credits to other plants and use the revenue to invest in cleaner and more efficient technology.
\
Phelps said plant owners are delaying the plan while attempting to insert loopholes that would allow them to claim reductions that were never carried out.
\
One bone of contention is whether the plants would be given or sold the carbon dioxide credits or allowances, Phelps said. The draft plan calls for giving away 75 percent of the credits, while ConnPIRG wants at least 50 percent of the credits to be sold or auctioned.
\
Phelps said the plan must also be strengthened to prevent utilities from attaining reduction goals and then selling credits by importing electricity from ""dirty"" out-of-state plants. The emission reductions would be bogus and encourage greater pollution in other states, he said.
\
Angie O'Connor, president of the New England Power Generators Association in Boston, said the amount of carbon dioxide eliminated by the greenhouse gas initiative would be ""so miniscule I'm not sure it could be measured.""
\
The initiative would also suppress interest in building new generating plants, she said. ""Where is the environmental benefit? Is there a real, sound benefit to these nine states?"" she said.
\
Phelps said, ""Now is the time for the states to reject the industry lobbying, roll up their sleeves, and tackle the problem of global warming head-on.""

13," Yale welcomed Sir Nicholas Stern, the British economist whose team offered an urgent warning last fall on the worldwide economic impact of climate change, and then gave him a good grilling Thursday.\ A panel of top economists questioned many of the assumptions loaded into the economic models used by Stern's team. But the overriding response was that the climate science behind the report is sound, that the world must act, and that the solutions will require raising the price of carbon -- the element at the center of the global warming dilemma.\ ""The review provides enough information to make an economic case for immediate action,"" Wesleyan economics Professor Gary Yohe said.\ ""This is now a chronic disease our planet has,"" said J. Gustave Speth, dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, who wrapped up the morning half of the discussion. ""And we will be dealing with it for a long time.""\ The Stern Review, commissioned by the British government and presented last October, warned that climate change ""will affect the basic elements of life for people around the world -- access to water, food production, health and the environment. Hundreds of millions of people could suffer hunger, water shortages and coastal flooding as the world warms.""\ The costs of climate change will be great, the report concludes, but the cost of dealing with the problem is manageable if we begin to act now.\ Stern, head of Britain's government economic services and a former chief economist at the World Bank, advised the audience of a few hundred students, faculty and interested citizens gathered for the daylong symposium Thursday not to take his report's models ""too literally.""\ ""On the whole, the models are conservative,"" he said. ""And I believe the damage will likely be greater"" than predicted. ""The case for the urgency of action is very powerful.""\ The review's benchmark goal is to stabilize carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at about twice the level that existed in the pre- industrial age. Scientists generally agree that the accumulation of CO2 and other ""greenhouse"" gases in the atmosphere is warming the earth.\ A U.N.-sponsored panel concluded earlier this month that it is ""very likely"" that human activity -- principally the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal -- is a primary cause of the problem. Global warming is predicted to lead to rising sea levels as a result of melting ice sheets, increased flooding and droughts, greater storm intensity and possibly other shifts in climate patterns.\ Figuring out what it will cost to cut emissions enough to meet Stern's goal -- and whether that goal is worth meeting -- involves some complicated calculations of costs vs. benefits.\ The Stern Review predicts that the risks from climate change could cost from 5 percent to 20 percent of global gross domestic product if no action is taken. But the report contends the cost of combating the problem can be limited to about 1 percent of GDP.\ Yale economics Professor William Nordhaus argued that the review overstates the case for urgent action and criticized Stern for failing to subject the report to peer review, a practice he said is ""fundamental to good science and sound economics.""\ He and the other panelists proceeded to offer such a review in public, their critiques tightly woven with the language of economic theory and modeling. Nordhaus criticized key factors used in the review's modeling, which he said led him to question the costs of damage from climate change and the efforts to abate it.\ He said most economists agree that the science behind global warming is sound, and that the issue needs to be addressed, almost certainly by raising the market price of carbon.\ In other words, put a price on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions that will begin to reflect their environmental impact. One way to do that is through ""cap and trade"" systems for carbon dioxide emissions similar to the one already in place in Europe and now being organized in Connecticut and several other northeastern states. Such systems put a price on every ton of carbon emissions and allow ""credits"" for these emissions to be traded.\ Contact David K.

When Sen. Joseph Lieberman introduced his America's Climate Security Act on Thursday, many called it the most ambitious global warming initiative in U.S. history.
\
And that should have made the Connecticut independent a hero to environmentalists.
\
But a number of environmental groups are less than enthusiastic about of one of the most important aspects of the measure.
\
""This is a political concession to coal-burning companies,"" said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch. ""We are not among those gushing about this bill.""
\
Lieberman co-sponsored the measure with Sen. John Warner, R-Va. According to information from Lieberman's office, the legislation would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 63 percent below present levels by 2050 by setting strict limits on the emissions that manufacturers and utilities can release. But a principle feature is a ""cap and trade"" system of pollution allowances that critics say will reward the worst polluters -- coal-fired utility plants -- with billions of dollars in federal giveaways.
\
A large consortium of environmental groups criticized this approach to reducing global warming last month, although members have also praised the legislation's overall goals.
\
""We applaud Sens. Lieberman and Warner for their leadership on global warming,"" Christopher Phelps, program director of Environment Connecticut, said in a prepared statement Thursday. ""Time is running out to stop the worst effects of global warming, and this bill is an important starting point for action.""
\
Lieberman and Warner introduced their bill Thursday with fanfare, releasing 16 pages of documentation about the bill that prominently displayed the praise of backers from both the energy business and environmental groups.
\
Senate observers consider the proposal as a compromise that could get the 60 votes needed to pass, perhaps next year.
\
""It is the tipping point ... a breakthrough,"" said Lieberman, who heads the Senate Environmental and Public Works subcommittee, which will write the final legislation. He also said, ""This bill does what we have to do. It doesn't do everything some would like to do.""
\
Warner, the panel's top Republican, referred to the measure as a ""starting point.""
\
Under cap and trade, the federal government either auctions off or gives away billions of dollars worth of ""pollution allowances,"" or ""credits,"" that can be traded on an open market.
\
In theory, the system uses market incentives to reward companies that quickly and efficiently reduce their emissions. These non-polluting companies make money by selling their credits at a profit to heavier polluters, who need the allowances to compensate for their non-compliance.
\
""This has already worked very effectively in reducing sulfur dioxide emissions [that cause acid rain] from power plants,"" said Dan Lashof, science director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading Washington-based environmental advocacy group deeply involved in the climate debate. ""A cap and trade system for sulfur dioxide passed as a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act. By 2005, sulfur dioxide emissions had been reduced by 35 percent.""
\
For environmental groups, the rub is how the proposed legislation would hand out the billions in pollution credits. The groups are virtually unanimous in their support of an auction system to distribute the credits, which forces major polluters to pay up front to receive the allowances. Coal and gas companies and major manufacturing groups support a giveaway system that allows them to obtain the credits free and then sell them at considerable profit when and if they have met emission standards.
\
The Lieberman-Warner bill -- the subject of lengthy haggling in Washington all summer between environmental and industry lobbyists -- would give away 49 percent of the credits to industry during the measure's first phase.
\
The present version of the bill would give away another 27 percent of the credits to state governments, farmers and forest groups to reward them for meeting greenhouse emission limits of their own. That would leave only 24 percent of the credits to be auctioned on the open market.
\
And that's what has environmental groups and left wing bloggers furious at Lieberman. Environmentalists believe 100 percent of the credits should be auctioned to make polluters pay -- and not profit -- for their emissions.
\
Last month, 15 major environmental groups -- from the National Audubon Society to the Union of Concerned Scientists -- circulated an open letter to U.S. senators that, while it praised the overall goals of the legislation, sharply criticized the pollution credit giveaway to major industries.
\
""Pollution allowances are a public trust,"" the Sept. 14 letter said. ""All allowances should be auctioned or otherwise used to benefit the public, not to generate windfall profits for polluting industries.""
\
After a long summer and early fall negotiating the terms of the climate security legislation, many environmental groups and bloggers are dismayed that almost 50 percent of the pollution credits will be given away.
\
""It's basically the biggest corporate giveaway in history,"" blogger Matt Stoller wrote Wednesday on Open Left, a liberal blog.
\
Stoller cited an analysis by Friends of the Earth that said the coal industry could receive up to $231 billion worth of pollution credits.
\
Daniel J. Weiss, director for climate strategy at the Center for American Progress in Washington, said one problem with handing out free credits to industry is that it slows progress in reaching emissions goals.
\
""The Lieberman-Warner bill is the most serious global warming measure ever considered by Congress,"" Weiss said. ""It's not perfect and of course it is the result of a long process of give and take between the green groups and industry. But all of the environmental groups are very concerned about the giveaways. Forcing the companies to pay good money for these credits would speed innovation because then not meeting the specified goals would be costing them more.""
\
Two prominent state groups -- Environment Connecticut and the Connecticut chapter of The Nature Conservancy -- are also critical of the giveaway provision in the Lieberman-Warner bill. They cite recent experience in Europe. There, billions in pollution credits were given away to industry under the argument that if the companies made money under the cap and trade system, they would have less incentive to pass costs on to consumers in the form of higher electricity rates.
\
""But in Europe, giving away the allowances just ended up causing higher energy costs,"" said David Sutherland, director of government relations for the Connecticut chapter of The Nature Conservancy. ""The giveaway system just ended up being a windfall for the companies.""
\
Washington environmental lobbyists are predicting a long, hard slog in the environmental subcommittee all winter, with most of the arguing being over the distribution of the credits. Even the bill's sponsors agree with this assessment.
\
""This is going to be a long, contentious piece of legislation,"" Warner said.

15,"
State energy officials are proposing to lower the cap on greenhouse gases for the New England and Mid-Atlantic states that participate in a cap-and-trade program for large power plants.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI, works as an agreement among nine Northeast states to set a limit for carbon dioxide emissions coming from power plants of a certain size, which are required to buy allowances for their greenhouse emissions that are sold through periodic auctions.
\
Funds from the auctions go to the states to support renewable energy and efficiency programs. These changes come just a few weeks after President Barack Obama proposed similar measures to both limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and increase support for renewable energy programs nationally.
\
The new rules tightening the Northeast's emissions cap, proposed earlier this week, would lower power plant carbon dioxide emissions from 165 million tons to 91 million tons for 2014. And beyond next year, the cap would drop by 2.5 percent each year until 2020.
\
The cumulative effect of eliminating 86 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions through the regional partnership by the end of the decade is equal to taking 16 million cars off the road for one year, according to the state energy department.
\
""The tighter limits on greenhouse gases will significantly increase the environmental benefits of RGGI over the next decade and help Connecticut meet its obligations under the Global Warming Solutions Act,"" said Mark Lebel, energy fellow for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, an environmental advocacy group.
\
Since they began in September 2008, the auctions for emissions allowances sent about $74 million to Connecticut for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.
\
""These changes should protect electric consumers with reasonable cost limiting provisions while generating additional funding from RGGI auctions for our clean energy and energy efficiency programs,"" Lebel said in a written statement.
\
RGGI, the Northeast cap-and-trade program, was the first in the nation to create a market for carbon emissions and has cut carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent from 2005 to 2012.
\
""Changes in the RGGI program are consistent with President Obama's climate change initiative and its focus on reducing carbon emissions from power plants,"" energy commissioner Dan Esty said in a written statement. ""Connecticut and the RGGI region have taken the lead on this issue and created a model for our nation.""
\
Esty linked the recent increase in severe storms -- like Hurricane Irene and the October snowstorm in 2011 and storm Sandy last year -- with climate change.
\
The proposed changes to the regional program up for comment until Aug. 16, with a public hearing scheduled for Aug. 14 at the headquarters for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in New Britain.

16,"In the annals of Connecticut’s legislative brawls, this one has the makings of tolls 2.0.\The new transportation effort that is grazing the guardrails is the Transportation and Climate Initiative, TCI. It’s a climate change-combatting concept that seeks to replicate through the motor vehicle sector what the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) accomplished through the electric power sector — cutting greenhouse gases and other emissions while raising money to cycle funds back into related climate-change programs. In the case of TCI, it could also cycle funds into the state’s dwindling transportation fund.\TCI is envisioned as a cap-and-invest program for motor vehicles, just like RGGI is for power plants. Both essentially put a price on carbon pollution to incentivize using less of whatever is producing that pollution. In RGGI, for the right to pollute above a set cap that goes down over time, power plant owners buy emission allowances from their states through quarterly auctions. The states get the money, most of which is supposed to be invested in consumer benefits such as energy efficiency programs that help lower energy use further.\Only the broad outlines of TCI exist at this point. Enabling legislation needed to start the process of designing an actual plan, specific for Connecticut, has been hit with pushback rarely seen in Connecticut on matters related to climate change. Normally bi-partisan affairs, this measure made it through the environment committee on a party-line vote. And full-bore PR campaigns by supporters and opponents can make it tough to tell if the two sides are even talking about the same bill.\“Stop the gas tax” is the GOP and fossil fuel-related industries’ high-octane approach — focusing solely on the likelihood that TCI will cause gas prices to increase. It poses an arguably Trumpian-tactic that TCI supporters — who have been working towards this for more than a decade — have had to counter with less headline-grabbing explanations and decidedly lower-key outreach.\“They’re coming after the middle class wallet,” proclaimed Senate Republican Leader Kevin Kelly, R-Stratford, at a kickoff event last month during which the words “climate change” were uttered precisely once — though not by any of the legislators in attendance.\“Any time government puts their hand in our wallet, it’s a tax,” said House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, at the same event.\More News\*\News\New Haven environmental programs get boost through...\*\News\New Haven police investigating homicide on George Street\Staff Report\*\News\Former CT stay-at-home mom launches granola business that...\By Pam McLoughlin\*\News\Donation drive Saturday to benefit West Haven Animal Shelter\*\News\Proposal submitted in West Haven for 140 new apartments,...\By Brian Zahn\*\News\Bradley Airport: Tweed expansion calls for coordination...\By Mark Zaretsky\*\News\New Haven schools are getting $14 million less than...\By Linda Conner Lambeck\*\News\New Haven police identify Bridgeport woman killed in...\By Meghan Friedmann\*\News\New Haven deal on lead in homes would 'change life...\By Mary E. O'Leary\*\News\Yale New Haven Health treating 'staggeringly small'...\By Jordan Fenster\“It’s not a tax. Categorically, it’s not tax,” said James Bradbury, mitigation program director at the Georgetown Climate Center, which has acted as TCI’s facilitator since 2010 when 11 states from Maine to Maryland plus the District of Columbia signed the initial declaration of intent. Republican M. Jodi Rell was governor at the time. Virginia and North Carolina have since joined.\“It’s an environmental program that is first and foremost designed to reduce emissions,” Bradbury said. “It’s convenient for the opposition to call anything they don’t like a tax.”\But proponents have had to wind their way through the reality that gas prices are expected to rise about five cents a gallon when TCI is slated to go into effect in 2023. The increase is capped at nine cents, which has not stopped opponents from seizing on a study by Tufts University — now discounted by some, including the author himself — that gas prices could rise by 38 cents a gallon.\Opponents have also seized on the fact that of the 14 jurisdictions that have been working through the development of TCI, only four — Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia — signed the memorandum in December to move into the final stage, though all the remaining states say they are working toward that. Those three New England states account for three quarters of the region’s motor vehicle emissions.\“You counter it with the facts,” said Charles Rothenberger, climate and energy attorney at Save the Sound. “I think one sign of the desperation of the opposition is that they’re really resorting now to things that are factually untrue. A less-polite person would call them lies.”\Supporters point out that gas prices tend to fluctuate wildly in the best of times due to standard market forces. For instance, they plunged at the start of the pandemic and now have gone back up by almost $1, so five cents due to TCI would be negligible.\“Fundamentally, what this policy is is a cap on pollution that comes out of motor vehicle tailpipes,” Rothenberger said. “It’s that simple.”\Many moving parts\Coupled with plunging natural gas prices, RGGI was extremely successful and has all but eliminated coal and oil power plants in New England and provided billions of dollars to all the participating states, mostly for energy-efficiency measures to help further reduce the need for electricity.\But TCI has more moving parts.\In TCI, the cost of the carbon will be paid by large suppliers of transportation fuels — gasoline and on-road diesel — at the wholesale level. In Connecticut alone, it’s estimated those payments will bring in $89 million in 2023, increasing to as much as $117 million in 2032. Just as ratepayers picked up some of the cost under RGGI, consumers likely will pick up some of it under TCI — the per-gallon price increase. It’s not a tax.\But TCI deals with a more complicated sector than RGGI. Motor vehicles cut across every swath and socio-economic sector of life with impacts that are uneven. For instance, low-income people driving older, less-efficient vehicles would likely get hit harder at the pump, as would rural residents and others who have no public transit options to help defray costs. Wealthier people with newer, more efficient or even electric vehicles would obviously feel it less.\The regional structure for all the states — first released in 2019 — requires that at least 35 percent of each state’s auction proceeds from selling emissions allowancesbe re-invested in those communities and/or to the people that typically suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate change and pollution in addition to those with limited transportation options.\TCI states use that broad structure to tailor the programs to their particular needs. Just a couple of those specific adjustments are in Connecticut’s enabling legislation, including pushing that percentage of the auction proceeds going to the environmental justice community up to 50 percent, with specific language designating it for over-burdened and under-served people and areas — and taking great pains to structure the required equity advisory committee that helps design the state plan to represent as many constituencies as possible.\Katie Dykes, commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, a champion of TCI, has hit the road with Garrett Eucalitto, the state’s deputy commissioner of transportation, to sell the program to skeptical residents and lawmakers.\“It has all the hallmarks of climate programs that have proven successful in our region,” Dykes pointed out. “It’s market-based; it’s regional in scope; it’s ambitious. It’s tackling emissions in a sector that hasn’t been addressed yet. And it’s going to drive billions of dollars in investments in our communities.”\She points out that while climate change mitigation is the goal — since it will lower motor vehicle emissions broadly, by 26 percent — it will also provide public health benefits, potentially helping to lower the stubbornly high incidence of asthma in the state.\Last month, the American Lung Association’s annual “State of the Air” report once again found parts of the state among the most polluted in the country. Motor vehicles have for some time now constituted the largest sector of greenhouse gas emissions in the state and the nation, about 40 percent.\“It is a choice of opponents of this program to ignore those very real impacts and to refuse to propose an alternative solution and to call this a gas tax when in fact this is an incredibly cost-effective solution to address a growing source of emissions in our economy — the transportation sector,” Dykes said.\The opposition to TCIRepublican leaders have piggy-backed on the No Tolls CT campaign that’s still around from that fight, drawn in another piece of legislation to lower emissions standards on medium and heavy-duty trucks and posited their notion of a gas tax also being a food tax, even though there’s no indication such a move would do anything to food prices.\They’ve also gotten support from the conservative Yankee Institute for Public Policy. Similar conservative groups are fighting TCI in most of the partnered states. While the funding for the anti-TCI campaigns is not clear, many of the opposition groups receive money at least indirectly from well-known fossil fuel-supporting funders such as the Koch family.\The Yankee Institute is responsible for anti-TCI ads that have run recently on gas pump screens in service stations.\Ken Girardin, the Institute’s director of policy and research, is making a tax argument, as are other opponents, but with a twist. He’s calling it a new tax, which he said needs to be approved by the general assembly. Under the TCI procedure, the actual plan with the price increase that he calls a tax would not go through the legislature.\If the state’s objective is to get people to use less gasoline and diesel fuel, then government should say that, the way it did with tobacco, he said. “Instead we get these euphemisms, he said. “If you want to tax people to change people’s behavior, at least say ‘We’re going to tax you to change your behavior.’”\He and others also point to RGGI funds that were used to plug budget holes on several occasions as an example of what can go wrong with TCI’s likely similar format.\“It’s another slush fund,” said Michael J. Fox, executive director of the Gasoline and Automotive Service Dealers of America. “I just really find it is — appalling isn’t even enough of a word.”\Calling electric vehicles “good things,” his contention is that a modernized infrastructure and an electric grid to supply it should come first. And to pay for it: “The right way to get revenue is tolls,” he said.\If it’s all about climate, which he doesn’t necessarily agree with, everyone should pay, he said.\“Why are they only doing it through only one industry? If it’s climate, let’s put a 1 percent tax on everything that everybody buys and it goes into a climate fund.”\Candelora, while publicly making charges including “No one in my district is happy about paying another tax under the guise of air pollution control,” and all-but-admitting that the opposition’s gas tax tactic was chosen because it is “a very third-rail item,” was more subdued one-on-one. The differing interpretations between opponents and supporters, he said, is that the intent is to reduce carbon emissions on the front end. But on the back end, folks are looking at the result of how that’s done.\“I think both sides are right,” he said.\He also contended that TCI is not regional because most states haven’t signed on yet. It puts the burden on states like Connecticut to reduce carbon while the other states “can just be reckless,” he said.\The supporters of TCI\TCI supporters have called out such views as misinformation, which some say is being spread with abandon.\Environment committee Co-Chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, and others called the Republican stance frustrating, noting that TCI has always taken a regional approach and has been bipartisan state-to-state all along.\“Connecticut can’t solve for climate change alone,” she said. “Here we have this fantastic strong regional program that is bipartisan, and we’re getting this pushback.”\Sen. Will Haskell, D-Westport, as the youngest member of the senate, has been the voice of young adults. He said student groups he talks to are “shocked that this is controversial.”\“It’s clear to me most of my colleagues believe climate change is a problem. The question is whether they believe we ought to do something about it,” he said. “What we’re up against is a campaign of slogans.”\He said if they have a better program or funding idea, he’s happy to hear it. “The answer cannot simply be ‘no,’” he said.\Don't Miss\The wakeup call that made COVID real for a CT doctor\By mid-March last year, everyone at Yale New Haven Hospital had been talking about the coronavirus.

Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, an Environment Committee member, backing the legislation meant getting assurances that the needs of her sprawling rural district in the Northwest corner, which is almost entirely car-dependent with no public transit to speak of, would be considered.\“This is a tough issue for us in rural areas,” she said. “Your gas prices will go up. We will pay the cost but won’t see those benefits directly.”\She is keen on solutions such as using TCI funds for better broadband — something her district struggles with as well. It would give many residents a way to work from home and avoid their cars all together, at least part of the time.\“We’ve got to acknowledge that this is going to be an increase in gas cost and then weigh that as investment. I think of it as an infrastructure investment.”\In the meantime, a large coalition of supporting groups including environmental and social justice advocates such as Transport Hartford/Center for Latino Progress has been quietly fanning out around the state over the last couple of years, educating those likely to feel most of the impacts and picking up support in some unlikely places. The group has its own social equity coalition and a host of major corporations working through Ceres, which works with investors on multiple sustainability issues.\“The way the opposition wins is by scare tactics,” said Amy McLean, Acadia Center’s Connecticut director. “The way we win is putting together constituencies.”\Among their biggest challenges is that there are almost no examples to show how a TCI concept has worked elsewhere. Except California.\The benefits of California’s program\California has a cap-and-trade program, a slightly different animal than cap-and-invest, like RGGI and TCI. It covers the power and transportation sectors — about 75 percent of emissions overall, although transportation went into effect in 2015, a few years after the power portion. There really hasn’t been time to crunch the transportation data or separate it from the power portion in terms of the emissions impact. The program also started as the San Onofre Nuclear plants shut down, resulting in an emissions increase due to greater use of natural gas at the time.\But Climate-xchange, a research and information group that helps states transition away from fossil fuel, has researched the impacts of California’s cap-and-trade, pointing out that the benefits greatly outweigh the costs in terms of investments. The report also says that TCI states can expect equally robust financial benefits and avoid premature deaths.\The 2020 annual report on California Climate Investments Using Cap-and-Trade Auction Proceeds lists pages of programs that have benefitted, many directly from the transportation sector. California’s experience with how to get those revenues to the folks who need them most is instructive and goes beyond just getting people to buy EVs.\Fact sheets compiled by the Greenlining Institute include giving people money towards emissions repairs for their cars, new or used hybrids or plug-in vehicles, public transit passes worth as much as $4,500, providing hundreds of vanpools for agricultural workers in that state’s large farming areas, setting up community air pollution monitoring systems and planting trees in areas disproportionately impacted by air pollution. The group also developed a Clean Mobility Equity Playbook based on California’s experience.\Dykes will rattle off a laundry list of potential uses of the proceeds from TCI: EV rebates, EV charging systems, electrifying school buses and transit buses, expanding public transportation to rural communities, transit-oriented-development projects, smarter solutions like traffic signals that help reduce idling, bike trails and walking trails to help people get out of their cars, and more robust broadband service so people can stay connected without having to drive to an office if that’s an option.\With the Biden administration likely to provide funding for cleaner transportation, the revenues from TCI could be critical to providing the matching funds that are often needed to get government grants.\Electrifying fleet vehicles is getting some traction from both sides of the aisle. Eucalitto of DOT said fleets tend to have the most miles traveled, and with central charging points, they often don’t require the EV charging infrastructure that personal vehicles do.\“It’s an opportunity to lower costs for businesses,” he said. “Studies have shown when you target those high-mileage fleets, that’s where you get your biggest bang for your buck.”\Eucalitto said he’s been in touch with California officials on their programs as well.\Despite the examples from California, TCI opponents claim that transportation initiatives don’t work and Connecticut won’t meet its goals.\Danny Cullenward essentially says it depends. He is the policy director for CarbonPlan, an independent non-profit climate research organization, an expert in climate policy and carbon markets, in addition to being a lawyer teaching at Stanford.\He admits his views are somewhat oppositional after watching the California program move along. He says the kind of carbon pricing that TCI, like RGGI, is talking about is really pretty low.\“I’m in the camp that says this stuff is way too hard to get right to do anything other than help a little on the margins, which isn’t to say it’s not good,” he said. “These programs aren’t nearly as big as people talk about, but they’re also sometimes pretty good at their modest small scale.\“The fears are overblown. The benefits are typically overblown, too. But they’re there. They’re real. Everything’s just smaller than people make it out to be,” he said.\Cullenward suggests that a lot of the progress should come from local efforts like urban planning, bikeable areas, local zoning, permitting and planning changes that support the large-scale clean and lower carbon transportation policies and goals.\The biggest issue he said is the politics, something Connecticut is seeing first-hand.\“I think in some ways we’ve been emphasizing some of the wrong strategies. This is a good idea,” he said of carbon pricing programs like TCI. “Will the politics be feasible? I don’t know. It’s about the worst political recipe I can come up with. But it’s a good thing if you all get it done.”"

IN the 1970s and early '80s, having seized control of the U.N. apparatus by power of numbers, Third World countries decided to cash in. OPEC was pulling off the greatest wealth transfer from rich to poor in history. Why not them? So, in U.N. declarations and conferences, they began calling for a ""new international economic order."" The essential demand was simple: Transfer wealth from the industrialized West to the Third World in the name of equality, with a dose of post-colonial reparations thrown in.
\
The idea of essentially taxing citizens of democracies to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies went nowhere, thanks mainly to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and the debt crisis of the early 1980s.
\
Such dreams never die, however. The raid on Western treasuries is on again, but with a new rationale to fit current fashion. With socialism dead, the gigantic heist is now proposed as a sacred service of the newest religion, environmentalism.
\
One of the major goals of the Copenhagen climate summit is another shakedown: the transfer of assets from the industrial West to the Third World to save the planet.
\
It's an idea of genius, engaging at every left-wing erogenous zone: rich man's guilt, post-colonial guilt, environmental guilt. But, the idea of shaking down the industrial democracies in the name of the environment thrives not just in Copenhagen.
\
On the day Copenhagen opened, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took jurisdiction over regulation of carbon emissions by declaring they endangered human health.
\
Since we operate an overwhelmingly carbon-based economy, the EPA will affect practically everything. Any institution that emits more than 250 tons of CO2 a year will be in EPA's realm. The EPA proposes regulating emissions only above 25,000 tons, but it has no such authority. Not since the creation of the Internal Revenue Service has a federal agency been given more intrusive power over economic life.
\
This naked assertion of vast executive power in the name of the environment is the perfect fulfillment of the prediction of Czech President Vaclav Klaus, an economist, that environmentalism is becoming the new socialism, i.e., the totemic ideal in the name of which government seizes the commanding heights of the economy and society.
\
Socialism having failed so spectacularly, the left was adrift until it struck upon a brilliant gambit: metamorphosis from red to green. The cultural elites went straight from the memorial service for socialism to the altar of the environment. The objective is the same: highly centralized power given to the new class of experts, managers and technocrats. This time the alleged justification is not abolishing oppression and inequality but saving the planet.
\
Not everyone is pleased. When the Obama administration signaled, in a gesture to Copenhagen, a U.S. commitment to major cuts in carbon emissions, Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., wrote the president protesting that he lacks the authority to do so. It requires congressional concurrence by legislation or treaty.
\
With the Senate blocking President Barack Obama's carbon cap-and-trade legislation, the EPA served as the administration's loud response to Webb: The hell we can't. With the EPA ""endangerment"" finding, we can do as we wish with carbon. Either the Senate passes cap-and-trade, or the EPA can impose draconian measures.
\
Forget the economic effects of severe carbon chastity. There's the matter of constitutional decency. If you want to revolutionize society, you do it through Congress, not by administrative fiat of EPA bureaucrats.
\
Congress should not just resist this executive overreaching, but trump it: Amend existing clean air laws to exclude CO2 from EPA control and to reserve that power for Congress. Do it soon, because Big Brother isn't lurking in CIA cloak. He's knocking on your door, smiling under an EPA cap.

Almost no one is talking about it, but California Gov. Jerry Brown, D, signed a hugely consequential bill this month. The law, SB 32, drastically ramps up the state's landmark climate change law in the world's sixth-largest economy. The world is watching closely: If California's policy appears to be working, it will be copied in states and countries across the globe. Which makes it all the more important for state leaders to get it right.
\
California is well on its way to meeting its first emissions goal, set a decade ago, to cut the state's carbon footprint to 1990 levels by 2020. That transition has been driven in part by traditional, command-and-control environmental regulations and in part by a statewide cap-and-trade system, which makes polluters pay for the emissions they produce. Despite some early doomsaying, this hybrid policy has not smashed the California economy. In fact, the state's economy has grown faster than the rest of the country's in recent years, as have wages. So far, the state's experience appears to show that a major economy can transition off carbon dioxide without destroying its economic prospects.
\
The state's new target, however, is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, which is dramatically more ambitious. The state is doing relatively easy things now. Experts warn that the deeper the cuts go, the harder and more expensive they become. Which means it is all the more important that the flaws in the policy be ironed out in coming years.
\
Though California's approach is multifaceted, it really only requires one major element -- the cap-and-trade system. This policy puts a hard ceiling on statewide carbon dioxide emissions and requires polluters to buy permits to emit greenhouse gases under that cap. The effect is to create a market for pollution credits and a price on carbon dioxide emissions. The price signal nudges companies and consumers to cut waste, invest in cleaner infrastructure, buy products that are friendlier to the environment and develop green technologies. Environmental considerations are now baked into the price of goods and services, which means that market forces, not regulators, determine how to green the economy. The policy is cheaper and more flexible than direct regulation.
\
Other supposedly complementary state policies, such as mandates regarding renewable energy or transportation fuels, are, in fact, superfluous. The cap-and-trade program already sets a statewide emissions limit; additional regulations requiring that the state meet its carbon goals in particular ways are likely to raise costs for little additional benefit. As the state ramps up its ambition, it should rely more on its carbon market than on its carbon mandates.
\
Other states, meanwhile, should do the same. If President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan clears the courts, each state will have to create an emissions-reduction program of some kind. The Obama administration's plan would allow states to band together and create cross-state carbon markets, which would be by far the most efficient approach. The larger the market, the cheaper the policy.
\
California has already merged its carbon trading system with Quebec's. That market should get larger, and soon.

Clean energy advocates looked skeptically at a complicated budget fix that appears to make whole the state's clean energy fund after legislators raided tens of millions from it to fill a budget gap.
\
Next year, the budget transfers to the General Fund $6 million of what would have been allocated to the state's Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority. For the 2015 fiscal year, it takes $19 million.
\
The fund's president, Bryan Garcia, said that legislators fixed the problem and that the fund's operations shouldn't be affected, an outcome that an initial analysis says is probable, depending on how its implemented.
\
""We expect those transfers to be covered,"" Garcia said. ""The final budget reflected the governor's and legislature's commitment to us.""
\
But even with the bright possibility of a fix, environmentalists and representatives from clean energy businesses said at a midday press conference that the raid of the fund gives the wrong message to the renewable energy industry, raising questions about the state's commitment to clean energy.
\
""To prostitute this fund each time the legislature cannot balance its budget is wrong,"" said Michael Trahan, executive director of Solar Connecticut, whose members include solar installers that get about $10 million a year from the fund. ""You can imagine how they feel when they are facing the day when those funds are put into jeopardy.""
\
John Harrity, from the Connecticut Rountable on Climate and Jobs, said: ""It feels like we are robbing our kids' piggy bank -- because they are going to inherit the economy we help, or fail, to grow.""
\
To fix the loss of clean energy funds, legislators gave the state's energy commissioner, Daniel Esty, the discretion to redirect money that the state gets from the region's cap and trade program, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, to the clean energy fund.
\
The cap and trade program works because nine states in the region require that power plants of a certain size buy offsets for their carbon dioxide emissions. Proceeds go to the states to invest in energy efficiency programs and development sources of clean energy.
\
Revenue from the sale of offsets is expected to jump this year as tighter greenhouse gas regulations are put into effect, and depending on that increase, it could cover the funds transferred to the budget, according to William Dornbos, the Connecticut director of Environment Northeast.
\
""It's also a possibility, depending on [Esty's] discretionary authority, that they could get a funding increase if the auction proceeds are on the higher end,"" he said.
\
That said, a ""make whole"" situation relies on a number of positive outcomes: the greenhouse gas auction revenues increasing, and the energy commissioner allocating full funds to the clean energy fund. Environmentalists know this and say they're watching closely.
\
Chris Phelps, campaign director of Environment Connecticut, at a press conference Thursday said that its clear that ""the effort to mitigate the harm is real,"" however unfinished.
\
""The money isn't back in the bank, as it were, and it's dependent on other things happening and other revenue streams,"" he said.
\
And even if the fund switching solves the problem with the clean energy fund, it could come at the expense of utility-run energy efficiency and conservation programs.
\
The discretion for how to distribute the greenhouse gas funds gives Esty the ability to cap that source of funding for the utilities' conservation programs at where it was proposed for this year -- about $5 million, Dornbos said.
\
Complicating the situation, the utilities rely on proceeds from the greenhouse gas auctions to specifically fund efficiency and conservation programs for oil customers, who don't otherwise pay into general ratepayer conservation funds.

can ... incentivize small businesses so that they can grow is to keep money in their pocket,"" is a concise summary of McMahon's conservative fiscal philosophy. ""I think you keep money in the pocket of small businesses and entrepreneurs by reducing the tax burden."" McMahon promotes a conservative economic philosophy. McMahon, who resigned as CEO of WWE to run for the Senate, sees as her top issue ""creating an environment of stability for businesses so that they would know what their taxes are going to be, can they get money, (can they access) working capital to help them with their business and making sure that the rules and regulations aren't just stifling the life out of small businesses.""
\
McMahon has published a jobs plan, which is posted on her campaign website, linda2010.com. Among the proposals are:
\
A--Stopping increases in income tax, capital gains, dividend tax and estate tax rates and reducing corporate tax rates.
\
A--Cutting ""burdensome regulations and mandates on businesses,"" including cap-and-trade, which is intended to reduce carbon emissions, and ""card check,"" which would ease union organizing efforts.
\
A--Increasing energy supplies, including nuclear power, domestic exploration and alternative fuels. ""In order to create jobs too, I think we need to create alternative energy sources,"" she said. ""Wind, solar, geothermal and our fuel cells that we have right here in Connecticut, and nuclear.""
\
A--Controlling government spending with a balanced-budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, an end to off-budget spending, such as Medicare and Social Security, and using unspent bailout and stimulus money to reduce debt.
\
A--Making credit available to small businesses. ""I hear from some businessmen and women and entrepreneurs that they need very much to have working capital and they can't get it from the local bank that they have gotten it from before because the regulations are stricter and tighter at this particular point.""
\
She addressed the standoff in the Senate about extending unemployment benefits by saying, ""I think there are ways to cut to pay for it. ... If we pay down our debt -- we're paying a billion dollars a day in debt service, a billion dollars a day! That's a lot of money just to pay for our debt.
\
""There is some suggestion that ... unspent stimulus money would be used to extend unemployment benefits and that's just using more borrowed money to do it. ... I think there are means to find ways to pay for the extension.""
\
While she couldn't specify the details, she said a proposal by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., was a potential solution.
\
Thune's plan (linked at newhavenregister.com) would pay for extending unemployment benefits by cutting spending by $113 billion and rescinding $38 billion in unobligated stimulus money, among other measures.
\
McMahon said a balanced-budget amendment would be effective in restraining federal spending. ""(If) we have a major catastrophe or a major war, clearly that doesn't come under the balanced budget ... However, I do believe that all the operating costs ought to go into the budget, all entitlement ought to go into the operating budget, and then we should not spend more than we take in.
\
""Now I don't think that can happen overnight. I think that there's a progressive way to have a balanced budget, but I think we should definitely strive for that.""
\
McMahon has advocated increased drilling in environmentally sensitive areas in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Alaska. ""I think the (BP) accident concerns us all, and clearly we want to make sure that we leave that next generation, generation after that, with a clean environment, clean water, clean air. But at the same time, I think we have to look at exploring our natural resources here.""
\
McMahon said, ""I think BP took shortcuts"" but does not agree with a moratorium on deep-water drilling. ""I do believe (Louisiana) Governor Bobby Jindal had the best idea when he said, let's take a breath, reinspect the rigs, make sure that all the safety measures are in place, and when they're recertified and safe, to go forward. Make sure that those shortcuts are not taken.""
\
On the war in Iraq, with a withdrawal of troops under way, McMahon said, ""I do believe we've made a difference in Iraq, and I think at this point we are on a specific withdrawal of our troops. ... So I think that policy's in place and is moving fine.""
\
""It's a difficult job in Afghanistan because we're also trying to change a culture and to give the people of Afghanistan a different way of life in terms of what kind of crops they're growing, etc., so that they can have more of a sustained economy. That can't be accomplished overnight.""
\
McMahon faces an Aug. 10 primary against financial analyst Peter Schiff, who collected enough signatures to get on the ballot, and former U.S. Rep. Rob Simmons, who has suspended his campaign.
\
Last week, Simmons brushed aside rumors that he is considering reviving his campaign.
\
""He's never taken his name off the ballot, so ..."" McMahon said. ""Look, I can only take Rob Simmons at his word. He says he's a man of his word. ... Rob absolutely said that he would abide by the wishes of the convention and that he would not primary. So that's all I know.""

Four years after setting goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, state legislators are debating whether to toughen the law and mandate the cuts.
\
But it's also debatable whether the state - by promoting alternative fuels, greener buildings and greater efficiency - will be able to meet those goals, regardless of any legal requirements.
\
""For a variety of reasons, I think we're going to come up short on the near-term goal"" for emissions reductions, said Paul Farrell, acting chief of staff at the Department of Environmental Protection, who has spent years working on climate issues.
\
""Putting [goals] into statute now doesn't change the fact that there is limited technology to control carbon output,"" he said. ""Most reductions now are through efficiencies.""
\
The legislature's environment committee pushed ahead a bill Friday that would require the state to cut emissions of the gases associated with global warming by 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.
\
Emissions would have to be reduced to at least 80 percent below 2001 levels by 2050. That is in line with the recommendations of a UN panel of scientists who have said drastic changes must be made soon to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.
\
""Connecticut can't stop global warming all by itself, but we can do our fair share,"" said Christopher Phelps, program director for Environment Connecticut, who praised the committee's action. Phelps took a more optimistic view of the goals.
\
""Absolutely, they're very realistic,"" he said. He said the legislation includes several measures that could move the state ahead, including creating a low carbon fuel standard for motor vehicle and home heating fuels and setting limits on emissions from new power plants.
\
Several other states have adopted similar legislation, he said.
\
""By joining other states and adopting global warming pollution caps, Connecticut can help set an example for Congress as it considers federal emissions limits later this year.""
\
The state first set goals for emissions cuts in 2004 and subsequently developed a Climate Change Action Plan to work toward those goals. But despite some successes, the state's effort has begun to falter, Phelps and others said.
\
""There was a strong feeling in the committee that the state is having trouble moving toward the goals,"" Sen. Edward Meyer, D-Guilford, co-chairman of the environment committee. He said the new bill would do more to hold state agencies accountable for reaching the emissions targets.
\
The bill requires agencies to consider the emissions impact of new projects and put a price on carbon dioxide; keep track of progress on cutting emissions; and update regulations and laws to help meet the goals. The measure would require the state to revise the state building code to incorporate more stringent energy standards.
\
Connecticut already has joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a coalition of Northeastern states and Canadian provinces formed to set up a system for controlling emissions from power plants, a key source of greenhouse gases. The states are drawing up regulations for a cap-and-trade system that will enable power producers to buy and sell credits for carbon emissions.
\
Connecticut and several other states have followed California's lead and adopted strict tailpipe emission standards for motor vehicles. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has rejected those standards, and the states are challenging the EPA in court. Farrell said the tougher standards would go a long way toward meeting Connecticut's overall goals.
\
Scientists say that a small rise in average temperatures already has started to alter the climate and that humans have pumped enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to keep pushing the temperature up for decades..
\
The environment committee approved the measure 18-6, Meyer said. He said he expects the measure will be taken up next by the energy committee.
\
Farrell said regardless of the bill's fate, the state is making progress, and ""we'll keep chugging along.""
\
""Climate change is a much, much broader issue, involving all sectors of society,"" he said. ""We're looking at systemic changes in how we live and how we work and how we do business.""

For the first time in the U.S., carbon dioxide goes on sale in September - and the bidding will start at $1.86 a ton.
\
A consortium of 10 states, including Connecticut, said Monday it will hold the first auction of carbon emissions ""allowances"" on Sept. 10, part of a plan to curb greenhouse gases from the region's power plants and slow global warming.
\
Subsequent auctions will be held quarterly, and power plant operators - who until now have been able to emit without paying - will have until the end of 2011 to acquire enough credits to account for all of their CO(-2) emissions.
\
At the same time, the states in the consortium will reduce the amount of emissions allowed. The cap will decline by 10 percent over 10 years, and the number of permits auctioned will shrink.
\
""As the cap comes down, permits become more scarce, and [that] makes clean generation more competitive than dirty generation,"" said Derek Murrow, policy director for Environment Northeast, a nonprofit advocacy group.
\
The exact impact on consumers is unclear - by one estimate, less than 1 percent of the retail price of energy. But money from the auctions will finance other programs to encourage energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy, which in the long run could lessen the impact on residents' pocketbooks.
\
""It's a new model not just for the region but for the nation,"" said state Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Gina McCarthy. ""It's a way we can make greenhouse gas reductions achievable but do it in way that costs are contained, that protects the interests of the consumer.""
\
Power plants are a major source of the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are contributing to global warming. Electricity generation contributed 22 percent of the emissions in Connecticut in 2001, according to the state's latest assessment. That compares to 40 percent from transportation and 19 percent from residential activity.
\
The states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative have agreed to auction off nearly all of the allotment of carbon allowances, totaling about 188 million tons of CO(-2) in the first year.
\
The consortium includes all of New England, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and New York.
\
Murrow said the regional plan ""sets an important precedent for national action."" California has approved a cap-and-trade program but has yet to implement it.
\
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman and Virginia Sen. John Warner have proposed a bill to set up a similar cap-and-trade system nationwide for electricity generation, transportation and manufacturing.

23,"A winning plan \to reduce transportation emissions \While it is absolutely necessary to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, a multi-state gasoline tax cap-and-trade system [Oct. 25, Politics, ""Connecticut among states studying regional gas tax""] would be a complicated, ineffective approach. Not only are existing cap and trade programs ineffective at reducing emission, they are adversely impacting low-income people with more pollution and higher energy bills.\A winning plan to reduce transportation emissions will come from careful planning that emphasizes electrifying transportation, powered by renewable energy, increasing investment in public transportation, and making our communities more accessible for biking and walking.\We do not have time to waste on reworking failed market-based policies - we need to get off fossil fuels. Leaving that transition up to a convoluted tax is not going to do it.\Jim Walsh, Washington, D.C.\Going green isn't just\ for the future, it needs \to happen now\People depend on fossil fuels for almost every aspect of their day. Whether it be getting into their car and driving it to work or turning on electrical appliances in the house, the usage of nonrenewable energy resources is at an all-time high.\When burned, fossil fuels emit toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. According to USA Today, 2.57 million pounds of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere every second. Excessive amounts of these hazardous gases are detrimental to the climate, environment and human health. So what can we do before it's too late?\Switching to clean energy is the first step towards a clean planet. Solar and wind energy are among the most common alternatives, are in high demand and are often less expensive. Solar energy traps energy from the sun and converts it to electricity. Solar panels placed on rooftops are designed to produce enough electricity to support a house. Although wind energy is not common for a single house, many communities across the country are switching to wind energy to run entire towns.\Clean and renewable energy is the face of the future, but greater efforts to go green are needed.\Catherine Rowlins, Colchester\Connecticut doesn't \need more \natural gas plants\We don't need any more fossil fuel plants in this state. ISO-New England's approach has shown to favor natural gas power plants over green energy options, claiming this to be the most cost effective way to meet energy demands. And Katie Dykes, DEEP Commissioner and the Connecticut manager for the New England States Commission on Electricity, claims that the proposed plant in Killingly is ""necessary to the region's mission of providing power to residents and moving away from dirtier fuels like coal."" But this appears to fail to factor in the energy we'll have from the massive wind project that is in the works or the rapidly expanding solar industry.\The fossil fuel industry tries to squelch any concern about natural gas because it emits less carbon dioxide compared to coal plants. What they're leaving out is that the multitude of methane leaks from natural gas infrastructure - from extraction, processing, transport, storage and burning - are many times more dangerous to the climate than carbon. More methane going into the atmosphere will amplify the climate crisis we're in, not help solve it.\Governor Lamont should immediately stop the gas plant proposed in Killingly. No other state in New England is building gas plants, and Connecticut doesn't need to either.\We don't have time to wait a few more years to solve the massive problems we face from climate change. For a livable future, we must decarbonize. We must stop building natural gas plants now.\Sandy Henschel, Clinton"

CAMBRDIGE, Mass >> A study released last week concluded that the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has generated $5.7 billion in saved health care costs; the study attempted to quantify the impacts on public health in the Northeast between 2009 and 2014.
\
The study, completed by Abt Associates, states that the initiative, of which Connecticut is a part, has made for better air quality and improved public health in the region, and estimates between 300 and 800 adult deaths were avoided in that five-year span.
\
The RGGI is a cooperative effort between Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont designed to reduce carbon emissions. It's a cap-and-trade program that allows companies to trade credit emissions if their own emissions come in lower than what was allotted to them based on their size. The money gained in trading emissions credits is then used to develop and build on green energy technologies at the companies.
\
""Connecticut's participation in RGGI is clearly a 'win' for efforts to address Climate Change and a 'win' for the health and well-being of this state's residents,"" said Dennis Schain, spokesperson for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ""RGGI was designed to reduce carbon emissions from electric power plants in order to combat Climate Change -- and it has been very successful in accomplishing that goal.""
\
""As the new Abt Associates study documents, however, RGGI is also responsible for significant improvements in public health and reductions in spending on health care needs here in Connecticut and across this region. This is because improvements in power plant efficiency needed to address carbon emissions have also reduced the levels of conventional pollution put into the air that can have serious health impacts,"" Schain added.
\
As a result of the RGGI, the Abt Associates study estimates that 8,200 to 9,900 asthma attacks were prevented, 13,000 to 16,000 respiratory illnesses were not newly acquired, and between 35 and 390 heart attacks were likely avoided.
\
""These results show that carbon trading programs like RGGI provide many benefits,"" says Michelle Manion, Abt senior associate and lead author of the study in a press release Wednesday. ""RGGI is saving lives, improving health and increasing productivity in the Northeast.""
\
At the state level, the study shows that an estimated 421 asthma attacks were avoided in Connecticut during the period surveyed, and between 15 and 34 lives spared.
\
The study also states that the benefits of the RGGI have not just been experienced by the participating states, but that neighboring states like Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia, have also benefited from the measure.
\
""This study shows how a regional approach to greenhouse gas reduction is helping families and communities,"" said Christopher Spera, vice president for US Health at Abt Associates, in the company's release about the study. ""Behind the numbers are real people who aren't suffering from illness or premature deaths and are now enjoying an improved quality of life.""
\
More than $3 billion has been invested in green energy as a result of the initiative, the study notes. The purpose of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of the initiative, according to the executive summary.

REPUBLICANS are now clearly distinguished by their driving desire to lose. Every faction seems determined to rule the kingdom of irrelevance. Witness the reaction to the National Council for a New America, a ""listening tour"" by Republican officials kicked off at a pizza parlor in Northern Virginia. Social conservatives attacked this forum on education and the economy for the offense of not being a forum on abortion and the ""traditional"" family. Neo-Reaganites searched the transcript for nonexistent slights: How dare former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticize ""nostalgia"" for the ""good old days?"" Why didn't he just spit on President Ronald Reagan's grave? Other conservatives criticized the very idea of a listening tour, asking, ""What's to hear?""
\
Bush described himself as ""dumbfounded by the reaction."" He added: ""I don't think listening is a weakness. People are yearning to be heard. Perhaps we should begin with a little humility.""
\
There is much for Republicans to be humble about.
\
The party, says Bush, faces ""dramatically changing demographics, especially Hispanics in swing states,"" the ""alienation of young voters"" and a drop in support among college graduates.
\
""Trying to be all things to all people isn't going to work,"" Bush contends. The goal is ""not to redefine our beliefs, but to recognize challenges and adapt,"" particularly on national security, health care, education, the economy and the environment. Republicans need to ""focus on creating policies relevant to today -- not things relevant 20, 30 or 40 years ago.""
\
Bush insists a focus on creative policy can be unifying because ""conservatives have more in common than they disagree on.""
\
The Republican Party has been unified in opposition to President Barack Obama's continued accumulation of federal debt and power. On other issues, it seems Republicans are likely to pass through a series of wrenching debates before they arrive at ""policies relevant to today.""
\
Take the environment. For many Americans, concern about carbon emissions and climate disruption is no longer a conviction; it is a value. It is possible that skeptics -- the dominant Republican voices -- have uncovered a vast scientific delusion, like belief in phrenology. Given compelling evidence from glaciology, botany and marine biology, it seems unlikely.
\
Republicans have contributions to make on climate policy. They might support a carbon tax instead of a cap-and-trade system. They should insist that all revenues gained from a carbon tax or the sale of pollution permits go back to the people as lower taxes. But the main policy choice is binary: Should a cost be imposed on carbon emissions? If Republicans generally say no, they will not be viewed as an environmental party.
\
A similar argument can be made concerning health care. Obama's plan, in its nascent form, seems deeply flawed -- pushing workers toward a system resembling Medicare. Republicans have long supported alternatives that subsidize individual private health insurance. But these generally have been incremental, poorly explained and largely ignored.
\
A credible Republican alternative would employ a more generous refundable tax credit that enables the working poor to purchase basic health insurance. This is perhaps the only real alternative to socialization of health care. It is also costly.
\
Or, consider immigration. Immigrants hold diverse political views, but they make a determination about parties and politicians: Do they welcome us? The answer from Republicans often has been equivocal. Some of this is a matter of tone. But it is difficult to imagine a remedy to this impression of resentment without Republican support for immigration reform that includes legal status for temporary workers and a realistic path to citizenship.
\
Carbon restrictions, universal health insurance and immigration reform could eventually be important to the Republican recovery. But would a candidate carrying these ideas transform the Republican Party, or be destroyed by it? The hostile reaction to the pizza parlor putsch provides one answer.
\
This is a snapshot, not a prophecy. As the years pass, the kingdom of irrelevance seems less and less pleasant, even to its rulers. Policy shifts that seem incredible become inevitable. This is how a party prepares to win.

Gina McCarthy, the state's environmental protection commissioner, has been nominated for a major position in Washington handling climate change.
\
McCarthy's would be the first departure of a Connecticut official for the Obama administration, and because she has worked for two Republican governors - Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut - her nomination is considered an important bipartisan choice made by the new president.
\
The DEP chief has been nominated to be assistant administrator for air and radiation at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, where one of her principal responsibilities will be coordinating climate change policy with individual states and other nations.
\
The White House announced McCarthy's nomination, and three others for key posts in the administration, on Thursday.
\
President Barack Obama has vowed to make climate change one of the most important policy initiatives of his presidency. McCarthy, a proponent of aggressive steps to reduce emissions contributing to global warming, will be at the center of a major effort to reverse America's environmental direction after almost a decade of lackluster enforcement of clean air rules by the Bush administration.
\
McCarthy earned high visibility as Connecticut's environmental commissioner for her ""No Child Left Inside"" campaign, urging greater use of state parks. She was also credited with leading the effort to promote the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cooperative program in the Northeast to reduce emissions contributing to global warming. That placed her in a strong position to be considered by the Obama administration.
\
Rell recruited McCarthy to run the DEP in 2004 after a much-heralded national search. Before coming to Connecticut, McCarthy worked on the environment in Massachusetts in various capacities at the local and state levels. She was the deputy secretary of operations for the Massachusetts Office of Commonwealth Development, which is a ""super secretariat"" that coordinates the policies and programs of the state's environmental, energy, housing and transportation agencies.
\
""Gina is full of energy and excitement for the global warming issue, and I am excited for her and the Obama administration,"" said Gary Yohe, a Wesleyan University economist who shared the 2007 Nobel Prize with Al Gore for studying and disseminating information about global warming. Yohe has worked with McCarthy on global warming issues Connecticut faces.
\
But Yohe pointed out that global warming initiatives still face considerable opposition in Congress, and that this will be one of McCarthy's toughest challenges.
\
""There are still members of Congress who will exploit every nuance of difference on policy to hold up progress, and who consider 'cap and trade' programs to reduce gas emissions as a tax,"" Yohe said. ""The Senate still doesn't have 60 votes to bring a climate change bill to a vote, and this will be a problem for McCarthy to address.""
\
Rell hailed McCarthy's service to the state.
\
""Her leadership on climate issues is nationally respected,"" Rell said, ""so it comes as no surprise that the Obama administration would reach out to Commissioner McCarthy, a dedicated public servant with tremendous talent and passion. While we certainly would hate to lose her in Connecticut, it is reassuring to know she would be working to preserve and improve the environment for all Americans.""
\
Although enthusiastic about McCarthy's ascendancy to a national role, state environmentalists are concerned about whether Rell can find a replacement of her caliber.
\
""It's really important for Connecticut who Gov. Rell chooses to replace McCarthy,"" said Yohe. ""Whoever succeeds her will be playing a leading role in [the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative], and that's very important for the state.""
\
DEP spokesman Dennis Schain said that McCarthy will continue to work at her state job until the Senate votes on her nomination.

28,"
Scott Pruitt, President-elect Trump's selection to run the Environmental Protection Agency, by all accounts believes that global warming doesn't involve human activity, such as coal burning, driving or deforestation. We should admire his skepticism. After all, for centuries scientists have proposed countless theories, widely accepted at the time, but later proven false. Perhaps he knows some newly discovered facts or explanations that would lead to a plausible theory that humankind isn't the driving factor behind global warming. I look forward to his upcoming congressional confirmation hearings so he might enlighten us.
\
In a nutshell, global warming theory begins with the observation that Earth has a natural supply of ""greenhouse gases."" These capture heat, keeping the planet warm, while allowing sunlight (relative shortwave energy) to reach Earth unimpeded. But, heat from the planet also attempts to re-radiate back into space through multiple atmospheric layers. As radiation moves through the atmosphere on its journey into space, molecules in each layer absorb some portion. Thus, extra molecules of rising carbon dioxide (in our case caused by fossil fuels and deforestation), captivates a bit of radiated energy as it bounces around in one or more of the layers. The more molecules we add and overheat, the less heat that escapes into space, further warming the planet.
\
Nearly every scientific discipline has been viewed at one time or another with varying degrees of skepticism. And why not? Science isn't infallible. Reservation, skepticism and conjecture constitute the heart of any system that advances knowledge. In science this plays out in self-critical assessments or peer reviewed claims, both essential in sustaining its credibility and value as an engine for progress. Yet, once reputable authorities establish a theory, the skeptic needs to offer up sound evidence to debunk it.
\
Trump's transition team refers to Mr. Pruitt as ""an expert in Constitutional law,"" claiming he brings a deep understanding of the impact regulations have on the environment and economy. Pruitt asserts President Obama's Clean Power Plan will shutter coal-fired power plants, thereby increasing electricity costs, and effectively amounts to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, which Congress already rejected. True enough. But supporting his stance on the grounds that the environment will be none-the-worse for it, flies in the face of global warming science.
\
But, it's also true that fields such as philosophy, history -- and even law and political science -- often point to where scientific answers might be found. But unlike law, science adds the necessity for empirical evidence: multiple observations, testing, data, which draw conclusions subject to verification, and the ability to falsify the theory advocated. Unlike law, science discovers, and in so doing expands the body of universal, epistemic relationships -- steering clear of emotion, ideology or politics. And, although science works to conserve established theories, it has a capacity to undergo revision when assumptions and data fail to account for what more cogent, deeper analysis or instrumentation reveals. That being said, not every skeptic has a vote.
\
Those who depend on experts for answers, including elected or appointed officials, should want to know how these specialists justify their claims. Under what conditions do they form hypotheses from small samples of facts to create more encompassing theories? When a scientist reports a year-over-year rise in the Earth's temperature, what links this to the use of fossil fuels or simply some natural phenomenon? What links empirical evidence of one thing to the causation of another? If Mr. Pruitt disagrees with the majority of experts on the causation of climate change, he should enlighten us about what explains the precipitous thawing of our permafrost, the lengthening of the growing season in middle and higher latitudes, the poleward and upward shift of plant and animal ranges, the decline of some plant and animal species, the earlier flowering of trees, emergence of insects, and egg-laying in birds. Environmental science attempts to answer these kinds of questions, which should serve as points of entry to Mr. Pruitt's upcoming testimony.
\
A baseball pitcher needn't study physics to pitch well, and fans will not much care if the physicist explains why the pitcher's fastball works well in the ninth inning. Likewise, politics, law, ethics and other social constructs can reduce to irrelevance the physical part of an undertaking, the slice that science deals with. Politicians simply may not care about the science. But this separation must occur, if through policy we have any chance in slowing down and finally arresting climate change.
\
Pruitt can invoke many good reasons for rejecting scientific-like explanations about global warming. Indeed, we look to science itself to help separate true science from junk science. But, the new administration cannot simply reject the current theory based on nothing more than that it may conflict with a constituency's self-interest or one's sheer lack of understanding. On a more justified level, Pruitt may criticize the science because: (1) reasonably-based competing views or data point in another direction; (2) relevant empirical data cannot be explained by the theory; (3) a model of the phenomenon critical to the theory doesn't account for an apparent feature or complexity; (4) samples may have been inappropriately drawn in support of a necessary hypothesis; (5) there exists a lack of experimental replication; (6) lack of peer review; or (7) the lack of an ability to falsify scientific claims. Skeptics such as Mr. Pruitt who contest the proposition that human activity causes global warming have many places where they might find winnable positions. It remains to be seen whether by any one of these theory-busters Mr. Pruitt can plausibly dispute what has caused an increase in global average surface temperature of about one degree over the past century, or what accounts for a rise in global average sea level, the increase in ocean water temperatures, or the increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events in some regions of the world.
\
The union of scientists, worldwide, look to peer reviewers as an established criterion for judging the integrity of scientific claims. More than 13,000 peer-reviewed articles stand for and about 100 against the proposition that humans cause global warming.
\
The selection of the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must have a developed sense for how science, technology and policy can avert this existential threat to humanity. Before confirming Mr. Pruitt, he must acknowledge that scientific theories backed by established convention serve as the best hope in creating sound policy for saving the planet from environmental catastrophe.

\
ISSUE 1: Get Washington working for Connecticut: Standing up to the special interests to fight for people.
\
There aren't enough people in Washington standing up to the special interests to make sure the interests of the people come first. In tough times like these, people in Connecticut need a fighter in Washington to make Washington work for them. As attorney general, I've taken on the biggest special interests and the toughest opponents - like big tobacco, big energy and insurance companies, big Internet providers - to stand up and make a difference for the people of Connecticut. That's what I'll do as a United States senator.
\
This means standing up for small businesses instead of big Wall Street banks, so that our small businesses can get loans, tax breaks and incentives to save and create jobs. I'll fight to close tax loopholes for big corporations shipping jobs overseas and end the sweetheart deals that allow big drug companies to set prices for drugs in Medicare. And that's where I'll start cutting the budget, because we must reduce spending, but we don't have to do it on the back of senior citizens.
\
ISSUE 2: Made in Connecticut: Strengthening manufacturing, creating jobs.
\
Our workers are among the most talented in the world, but too often corporate profits and global pressures overpower their interests and those of local industry and our manufacturers and small businesses are hurt.
\
My ""Made in Connecticut"" initiative is designed to create jobs and promote industry by making ""Made in Connecticut"" and ""Made in America"" matter more in Washington. It includes ending tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas, combating Chinese currency manipulation that unfairly undermines the value of our products abroad, promoting clean energy and clean energy manufacturing through loans and tax credits and creating partnerships for workforce training. I've also proposed measures to provide immediate, targeted assistance to small businesses, which are the engine of job creation in our state. These include expanded tax cuts and tax credits to promote small business hiring and growth, direct lending and credit-card reform to ensure stable access to funding, and export assistance.
\
Small businesses create jobs. People create jobs. And sometimes their interests are trampled by big corporations and forces they can't fight. I've stood up for them, and taken on those fights - for the workers at Alderman Motors, at Pratt & Whitney and at businesses around our state - to save their jobs. I will take on their fights in Washington, too, so that ""Made in Connecticut"" creates jobs and opportunity in Connecticut.

\
ISSUE 1: Reviving job creation and economic growth.
\
Connecticut's unemployment rate is 9.1 percent, just shy of the national rate of 9.6 percent. Some economists are talking about a ""new normal"" of permanently high unemployment. Home values have plunged and the stock market is lethargic. I reject the notion that a declining standard of living is inevitable. As someone who has created more than 500 jobs in the private sector, I know what will - and what won't - get our economy moving again.
\
Small businesses, which create 70 percent of new jobs, should be incentivized. We must stop impending tax hikes on wages, salaries, capital gains and dividends. We must permanently abolish the death tax. Job-killing regulations, such as card check and cap and trade, cannot be allowed to become law. Expanding energy production, maintaining sound money and repealing unfair regulations and mandates that inhibit growth are also essential. People create jobs, not governments. As we saw with the failed ""stimulus,"" job growth does not come from politicians distributing borrowed money. It comes from empowering men and woman with a vision for their business and a desire to serve customers and reward shareholders.
\
ISSUE 2: Balancing the federal budget.
\
With a $13.5 trillion national debt, restoration of the federal government's solvency will not happen quickly. But there are steps that can be taken immediately. Unspent stimulus funds can be returned. Non-Defense discretionary spending can be restored to the level of fiscal year 2008, before the era of trillion-dollar annual budget deficits. It's time to freeze government hiring and compensation. (USA Today has found that ""the typical federal worker is paid 20 percent more than a private-sector worker in the same occupation."") Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be reformed. Ultimately, we must work to pass a balanced-budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a measure that will permanently end the irresponsible expenditure of money the American people don't have.
\
Our children and grandchildren are burdened with debt for decades to come. Washington must never again be allowed to put career politicians' desire for re-election ahead of the nation's solvency.

ISSUE 1: Remove fiscal drag
\
We need to remove fiscal drag with a full payroll tax (FICA) holiday for employees and employers to allow the private sector to add the 20 million good jobs we desperately need back. This tax cut increases take-home pay by more than 8 percent for people working for a living (which is more than $300 a month if you make $50,000 a year). We lost 8 million jobs in the last two years because sales fell off.
\
Instead of funding the banks and insurance companies with trillions of dollars, we need to stop taking trillions of dollars away from people working for a living, so they can resume normal spending patterns and sales can go back up and create all the jobs we need. I also propose $500 per capita of federal revenue sharing for the state government with no strings attached. That would provide the state of Connecticut with approximately $1.75 billion to help it through its financial crisis.
\
ISSUE 2: Federally funded jobs.
\
I am proposing a federally funded $8-per-hour job for anyone willing and able to work to facilitate the transition from unemployment to private sector employment. Employers don't like to hire the unemployed and my proposal for this type of transition employment has proven successful in Argentina in 2001, where it transitioned more than 1 million people to private-sector employment, and currently in India, where more than 100 million people have participated in the program, and helped India sustain some of the world's highest growth rates.

\
ISSUE 2: Repairing our economy and protecting it in the long term. Stimulus through a payroll-tax holiday for working people and small businesses (Flip The FICA), and requiring banks with more than $1 billion in assets to own 30 percent of every loan they make, for the lifetime of the loan. (This will prevent future mortgage crises.)
\
More about ""Flip The FICA"": Eliminate FICA taxes for employees and employers for incomes less than $100,000, and institute the current FICA tax of 7.65 percent only on additional income exceeding $100,000. This will allow working families to keep 7.65 percent more of their paychecks, which will help them pay their mortgages and spend reasonably. And it will reduce small businesses' payroll expenses by 7.65 percent. These two things in combination will create a tremendous amount of jobs, greatly reduce the rate of foreclosures, greatly reduce the rate of small-business failures, reduce government unemployment payments and get our economy back on track very quickly. Flipping the FICA also will discourage corporations from giving huge bonuses to their top executives, because they would have to pay the same FICA taxes on the bonuses as they used to pay on their lower-income workers' paychecks. And, believe it or not, it's revenue-neutral.

\
ISSUE 1: Creating good-paying American jobs.
\
My top priority has been and will continue to be creating and keeping good, high-paid jobs in our state. To do that, I believe we need to revitalize our manufacturing base and make sure we are making things in America again. American factories need to start humming and American workers need to see the rewards of a hard day's work. We need to make it easier for Connecticut companies to make it here and sell it around the world. America has led the world in every major technological innovation of the last century and that has been a driving force behind our economic growth. We can't afford to cede that ground now to other countries like China and Brazil.
\
I believe this country and this community can continue to lead if we make the decisions now to invest in the industries of the future. That's why I'm working with manufacturing companies right here in East Hartford, Manchester, Barkhamsted and all around my district to ensure that they are able to compete in a global economy, making world-class goods and exporting their goods overseas.
\
ISSUE 2: Middle-class tax relief.
\
I will continue to work hard to pass much-needed tax relief for middle-class Americans who are struggling to make ends meet. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to hold those tax cuts hostage in a deficit-busting scheme to extend $700 billion in Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. We can't afford to borrow money from China to fund tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, tax breaks we've already seen do nothing to create jobs or boost the economy.
\
Here's how my tax cuts would work. Every American family would get a tax break on their income up to $250,000 per year. That means that more than 97 percent of Americans would get a tax break on all of their income. For income exceeding that amount, tax rates would be at or below the rates that existed when President Clinton was in office and when the economy created 23 million jobs. While I have been working with my colleagues to pass tax relief for the middle class, Republicans are once again siding with their billionaire, and big corporation, friends.

\
ISSUE 1: Economy / jobs.
\
Priority one is getting people back to work so they can provide for their families. Washington's solution was the multibillion dollar stimulus bill, which was supposed to create 41,000 jobs here in Connecticut. Instead, only 7,600 jobs were created or saved at a cost to taxpayers of $350,000 per job. The stimulus bill failed to put people back to work because it does not encourage businesses to invest and hire. Government spending is not the solution. It is part of the problem.
\
We need sensible, pro-growth policies that encourage small businesses and private enterprises to invest more and add jobs. I support putting an end to the tax increases and eliminating unnecessary regulations and bureaucratic red-tape that add to the cost of doing business and stifle growth. In addition, we must rein in out-of-control government spending and remove the job-stifling uncertainty caused by the constant threat of new taxes and new regulations and mandates, such as Cap & Trade, and the union card check. We also need to repeal the onerous reporting mandates imposed on small businesses by the new Obama health care law. I also support tort reform legislation to protect businesses from frivolous lawsuits.
\
ISSUE 2: Government accountability and spending.
\
Congress has lost touch with mainstream America. The agenda it has imposed does not reflect the reality of most Americans, and is failing to boost our economy and help grow our workforce. It seems that party loyalty and a desire to pass partisan bills has trumped the will of the people. Citizens are losing faith in a Congress of career politicians who have mastered backroom deals and tricky maneuvering to push bills through before they are even reviewed and read.
\
I've listened to many people who are fuming over Washington forcing them to subsidize the irresponsible behavior of those rescued in bailouts. Responsible individuals and businesses work to a budget, and it's time Washington did, too. We need to enact legislation and reforms that establish strict budget caps to limit federal spending, eliminate wasteful programs and reduce the size of government. We should cancel unspent stimulus funds that are putting us further into debt. I will work for more openness and transparency in the legislative process to ensure bills are posted and debated before coming up for a vote, and solutions address the problems. I will also fight for term limits and promise to limit my service to eight years.

\
ISSUE 1: Job growth, upward mobility.
\
With the worst gap between rich and poor since the Great Depression, we must focus on creating job growth and upward mobility. The economic bill of rights proposed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which guarantees a job to anyone who wants one, must rank as our top priority.
\
Government spending must prime the economic pump to create jobs. A massive green jobs program modeled after the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II will put us on the road to economic recovery. We can reverse the slide that sent millions into poverty during the past decade by dedicating billions to creating equal opportunity employment for those who seek work. To help those who have given up after long-term unemployment, $10 an hour government public-works jobs can provide an opportunity to re-enter the workforce. People can move gradually to the private sector. But if they choose to stay in the public arena, so be it. These jobs can help rebuild our decaying infrastructure and our civil society. We can fix roads, bridges, schools, universities and hospitals. Public employees can clean up riverfronts and parks, and, as in the Great Depression, explore careers in arts and culture.
\
ISSUE 2: De-fund the wars.
\
The only way to end the illegal wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan is to de-fund them. The vast military-industrial complex - from the Pentagon to the Central Intelligence Agency to the National Security Agency - must experience a 70 percent cut in defense spending. In the economics of guns and butter (military vs. human resources), more than 50 percent of federal domestic discretionary spending goes to buy missiles, drones, planes, tanks and ships. Less than 15 percent goes to butter: food, education, health care and transit. We need to refocus federal priorities on human needs, and not weapons of war. As the world's largest military, we spend 15 times more on military than our closest rivals, Russia and China. To maintain the manufacturing base, we can transition those industries like Pratt & Whitney and Electric Boat towards peacetime manufacturing like mass transit. Other companies like Blackwater/Xe must face the corporate death penalty. While scaling back the bloated war machine, we should institute a truth and reconciliation commission to shine a light on the various war crimes and illegal black operations that our tax dollars have paid for during the previous decades. Wars only stop when we stop funding them.

ISSUE 1: War.
\
Bring all troops home now from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Haiti, Yemen and everywhere else in the world. Close all military bases. Cut all aid and political ties to apartheid Israel. End all military and military-related spending. Use the money saved toward a massive public-works program designed to combat the climate crisis and make an environmentally healthy and sustainable economy. Billions to care for veterans returning from war.
\
We propose cutting the military budget by 100 percent. In Connecticut, that would equal 17 billion tax dollars. With the $17 billion that Connecticut contributes to the U.S. military budget, we could do all the following at the same time: Put every 4-year-old in a Head Start program; double the number of elementary- and high-school teachers; pay college tuition for every 18- through 22-year-old; power all Connecticut homes with renewable wind-power; raise the state public-transportation budget by 1,000 percent; provide health insurance to every Connecticut resident currently without insurance; give every Connecticut resident older than 65 $2,000 a year to supplement Social Security and retirement; provide a job to every person in Connecticut who is officially unemployed with a wage of $50,000 a year.
\
ISSUE 2: Jobs.
\
The U.S. government has given trillions of dollars of our money to failed banks and corporations. Still, the profiteers will not and cannot release funds to create a single job. In fact, since the bailouts, unemployment has grown. Non-financial companies now sit on $1.8 trillion in cash, roughly one-quarter more than at the beginning of the recession. Giving the wealthy and their institutions more money will not create a single job. Investors now make their profits by forcing the remaining employed to work longer and faster for less pay. Higher unemployment makes it easier to squeeze profits out of workers and smash unions.
\
Only the independent action of masses of working people will force the bosses to end unemployment. We must demand: establish a mass jobs program; create full employment by reducing the work week while increasing pay and spreading out the available work; triple the federal minimum wage.
\
Workers create all the wealth. We have every right to decide how that wealth is used. We say: Place the largest banks, financial institutions, and corporations under public ownership and workers control. Organize workers committees to direct investment and production towards human needs instead of profit.

ISSUE 1: Economy.
\
My No. 1 priority is to help our economy recover and grow. That is why I have worked to create jobs, support small businesses and revitalize our manufacturing sector.
\
I was sent to Washington four years ago during the most trying economic period in a generation, and my primary goal is continuing to repair that damage to our economy, neighborhood by neighborhood. In my two terms in Congress, I have fought to support the priorities of eastern Connecticut: getting critical dredging conducted at our shoreline harbors, increasing jobs at Electric Boat, working to unlock credit for small businesses and supporting tax relief for families. I also have made a priority of restoring our nation's manufacturing base by ensuring that our small- and mid-sized manufacturers have the tools they need to ""make it in America."" And when asked to approve a taxpayer-funded bailout for the same Wall Street firms that recklessly crashed our economy, I voted no because it did not do enough to support struggling families and small businesses.
\
ISSUE 2: ""Make it in America""
\
American innovation and work ethic have long been the backbone of our economy. But the success of American manufacturing should not be just a proud part of our history; it should be a foundation of our economic future. That is why I am fighting for a ""Make it in America"" agenda that supports our manufacturing industry, invests in training new workers in new energy production and other emerging fields, and promotes Connecticut-made goods around the world.
\
I am proud to have helped eastern Connecticut manufacturers reduce costs and preserve jobs by winning critical tariff reductions for companies as part of the Manufacturing Enhancement Act. In addition, I successfully boosted resources to support new manufacturing training programs, ensuring that new graduates will be prepared for manufacturing fields like green energy and medical device production. And, I led two trade missions to find new markets for Connecticut-made goods abroad, helping our manufacturers find new customers and increase the number of jobs here in eastern Connecticut.

\
ISSUE 1: Economy.
\
Getting people back to work in eastern Connecticut is as simple as cutting taxes. Adding burdensome new health-care mandates to our small businesses will only make the problem worse. I support continuing the Bush tax cuts for all income levels. It is wrong to increase taxes on any segment of our country right now. If taxes are increased to people making $200,000/250,000, that affects small business owners. The wealthiest income bracket is still the population most likely to spend in the marketplace and to give dollars to fund charities.
\
I believe we should suspend the federal unemployment tax, which would save all employers $52 per worker, allowing some to make new hires. This would cost roughly $7 billion dollars, which would be paid for from a reduction in improper government payments, which last year totaled $98 billion dollars. I also will push to reduce corporate income tax, particularly for manufacturing companies to encourage them to stay in eastern Connecticut. A manufacturing company grows businesses exponentially, employing powder coaters, sheet-metal fabricators, electricians and others to keep their business going. There are three free-trade agreements waiting for the president's signature. Signing those agreements will increase exports by 1 percent and create 250,000 news jobs.
\
ISSUE 2: Government spending.
\
This year, the government is taking in $2.4 trillion (revenue) and spending $3.7 trillion. How can you spend more than you make and expect to pay down our $13 trillion debt. We need competition: The private sector needs to compete against the public sector for jobs; that will greatly reduce costs. We need to get waste, fraud and abuse out of government before one more dollar of taxpayer money is spent.
\
As the 2nd District's congresswoman, I will vote to stop the runaway spending we have seen in Washington. This is more than just election-year rhetoric with me. It is very personal. As I have traveled around the 2nd District, family after family has told me they, not the government, know best how to spend their hard-earned money. Frequently I am asked what government programs I would cut. First, let me assure you that I will not cut military spending while our country is under threat. I will not vote to cut benefits to our elderly. We have made a social pact for their productive efforts to our society that we must uphold. I will not vote for a cut that hurts my 2nd District. That is my first priority. As to what I would cut, it must be a collective effort. There is plenty of money to be found in the waste that our federal government has created.
\
The political will to make the needed and necessary cuts does not exist with the current Washington insiders. We must first change the culture if we are to have meaningful spending controls. Finally, I support returning the unspent stimulus money to the treasury, immediately. That single step will have a huge impact.

\
ISSUE 1: Full employment.
\
In 2009 alone, the United States lost 10 million jobs, and 62,000 U.S. companies closed their doors. Including part-time workers and citizens who've given up looking for work, national unemployment is close to 19 percent. We are not only a debtor nation (a $120 trillion deficit, including future obligations), but Congress encourages individual debt ($14 trillion), enhancing consumer indices and suggesting economic growth no longer sustainable. Small businesses are engines of job growth (generating 70 percent of U.S. jobs) and the big projects once requiring big centralized government (e.g. the interstate highway system) are largely behind us. Long periods of frenetic growth fueled by cheap foreign oil (kept below market value by U.S. militarism) are infeasible as supplies of oil diminish.
\
To create jobs, we must regionalize our food and energy production, which will produce jobs, increase efficiency, reduce dependence on fossil fuels and break up six big banks that control 65 percent of our GDP, favoring instead smaller local banks. As in 2008, I again propose aggressive job creation via alternative/renewable energy production (a New Green Deal); ""Green Corps"" transitional jobs to inexpensively install solar, geothermal and wind power in homes; and sustainable local agriculture. As your congressman, regionalized energy/food and resulting job growth will produce sustainable, resilient economies around zero-waste manufacturing, independent-locally owned retail, multiple sources of community and municipal capital (for property-tax reduction), green building, mass transit and redesign/repair of our dilapidated infrastructure.
\
ISSUE 2: Get out of Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Pakistan now.
\
Cut the bloated military budget by 40 percent. Stop military corporate bailouts at taxpayers' expense.
\
Long after Washington warned that ""overgrown military establishments"" were antithetical to American liberties, another general-turned-president, Dwight Eisenhower, warned of ""the disastrous rise of misplaced power"" from expanding influences of the ""military-industrial complex."" With U.S. military budgets greater than the rest of the world's combined and with 800 U.S. military bases in 130 countries, costing $8,000 per taxpayer per year, those worst fears have been realized, crippling America on a rack of continuous war against oft-exaggerated foes. Over half of U.S. tax dollars and congressional spending since the end of WWII has been spent on militarism (arguably the largest socialist institution on Earth). Defense industries produce nothing useful for society or national trade accounts. Money so spent produces fewer jobs than equivalent spending in other branches of manufacturing, especially green tech. Labor agrees that sustainable jobs multiply when military industrial facilities transition, at least partially, to commercial production of materials which are useful to society (e.g. mass transit, commercial vessels, renewable energy technologies). Congressional military appropriations exceeding national defense needs are earmarks, thefts from single-payer health care, affordable education and renewable alternative energy. They're bailouts and acts of pollution, supporting profligate consumption of foreign oil, discounted below market value at gunpoint.

\
ISSUE 1: Economy
\
Rosa's highest priority in Congress is to help get our economy back on track and make opportunity real for Connecticut families. She knows that we need jobs, American jobs, that will help middle-class families to thrive. Rosa's path is tax cuts for the middle class, tax credits for small businesses to create jobs, access to affordable training and college for our workforce, bringing manufacturing jobs back to Connecticut and supporting the jobs for the future. She recognizes that true economic recovery requires addressing high unemployment and other immediate crises while investing in the infrastructure and green economy that will create jobs in the long term.
\
Rosa wants America to work again. She helped repeal tax breaks for exporting American jobs and changed it, so companies now get breaks to create jobs here. It's the same with small business. Rosa continues to fight to make sure we do not revert back to the practices that created the current economic situation, while ensuring that our government's economic policy benefits the families and businesses of the Third District.
\
ISSUE 2: Small businesses
\
Rosa knows that small businesses are the engine of our economy and a vital component of any meaningful economic recovery. She has worked hard to see they get the tax relief and access to credit they need to recover and thrive, bringing more jobs to our state, including voting for the Small Business Jobs Act, which includes $12 billion in tax cuts, which leverages up to $300 billion in private-sector lending, and which includes state grants.
\
She believes that if we are going to bring about a real, lasting economic recovery, we need to reestablish the conditions for our long-term prosperity and help to create the conditions that enable business to succeed. That is why she introduced the Manufacturing Reinvestment Account Act, which will allow businesses to create a manufacturing reinvestment account into which businesses can make annual contributions of up to $250,000 and hold the money there for five years. These funds could then be used to purchase equipment and facilities or for job training. With 27 million small businesses across the country and 329,618 in Connecticut, it is critical to make smart, targeted investments to help these companies get off the ground and to be successful. Rosa believes that we can we can keep Connecticut the thriving center of manufacturing and industry it has long been known to be.

ISSUE 1: Jobs
\
The government cannot create jobs, nor can it create wealth. The federal government must get out of the way of the entrepreneurs and risk takers that create businesses, hire employees and improve the economy. The federal government has created such a hostile and uncertain business climate in the United States that it is driving businesses and jobs overseas. We must get the federal government off the backs, and out of the pockets, of the small businesses that employ most of the citizens of this country.
\
ISSUE 2: Health care
\
We must repeal the disastrous health-care bill passed earlier this year. Government control of health care will only drive the cost of health care up and the quality down. The individual mandate is unconstitutional and the 1099 mandates for businesses is a job-killing bureaucratic morass that must be repealed.

ISSUE 1: Creating a future of job growth in Connecticut.
\
Connecticut's economy has been slow to come out of this recession and people want leaders who have a positive vision to move the state forward. First, we've got to support good-paying manufacturing jobs. For too long, we've allowed loopholes in our federal Buy American laws that send our tax dollars overseas. Based on ideas I got from manufacturers in the Fifth District, I've passed legislation that will make sure that when the federal government buys something, it looks to American manufacturers first. I've also been a strong supporter of keeping good-paying jobs at Pratt & Whitney's Cheshire plant, working with Governor Rell and the Congressional delegation to keep the plant open. And we need to capitalize on Connecticut's position as a leader in energy-efficient technologies and create green jobs with industry leaders like Fuel Cell Energy in Torrington and Danbury, and newer green energy firms like Arbor Fuel in Farmington.
\
We have the know-how and the workforce to take advantage of these jobs of the future, but the federal government needs to pass energy-reform legislation that will create a domestic demand for renewable energy in order to stimulate the country's small but growing renewable-energy economy.
\
ISSUE 2: Supporting the engine of Connecticut's economy: small businesses.
\
Connecticut's small businesses will drive our economic recovery. When I visit small businesses in the Fifth District, I hear their frustrations with getting access to capital and paying taxes while trying to stay in business. So I just helped pass in Congress a bill to give $12 billion in small business tax cuts and to create a new loan program to keep businesses hiring. These local businesses can't survive without paying customers, so to put money back in the pockets of consumers, the Recovery Act included billions in tax cuts.
\
Finally, the Bush tax cuts are set to expire at the end of this year, and I support extending those tax breaks for middle-class families, but not the wealthiest among us. We can afford to help only those who need it most.

\
ISSUE 1: Increasing jobs and fixing our economy,
\
Federal government policies either can make it easier or harder for the private sector to increase the number of jobs. I believe the current policies being advanced are making it much harder for businesses to grow and prosper. Our representatives in Washington must implement policies that allow businesses to grow, hire and reinvest, especially during tough economic times. Currently, Connecticut's Fifth District has municipalities facing nearly 15 percent unemployment. We need job growth and we need it now. The only time-tested way to ensure meaningful job growth is to rein in federal spending and reduce taxes on families and businesses.
\
ISSUE 2: Repeal or defund the federal takeover of health care.
\
This legislation did little to solve the underlying problems in our health-care system, and instead expanded the costly Medicaid entitlement program, cuts to Medicare and imposed a massive new tax on American families and businesses.
\
It seems that each week we read about more negative unintended consequences of the bill, such as insurance providers declining to offer certain policies for children and seniors and higher health-insurance premiums. I would support alternative solutions to reforming the health-care system that include using tax policy such as tax credits for small businesses to help make health care more affordable and accessible.
\
There is no doubt that we must make reforms to the health-care system, but we must do responsibly and without increasing the size and cost of the federal government.

ISSUE 1: Economy/jobs.
\
Recognizing the persistent poor economy in Connecticut and its high unemployment, the new governor and legislature must pass legislation that seeks to improve Connecticut's economic climate with the goal of attracting new businesses and achieving expansion of our existing businesses.
\
We will need to target our state economic development dollars to industries that are committed to staying in Connecticut and producing new jobs. The strength of Connecticut is an educated workforce and we need to target renewable energy industries and other cutting edge technological industries.
\
ISSUE 2: State budget.
\
Recognizing the $3 billion plus deficit in next year's budget, the challenge for the new governor and legislature will be to craft a budget that makes smart cuts that limit the negative impact on our less fortunate neighbors and maximize job preservation and creation.
\
For instance, I proposed a bill in the 2010 legislative session that sought significant cuts to the Transitional Film Tax Credit Program. This proposal was controversial and opposed at the Capitol by many legislators. Although I did not enjoy proposing this cut, this cut would have saved significant monies and would have had little impact on our struggling neighbors and on permanent jobs in Connecticut.
\
Next year's budget will require similar tough and unpopular cuts, but such cuts will be necessary to achieve an acceptable and reasonable state budget in 2011.

ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
My focus will be to stop the job losses and make Connecticut attractive to business so that our existing businesses will want to stay here and expand in our state and new businesses will want to come here. We need to stop bashing business. Business makes our economy work and we need an environment that allows businesses to prosper. In the last 20 years, Connecticut has had a net loss of jobs.
\
Just recently, United Technologies announced its intention to move certain jobs out of Connecticut because it is too expensive to do business in our state. Our current elected officials have done little to improve Connecticut's competitiveness when it comes to attracting business. CNBC rated Connecticut as 47th in attractiveness to new business development and business retention. Simply put, we are not considered a business-friendly state. Without a strong business base we cannot have a strong economy or job security for our citizens. What matters most to business is the cost of doing business. Business exists to make a profit. That premise is the foundation of our free market system and it is what propelled our country to be the economic envy of the world. If business is profitable, it will invest some of those profits in growth. That growth means new jobs and job security.
\
Total tax burden is a major cost factor to business. It affects bottom line profitability. Other factors such as the regulatory environment are important, too. To summarize, my focus over the next two years, if elected, will be to reduce the cost factors that affect our competitiveness and simplification of the regulatory environment of the state to make us more competitive and attractive to business development and growth.
\
ISSUE 2: The economy.
\
We need to stabilize our economy and then create an environment for recovery and growth. Economic stability, recovery and diversification are essential to job creation and job security. We all know that, but it seems the solution to creation of economic stability and recovery are elusive. Today we are competing in a world economy and Connecticut has failed to compete effectively. We cannot ignore this.
\
Unfortunately, there are too many special interest groups lobbying our elected officials to the detriment of our state. All our attention must be concentrated on fixing the economy and improving the climate for job creation and stability. That will be my focus until we have brought Connecticut back to economic prosperity and security. State regulation must be simplified to make it easier for our existing business to comply and for business startups to begin doing business here.
\
We need to reduce the cost of government and focus on creation of jobs in the private sector. That means reducing the total tax burden in our state so that we will be competitive with the most competitive states such as Texas and Virginia, and with other countries. Connecticut was recently rated as one of the worst states to retire in due to high property taxes and taxes on pensions. Being rated worst is not being competitive. We need to change our status from one of the worst to one of the best places to retire or start a business.

The projected budget crisis provides a unique opportunity to downsize the state government and actually make it more efficient and effective. Downsizing will come from consolidation of state agencies, elimination of duplicate middle management positions and the termination of specific institutions and programs that have proven ineffective. Further, both savings and higher academic achievement will result from a much higher degree of accountability of our schools. The state should not be paying 75 percent of a school system's costs when the graduation rate is only about 40 percent and the proficiency rate is only about 25 percent. Although controversial, I also support the creation of a one-house state legislature with term limits.

ISSUE 1: Growing the economy and creating jobs.
\
We have lost tens of thousands of jobs in Connecticut during this recession, and yet we have done nothing to make our state a better place to do business. We need to improve our business climate by repealing the business entity tax, eliminating unnecessary business regulations and expanding tax credits to those businesses that are hiring. We need to get government out of the way of businesses and entrepreneurs. As a small business owner, I know the difficulties of making payroll, accessing quality health insurance and spending time filling out forms rather than doing business. I have the experience necessary to make Connecticut a place where companies want to stay and grow.
\
ISSUE 2: State spending.
\
Over the last six years, since my opponent has been a state senator, state spending has increased by more than $4.5 billion. That kind of spending is unsustainable even in good times. As a result, Connecticut is the most taxed state in the nation. Now we're facing a $3.5 billion deficit. Connecticut does not have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. We need a state senator who will stand up to special interests and reduce government spending by consolidating state agencies and eliminating waste.

\
ISSUE 1: There is no greater issue than the need to create jobs.
\
We need a proactive strategy to create jobs that includes the following prerequisites:
\
1) Lower energy cost by a minimum of 10 percent in two years and invest in green technologies as required by the energy reform legislation I voted for last session but was vetoed by Gov. Rell.
\
2) Provide small businesses with badly needed capital at an agency where small business is treated as a customer.
\
3) Prioritize state bond investments toward necessary infrastructure projects such as mass transit, roads and bridges, schools, flood control, prisons and state parks.
\
4) Invest in training and re-training at our vo-tech high schools and public colleges in order to maintain a highly skilled workforce to offer, retain and attract employers.
\
A recent study by UMass concluded that a focused, combined investment in infrastructure projects and education in training workers yields the most positive results for both short- and long-term job growth. Connecticut should heed that advice and develop a plan of implementation that includes reducing energy costs, capitalizing small business needs, streamlining regulatory permit processes and investing in workforce training to meet employer labor needs.
\
ISSUE 2: The current fiscal situation demands that state government become leaner and smarter in the delivery of services.
\
Every agency and their myriad of programs should be subjected to value stream mapping in order to discern effective programs and necessary functions from those that are ineffective or unnecessary. Agencies with similar missions should be consolidated and political appointments cut in half. Municipalities must also cut costs and concomitant state subsidies by regionalizing functions such as special education and transportation. Tax credits currently costing hundreds of millions in lost revenue must be subjected to cost/benefit analysis by objective experts like UConn's Center of Economic Analysis. Any current tax credit which yields little or no economic benefit to Connecticut in terms of net job creation should be repealed and the corresponding revenue returned to the state's coffers.
\
Similarly, tax exemptions must endure a similar test. Our state transportation needs should be augmented by establishing EZ Pass tolls, preferably nearest to our borders. A recent study found putting these tolls on Connecticut highways was both safe and feasible. Our roads suffer the wear and tear caused by out-of-state tractor trailers and other vehicles every day, yet we forego millions in revenue that our neighboring states collect.

\
ISSUE 1: Tax relief.
\
We should restructure Connecticut taxes to eliminate the sales and gas taxes and modify the income tax (and business tax) to compensate for the lost revenue. This will allow Connecticut taxpayers to deduct up to another $4 billion on their federal income taxes and save taxpayers as much as $1 billion a year while not impairing state revenues. This will also simplify Connecticut taxes and allow streamlining of the tax collection system because the income tax is the most efficient tax to collect. The result for Connecticut will be lower taxes, more transparent and fair taxes and a competitive advantage for Connecticut merchants who no longer will have to charge sales tax. Imagine no sales tax all year long! And with the hidden gas taxes gone, gas would cost 42 cents less per gallon!
\
ISSUE 2: Job creation.
\
Eliminating sales and gas taxes will stimulate the economy by giving Connecticut a competitive edge with surrounding states. No gas tax means lower gas prices (42 cents less per gallon) that should attract people from surrounding states. No sales tax means lower cost for merchandise that will give Connecticut merchants a competitive advantage with surrounding states. Just like when Massachusetts residents cross their border to purchase merchandise in sales-tax-free New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, residents will be attracted to Connecticut by cheaper gas and sales-tax-free purchases here in Connecticut. This should spark a retail boom here in Connecticut. The expanded retail activity will stimulate job creation.

Working people are the backbone of our state, but we also need to work on attracting more employers to do business in the state. The Jobs Bill that was passed this year does a lot to provide tax credits to small businesses. We need to make sure that when the state is contracting, local businesses have the opportunity to put in a low bid. This will allow us to keep jobs in Connecticut in addition to investing in local business.
\
ISSUE 2: Seniors are another priority of mine.

It is important that we maintain the programs that offer vital services that allow them to live independently. Home care not only saves our state millions in dollars, but it is also more comfortable for our seniors to live at home.

ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
Connecticut has been chasing jobs out of the state for years with high taxes, high costs and excessive regulations. We must reverse this trend. Start by spending less in Hartford. Eliminate unnecessary business mandates. Reduce health care costs on small business by reducing health insurance mandates. Reduce energy costs by increasing the generation of electricity. Foster green technologies, including new nuclear power.
\
We can make Connecticut competitive again, but it will take a change of mindset in Hartford. For too long we have been anti-business, prompting entrepreneurs and investors to go elsewhere. End the business entity tax. Repeal the corporate tax surcharge. Job creators are our friends, not our enemies.
\
ISSUE 2: Budget.
\
The Connecticut budget is a disaster. We are staring at an enormous budget deficit, roughly 20 percent! We spent the rainy day fund. We spent the stimulus money. We borrowed billions and spent that, too. And what did the legislature do since the recession began to ensure our long-term fiscal health? Nothing!
\
Our legislature failed our people. We must get our fiscal house in order immediately! If we fail, there will be no jobs created here, even when the national economy comes back. My prescription: consolidate state agencies, reduce oversight and management, lower benefits for new hires and increase support to non-profits for delivery of services. What not to do: more taxes. We are already No. 1 in per capita tax burden. No more! Higher taxes will only serve to accelerate the exodus of jobs.

\
ISSUE 1: Interventionism.
\
Government is best when it serves as an impartial referee, prosecuting fraud, upholding contracts, employing punitive force to those who have harmed others. But governments mostly act as interested participants, choosing winners and losers. Many individuals, voting blocs, organizations, and corporations have been eager to purchase from government all sorts of favorable legislation that gives them unfair advantage over others. These come in the form of regulations (which more so burden smaller outfits who have greater difficulty affording regulatory compliance and who may desist for fear of imprisonment and large fines for missteps), restrictions, subsidies, tariffs, land grabs, hand-outs and bailouts. This all harms market forces and leads to perverse incentives, moral hazards, increased prices, decreased quality and safety, and scarcity, which harms all of our qualities of life.
\
Free-marketers understand that an important goal is ending the interventionist policies that impoverish us, especially the least well-off of us. It is wealth that enables us to educate ourselves and our children, provide for our health care and safety, nourish ourselves with healthy foods, protect our environment, aid others, and engage in the activities in which we delight.
\
ISSUE 2: Property rights.
\
The Supreme Court ruled that in the public's interest of local economic improvement, it was legal for the government of New London to seize privately owned homes and deliver them to private developers. The court's ruling embraced a broad concept of what constitutes a public use and infringed on the property rights of these unfortunate citizens. People are free to interact with one another through voluntary trade, negotiation, and cooperation, not by infringing on property rights or liberties. In the absence of an incontestable public good, we should not support companies stripping people of their property through government force any more than we should support companies using thugs with axe-handles. Many people make good faith arguments for intervention by government for a perceived public good. They accept any loss of freedoms to the individual who is not harming anyone as an acceptable trade-off, believing that the means are justified by their expected positive ends. Libertarians believe positive ends are not justified nor are even achievable by aggressive means. If we choose not to stick with a narrow and firm definition of true public goods, our property and liberties are always at risk to the whim of the voting majority.

ISSUE 1: ""Stop the Spending.""
\
In pursuing dynamic job growth, I support a program to ""Stop the Spending."" Since 1972, according to the Yankee Institute 2010 report on state spending, the record shows that spending in inflation adjusted dollars has increased by almost 250 percent. As part of this effort, we must stop bonding deficits. Bonding must be used to provide financing for infrastructure. We must eliminate inefficient, ineffective and outdated programs. This latter task will require a top-down review focusing attention on all state government departments, agencies, functions and programs. There should be no exceptions for any function, office or past practice.
\
ISSUE 2: Stop government growth.
\
I support an initiative to stop the growth of state government by freezing all hiring except as may be required by retirement or resignation until the size of government is reduced by 15 percent. Employee reductions reduced by the top-down review process will not be replaced. The reduction of 15 percent should not be viewed as the end point, but rather the first step in creating a leaner and more efficient government working for our citizens.

\
ISSUE 1: Establish a business-friendly environment.
\
There is nothing more important to Connecticut families than getting the state's economy back on track by establishing a more business-friendly environment. Reclaiming Connecticut's prosperity can be achieved by public policy initiatives that support private sector job growth. Protecting jobs must be a priority. Repealing the business entity tax - one example of a mandate that stifles entrepreneurs and drives up business costs - would give needed relief to every business, but especially to small businesses. I recently hosted a Home-Based Business Networking Forum in collaboration with the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development to connect these micro-businesses with the tools and resources they need to grow. As the smallest of small businesses, they are engines of economic activity for our towns and region in challenging economic times.
\
I support requiring that every bill, amendment or resolution before the General Assembly be accompanied by a job impact statement. This job impact statement must disclose the effect of the proposed bill on employment in Connecticut, and include an estimate of the gain or loss of jobs anticipated.
\
ISSUE 2: Reduce size and cost of government.
\
When job losses and foreclosures signal a sharp downturn in many family and personal finances, increasing taxes to pay for an oversized and unaffordable government would hurt more than help our already weak economy. It is critical to reduce the size and cost of government. Government expenditures need to focus on the core functions of public health and safety, transportation and public education. Cuts in state spending should shrink the size and cost of government, not shrink government's commitment to its core functions. Towns should be relieved of excessive state mandates. Municipal mandate relief would save on property taxes and allow towns to find better, more cost effective local solutions.
\
In 1991, the personal income tax was enacted. At the time, the income tax was portrayed as the ""tax to end all taxes."" Since the inception of the personal income tax, however, the size of government has grown 135 percent. With this super-sizing of government comes super-sizing of government operating costs. With greatly diminished revenues, our deficit is a mirror of costs that Connecticut can no longer afford.

\
ISSUE 2: Reduce waste and inefficiency.
\
Reducing waste and inefficiency in state government is absolutely essential if we are to solve our state's budget problem.

This will free up funds to pay for programs and services that help people in our towns.

ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
Connecticut can emerge from this recession with more jobs and a much stronger economic base by aggressively embracing emerging green technologies. Global fossil fuel supplies are not expected to keep pace with rising global demand and prices for oil and natural gas will rise as a consequence. As a nation we need to begin a rapid deployment of clean renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Demand for these technologies is growing rapidly.
\
Connecticut should put in place a package of incentives and actively recruit green-tech manufacturers to our state. Our skilled workforce is capable of building nuclear submarines and advanced jet engines - we can build a windmill, solar panel or fuel cell just as well. This will reinvigorate manufacturing in our state and create thousands of good-paying jobs.
\
ISSUE 2: Lower energy costs.
\
I voted against deregulating our electric system 12 years ago because I knew it would only lead to higher prices for Connecticut consumers and businesses. As predicted, Connecticut now has the highest electric prices in the contiguous 48 states.
\
It's high time the General Assembly stands up to special interests and reins in these costs which strain household budgets and harm our business climate. Legislation I sponsored and worked for this past year would have accomplished this by turning the current Department of Public Utility Control in a real Department of Energy with a mission to reduce costs to consumers and businesses by 15 percent! The new Department of Energy, in addition to protecting consumers, would also be charged with deploying clean energy systems across Connecticut in order to protect our state from long-term electric price shocks, create jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our climate.

ISSUE 1: Jobs:
\
Our next state representative must be concerned with a single goal: Getting Connecticut back to work. The first step is electing leaders who will implement common sense solutions to the problems created by our current political class. Connecticut is ranked dead last in job growth and our legislature has been rated the ""least business-friendly"" in the country. Our state is hemorrhaging jobs. Furthermore, the Democratic supermajority has bungled the state budget so badly that we are staring at a $3.5 billion structural deficit in the next fiscal year - and that's after they levied the largest tax hike in Connecticut history just last year! Compounding the problem is the fact that to get through this election cycle without further raising taxes, the Democrats in Hartford are borrowing money on the state's credit card to cover operating expenses - essentially just to keep on the lights.
\
The cold, hard fact is that our state government is broke. I am asking the voters of Cromwell, Portland and Middletown to join me in sending a message to career politicians that it has to stop.
\
We can spend no more than we make, and we should borrow no more than we can afford to pay back. I promise to bring the citizens of Connecticut the common sense they deserve.

ISSUE 1: Health care.
\
As the chairman of the Select Committee on Aging, my health care priorities are to expand the state's home care program and to eliminate the 6 percent co-pay for the participants in order to help the elderly and disabled remain in their homes instead of nursing homes. This program expansion would translate into a better quality of life for our seniors and also provides a tremendous savings for the state, since home care is approximately one-fifth the cost of a senior residing in a nursing home.
\
Also I want to make sure that nursing homes are economically healthy so these facilities are available for our loved ones. One of my priorities is to expand the state's ConnPACE prescription drug program to help low-income elderly and disabled residents obtain their medication at a discount. This expansion would be accomplished by changing the income guidelines to increase the number of people eligible for the program.
\
ISSUE 2: Tax.
\
I will fight to institute a property tax freeze for seniors. The last property tax freeze program was eliminated in the early 1980s. The tax freeze program would be based on adjusted gross income in order to qualify. The basis for the program is to give seniors the choice to remain in their homes and not be forced to sell because they cannot afford to pay their property tax. The municipalities would be reimbursed by the state for any change in revenue related to the program.

\
ISSUE 1: Resolving the deficit and balancing the budget.
\
The next two years will be very difficult as our state confronts a substantial deficit due to the nationwide recession. As so many of our families have lost jobs or their homes, more are in need of government services like shelter, food and heating assistance. It will be my priority to streamline and consolidate government agencies to make our state more accountable and efficient while preserving the safety net that so many of our families rely on. As House Chair of the Appropriations Human Services subcommittee, I have learned how careful we must be when we make the requisite cuts - it must be carefully done.
\
ISSUE 2: Minimizing education cuts to towns.
\
Both East Hampton and Middletown rely on substantial state education aid because of the school funding formula - any loss to ECS will likely be passed on to local taxpayers in property tax increases or will result in teacher layoffs or increased class sizes. These are both unacceptable options. Our new governor must provide the vision and leadership, as well as the commitment to resources, to tackle education reform, formula funding reform and closing the achievement gap. Connecticut's strength has always been our skilled workforce, and too many of our children are dropping out of school or at risk of school failure. We must do better.

ISSUE 1: State spending - taxes.
\
Connecticut will have a structural deficit of roughly $4 billion in each of the next three fiscal years. It will be the duty of those we elect to office to reverse this deficit.
\
As an elected official, I will work to cut the level of state spending. We should be considering elimination, consolidation and privatization of state services where applicable to reduce our debt.
\
I want to review state unfunded mandates that burden local towns with excessive costs. Long-term liabilities are now more than $60 billion - which is more than 28 percent of the state budget. We must reduce and streamline our bonded debt with a fiscally conservative approach.
\
My ultimate goal is to cut state spending in order lower taxes for individuals and businesses. As a former common council member, I supported budgets that reduced spending and zero increases. I will also support term limits and downsizing the state legislature operating budget, plus binding arbitration laws.
\
ISSUE 2: Jobs.
\
We must bring down the costs of doing business in Connecticut by reducing spending and cutting taxes. We must competitively position our state as a pro-business pro-growth state for existing businesses to flourish and for new and relocating businesses to find us attractive.
\
We must streamline bureaucratic red tape and regulations and have fast tract policies that encourage the free enterprise system to flourish.
\
Regulations that stifle and hamper businesses and excessive taxes on equipment investments are areas that drive business out of Connecticut.

\
ISSUE 1: The need to reduce state spending.
\
In the last six years, the state budget has grown by 35 percent, and taxes have increased across the board to fund the spending spree. The result on all aspects of life in Connecticut has been predictable.
\
Businesses have left the state in droves; more than a hundred thousand good paying jobs have been lost. New initiatives to improve life in Connecticut have been scrapped, as state coffers swung from a surplus to unimaginable deficits. Connecticut's towns have had to raise property taxes to make up for lost state aid, and Hartford's cash-strapped legislature has fallen deaf to the call from every small town for badly needed property tax reform.
\
Connecticut's independent Office of Fiscal Analysis predicts that next year's state budget, which commences on July 1, 2011, is already more than $4 billion short. If we don't reduce spending by that same amount, Hartford will pass along $4 billion in new taxes to balance the budget.
\
Hartford must commit to spending less, not more. No new jobs program, no alternative energy initiative, no educational goal, no transportation plan; none of them can succeed until Connecticut balances its books.
\
ISSUE 2: The need to budget responsibly.
\
No Connecticut household would borrow money to buy groceries, yet for the last two years, Connecticut's legislature has borrowed money to fund basic operating costs. As a result, the state's debt service includes interest on money spent to pay the state's day-to-day bills. For two years in a row, Hartford has deferred contributions to the state pension fund, a fund recently ranked as being the second-largest underfunded state pension in the country. Pension funds require time for contributed funds to grow and mature; the entire actuarial calculation is based upon contributions from year to year. A delay in funding the pension today means it will cost much more to fund tomorrow.
\
These are only some of the examples of how the General Assembly has recklessly ignored economic realities. My view is simple: If we can't afford it, we shouldn't fund it. I'll never vote to borrow money to pay operating costs, defer a scheduled payment until next year, or resort to funding gimmicks that do no more than increase costs in the long run.
\
No budget plan will receive my support unless the money ""in real dollars"" is in hand. In the 2009-2010 budget year, only three of Connecticut's 12 revenue categories met projections. This was not a function of a failing economy; it was the use of inflated revenue projections to balance a budget on paper, only. This kind of sleight-of-hand budgeting must end.

ISSUE 1: State budget.
\
Connecticut faces large deficits in the next two fiscal years due to declining revenue brought on by the recent international financial crisis and recession. To address this, we need to reasonably balance necessary spending with needed cuts and, if necessary, responsible, fair changes to the tax code. Improvements to our tax code should begin with the property tax, which is divisive, regressive, outdated and drives sprawl. We also need to fully enact results-based budgeting in which we rigorously review programs and cut or change those that are not carrying out their missions.
\
Finally, we need to be more efficient and innovative in the way the state delivers services. It is vital that we harness modern technology to make government for accessible and responsive to our residents.
\
ISSUE 2: Economy and jobs.
\
Connecticut should aggressively invest in emerging green and clean energy technology. We must reform our energy policy with the goal of bringing down costs and increasing our use of renewable energy. Connecticut must modernize our transportation system to make the state more attractive to employers. The state should build on federal health care reform to help lower the cost of insurance for employers. We also need to invest in and improve education at all levels so that we have a skilled workforce and can provide opportunity for our children. Squarely addressing the budget problem will also increase confidence within the private sector and help repair the economy.

ISSUE 1: The budget.
\
This word is truly a joke in this state. We do not have a budget, what we have is a line of credit that the current administration seems to think is inexhaustible. If a supermajority cannot even begin to bring the runaway spending under control in four years, then it is clear that they are either incapable of doing so or else do not wish to.
\
Will the solution be easy or comfortable for the people of Connecticut? No, it will mean cutting back on services and projects that we just cannot afford at this time. We will have to establish a budget and then adhere to it until we can afford to do more. We must operate as families in our state have done or else we will bankrupt Connecticut.
\
ISSUE 2: Jobs.
\
Connecticut has become one of the least likely states to attract new business to. We have had an attorney general who, in his zeal to show us that he is for the working class, has overly prosecuted, and persecuted, businesses so much that they have left the state. The House and Senate have also done the same by over taxation and regulation of businesses. We have got to realize that there must be a balance between business and labor. Without business, there is nothing for labor to do and without labor there would be no businesses. Business owners and their investors will always make the lion's share while workers will make a fair wage and have reasonable working conditions. When one takes a job they agree to a compensation for their labor. If the job is not what one likes then remember that this is America, the land of opportunity, go find the job you like or start your own business.

\
I am committed to preserving the state's investment in our local public schools so they continue to be great places to work, learn, and grow. Over the past two years, I have worked extremely hard to ensure Colchester and East Haddam receive our fair share of state education dollars. Our bottom line was more than $34 million in state education funds. In the next two years, I will continue to explore every avenue for additional state and federal funding for local education. I will also work to create jobs to keep highly qualified graduates in Connecticut's workforce, expand after-school and affordable preschool programs, and increase financial aid opportunities to make college affordable to more families.

Too many local families have been hit hard by the recession. I am proud of my work over this past legislative session to create jobs and foster business growth - the winning combination for putting Connecticut back to work.

I want to strengthen Connecticut's long-term competitiveness in the global marketplace, improve workforce training in new technologies, provide tax credits to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses, and lower energy and health care costs for small businesses. It is important to promote smart economic growth that broadens our tax base, but preserves the character of our community.

\
ISSUE 2: Job creation and retention.
\
Connecticut has a reputation as one of the most business-unfriendly states and one with a business unfriendly legislature. Connecticut has lost more younger working people than almost any other state. We must do everything reasonably possible to turn this around - especially for small businesses. Burdensome regulations that make it difficult to start and run businesses and require a lot of state paperwork need to be eased up. Numerous nuisance filings and small taxes should be eliminated and the $250 business entity tax should be repealed. The large fee increases enacted during this past legislative term should be rolled back.

\
Creating and retaining jobs locally needs to be our highest priority. Over the past 22 years, Connecticut has been last in the nation for job creation and in my first two years I have been working to turn that around. I was proud to sponsor Connecticut's landmark 2010 jobs bill, which Gov. Rell signed into law in our district.
\
The law was written to promote innovation and entrepreneurship, provide tax credits to small businesses for each job they create, put people to work immediately in green jobs, and educate, attract and retain young workers. I will continue to focus on solving problems that hurt Connecticut's economy for decades.
\
ISSUE 2: Property taxes.
\
We also need to hold the line on property taxes and electricity rates. One of my proudest achievements was protecting funding for Middletown, Middlefield and Durham's schools. This funding helped keep local property taxes in check, and also prevented teacher layoffs. I also took on the hedge funds and speculators who have been driving the increase in our electricity rates. Bringing electric rates under control will help every senior, family and small business in the state. I am proud that electric rates are actually set to fall 5 percent in January - a small but important first step to rebuilding our middle class.

ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
Connecticut is not a business friendly state and with the highest unemployment rate in decades, we are all paying for it.
\
We must stop the excessive taxation and overregulation that is forcing many businesses to lay off workers, close their doors or move out of state. Facing massive budget deficits, leadership in Hartford looked to businesses to bail them out, passing a 25 percent corporate surcharge last year. That's why it should not come as a surprise that an executive from UTC, Connecticut's largest private employer said ""Anywhere but Connecticut"" when asked where it's low-cost to do business. We must make it easier for business to come and thrive in our state. We should eliminate the business entity tax that discourages new business and continue to streamline the permitting process to make it easier for new business to open their doors.
\
If we continue to look at business to fix our budget deficit, we will continue to force them out of state. It is time to try a different approach by encouraging business to prosper and lead Connecticut out of this budget crisis by giving people jobs.
\
ISSUE 2: State budget.
\
For years state government has mismanaged our budget. Our state government continues to spend and then taxes the citizens to pay for it. During prosperous times when a budget surplus existed, numerous programs were created. During tough economic times, rather than scale back our spending to affordable levels, we borrow and raise taxes to fund an out-of-control budget. During the last two years, the legislature voted to raise taxes by $1.5 billion and borrowed another $2 billion. It is the hard working families and small businesses that end up paying.
\
Since 1988, Connecticut's population has increased a modest 6.8 percent. During that same period, our spending has increased an astonishing 270 percent. That defies common sense.
\
It is time to go back to basics and focus on the core functions of government: education, public safety, infrastructure. We need to identify programs that are not working and eliminate them, identify ways to consolidate government and eliminate fraud and waste.
\
The government we have is unsustainable. It is time to do more with less. We should reevaluate our budget and make sure the citizens of Connecticut finally get what they pay for.

\
Linda McMahon, who with her husband, Vince, built up their wrestling business into a worldwide entertainment force, wants government to give small businesses a chance to grow with fewer taxes and regulations.
\
She wants to take a hard look at the safety of oil-drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but would extend drilling to the Outer Continental Shelf and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
\
And while her World Wrestling Entertainment suspended its drug-testing policy for a decade under a heavy competitive assault by Ted Turner, she is proud of how the industry has evolved and the wellness programs that are now in place.
\
McMahon, 61, of Greenwich, the endorsed Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Christopher J. Dodd, sat down for a wide-ranging interview last week at the opening of her East Haven campaign office. The interview, held before Friday's latest Quinnipiac University Poll showed McMahon trailing Blumenthal 54 percent to 37 percent among likely voters, focused on issues she's faced in her campaign, as well as those, such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that she would face as a senator.
\
""I think the best way that you can ... incentivize small businesses so that they can grow is to keep money in their pocket,"" is a concise summary of McMahon's conservative fiscal philosophy. ""I think you keep money in the pocket of small businesses and entrepreneurs by reducing the tax burden.""
\
As a businesswoman, McMahon promotes a conservative economic philosophy that Republicans have made their standard. In the wake of what is becoming known as the Great Recession, McMahon, who resigned as CEO of WWE to run for the Senate, sees as her top issue ""creating an environment of stability for businesses so that they would know what their taxes are going to be, can they get money, (can they access) working capital to help them with their business and making sure that the rules and regulations aren't just stifling the life out of small businesses.""
\
McMahon has published a jobs plan, which is posted on her campaign website, linda2010.com. Among the proposals are:
\
A--Stopping increases in income tax, capital gains, dividend tax and estate tax rates and reducing corporate tax rates.
\
A--Cutting ""burdensome regulations and mandates on businesses,"" including cap-and-trade, which is intended to reduce carbon emissions, and ""card check,"" which would ease union organizing efforts.
\
A--Increasing energy supplies, including nuclear power, domestic exploration and alternative fuels. ""In order to create jobs too, I think we need to create alternative energy sources,"" she said. ""Wind, solar, geothermal and our fuel cells that we have right here in Connecticut, and nuclear."" Last week she toured the NRG power plant in Middletown.
\
A--Controlling government spending with a balanced-budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, an end to off-budget spending, such as Medicare and Social Security, and using unspent bailout and stimulus money to reduce debt.
\
A--Making credit available to small businesses. ""Some of them (local banks) say, 'I have assets to lend but I don't have people coming through the door because those people, potential borrowers, are just unsettled. They don't know what regulations are coming down, they don't know what taxes, they don't know how this health care bill is going to impact them, so they're hesitant to reach out and to grow.
\
""On the other hand, I hear from some businessmen and women and entrepreneurs that they need very much to have working capital and they can't get it from the local bank that they have gotten it from before because the regulations are stricter and tighter at this particular point.""
\
She addressed the standoff in the Senate about extending unemployment benefits by saying, ""I think there are ways to cut to pay for it. ... If we pay down our debt -- we're paying a billion dollars a day in debt service, a billion dollars a day! That's a lot of money just to pay for our debt.
\
""There is some suggestion that ... unspent stimulus money would be used to extend unemployment benefits and that's just using more borrowed money to do it. ... I think there are means to find ways to pay for the extension.""
\
While she couldn't specify the details, she said a proposal by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., was a potential solution.
\
Thune's plan (linked at newhavenregister.com) would pay for extending unemployment benefits by cutting spending by $113 billion and rescinding $38 billion in unobligated stimulus money, among other measures.
\
McMahon said a balanced-budget amendment would be effective in restraining federal spending. ""(If) we have a major catastrophe or a major war, clearly that doesn't come under the balanced budget ... However, I do believe that all the operating costs ought to go into the budget, all entitlement ought to go into the operating budget, and then we should not spend more than we take in.
\
""Now I don't think that can happen overnight. I think that there's a progressive way to have a balanced budget, but I think we should definitely strive for that.""
\
McMahon has advocated increased drilling in environmentally sensitive areas in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Alaska. ""I think the (BP) accident concerns us all, and clearly we want to make sure that we leave that next generation, generation after that, with a clean environment, clean water, clean air. But at the same time, I think we have to look at exploring our natural resources here.""
\
McMahon said, ""I think BP took shortcuts"" but does not agree with a moratorium on deep-water drilling. ""I do believe (Louisiana) Governor Bobby Jindal had the best idea when he said, let's take a breath, reinspect the rigs, make sure that all the safety measures are in place, and when they're recertified and safe, to go forward. Make sure that those shortcuts are not taken.""
\
On the war in Iraq, with a withdrawal of troops under way, McMahon said, ""I do believe we've made a difference in Iraq, and I think at this point we are on a specific withdrawal of our troops. ... So I think that policy's in place and is moving fine.""
\
She said that with Gen. David Petraeus taking command of the Afghan war, ""President Obama has committed these extra troops, so now lets arm these men and women who are there with the best of everything that we have, protect them, give them everything they need to be victorious in Afghanistan.
\
""It's a difficult job in Afghanistan because we're also trying to change a culture and to give the people of Afghanistan a different way of life in terms of what kind of crops they're growing, etc., so that they can have more of a sustained economy. That can't be accomplished overnight.""
\
McMahon has described WWE as ""a soap opera that entertains millions every week"" in a TV ad. The $1 billion company draws 15 million TV viewers each week. It's also big on pay-per-view, live events, licensing and even movies.
\
But in the 1990s, Turner, who founded CNN and World Championship Wrestling, ""had gone full bore and taking talent from WWE, building up his business. He had the money of Time Warner behind him; it was really full-on competition and ... We were really struggling to stay alive at that point.""
\
So, since they were finding few instances of drug violations, WWE dropped its random drug-testing policy.
\
""I think you have to look at WWE as an entertainment company, no different than Hollywood -- and no other entertainment company, including WCW with Ted Turner, was doing any kind of drug testing. And so it wasn't a level playing field, and they clearly had a strong financial advantage, and so that, combined with the fact that we'd seen a real difference in the men and women, we suspended drug testing. We always maintained the right to test for cause and would do that from time to time. And so that was why we suspended the policy.""
\
She said the death of wrestler Eddie Guerrero, who had a heart condition and a drug-abuse problem, occurred as WWE was considering its new comprehensive wellness policy. Of the new policy, she said, ""The goal is to keep these men and women as healthy as can be.""
\
And as entertainers, she said the wrestlers' performances do not compare to athletes such as baseball and football players who have been found to take steroids.
\
""If you are a superstar in WWE, taking steroids does not enhance your performance. You're not expected to jump higher, throw a ball farther, run faster, so it's not enhancing your performance with WWE.""
\
Last week, a group called Moms Against McMahon came out against McMahon becaue of the culture of WWE, which the group says promotes violence and unhealthy attitudes toward women.
\
McMahon said, ""The content has evolved ... and I'm really happy with the evolution of that content.
\
""If you consider that this is the longest-running episodic weekly program in the history of television, in terms of number of episodes, longer than 'Lassie,' longer than 'Gunsmoke,' and there are over hundreds of thousands of hours in this library. And are there going to be segments that, yeah, you know, you go back and you look at 'em and you go, 'Wow, I'm glad we've evolved with our content today, which is PG.'""
\
Pointing out that professional wrestling started out as ""an itinerant traveling show,"" she said, ""it's not easy to change the culture of an industry. ... If you look back from the mid- to late-'70s to where we are today, it's an incredible accomplishment to have moved content as well as policy and to have grown a company during that time.""
\
McMahon faces an Aug. 10 primary against financial analyst Peter Schiff, who collected enough signatures to get on the ballot, and former U.S. Rep. Rob Simmons, who has suspended his campaign.
\
Last week, Simmons brushed aside rumors that he is considering reviving his campaign.
\
""He's never taken his name off the ballot, so ..."" McMahon said. ""Look, I can only take Rob Simmons at his word. He says he's a man of his word. ... Rob absolutely said that he would abide by the wishes of the convention and that he would not primary. So that's all I know.""

The governor's climate experts will meet with environmentalists to work out a new clean air plan to supersede one that has been gathering dust for about two years.
\
Roger Smith, Connecticut Climate Coordinator, said government agency representatives will sit down with business leaders, environmental groups, academicians and others in the next few days to jump-start the state's Climate Change Action Plan.
\
One goal of the meeting will be to select aspects of the plan to put into action first, and to establish a priority among other ambitious ends, Smith said.
\
Gov. M. Jodi Rell said: ""My proposal will dramatically reduce the harmful emissions that cause global warming, and protect our environment now and in the future.""
\
Clean Water Action, with 11,000 Connecticut members, issued a report recently finding that of 55 policies outlined in the state plan, 14 account for 90 percent of total carbon emission reductions.
\
Out of the top 14, only six are being carried out, said Smith, who also is a campaign director at Clean Water Action in Hartford.
\
""We're doing nothing for energy efficiency, the program to educate homeowners or the incentives to make homes more 'energy tight,'"" he said.
\
""The biggest thing is power plants,"" he said, which account for 25 percent of the carbon reductions in the state climate plan.
\
""The climate plan is not driving actions,"" he said.
\
Laws could be passed to implement the plan, but environments are avoiding a bruising political battle in hopes a mandatory federal climate law is enacted by 2010, Smith said.
\
Otherwise, it does not seem likely that the whole state plan will be adopted, he said.
\
Rell proposed legislation in March to implement the plan, which includes a nine-state regional agreement to cut greenhouse gases.
\
This Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
\
The initiative contains plans to put a lid on carbon emissions from electric plants of greater than 25 megawatts in 2009, followed by a 10 percent reduction by 2014.
\
The restriction would be accompanied by a carbon ""cap-and-trade"" program with which Smith and other environmentalists are already dissatisfied.
\
""As an added benefit under RGGI we will be using the free market to further encourage energy efficiency and energy conservation for the benefit of our current and future generations,"" Rell said when she announced the plan in March.
\
In theory, power plants and other large emitters of carbon dioxide would be required to obtain permits per ton of carbon produced.
\
As they reduce emissions, they could then sell the permits.
\
The unresolved question is whether the permits will be given to the power plants, sold to them or auctioned off.
\
""Connecticut could potentially set a bad precedent if it gives permits away,"" Smith said.
\
The current plan would sell a limited number of permits and then let electric utilities sell them for profit.
\
The costs of buying permits and improving plants could be passed on to consumers.
\
Meanwhile, the simplest way to reduce carbon emissions is conservation and increased efficiency, Smith said.

The 10 states participating in a regional program designed to reduce air polluting emissions voted Tuesday to delay action on new standards until next month.
\
Representatives of Connecticut and the nine other states in The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative met in New York City for an ongoing evaluation of the standards. Dennis Schain, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said that by the end of January, a draft proposal for new standards will be written.
\
Details of how each of the states will achieve the new standards will be developed later, he said.
\
The initiative, a market-based program, was created in 2007. It is commonly known as a cap and trade program, one of the mechanisms available for reducing air pollution in a nation or region while allowing regulated companies some flexibility to meet the standards established.
\
Under such a system, companies are issued credits based on how large they are and what industries they are in. If a company's air pollution emission is below its allotted credits, it can sell the extra credits to other companies.
\
Officials with Environment Northeast, known as ENE, a Maine-based regional organization with offices in Connecticut, are urging state officials to support the lowest possible cap -- 91 million tons -- on greenhouse gas emissions. The new standards would take effect in 2014.
\
Peter Shattuck, director of market initiatives for ENE, said he is encouraged by the delay on new standards.
\
""I don't think that it's an indication of a speed bump in the process,"" Shattuck said. ""It could indicate that it is taking some time to build a consensus around the lowest possible cap.""
\
ENE issued a six-page report Monday that claims emissions in the participating states are on track to fall 45 percent below the current cap level this year, even as electricity prices have dropped 10 percent since the initiative was launched.
\
Schain said retiring or withholding credits not sold in 2012 and 2013 was discussed Tuesday.

\
A group of environmentalists, business leaders and organizations from around the Northeast are urging Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy to improve standards of a regional program designed to reduce emissions that cause air pollution.
\
Connecticut is one of 10 states participating in The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market-based program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. RGGI was created in 2007 and a task force of officials from the participating states are evaluating options for improving the program.
\
Officials with Environment Northeast, or ENE, a regional organization with offices in Connecticut, say that extreme weather across New England and the nation has given the public an increased interest in global warming and the affect it has on climate.
\
RGGI is what is commonly known as a cap and trade program. Under such a system, companies are issued credits based on how large they are and what industries they are in. If a company's air pollution emission comes in below its allotted level under the credits, it has extra credits it may trade with other companies.
\
Juliet Manalan, a spokeswoman for Malloy, said he is ""a strong proponent of RGGI and other northeast initiatives to curb carbon emissions.""
\
She said Malloy is awaiting the completion of a review and analysis of the RGGI caps, and will adopt the appropriate approach at that time.
\
Independent analysis has shown that RGGI's affect on Connecticut's economy has increased the state's net economic output by $189 million and created 1,309 jobs in the state in the first 2 1/2 years of operation, according to ENE officials.

The next two years offer hope that the country can seriously start to tackle the problem of global warming and set in motion the best approach to biofuel development, according to a major environmental activist. Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, at a press conference at Yale University Monday, said the case is building for legislation to cap the carbon emissions associated with global warming.
\
With a Democratic majority in Washington and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., now head of the Environment Committee, Beinecke expected the 111th Congress to put new legislative proposals on the table early on.
\
""We feel we need to develop a cap and trade system that starts reducing carbon very quickly so that we can reach the goal of an 80 percent reduction in our carbon emissions by 2050,"" she said.
\
Beinecke said this will require increased energy efficiency, increased fuel efficiency of cars and a dramatic increase in the amount of solar and wind energy, while the scientific community figures out how to capture carbon from power plants fueled by coal.
\
Beinecke, who was being honored as a Dwight Hall Distinguished Mentor at Yale, said 50 percent of electricity in the U.S. is still generated by coal with more than 100 coal plants on the drawing boards.
\
She said there is a race going on by utilities and the coal companies that the plants be approved before new regulations are developed on carbon capture.
\
""That's a huge problem,"" Beinecke said.
\
Beinecke, who has served on the governing board at Yale and whose family funded the Beinecke Rare Book Library at the university, said the rise of sea level associated with global warming will have a major impact on every country that is heavily populated along its coastal areas.
\
She said the devastation suffered by New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina will become more common as global warming progresses.
\
""People who live in developing countries are particularly vulnerable, particularly those who live in poverty,"" she said.
\
Beinecke said the fact that potential U.S. presidential candidates, from Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., to Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., and Sen. Barak Obama, D-Ill., have already targeted global warming, bodes well for the future.
\
""Everyone is wrestling with it,"" she said.
\
Her organization also has set other goals, including backing intensive research and development on the best biofuel to help replace petroleum products as an energy source.
\
She said there is an investment frenzy to find the best method and she wants to steer that to the most environmentallyfriendly option, which would be switchgrass, rather than corn.

\
Connecticut and the eight other Northeastern states that take part in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) on Thursday announced they have agreed to new standards that will further reduce air polluting emissions.
\
RGGI is a market-based program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that was created in 2007, and Thursday's announcement by the nine states that participate comes after a two-year review of the existing standards and what implementing more stringent measures might mean.
\
""RGGI has been an enormous success in reducing carbon emissions, providing incentives for cleaner power generation, improving air quality, and funding clean energy initiatives -- all at a minimal cost to electric ratepayers,"" said Daniel Esty, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ""The changes in the program put forward today will allow us to continue moving toward a cleaner energy future in a manner that is consistent with the need to keep power cheap, strengthen our economy and grow jobs.""
\
RGGI is what is commonly known as a cap-and-trade program, a term used to describe one of the mechanisms available for reducing air pollution in a nation or region while still allowing regulated companies some flexibility to meet standards that have been established.
\
Under such a system, companies are issued credits based on how large they are and what industries they are in. If a company's air pollution emission comes in below its allotted level under the credits, it has extra credits it may trade with other companies.
\
The changes to the RGGI program include:
\
A reduction of the 2014 regional carbon dioxide budget, ""RGGI cap,"" from 165 million to 91 million tons -- a reduction of 45 percent. The cap would decline 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2020.
\
Not reoffering any unsold carbon dioxide allowances for 2012 or 2013.
\
Requiring regulated entities to acquire and hold allowances equal to at least 50 percent of their emissions in each of the first two years of the three-year compliance period, in addition to demonstrating full compliance at the end of each period.
\
With the creation of the new rules, the participating states will now go back to their respective legislatures and regulatory agencies to implement the changes needed to comply with the program. The state specific changes would take effect Jan. 1, 2014.
\
The changes to the RGGI program are being praised by officials with Environment Northeast, a Maine-based regional organization with offices in Connecticut.
\
""RGGI has demonstrated that emissions can come down rapidly and affordably in the electric sector, and we applaud the states for building on the program's success and committing to further efforts to address one of the main sources contributing to climate change,"" said Daniel Sosland, ENE's president.

Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman laid out a timetable on Sunday for a congressional vote on legislation that would set the first national limits on the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.
\
""My hope is we can bring a bill out of [committee] before the summer recess so that it will be ready for floor action sometime in September,"" Lieberman, an independent, said at a press conference in Hartford intended as a progress report on government efforts to combat global warming.
\
A congressional vote would be a watershed moment in the federal response to global warming.
\
""For the first time there is a bipartisan majority in Congress that accepts the globe is warming and that Congress has a responsibility to act on greenhouse gas emissions,"" Lieberman said.
\
Lieberman, the chairman of the climate change subcommittee and the co-sponsor of one of the earliest global warming bills with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the change in Washington is partly because of states like Connecticut and California setting their own limits on greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Any congressional bill that emerges from committee, he said, almost certainly will limit emissions through a ""cap-and-trade"" system similar to that in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, of which Connecticut is a participant.
\
Beginning in 2009, the initiative caps carbon dioxide emissions from large electric power plants and creates a market for emission permits to be bought and sold.
\
Appearing with Lieberman at the visitors center of The Mark Twain House & Museum were state Sen. Bill Finch, D-Bridgeport, the co- chair of the General Assembly's environment committee, and leaders of state environmental groups.
\
Finch said one of the most important components of a global warming bill proposed this session is an eventual ban on incandescent light bulbs deemed inefficient.
\
Finch said part of the bill's purpose is to demonstrate that people in Connecticut can make a difference in global warming. ""We have about the same greenhouse gas emissions as the country of Chile,"" Finch said. ""There is more carbon in the atmosphere now than there has been in the last 650,000 years.""
\
David Sutherland, director of the state chapter of The Nature Conservancy, said the global warming bill also contains a crucial provision requiring a study of global warming's expected impact on Connecticut to be completed by February. Coastal marshes are immediately vulnerable, he said.
\
Sutherland said the difference between climate changes earlier in the earth's history and the change being caused by rising temperatures from greenhouse gases is speed.
\
""We've always had species extinctions,"" he said. ""My concern now is it's going to be happening at a vastly accelerated rate.""
\
Lieberman said the report a week ago from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that global warming is real. ""Now people can see it with their own eyes. They can see the polar ice melting,"" he said.
\
The press conference, at noon on a rainy Sunday, was sparsely attended. The first question asked of Lieberman was not about global warming, but about Thursday's firing of radio personality Don Imus over his racial insult of the Rutgers women's basketball team.
\
Lieberman, a frequent Imus guest, saw the question coming.
\
""Let me guess. Does it begin with I, and it's not Iraq or Iran?"" he said.
\
As he had in an earlier written statement, Lieberman said that he considered Imus a friend but that his remark was deeply offensive and unacceptable.
\
""He apologized for that, and I was impressed the Rutgers coach accepted his apology. I think he deserved a two-week suspension. I don't think he deserved to be fired. I hope we all learned from this,"" Lieberman said.

The state House of Representatives on Monday overwhelmingly approved a tough new mandate that requires the state to drastically cut the greenhouse gas emissions associated with global warming.
\
If it passes the Senate and is signed into law by Gov. M. Jodi Rell, the bill would force state agencies to calculate and list greenhouse gases produced in the state, come up with strategies to meet the new reduction goals and start measuring the state's progress.
\
Those efforts could affect a broad spectrum of daily life in Connecticut, including the cost of electricity; incentives for conserving energy and using alternative, renewable sources; how homes and businesses are built; the types of motor vehicles on the road and the availability of public transportation.
\
""To get there, it will take a very comprehensive, statewide effort,"" said state Rep. Patricia Widlitz, D-Guilford, who led the charge for the bill on the House floor. Widlitz argued that although the state has made progress, it is falling short of goals set by legislation in 2004.
\
""When we have a mandatory cap, then people will be serious about doing something that gets us there,"" she said. ""Connecticut doesn't have the power to stop climate change, but we have the resources to diminish its impact.""
\
The bill passed 131-16 after more than four hours of debate and votes defeating several amendments proposed by Republicans. In the end, 26 GOP members joined a solid wall of Democrats in supporting the bill. It now moves to the Senate. Derek Slap, a spokesman for Senate President Pro Tem Donald Williams, said Williams, D-Brooklyn, expects the Senate will pass the bill this week.
\
The measure builds on goals set by the state four years ago and would require Connecticut to cut emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below 2001 levels by 2050. Many scientists say those goals must be reached worldwide in order to stave off the worst effects of global warming.
\
Similar measures have been enacted in California, Hawaii and New Jersey. At a conference at Yale just over a week ago, Rell signed a resolution backed by 18 governors urging the federal government to join with states in a national effort to curb our energy appetite and find cleaner ways to power our lives.
\
The bill sets deadlines for state officials to set up an inventory of the state's greenhouse gas emissions and come up with strategies and regulations to reduce emissions. Those strategies will include selling ""permits"" to emit carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas, and possibly setting a low-carbon fuel standard and developing better mass transit.
\
""This represents one of the strongest pieces of global warming legislation at the state level to date,"" said Chris Phelps of Environment Connecticut, one of a coalition of groups pushing for the bill. ""Passage of this legislation will help set the bar for Congress as it debates national global warming bills this year.""
\
Rell held off expressing outright support for the measure Monday evening.
\
""This [bill] has laudable goals, and as with all legislation, the governor will review it in final form and make sure the goals are achievable in a cost-effective manner,"" Rell spokesman Chris Cooper said.
\
Rell has been a firm supporter of efforts to combat climate change. She has launched a marketing campaign to get citizens to do ""One Thing"" every day to conserve energy. She also has backed the state's participation in a regional program to curb emissions from power plants through a ""cap-and-trade"" system that will issue a limited number of carbon dioxide ""permits"" to control emissions from the plants.
\
""We recognize how important the issue is,"" Cooper said. ""It's one of the greatest challenges we will confront in our lives.""
\
Some Republican opponents Monday questioned the science behind global warming and contended that the warming we are experiencing is part of natural climate cycles.
\
""Is it actually man that is causing climate change? I don't know,"" said Rep. John Harkins of Stratford. ""It's arrogant to think we have that much control over Mother Nature.""
\
Harkins compared the concern over global warming to the Middle Ages, when, he said, witches were burned at the stake after being blamed for cold weather.
\
""Global warming is the biggest scam since Ponzi,"" railed Rep. Richard Ferrari of East Granby.
\
Rep. James O'Rourke, D-Cromwell, countered that ""global warming is a reality; the evidence is overwhelming ... and it's happening because of man-made releases of carbon dioxide"" - reflecting the view of many major scientific groups.
\
""To not do this, to not take action would be immoral,"" he said.
\
Requirements Of The Bill Cut greenhouse gas emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below 2001 levels by 2050. Establish an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and produce regular progress reports. Identify economic opportunities, strategies and regulations to reduce emissions. Consider low-carbon-fuel standards. Consider how to improve the transportation system.

A vote on new standards for a regional program designed to reduce air polluting emissions could come as early as today, and a regional environmental group is urging Connecticut officials to support the most stringent possible measures being considered.
\
Representatives from Connecticut and nine other states that participate in The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) are meeting today in New York City, said Dennis Schain, a spokesman for Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
\
A market-based program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, RGGI was created in 2007, and a task force of officials from the 10 states are evaluating options for improving the program. Schain said while a vote is possible, it is more likely that discussions about what the new RGGI standards should be will continue.
\
""Commissioner (Dan) Esty will be at the RGGI meeting to represent Connecticut,"" Schain said. ""Representatives of the RGGI states are expected to continue ongoing discussions about the performance of the RGGI program and changes that may be required to build upon its effectiveness.""
\
Officials with Environment Northeast (ENE), a Maine-based regional organization with offices in Connecticut, are urging state officials to support the lowest possible cap -- 91 million tons -- on greenhouse gas emissions. The new standards would take effect in 2014.
\
""Three of the four caps being considered would not reduce emissions at all,"" said Peter Shattuck, director of market initiatives for ENE. ""If they're only considering what is currently on the table, then we want them to go with the lowest one.""
\
ENE issued a six-page report Monday that claims emissions in the participating states are on track to fall 45 percent below the current cap level this year, even as electricity prices have dropped 10 percent since the RGGI program was launched.
\
The decline in emissions and electricity prices is caused by decreased generation from carbon-intensive coal and oil plants, increased generation from natural gas and renewables, and improving energy efficiency of the regional economy, according to Daniel Sosland, ENE's president.
\
""RGGI has demonstrated that emissions can come down rapidly in the electric sector, and states have an opportunity to lock in progress addressing the root cause of climate change,"" Sosland said.
\
Shattuck said whatever action the RGGI task force takes could have an impact that will be felt well beyond the Northeast.
\
""RGGI states are effectively setting the bar for climate efforts nationwide,"" he said.
\
ENE has been lobbying for tougher emissions since the summer.
\
RGGI is what is commonly known as a cap and trade program, a term used to describe one of the mechanisms available for reducing air pollution in a nation or region while still allowing regulated companies some flexibility to meet standards that have been established.
\
Under such a system, companies are issued credits based on how large they are and what industries they are in. If a company's air pollution emission comes in below its allotted level under the credits, it has extra credits it may trade with other companies.
\
Schain called RGGI ""an innovative, first-in-the-nation effort to limit carbon emissions from power plants which has resulted in several millions of dollars being made available to Connecticut for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.""
\
""This has helped reduce emissions even more and created many new jobs in our state,"" he said. ""We look forward to playing an active role in determining the future course of RGGI.""

PRESIDENT Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. Well spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of Obamacare, financial reform and a near trillion-dollar stimulus that will significantly transform the country. But spent nonetheless. There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural. That's why, as I suggested last week, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next two and a half years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress next January.
\
Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda.
\
That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses. It is still possible for the gaffe-happy Republicans to blow it. When the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee publicly apologizes to the corporation that unleashed the worst oil spill in American history, you know the Republicans are capable of just about anything.
\
But assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-on reforms are dead. Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring). They could then vote for anything -- including measures they today shun as the midterms approach and their seats are threatened -- because they would have nothing to lose. They would be unemployed. And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.
\
As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are already looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session. Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes, and climate-change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.
\
Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden. Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission, which conveniently reports by Dec. 1. And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress -- but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.
\
It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply. To pass in a lame-duck session major legislation so unpopular that Democrats had no chance of passing it in regular session -- after major Democratic losses signifying a withdrawal of the mandate implicitly granted in 2008 -- would be an egregious violation of elementary democratic norms.
\
Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through a health-care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber -- something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.
\
How then to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress? Bring the issue up now -- applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day. Every current member should be publicly asked: In the event you lose in November -- a remote and deeply deplorable eventuality, but still not inconceivable -- do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?
\
The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow. Call me naive, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.

NEW HAVEN -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, after receiving a standing ovation at Yale University Friday for his efforts to counter global warming, said the United States is reaching a turning point in seriously addressing the issue of climate change.
\
""I'm very optimistic. ... One of the things that defines a successful movement is when it reaches a critical mass. ... You can feel the momentum. ... Every day, I see what is happening in California, and I am telling you, things are about to move our way,"" Schwarzenegger said.
\
Schwarzenegger and Gov. M. Jodi Rell were among four governors who signed a declaration on climate change at the university as part of a two-day conference of governors organized and held at Yale. Also signing the declaration at the conference were New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
\
A total of 14 other state leaders also agreed to the principles, but were not present at the event.
\
The states, which represent half the U.S. population and half the U.S. greenhouse gas emission problems, called on congressional leaders and presidential candidates to work out a federal-state partnership that supports state innovation and the development of green energy technologies.
\
The declaration also spoke of the need for mandatory action that will provide monitoring incentives and revenue from a federal cap and trade system. They further pledged to help shape the first 100 days of the next presidential administration. ""We have no time to lose,"" it stated.
\
The gathering celebrated the 100th anniversary of President Theodore Roosevelt's conference of governors, which kicked off the conservation movement and eventually the National Park System.
\
California, which has the seventh-largest economy in the world, has been recognized for its leadership role in tackling global warming, from its green building standards to attempts to cut tailpipe emissions.
\
It has also pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent to 1990 standards by 2020, with an additional 80 percent cut by 2050. Schwarzenegger said California's efforts to bring down vehicle emissions will help revive the auto industry and add jobs to the economy with new green technology.
\
Schwarzenegger put his faith in the young scientists in the audience at Woolsey Hall to push ahead.
\
""Stir things up. Be fresh in the way you look at things,"" he said, advising them not to fear compromises along the way. ""I think both environmental activists and their opponents cannot let perfect become the enemy of the possible.""
\
The other major speech at the event was delivered by R.K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Nobel Prize-winning United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who warned of the narrowing window left for nations to band together to halt global warming.
\
If nothing is done, he predicted, increasingly severe floods, droughts and lower agricultural yields will affect everyone, but mainly poorer populations. The situation will be a threat to peace and stability, he said. Pachauri said some species could become extinct.
\
The Nobel laureate reiterated statements by Yale President Richard C. Levin that the changes necessary to halt global warming are not too expensive.
\
""The myth that there will be a loss of jobs and economic output needs to be exploded,"" Pachauri declared, putting the cost of mitigation in 2030 at less than 3 percent of gross domestic product. He said the co-benefits -- energy security, low levels of pollution and better health outcomes -- may offset some or all of these investments.
\
Yale has pledged to reduce the university's greenhouse gas emissions to 43 percent below its 2005 baseline by 2020. In the first two years, it has already cut carbon emissions by 17 percent, and it is projecting another 17 percent cut in three more years at a cost of less than 1 percent of its operating budget. Pachauri said an honest market approach will put a price on carbon emissions, which will give companies the incentive to invest in research and development. Important lifestyle changes should include more efficient transportation and energy use.
\
Pachauri praised Connecticut's plan under Rell that asks everyone to do one energy-saving action daily to lower the collective carbon footprint.
\
Pachauri also had advice for developing countries, such as his homeland, India, which he said should not emulate the mistakes of the West as it industrializes.
\
His own action to help the 1.6 billion people in the world who don't have access to modern forms of energy, including 400 million in India, is a cottage enterprise that brings solar panels to villages, where lanterns and flashlights can be charged.
\
""Think outside the box. We all live on one planet, and we have to face the challenges together,"" Pachauri said to a standing ovation.
\
The states signing the governors' declaration are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Virginia and Washington.
\
Locally, the Connecticut Fund for the Environment praised a state bill that advanced at the legislature Friday, which calls for capping the state's total global warming emissions at 10 percent below 1990 levels in 12 years, and requires state agencies to develop the necessary incentives.

42,"
Today is New Year's Day. For me, it's usually a low-key family holiday during which we make hand-crafted, plate-sized gingerbread cookies.
\
This year I plan to make one of Obama in honor of his inauguration on Jan. 20. That day will mark the beginning a new year far more significant than any arbitrary turn of the calendar. Finally, we scientists will inaugurate someone who understands that a serious national investment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics for something other than war will make us more competitive in the world of ideas. This is especially true for ideas that will help wean us from our dependency on foreign oil and reassert world leadership on climate change.
\
The American Association for the Advancement of Science is our nation's most powerful science organization. It strives to be nonpartisan and has carefully examined the Obama science agenda; its assessment is at http://election2008.aaas.org/comparisons/ obama.shtml. Here are key points of the agenda that are important for Connecticut:
\
*Competitiveness and Innovation: Obama's plan to double federal funding for basic research will benefit the many universities and colleges in our state, because faculty can bring those dollars home to their respective institutions. Improving the H-1B visa program will also allow exceptionally skilled workers from overseas to carry out U.S. research and to produce technology with an American label.
\
*Education and Workforce: Federal education programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics will receive an $18 billion boost to enhance access to technology in the schools and increase the shrinking number of native-born students pursuing these fields. With its high concentration of public and private schools, Connecticut is likely to benefit more than most states.
\
*Health: The new administration hopes to create an independent institute to review the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of medical treatments. It will also invest $10 billion in an electronic health information system needed to implement standards-based access to proper care across the nation. The insurance companies in our state will thus be held more accountable and rendered more efficient. Obama's goal of targeting $1 billion for autism research is a personal boost for me, having raised an autistic son who is now 28 years old.
\
*Energy and Environment: Re-establishing U.S. leadership in international climate change agreements, rather than boycotting them, will raise our international standing. Obama's goals are to reduce CO(-2) emissions through a free-market cap-and-trade system, targeting an 80 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. He hopes to reduce the energy consumption of our economy by 50 percent by 2030, with at least 10 percent of that electricity coming from renewable sources by 2012. His non-energy environmental policies place protection of our water supplies as a top priority.
\
*National and Homeland Security: The administration will shift some attention away from terrorism to the larger threat of disease pandemics, particularly avian flu. This will be of special benefit to densely populated states such as our own. On the threat from nuclear weapons, Obama proposes to upgrade methods for tracking and controlling spent fuel from power plants. This will include reporting leakage. On most days, Connecticut lies immediately downwind of New York City, a highly vulnerable target.
\
*Transparency: Obama wants to use information technology to make government as transparent as possible. Pork, boondoggles, overpriced contracts and pet programs will be seen for what they are.
\
Where will the money come from? It's pretty obvious to me. We live in a world where the cost of offensive military invasions, interventions and occupations greatly exceeds that of all conceivable science, technology, engineering and mathematics initiatives put together. The outlay in the 2008 federal budget for the so-called Department of Defense and the so-called global war on terror was more than $627 billion.
\
Saying Happy New Year during a time of national economic pain is more than a gesture of optimism and good will. It's also a prediction of good things to come.

California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, after receiving a standing ovation at Yale University Friday for his efforts to counter global warming, said the United States is reaching a turning point in seriously addressing the issue of climate change.
\
""I'm very optimistic. ... One of the things that defines a successful movement is when it reaches a critical mass. ... You can feel the momentum. ... Every day, I see what is happening in California, and I am telling you, things are about to move our way,"" Schwarzenegger said.
\
Schwarzenegger and Gov. M. Jodi Rell were among four governors who signed a declaration on climate change at the university as part of a two-day conference of governors organized and held at Yale. Also signing the declaration at the conference were New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
\
A total of 14 other state leaders also agreed to the principles, but were not present at the event.

Correction published July 12, 2008*Power companies will have to buy permits for all their carbon dioxide emissions as part of a new state plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. A story on Page A1 Friday said they would have to buy permits only for any emissions beyond certain limits. The plan will set an overall cap on emissions for the electric generating industry that would gradually shrink, creating incentives for plants to curb emissions. Plants that reduce their emissions can then sell their permits.
\
Connecticut is just weeks away from implementing a sweeping plan to cut power plant emissions, and most agree that effort will mean higher energy costs to consumers.
\
But with electricity and gasoline prices already shooting upward, Gov. M. Jodi Rell now wants to blunt the impact on homeowners and businesses by building rebates into the plan.
\
That may sound good, but opponents of the idea said it actually undermines the effort to combat global warming and could harm consumers in the long run. Not only that, they say, Rell's proposal could violate the very law she signed in 2007.
\
That law intends to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels by forcing power companies to buy permits for any carbon dioxide they emit beyond certain limits. By approving the law, Connecticut joined nine other Northeastern states in a landmark ""cap-and-trade"" program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
\
Power companies are expected to pass the cost of the emissions permits on to consumers in higher energy prices. But the legislature decided to funnel the revenue generated by the sale of those permits into programs to increase energy efficiency for homeowners and businesses; to help industry curb power demand; and to invest in clean, renewable forms of energy.
\
The first auction of those permits is scheduled for Sept. 10, and the regulations governing the process in Connecticut were about to be approved when Rell proposed the changes last week.
\
Among legislators, there was ""widespread agreement that those [permit] proceeds are most appropriately invested in green technology, energy efficiency - things that will bring us close to energy independence,"" said state Sen. Andrew Roraback, R-Goshen, co-chairman of the legislative committee that has to sign off on the regulations.
\
The hope is that in the long run, those efforts will help consumers lower their energy bills.
\
Now, Rell is proposing that some of the proceeds go back directly to consumers. Experts believe the emissions allowances will sell for $3 to $5 a ton. Under Rell's plan, if the price goes above $5 a ton, the additional proceeds would go toward consumer rebates.
\
""I am insisting that we take this extra step to soften, in any way we possibly can, the unexpected costs that may result from this very important regional initiative,"" Rell said. ""This provision is intended to provide real relief at a time when families are struggling just to cover the basics - gasoline, groceries, electricity and heat.""
\
Environmental groups complain that Rell's proposal is short-sighted and will undermine the long-term battle against global warming. Consumers, advocates say, will benefit most if the revenue is used to pay for programs that help homeowners and businesses become more energy efficient, and to support renewable energy sources.
\
Roger Smith, coordinator of the Connecticut Climate Coalition, said if the price for emissions allowances goes to $6 a ton, rebates for a typical consumer would amount to only 23 cents a month. But, he said, every dollar spent on energy efficiency cuts $4 off consumers' electric bills.
\
""It's pretty clear to us that only one of them gets to the heart of the problem,"" Smith said, ""and that's getting people off fossil fuels.""
\
Smith noted that efficiency programs that help consumers cut their energy bills are already over-subscribed.
\
""We can add to programs people all want for energy efficiency - or give everybody a quarter,"" he said.
\
Critics contend Rell's last-minute amendments to the regulations are an end-run around the normal rule-making process, which involved public hearings and legislative debates.
\
Jessie Stratton, a former lawmaker who now represents Environment Northeast, notes that the 2007 law does not mention consumer rebates at all, and pointed out that the legislature took up the issue again during debate over this year's global warming legislation.
\
As part of that bill, Rell and the legislature committed the state to cut its output of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases associated with global warming 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80 percent below 2001 levels by 2050.
\
""An amendment to put in rebates was resoundingly defeated by the House,"" she said. If Rell wants to change the rules, ""the governor should go to the legislature in the next session and try to amend it.""
\
But Rell spokesman Matthew Fritz said the changes make more sense now because of the economy's decline and the rise in gasoline and other energy prices.
\
""We feel pretty confident that the language adopted last year allows for this type of action,"" said Fritz.
\
He also insisted the changes will not cut into the funds to be set aside for energy efficiency and other programs. Commissioner Gina McCarthy of the Department of Environmental Protection, the agency that drew up the rules, agreed.
\
""We will still get the greenhouse gas reductions. I'll get them - I'll just do it in a more clever way,"" McCarthy said. ""We want people to know we can achieve these goals on an economically sound basis.""
\
Roraback said there is concern that speculators may drive up the market price for emissions permits - and possibly add to the burden on consumers.
\
""We want to be sure ratepayers aren't left holding the bag,"" he said. ""We're trying to have a backstop [to energy prices].""
\
Roraback is confident his committee will approve the regulations - with or without Rell's amendments - at its July 22 meeting, in time for the state to participate in the Sept. 10 auction. The changes will have to be vetted by the committee's lawyers and Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.

45,"Gov. Ned Lamont on Monday signed on to a multistate effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to reinvest millions of dollars a year toward cleaner transportation, a deal that will likely mean higher gas prices in Connecticut.\Lamont joined Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia in joining the bipartisan Transportation and Climate Initiative Program (TCI-P), which guarantees that Connecticut will reduce carbon emissions by at least 26% in a 10-year period from 2022 to 2032.\""Engaging in this way with my fellow governors and Mayor Bowser accomplishes goals we have set for Connecticut for years,"" Lamont said. ""Participating in the TCI-P will help grow our economy through a fresh injection of capital to provide for jobs and new infrastructure. This collaboration will cut our greenhouse gas emissions, and it will make our urban centers healthier, after decades of being adversely impacted by the emissions being released by traffic every day. \""Connecticut has always taken pride in our leadership role when it comes to climate, and when we can combine that with a stronger economy, fast transit systems, and regional cooperation, that's a win for all of us.""\The initiative is a regional cap-and-trade plan to raise money to combat climate change by seeking wholesale reductions in motor vehicle pollution, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. It requires that large gasoline and diesel fuel suppliers purchase allowances for the pollution caused by combustion of the fuels they sell in Connecticut.\""Because fuel distributors operate in a competitive marketplace with a growing diversity of alternative fuels such as hydrogen and electricity, the price signal will spur innovation, including for regulated entities to reduce the carbon content of the fuels that they sell,"" said Katie Dykes, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\The program is expected to generate up to $89 million in annual revenue for Connecticut in 2023, which would increase to as much as $117 million by 2032.\The total number of emission allowances will decline each year, resulting in less transportation pollution. The proceeds - nearly $300 million for signatory jurisdictions netted in the first year - would be invested in low-carbon transportation projects designed to help both urban and rural residents. \Each participating jurisdiction would decide how to invest program proceeds independently in consultation with lawmakers and citizens.\But it's difficult, Dykes added, to say how much of the cost will passed along to fuel consumers.\""Should fuel suppliers pass along cost modeling estimates show a potential increase of around 5 cents per gallon,"" Dykes said. \""This is far less than the regular fluctuations that consumers see in retail fuel prices.""\Environmental advocates across the region applauded the move. Barry Kresch, president of the Electric Vehicle Club of Connecticut, said TCI is ""a real opportunity to substantially reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, improve the health of Connecticut residents, and generate investment in clean energy and clean transportation.""\But critics suggest the initiative amounts to little more than a new gas tax for Connecticut residents. Under Connecticut's current system, drivers already pay a flat tax rate of 25 cents per gallon at the pump, along with a gross receipts tax that fluctuates along with the wholesale price of gasoline.\The Yankee Institute for Public Policy, a right-leaning think tank, estimates it would result in $388.6 million per year in increased gasoline costs across the state.\""This new tax is regressive, opaque, and offensive to hardworking Connecticut residents and small business owners who deserve better from a state government that is supposed to care about them and represent their interests - not the interests of an activist group bent on making it too expensive for the average family to drive to work,"" said Yankee Institute President Carol Platt Liebau.\The Delaware-based Ceasar Rodney Institute's Center for Energy and Environment estimated the average Connecticut family will end up paying $258 more per year.\House Minority Leader-elect Vincent Candelora said any new taxes in the state of Connecticut would be ""wildly unpopular for taxpayers, especially given the state that we're in.""\ ""I think it's something that we need to we need to tread very lightly toward. There's going to be a lot of spirited conversation on this issue,"" Candelora said.\Candelora, a Republican from North Branford, said the issue would have to come before the legislature before Connecticut officially signs on.\""Given that our special transportation fund is heading toward insolvency, starting another initiative that is not going to help the solvency of our fund is probably not the way that we should be starting out a conversation on transportation and greenhouse gas,"" Candelora said.\Senate Minority Leader-elect Kevin Kelly called the pre-Christmas move a ""lump of coal to middle-class families.""\""This tax hike will burden middle class families' budgets at the absolute worst possible time without improving our aging transportation infrastructure,"" Kelly, R-Stratford, said. ""[Lamont's] holiday gift to Connecticut families is new and higher taxes.""\The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents thousands of small businesses in the state, said many who are struggling to make ends meet due to the coronavirus pandemic will face additional financial stress if gas were to go up in price.\""Restaurants require fuel to deliver food orders, plumbers and electricians drive to job sites, construction companies utilize fuel to operate their equipment,"" said NFIB State Director Andy Markowski. \""All of these small business jobs will now be more expensive because Connecticut joined TCI,"" he said.\Chris Herb, president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, an industry group, said TCI would ""put another tax, on top of another tax, on top of another tax, on top of another tax"" on gasoline, which he said is ""one of the already most taxed commodities in Connecticut.""\""We don't see this as an environmental initiative but rather a money grab,"" Herb said. \""We already have one of the highest gas taxes in Connecticut. This would be the breaking point for many people in Connecticut already struggling to make ends meet and quite frankly, just trying to survive.""\States that were initially on board with the program - but failed to commit this week to the agreement - include Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia.\Michael Hamad may be reached at mhamad@courant.com."
46,"Gov. Ned Lamont's extraordinary powers to combat COVID-19 will continue until at least May 20 after Democrats in the General Assembly agreed to a one-month extension of his authority. The extension comes as Connecticut is making progress on coronavirus vaccinations but seeing an increase in its test positivity rate and COVID-19 hospitalizations as now more younger people are contracting the virus.Want to get this in your inbox every Friday? Subscribe to Capitol Watch at courant.com/newsletters\The big story\Lamont's emergency COVID-19 powers extended until May 20:Democratic lawmakers have approved a one-month extension of Lamont's emergency powers to combat the coronavirus pandemic over objections from Republicans who say the legislature has become increasingly irrelevant as Lamont has governed via executive order for more than a year. The measure passed the state House of Representatives March 25 and the state Senate on Tuesday. Supporters of the extension said lawmakers and the Lamont administration need additional time to decide which executive orders should be continued, which should be changed and which should be suspended. The orders range from keeping bars closed to requiring mask-wearing to expanding the number of people eligible to give COVID-19 vaccinations. Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney said Lamont still needs broad authority to act because ""we do not have this pandemic in our rear-view mirror yet."" Lamont officials have warned that letting the emergency declaration expire could also impact federal funding related to the pandemic. But even Republicans who were complimentary of the job Lamont has done guiding the state through COVID-19 argued it was time for the legislature to be more involved. ""Let us get back to work,"" Sen. Paul Formica, R-East Lyme, said. ""We are a coequal branch of government, and it's time for us to start acting that way.""\Five things you may have missed\Connecticut gets first credit rating upgrade in two decades:For the first time in 20 years, a Wall Street credit rating agency has upgraded its rating of Connecticut's finances, an important signal that reflects confidence in the state's budgeting and could save money in the future through reduced borrowing costs. State Treasurer Shawn Wooden said the upgrade by Moody's Investors Service was ""a significant milestone for the state."" It comes as tax collections have exceeded expectations and the state is on track to end the fiscal year with a $180 million surplus as well as a reserve fund of more than $3 billion. Moody's said the upgraded bond rating ""reflects the state's continued commitment to numerous governance improvements that have already borne fruit."" Those measures include the so-called debt diet Lamont has pushed since being elected, saying Connecticut needed to scale back borrowing, as well as a measure that requires surplus funds to be saved or used to pay down pension debt.\Zoning reform bills advance, but not without changes: A pair of bills that would overhaul the state's zoning rules to promote the construction of more affordable housing and address racial segregation were advanced by the legislature's planning and development committee Wednesday, but even supporters of the measures said they are likely to undergo changes as they move through the General Assembly. One change already made is eliminating a provision that would have required communities to approve certain multifamily housing developments near train stations. Senate Bill 1024 would legalize construction of accessory apartments statewide and prohibit cities and towns from using vague terms such as ""character"" in zoning rules to block proposed projects. House Bill 6611 would set benchmarks and deadlines for cities and towns to develop affordable housing. Wednesday's votes moved the measures forward, but it is unclear if the House or Senate will take up the measures before lawmakers adjourn in early June.\Bipartisan agreement on designating pizza as official state food:A legislative committee that has had protracted debate on bills examining voting rights and other issues found bipartisan consensus to advance legislation that would make pizza Connecticut's official state food. The bill is being pushed by New Haven lawmakers, but before Wednesday's committee vote, several members opined about where the best pies can be found. ""I just want to say that we have good pizza in Meriden, too. Not just New Haven,"" said Rep. Hilda Santiago, D-Meriden. Rep. Stephanie Thomas of Norwalk said: ""I just want the record to reflect that as a Jersey girl I'm not admitting that Connecticut pizza is better than New Jersey pizza if I vote yes on this bill."" Connecticut has a state flower (mountain laurel), state animal (sperm whale), state bird (American robin) and state hero (Nathan Hale), but no food-related designations have made their way into statute.\Climate change bill that could raise gas prices moves forward:The legislature's environment committee voted Wednesday in favor of a significant climate change bill that would generate funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cut air pollution and promote electric cars but that could also raise Connecticut gasoline prices by 5 to 9 cents per gallon in 2023. Lamont is seeking the legislature's OK to join the multistate Transportation Climate Initiative, a regional cap-and-trade plan to raise money to combat climate change by seeking wholesale reductions in motor vehicle pollution, the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Opponents of the proposal say increased costs for wholesalers will be passed along to consumers through increased prices and have decried it as a new gas tax. The program is expected to raise $89 million in Connecticut in 2023 and as much as $117 million in 2032. Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia have also joined the effort.\Committee OKs legislation ending religious exemptions for vaccines: A bill to eliminate Connecticut's religious exemption for required vaccines for schoolchildren was pushed forward in the legislature's public health committee by a largely party-line vote Wednesday, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed, but members on both sides of the aisle expressed support for grandfathering in all children with existing religious exemptions currently in Connecticut schools. The bill was the subject of a 24-hour public hearing in February and has drawn strong opposition from some parents who see it as government infringing on their rights. Supporters say they are concerned about a recent increase in students claiming the exemptions and say that can put other students who cannot receive vaccines due to medical conditions at risk. ""You have a right to religious expression and affiliation as an American,"" said Rep. Henry Genga, D-East Hartford. ""Exposing those with life-threatening illnesses is not a result which we have a right to.""\Odds and ends\The Connecticut Supreme Court Monday dismissed a challenge from a Milford tavern owner and affirmed Gov. Ned Lamont's emergency powers that have kept bars shuttered since the pandemic took hold in Connecticut last March. The unanimous opinion said COVID-19 is a ""serious disaster"" under state law and Lamont's decision to act via executive order and suspend laws and regulations is within the authority of his office. The suit, field by Kristine Casey, owner of Casey's Irish Pub, had argued the state law authorizing gubernatorial emergency powers during disasters was vague and should not extend to the pandemic. ... Rep. Robyn Porter, D-New Haven, bristled on social media Tuesday at the concept of COVID-19 ""vaccine passports"" that would require people to show proof of vaccination to visit a business, take a trip or attend a sporting event. Lamont has no plans to develop the tool on a statewide basis, but recently suggested businesses in the private sector may take the lead on the issue. Porter, however, wrote on Facebook that the proposed passports were a ""backdoor way of mandating [vaccines] without technically making it a mandate."" ... Biagio 'Billy' Ciotto, the colorful ex-state senator from Wethersfield who died last month at the age of 91, was remembered at his funeral Monday by friends, colleagues and even President Joe Biden, who wrote a personal letter that was read at the service. ""Please accept Jill's and my heartfelt condolence on the passing of your beloved Billy,"" Biden wrote to Ciotto's wife of 66 years, Jeanne, and her family, in a letter read by U.S. Rep. John Larson, whose office Ciotto had worked in until recently. ... Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin received his first COVID-19 vaccine Thursday as the state expanded eligibility to all residents 16 and up. ""I just got my vaccine. I got the first shot just now. It's April 1, but I'm not fooling. It feels good to get that vaccine,"" the 41-year-old mayor said in a video posted to Twitter from a walk-up clinic in Hartford. ""Do it for yourself, for your loved ones, your colleagues, your classmates. Do it for your community. We've got to beat this virus, and the way we do it is by getting this vaccine."" ... Mary Ann Turner, the longtime Enfield Republican Town Committee chairwoman, has been named vice chairwoman of the Connecticut Republican Party. Turner will serve through June, when the party's central committee will elect a new slate of officers.

47,"WASHINGTON - He first achieved national renown with a speech hailing bipartisanship, but will leave the White House with the widest partisan gap in approval ever recorded.\He spent much of his presidency singing the praises of cooperation across party lines, but nearly all his major accomplishments resulted from party-line votes or executive actions.\And if Republicans accused him of paying too much attention to Democratic interests, allies blamed him for neglecting his party. Democrats lost a dozen governorships and hundreds of state legislative seats, as well as control of Congress, during his tenure.\President Barack Obama leaves office with job approval ratings comparable to the final marks for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. But unlike them, Obama's support is overwhelmingly party based.\Eight in ten Democrats on average approved of Obama's work over the last eight years while only about one in eight Republicans did so. Now nearly nine in ten Democrats and six in ten independents, but only about one in seven Republicans, give him positive marks, according to polling by the non-partisan Pew Research Center.\That's disheartening for the leader who was hailed at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, when he was a little-known Illinois state legislator running for the U.S. Senate, when he declared ""there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America.""\Last January, in his final State of the Union address, Obama cited the increase in partisanship during his presidency as among his greatest regrets.\In an interview with the Washington Bureau several weeks later, Obama said he still believed in bipartisanship, but that he had decided early it could not be his top priority.\""Bipartisanship is not a virtue if we don't do anything, and we just leave problems unsolved,"" Obama said. ""Bipartisanship is a virtue if we, both sides, (say) 'Look, we have a problem. We may differ on how we solve it, but let's sit down and negotiate.' And there's never been an issue in Washington that I haven't been willing to take a half loaf or a quarter loaf.""\As he saw it, he had tried again and again without success to divide the loaf, only to be met with what the White House saw as relentless opposition.\After all, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky famously said in 2010 that the ""single most important thing"" for the GOP was to make Obama a one-term president, a goal hardly conducive to compromise.\""When you can't get a negotiating partner across the table who is going to agree to anything, then you have to make a decision,"" Obama said about the fight over the 2010 Affordable Care Act. ""Do I just drop it? Or ... do you say, 'Wow, I've got millions of people out there who don't have health insurance and I need to go forward' ""?\""At that point then, it was just a majority muscle move,"" he added.\Republican leaders claim Obama never offered half a loaf or anything like it. They say he didn't have the legislative experience to cut deals or was too aloof to engage in the fine art of wining and dining lawmakers to his side.\""Almost without exception, President Obama begins serious policy discussions by explaining why everyone else is wrong,"" McConnell wrote in his 2016 autobiography.\""The conversation would last as long as it took the President to feel satisfied that his soliloquy had outlined the issue well enough for me to understand,"" he wrote. ""Speaker Boehner famously put the phone on his desk and carried on a separate conversation during one of these exchanges with the President. I never put the phone down, but on one occasion, I did watch at least an inning of baseball.""\While both political parties blame the other for the widening partisan divide, the causes are not so simple. Leaders were caught in a dynamic that has emerged over decades.\In the 1960s and 1970s, the Democratic and Republican parties had broad coalitions of liberals, moderates and conservatives. Presidents could forge bipartisan consensus for major legislation, from civil rights to environmental protection.\But the ability to compromise weakened in the 1980s as Republicans grew more consistently conservative and Democrats more reliably liberal.\The divide widened under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, and worsened further under Obama.\Greater levels of education, the advent of social media, greater racial diversity, increased income inequality, and changes in the economy probably all played a role.\To the extent that Obama and Republicans in Congress have aggravated the gap, the two sides have very different explanations.\As Obama tells it, the story begins early in his first term as he rode to Capitol Hill in the presidential limousine. He was going to meet with Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, then the House minority leader, to discuss ways to stimulate the economy to avert a depression after the housing market collapse at the end of the Bush administration.\Obama said he had phoned Boehner and asked to ""come up to your caucus and talk.""\""As I'm driving over, he puts out a press release saying, 'We're against it,' "" Obama told friends later, referring to the alert he saw on an aide's Blackberry.\""We hadn't talked to anybody yet!""\Dozens of interviews with Obama aides and the president himself suggest that the limousine story, which he told and retold over the years, deeply colored his thinking about his GOP adversaries.\Boehner's team has a different memory of the incident.\They say it wasn't their intransigence that started the gridlock of the last eight years but Obama's initial approach to them.\They say he made clear that the Democratic majority in Congress, led by the newly-elected Democratic president, would push through a economic stimulus bill with or without Republican support.\Obama's handling of the stimulus bill was ""the original sin"" of his young administration, ""setting the course of partisanship and confrontation,"" former Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.\""There's an argument to be made that the history of the Obama presidency would have been very different if he had insisted on bipartisan discussions and input on the stimulus bill,"" Steel said.\In the end, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus was formally known, passed Congress with three Republican votes in the Senate and none in the House.\Mutual recriminations only worsened later that year when the administration and Congress negotiated over Obama's proposed health care reform law.\On that, the two sides again share a story but give it different interpretations.\For months, White House and Senate staffs shuttled up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, chasing potential compromises but finding none.\Eager to break the impasse, Obama invited Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a key committee chairman, and several other lawmakers to the Oval Office for a session he thought could clear the way.\He set up the meeting the way he had learned from Republicans in the Illinois Senate: No public arrival. No parade before reporters. Just a few aides and officials in the room.\Grassley, with his low-key manners and graying hair, looked like the negotiating partners of Obama's past. Like Obama, he had done deals across party lines before.\It was early August. They sat in the Oval Office, Obama cross-legged in an arm chair, Grassley leaning back on a beige couch.\Can we make this idea work, or that one? Obama asked, working his way down the list. Is there another way you want to do it? Would he be willing to vote with the Democrats?\After a pause, according to a White House witness, the senator leaned toward the president and looked him in the eye.\""You know what, Mr. President?"" he said, ""I've got to admit - there's no change that allows me to vote for this thing.""\Obama and top advisers told that story often later. To them, it marked the moment they realized the Republicans were not prepared to consider the president's top domestic priority.\The moment symbolized something else for Grassley: Obama had started with a Democratic plan - government-based health care coverage - and was willing to tweak it only to pick up enough Republicans to allow the White House to claim it had bipartisan support.\Grassley said he wouldn't play that game. ""I said to the president, 'That's not bipartisanship,' "" he recalled.\For Obama, who believed in universal health care - or something close to it - the issue was simple. What was the point of winning the White House if you couldn't help people as you'd promised?\The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, passed in early 2010 without a single Republican vote. The party-line dispute contributed to the Democrats' heavy losses in midterm elections later that year, giving Republicans control of both houses of Congress.\After that, the stalemate was set.\Republicans argued that the Obama was trying to ram his political agenda - including cap-and-trade legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and an overhaul of immigration laws - down their throats.\After bitter debate, the climate change bill was passed by the House but was never brought to a vote in the Senate, where it died. In 2013, the opposite occurred for immigration reform. It narrowly passed the Senate, but died without a vote in the House.\After that, Obama increasingly used executive authority to order rule changes for the environment, immigration, unemployment and other issues. That means President-elect Trump can reverse or amend many of them as soon as he takes office.\Jim Manley, a former top aide to then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said Republicans still remember Obama's boast to GOP leaders in the Oval office in 2009. ""Elections have consequences,"" the new president told them.\""They've never forgotten that,"" Manley said.\Credit: Washington Bureau - - christi.parsons@latimes.com - ; By Christi Parsons ;and Lisa Mascaro"
48,"The General Assembly in the State of Connecticut has proposed a ""carbon tax"" on energy which would collect more than $500 million in new taxes from homeowners and businesses in just the first year that the law would take effect. The proposed legislation (Raised Bill 7247) is now being considered by the General Assembly's Environment Committee.\There are several reasons this idea is bad public policy and does not make good economic sense - for those who use propane, and all energy consumers as well.\This new tax, being labeled a carbon tax on fossil fuels, would be applied to most forms of energy, including gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, natural gas, electricity - and propane. Limited exemptions would apply to hydroelectric or nuclear-generated electricity as well as renewable biomass or waste vegetable oil. While we certainly understand the desire to promote the use of environmentally friendly fuels, it's important to also understand the prominent role that propane plays in that ecological framework.\Most people don't realize that propane has been designated an EPA certified ""clean fuel."" That's because propane is the cleanest burning fossil fuel. In fact, propane is actually a waste product that is left over when natural gas is collected and refined for distribution and use. If it were not used as an energy source for homes and businesses, most propane would be burned off at the refinery or processing plant.\Therefore, using propane to heat your home or even power an engine reduces greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise be produced if propane was not used as a fuel source. In many ways, propane is the ultimate waste product made into a valuable energy source that is good for our environment.\If the goal is to increase the use of efficient energy sources which reduce our carbon footprint on the planet in a cost effective manner, then we should be finding ways to promote the use of propane, not penalize it.\From an economic standpoint, this new tax would cost the citizens of Connecticut approximately $10 million dollars per year. According to a July 13, 2016 article in the Hartford Courant (""Report: Connecticut Energy Costs Are Highest In Nation""), State residents spend an average of $410 per month on energy, the highest in the United States. Adding a carbon tax on top of that would add approximately $25 per month to that expense which puts the average energy cost for CT citizens at $100 per week.\A carbon tax would have the greatest negative impact on those who can least afford it, such as those with limited or fixed incomes. In fact, it could accelerate the migration of citizens to other lower cost states, something Connecticut is already working hard to try to avoid.\Taxing energy that is essential to keep our homes warm, our businesses running, and our vehicles on the road, is bad economic and public policy. Instead of raising taxes, the Legislature should support the use of energy efficient fuels like propane and promote the use of higher efficiency appliances to reduce CO2 and help the environment. The average consumption of delivered fuels (including propane) has decreased by more than 40% over the last 15 years. We are on the right track - and we need to keep that momentum going with a continued focus on incentives for energy efficient appliances and cleaner burning fuels.\Propane consumed in the United States is produced in North America. It is a major contributor to the energy security of the Unites States and protects consumers from uncertain energy supplies outside of our borders. Dozens of public entities around the country, including school districts and police departments, have converted their on-road fleets to propane because it is economical and beneficial to the environment.\But most importantly, taxing the energy we need to live and work is a dangerous idea, and will cause significant economic damage to those who rely on it as an efficient, economical fuel.\Instead, let's focus on promoting the energy and efficiency we need to sustain long-term economic and environmental viability.\Leslie Anderson is president of the Propane Gas Association of New England\Credit: By Leslie Anderson"
49,"Treat Them \As Adults\Kevin Kane [Aug. 14, courant.com, ""Chief State's Attorney: Emboldened Juveniles Endanger the Public""] is right, both about the need to repair the juvenile justice system and the erroneous notion that 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds should be treated in the criminal justice system as juveniles rather than adults.\We as a society have established the threshold age of adulthood as 18. That is, for example, the minimum age required for entering the military without parental consent and the minimum age for voting required by the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\There is, as the ""raise-the-age"" advocates say, scientific evidence that the prefrontal cortex of the brain continues to develop into the mid-20s. But notwithstanding that fact, those who are 18, 19 and 20 should be regarded as adults rather than as juveniles and treated as such in the criminal justice system.\David R. Cameron, Madison\Teachable Moment\The comments by Derek Weimer, James Fields' high school history teacher [Aug. 14, Page 1, ""A Day Of Chaos, Loss""] raise some chilling questions.\Fields is the 20-year-old who allegedly plowed his car into a group of activists on Saturday, killing Heather Heyer and injuring others. In high school, Fields was fascinated by Hitler and Nazism, and Weimer admits to failing to educate young Fields.\Weimer said, ""This is definitely a teachable moment ... this stuff is tearing up our country.""\As teachers prepare their classrooms and introductory lessons, I urge every single educator among us to first establish an environment of safety, kindness and compassion. The need to shine a bright light on the dark issues that divide us seems urgent.\This discussion will not be easy or comfortable and perhaps colleagues will push back, saying they didn't sign up to teach this. Yet, first and foremost we are educating children, K-12 and beyond. No matter what our subject or discipline may be, we are charged with caring for the hearts and minds of our students. No one else seems to be able to lead the way out of this turbulent time.\Please, teachers, let's show the way and seize this horrific yet teachable moment.\Patricia Bengtson, Vernon\The writer is a teacher at Rockville High School.\Sowing Seeds \Of Hate\After reading the piece titled ""Charlottesville Chaos 'Beyond Tragic'"" [Aug. 13, Page A6], I couldn't help but respond to the following comment by J.R. Romano, chair of the Connecticut Republican Party: ""What happened is not Donald Trump's fault. Blaming him is wrong.""\So, by Mr. Romano's logic: If a farmer sows a field with seeds, and seven months later crops are ripening in that field, then what happened there has nothing to do with the farmer. Crediting him is wrong.\Let it go, Mr. Romano. It's a direct cause and effect. Trying to refute what is glaringly apparent serves only to damage your own credibility.\Dan Stark, West Hartford\Carbon Tax \Makes Sense\U.S. Rep. John Larson's proposal for a carbon tax to fund major infrastructure improvements around the nation [Aug. 9, Page B1, ""Larson: Carbon Tax Could Fund Plan""] is an interesting idea. I thank him for once again proposing legislation that uses carbon pricing as a way to reduce emissions. It's also obvious our infrastructure needs major improvements which could provide badly needed jobs.\Larson's is one of several Democratic proposals using carbon pricing over the years. A group of senior Republican statesmen recently proposed a carbon dividend with all the proceeds returned to the people.\The nonpartisan Citizens' Climate Lobby prefers a carbon fee and dividend, and all net revenues would be returned to households. This would ensure that people on lower incomes could manage price increases until we can all shift to the cleaner energy sources and efficiency measures which will be encouraged by the rising fee on fossil fuels.\We hope the recent ever-growing bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House will be taking a serious look at these various proposals. With bipartisan support, we can finally begin to move forward as a nation on real climate solutions.\Janet Heller, Manchester"

Meet the new Chris Dodd -- tough on Iraq, tough on polluters.
\
That's the terse, pointed message the Democratic senator from Connecticut has been trying to spread lately while trying to separate himself from the Democratic presidential pack and crack the 1 percent mark in national polls.
\
So far, though, Dodd has been blocked at almost every turn, as nearly every constituency he's courted throughout his political career appears to prefer someone else for president.
\
So in speeches, e-mail and media interviews, Dodd is now focusing on championing a harder line on Iraq than most of his rivals and promoting the idea that he's greener than the rest because he wants to impose a $50 billion a year carbon tax on American industry.
\
Can the new strategy work?
\
A lot of Democrats think Dodd is too late coming to his position on the war.
\
""For a lot of us in New Hampshire, the question is whether the candidate voted to authorize the war [in 2002],"" said longtime activist and lobbyist Jim Demers, who supports John Edwards. ""And if he did vote yes, we want to see how he answers for it.""
\
Dodd, along with most of his rivals, voted to authorize the war, and as recently as last December he suggested that the president's troop surge may not be a bad idea.
\
But a week later, in an op-ed piece for the Des Moines Register, he wrote, ""The president should announce in January that we will begin withdrawing and redeploying our troops.""
\
This week, Dodd plans to introduce an amendment to war spending legislation that would implement his plan.
\
Meanwhile, on April 19, the senator introduced a comprehensive energy plan whose centerpiece is a corporate carbon tax that would funnel $50 billion a year for research into alternative energy technology.
\
So far, all this has gotten Dodd a niche he hardly craves -- as a popular second choice. It's not uncommon to meet activists who feel that way, such as Fernando Romero, president of Hispanics in Politics.
\
""I like all the candidates, and I like that Dodd speaks the language,"" said Romero, who lives in Las Vegas, ""But [New Mexico] Gov. [Bill] Richardson has lived in Mexico and embraces the culture.""
\
In South Carolina, Franklin Ashley, a professor of playwriting at the College of Charleston, also had kind words for Dodd -- but not his vote.
\
If Illinois Sen. Barack Obama weren't running, he said, ""I'd be for Dodd in a heartbeat.""
\
But his heart remains with Obama. ""I heard Obama speak in Charleston,"" Ashley said, ""and it was an exhilarating experience.""

Voters in Washington state will be asked next month whether they want to adopt the nation's first carbon tax -- a powerful way to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. You'd think environmental groups would be doing everything they can to back that idea. You'd be wrong.
\
Initiative 732 will be on the ballot on Election Day. It calls for a $25-per-ton carbon tax, and it says how the proceeds should be spent: Trim the state's sales tax, cut taxes on manufacturers, and give tax rebates to low-income households.
\
Oddly enough, this plan has failed to impress some environmental campaigners. Washington Conservation Voters, an influential local organization, opposes it because none of the revenue will go toward funding clean energy. Climate Solutions, another local group, agrees. The Sierra Club won't back the plan, saying its help for low-income households and minorities is insufficient.
\
Those groups haven't put their own proposal on the ballot, so they're saying it's better to do nothing than vote for Initiative 732. This position is absurd. Curbing carbon emissions is, or ought to be, the primary goal, and the plan would do that. In addition, it's an opportunity to prove the viability of the carbon-tax approach and set a valuable example for the rest of the country.
\
The part of the plan that seems to offend the campaigners -- how the carbon-tax revenues ought to be used -- is worth debating, but what matters most is to put a price on carbon, reflecting its true cost to the environment. Promising that the revenues from the carbon tax will be used to cut taxes and support low-income working families seems wise, in fact, because it lends the idea bipartisan appeal. But that isn't the main thing. The main thing is that the measure shouldn't fail merely because it doesn't please every group on every point.
\
The latest polling shows 42 percent of respondents supporting the plan, with 37 percent against and 21 percent undecided. In other words, local groups could well decide the outcome, persuading undecided voters to lean one way or the other. It would be bad enough for the measure to be voted down because climate change wasn't seen as an urgent problem. If it fails for lack of support from climate campaigners, that's worse -- and those groups should be ashamed.

Sen. Christopher J. Dodd plans to unveil an ambitious energy plan today that aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enact a ""corporate carbon tax"" that would bring in $50 billion annually.
\
His greenhouse gas emission framework would require the U.S. to reduce emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. The reductions would be made gradually in three stages, with the first target being met in 2030. The Connecticut Democrat plans to address the Center for National Policy, a research group, on his proposals, the second in a series of speeches designed to show how he would govern if elected president next year. Dodd, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, last week outlined his foreign policy goals to an Iowa audience.
\
His comprehensive energy program would, as a position paper Wednesday explained, ""begin to turn back the clock on global climate change, safeguard our environment and protect American health.""
\
Dodd would also push for the carbon tax. Its purpose, the position paper said, would be to ""discourage big corporate polluters and stimulate innovation.""
\
The $50 billion annual revenue would go into a fund to develop renewable technologies such as wind, solar, ethanol and other bio- fuels, and would help efforts to bring more energy-efficient technology to the marketplace.
\
Consumers would also see changes under a Dodd administration. He would reduce the cost of energy-efficient lighting, cars and appliances, and would ""freeze electricity usage from 2010 onward through efficiency.""
\
Among those efficiencies: Raising fuel economy standards in automobiles to 50 mpg by model year 2017.
\
Dodd's other ideas include:
\
Requiring new coal plants to capture and sequester carbon dioxide -- ""no exceptions.""
\
Making ""historic investments"" in bio-fuels and other clean energy technologies from farms.
\
Making mass transit more affordable and convenient.
\
Exporting safe renewable energy technologies to friends, allies and developing nations.
\
Requiring all new government vehicles to use hybrid, plug-in or other fuel-efficient technology.
\
Requiring all new and existing federal buildings to include the latest energy-efficient qualities.
\
Creating a technical education curriculum that trains a new generation of auto mechanics.

Gary Yohe, a professor at Wesleyan University, has been in Brussels this week, helping to draft the final wording of the latest global warming report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
\
Due today, the report will confirm with greater certainty than ever before that some of the most dire consequences of global warming -- mass extinctions, wildfires, deadly heat waves and water shortages -- are already occurring and will accelerate.
\
Yohe is not a biologist or climatologist, or someone easily labeled an alarmist. He is an economist, who began working on climate change long before it was recognized as a danger. His expertise in calculating risk puts him at the center of the serious, evolving discussion over global warming. Now that science has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that greenhouse gases are causing the planet to heat up, the question is what can or should be done to stop it.
\
The Supreme Court ruling this week that the gases can be classed as pollutants is expected to spur Congress to adapt national emission limits. Connecticut belongs to a New England compact that already has approved drastic cuts in emissions, as have some Western states, led by California.
\
But who can guarantee the reductions will be enough to blunt the most harmful effects of global warming? And who knows whether the cost of global warming damage, assuming it can be assigned a cost, will outweigh the cost of reducing emissions? Both have been estimated in trillions of dollars.
\
Yohe recognizes that science alone cannot provide the answers. Testifying before the Senate's Energy Committee last March, Yohe said climate ""contrarians"" should be told:
\
""You're right! We don't know exactly how much warming the planet will experience over the next century. We are not sure precisely how local climates will change. ... We cannot guarantee that our fears about potentially dangerous climate change are justified, but you cannot be sure that they are not!""
\
Among his many activities, Yohe co-edited a 2006 book, ""Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change,"" that contains a paper on the likelihood of one of global warming's ""doomsday"" events -- the collapse of the heat-carrying Atlantic waters that contain the Gulf Stream.
\
Yohe himself worked on the modeling exercise with four scientists. Their results showed a 50 percent chance of collapse by 2100 if the temperature rises another 2 degrees Celsius.
\
""The take-home message is this is not an experiment we want to try with the only planet we have,"" Yohe said. ""There is a quantifiable risk it will happen, so we should take steps to assure it won't happen.""
\
Yohe has advised thinking of global warming as an insurance risk: One pays to prepare for disaster, despite uncertainty the disaster will occur. The form of insurance he favors is a tax on carbon that begins small, but rises steadily to push long-term investment decisions toward cleaner power plants and greener buildings.
\
""You have to stop adding emissions at some point. There are expensive ways to do it and cheap ways to do it,"" Yohe said in one of a series of interviews.
\
""You start modestly, so you don't crash the economy. ... You need a $10- or $15-a-ton tax on carbon. The critical thing is that it increases like an interest rate, forever."" He said a $10-a-ton carbon tax would add about a nickel to the price of a gallon of gas.
\
Yohe is one of five Americans among 60-odd experts in Brussels working on the report due today. It is a brief summary of a 1,500 page report on which Yohe served as a lead author.
\
""In our world he's a celebrity -- as close as we come to one,"" said a graduate student who attended a lecture Yohe gave at the University of Connecticut the week before he left for Brussels. Yohe's main topic was the British government's so-called Stern Review published last fall that predicted economic catastrophe if greenhouse gases are not checked.
\
The science behind the Stern Review is sound, he said, but its cost calculations are so far off-base they provide a ""slow-moving target"" to climate change skeptics.
\
""Nobody's clairvoyant,"" Yohe said, referring again to risk policy. ""The Senate can't subpoena Mother Nature to ask her what the climate sensitivity is going to be.""
\
Burning Embers
\
On the wall of his office at Wesleyan, Yohe has a large poster he calls the ""burning embers"" chart. For him, it is at once a personal souvenir and a powerful message.
\
He worked on the team that constructed it for the last big U.N. report in 2001. They intended the chart to capture in a single image the risks of global warming -- risks that are based on forecasts of climate sensitivity.
\
Sensitivity is the way scientists describe the link between rising temperatures and the buildup of greenhouse gases. But because the Earth's climate system is maddeningly complex, temperatures do not rise in lockstep with greenhouse gases. So scientists talk instead about the range of temperature increases most likely to result from any given concentration of greenhouse gases.
\
Then they must struggle to predict the damage the warming might ultimately do to the environment. In Yohe's ""burning embers"" chart, the potential damage is reflected in colored columns that bleed from safe white to fire alarm red across a scale of temperature increases.
\
With a single degree Celsius rise above the 0.7 degree warming that already has occurred, the poster's white indicates that the chance of a cataclysm, such as the rapid melting of polar ice sheets, is very low.
\
Yet for the same 1 degree rise, the poster's yellow shows plant and animal species already being harmed. At 2 degrees, the likely minimum warming now predicted by 2100, the poster turns mostly orange. At 4.5 degrees, the maximum, it is nearly all red for every kind of risk.
\
""Being in a room with 15 other smart people hammering out where the colors should change is pretty eye-opening,"" Yohe said.
\
He and his collaborators spent many hours over several days trying to decide what color hues to use for which risks, and whether the colors should melt into one another or change abruptly.
\
The embers chart now needs to be redrawn because of mounting evidence that global warming is changing the climate faster than expected in 2001.
\
""All those red lines are moving to the left,"" Yohe said, in the direction of greater risk.
\
Of C0[subscript 2] and Butterflies
\
Yohe, at 58, looks youthful, even with gray hair that falls over his forehead. He first confronted global warming in the early 1980s, a few years after he joined the Wesleyan faculty, when one of his former professors at Yale, William Nordhaus, asked his help with a National Academy of Sciences study of what effect emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, might have on temperature.
\
They didn't try to make disaster predictions. They projected how much more CO[subscript 2] would pour into the atmosphere from future economic growth and how much the temperature might rise as a result.
\
""We were in the `Let's see if there's a problem stage,'"" Yohe said. ""How warm could it get? How high could the atmospheric concentrations get, and what difference would it make?""
\
Their work produced a 2-inch-thick report filled with some of the first ""spaghetti graphs"" -- computer-generated tangles of lines that show the temperature rise under various scenarios.
\
Both professors are now internationally prominent. In a global warming issue published last fall, the Economist magazine described Nordhaus as ""the father of climate-change economics."" Nordhaus developed the first model to estimate the relative costs of containing global warming and the damage it might do.
\
Yohe, Nordhaus said, ""is very simply one of the world's outstanding economists"" in the area of global warming. Nordhaus, who also favors a carbon tax, said Yohe has done ""landmark"" work analyzing how rising sea levels might affect coastal property values.
\
He published one of his earliest papers, ""The Cost of Not Holding Back the Sea,"" in 1991, the year after the U.N. panel issued its first global warming review.
\
His most noticed paper, however, grew out of a friendly fight with Camille Parmesan, a butterfly biologist at the University of Texas.
\
While working together on a section of the 2001 U.N. report, they were in opposing camps over how much global warming was already affecting various species. Some, like the Edith's checker spot butterfly Parmesan studied, were disappearing from the warmest end of their ranges, while birds and plants on many continents were mating or blooming earlier in the spring.
\
""Biologists wanted to say we're already seeing the impact of climate change,"" Parmesan recalled. ""Economists thought that was too strong a statement. They believed in all the changes. But they had trouble accepting they were all due to climate change.""
\
To resolve the conflict, she and Yohe analyzed data dating back decades for more than 1,700 species for a common ""climate fingerprint."" Yohe, Parmesan said, helped sift out confounding local factors such as pollution or development.
\
""I thought up a little probability model,"" Yohe said. He designed it to capture all possible weaknesses in their data, including the publication biases of scientific journals. They wanted their conclusions, Yohe said, to be ""bulletproof.""
\
Their study, published in the journal Nature in 2003, became one of the most frequently cited in global warming literature.
\
Of the nearly 500 species it identified as changing their seasonal behavior, almost 90 percent were breeding, nesting, migrating or blooming earlier. Of the 434 species that shifted their ranges, 80 percent were moving away from heat -- toward the poles or up mountains.
\
The study did not consider whether the changes were harmful or beneficial. But Parmesan, in a survey published last November reported hundreds of species endangered, such as the polar bear. The harlequin frogs that lived in Central America's cloud forests had become extinct, killed by a fungus that climbed into their warmer, drier mountains.
\
Parmesan said her original argument with Yohe reflected the different way biologists and economists look at the future. Economists attach more importance to the immediate effect of a change on society. ""To a biologist, it's just the opposite. A tiny change now will magnify over the next 20 or 50 years.""
\
Yohe said economists have trouble capturing the full costs of climate change. They can estimate the net effect on agriculture or energy, but do less well with ""non-market"" effects.

54,"
REPUBLICANS are now clearly distinguished by their driving desire to lose. Every faction seems determined to rule the kingdom of irrelevance. Witness the reaction to the National Council for a New America, a ""listening tour"" by Republican officials kicked off at a pizza parlor in Northern Virginia. Social conservatives attacked this forum on education and the economy for the offense of not being a forum on abortion and the ""traditional"" family. Neo-Reaganites searched the transcript for nonexistent slights: How dare former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticize ""nostalgia"" for the ""good old days?"" Why didn't he just spit on President Ronald Reagan's grave? Other conservatives criticized the very idea of a listening tour, asking, ""What's to hear?""
\
Bush described himself as ""dumbfounded by the reaction."" He added: ""I don't think listening is a weakness. People are yearning to be heard. Perhaps we should begin with a little humility.""
\
There is much for Republicans to be humble about.
\
The party, says Bush, faces ""dramatically changing demographics, especially Hispanics in swing states,"" the ""alienation of young voters"" and a drop in support among college graduates.
\
""Trying to be all things to all people isn't going to work,"" Bush contends. The goal is ""not to redefine our beliefs, but to recognize challenges and adapt,"" particularly on national security, health care, education, the economy and the environment. Republicans need to ""focus on creating policies relevant to today -- not things relevant 20, 30 or 40 years ago.""
\
Bush insists a focus on creative policy can be unifying because ""conservatives have more in common than they disagree on.""
\
The Republican Party has been unified in opposition to President Barack Obama's continued accumulation of federal debt and power. On other issues, it seems Republicans are likely to pass through a series of wrenching debates before they arrive at ""policies relevant to today.""
\
Take the environment. For many Americans, concern about carbon emissions and climate disruption is no longer a conviction; it is a value. It is possible that skeptics -- the dominant Republican voices -- have uncovered a vast scientific delusion, like belief in phrenology. Given compelling evidence from glaciology, botany and marine biology, it seems unlikely.
\
Republicans have contributions to make on climate policy. They might support a carbon tax instead of a cap-and-trade system. They should insist that all revenues gained from a carbon tax or the sale of pollution permits go back to the people as lower taxes. But the main policy choice is binary: Should a cost be imposed on carbon emissions? If Republicans generally say no, they will not be viewed as an environmental party.
\
A similar argument can be made concerning health care. Obama's plan, in its nascent form, seems deeply flawed -- pushing workers toward a system resembling Medicare. Republicans have long supported alternatives that subsidize individual private health insurance. But these generally have been incremental, poorly explained and largely ignored.
\
A credible Republican alternative would employ a more generous refundable tax credit that enables the working poor to purchase basic health insurance. This is perhaps the only real alternative to socialization of health care. It is also costly.
\
Or, consider immigration. Immigrants hold diverse political views, but they make a determination about parties and politicians: Do they welcome us? The answer from Republicans often has been equivocal. Some of this is a matter of tone. But it is difficult to imagine a remedy to this impression of resentment without Republican support for immigration reform that includes legal status for temporary workers and a realistic path to citizenship.
\
Carbon restrictions, universal health insurance and immigration reform could eventually be important to the Republican recovery. But would a candidate carrying these ideas transform the Republican Party, or be destroyed by it? The hostile reaction to the pizza parlor putsch provides one answer.
\
This is a snapshot, not a prophecy. As the years pass, the kingdom of irrelevance seems less and less pleasant, even to its rulers. Policy shifts that seem incredible become inevitable. This is how a party prepares to win.

Not all the candidates appear in this issue of the election guide. Some did not respond to our requests for information. Others did reply, but too late for our print deadlines (however, their answers are posted online at www.courant.com/voterguide). And some do not appear in the guide online or in print because they are outside The Courant's primary coverage area. Write-in candidates were not included in the election guide.

\
ISSUE 1: Jobs and economic development.
\
Priority No. 1 is creating new jobs while protecting the ones we have. I'm confident I can lead an effort to bring new jobs to Connecticut, because it's something I've done before. As mayor of Stamford, I worked every day not only to create jobs in the city, but also to provide economic security by promoting a thriving economy. As governor, I will apply my experience and know-how every day to protect jobs and promote Connecticut as the place to grow businesses.
\
My running mate, Nancy Wyman, and I have put forward a comprehensive plan to create jobs in Connecticut.
\
Perhaps the boldest idea we've put forward is the creation of a new fund using close to a billion dollars in unused research and development tax credits to leverage new advanced manufacturing space. This plan, done correctly, could result in a $2 billion investment and as many as 30,000 direct jobs and 75,000 spin-off jobs. Other initiatives involve expanding state investment in stem cell research and other cutting-edge biomedical fields, and aggressively developing the state's three deep water ports to drive commerce.
\
Our full plan for jobs can be read at http://www.danmalloy.com/policy/.
\
ISSUE 2: Balancing the budget and getting our fiscal house in order.
\
For too long, Connecticut has suffered under leadership that refused to admit just how in the red we are. The result is a massive state deficit and the second-highest unfunded pension liability per capita in the country.
\
We need to be honest about our current problems. That's why I've called for a switch to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), so that we can accurately assess how big this hole is and what we need to do to climb out.
\
Then, we need to find smart ways to save money. I've set a goal of reducing the number of state agencies by a third by consolidating duplicative processes. I'd look at merging the state's three economic development agencies into one. I'd also suggest freezing compensation for political appointees, and I'd want to look for ways to stop providing cars for so many state employees outside law enforcement. And I'm committed to reducing political appointees under control of the governor's office by 15 percent. If we are to restore Connecticut's economic security, we need a fresh start, one based on experience and led by a governor who knows how to make it work.

EDUCATION: Undergraduate degree in economics from Harvard College and an MBA from Harvard Business School.

\
CIVIC INVOLVEMENT: I have served on two Governor's Commissions, I have been involved in improving our failing inner city schools and I support a number of charities focused mostly on improving opportunities for children and protecting the environment.
\
ISSUE 1: Bringing back jobs and the economy.
\
In order to restore the state's economy, our government must do more to support and attract employers. As governor, I will focus on keeping jobs here and making Connecticut a place where entrepreneurs and innovators want to start and build their businesses. I will convince out of state employers in seven industries to come here to create highly-skilled, high-paying jobs. The seven industries I have identified as having high potential for Connecticut include health care services, highly engineered manufacturing, financial services, medical devices, alternative energy, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.
\
I will make Connecticut more ""employer friendly"" by eliminating unnecessary mandates, regulations and fees that make it expensive for employers to hire Connecticut workers, changing the attitude of our government agencies to be sure they understand the importance of supporting employers and simplifying and expediting state approvals for employers seeking permits and services from state government. I will articulate a long-term economic policy for the state and veto any bills from our legislature that are inconsistent with that policy. This way our employers will have more consistency and certainty about Connecticut policy on taxes, employer mandates and regulations, which will make them more comfortable hiring and investing in Connecticut.
\
ISSUE 2: Reducing the cost and size of state government.
\
To avoid a financial calamity in Connecticut and create jobs, we must reduce the size and cost of state government without raising taxes. I have thoroughly reviewed the state budget and have identified ways to reduce state spending by $2 billion without reducing critical services. We will do more with less by, for example, eliminating wasteful or duplicate spending, applying ""best practices"" and ""comparative costing"" from the private sector to reduce costs, investing in improved information technology and systems to help our state work force be more productive, reducing the cost of delivering health care services statewide and shifting services to private contractors when they can provide those services for less.

ISSUE 1: Budget deficit.
\
The budget deficit is the greatest issue facing Connecticut. How the deficit is resolved will impact jobs, education, the environment, transportation, social services and energy policy. In the early 1990s the way out of the fiscal crisis was the implementation of an income tax. While I support the notion of an income tax, the state revenue the new tax generated allowed the legislature to ignore systemic governmental problems that have festered, leading to yet another economic meltdown.
\
Today we are facing a similar crossroads. My opponents both support the implementation of a ""local option"" tax, a premise that I oppose. Local option creates a new layer of taxation and a new diversion away from the difficult decisions that need to be made in order to restructure state bureaucracy. I support sharing the current state income and sales tax directly with municipalities. Ideally I would do so without raising the rates. But if it becomes a political necessity I would support increasing the sales tax by 1 percent, generating approximately $500 million in revenue that would be passed directly to towns, without strings. As the economy improved, I would strongly advocate reducing the sales tax rate, but leaving in place the 1 percent revenue stream for municipalities.
\
ISSUE 2: Restructuring state government.
\
Restructuring state government is issue 1a. The deficit cannot be addressed without significant change being implemented to reduce the cost and bureaucracy of state government. I believe Connecticut is a great product; unfortunately our user manual is too complicated. The dysfunctional state bureaucracy drives business out of state and prevents us from taking full advantage of the assets we do possess: location, quality of life and an educated and skilled workforce. As businesses leave so does the opportunity for our young people to stay in Connecticut and establish careers in rewarding fields.
\
As governor I will set a tone at the top that demands quality and value from every service the state provides. I will implement David Osborne's charter agency model. Charter agencies focus on creating effective paths to desired outcomes. Once the model has been tested on specific services, the results will roll out throughout departments and commissions. We will then restructure based on desired outcomes, not on existing bureaucratic silos. Outcome-driven organization will drive consolation of departments and commission, reducing cost and bureaucratic red tape.

\
ISSUE 1: State budget deficits/economic growth.
\
Addressing the multibillion-dollar state budget deficits forecast for the next two years and helping spark the state's economy will be the first priority of the Malloy/Wyman administration. We will achieve this by engaging all players in Connecticut's economy and state government to help us find solutions.
\
We have set a goal of reducing the number of state agencies by one-third, and the number of non-classified positions by 15 percent. We will also be seeking input from all agency heads and employees to find budget savings, and will work with state employee unions to streamline staffing without layoffs.
\
One of Connecticut's greatest assets is our tradition of innovation and entrepreneurship, and that is what will fuel our economic future. Our agenda will include: reducing health care and energy costs to make the state more business-friendly. Making statewide improvements in infrastructure and transportation. Investing in research and development with the potential to generate 30,000 direct jobs and 75,000 spin-off jobs. A hands-on business recruitment effort based on Dan's experience bringing outside businesses and their jobs to Stamford. Investing in high-tech and bioscience industries while working to revitalize the state's manufacturing industry. Revive our state's vital marketing budget.
\
ISSUE 2: Health care.
\
In order to generate strong and sustained job creation, cutting health insurance costs must be part of the solution. Connecticut is among the most expensive states in the country for a business to buy insurance, which creates an enormous obstacle to hiring more workers.
\
Dan Malloy has a track record in Stamford of creating jobs and I have a track record as comptroller of keeping health care costs down - in the state employee plan and for small businesses and municipalities. We strongly believe that we must allow small businesses to group together to buy health insurance in order to lower costs.
\
Our agenda will focus on reducing state spending on health care and making every dollar that we do spend count. It will include: changing the state's fiscal focus from paying the high costs of advanced preventable illness to prevention, early detection and treatment. Working with the congressional delegation to get our fair share of Medicaid and Medicare dollars. Forming strategic partnerships with community health centers. Properly funding nursing homes to cover the actual costs of providing care. Expanding HUSKY Primary Care to 400,000 low income children and parents. Making mental health care a priority.

\
ISSUE 1: Creating a stable economic environment where businesses can compete and consumers are protected.
\
Job creation is the most important issue facing the state and I recognize the economic challenges facing individuals and businesses across Connecticut. A competitive business environment and a level playing field for businesses are critical components of Connecticut's long-term growth. Small businesses are the engines of job growth and historically account for more than 90 percent of new jobs. Honest businesses can't compete against fraudulent businesses that don't play by the rules and prey on consumers and small businesses alike. As attorney general, I will work to promote fair competition and fight to create a better business environment for small businesses.
\
One of the biggest challenges facing the business community is energy costs. Investing in energy conservation will help to reduce demand, lower energy costs and help to keep energy dollars here in Connecticut. Those dollars will have a ripple effect on the Connecticut economy and help to create jobs. As attorney general, I will enforce the law and protect the public interest, but also consider how decisions made by the office affect business, economic development and jobs.
\
ISSUE 2: Consumer protection.
\
As attorney general, I will vigorously protect the state, our citizens and businesses from deceptive business practices. In tough times, we need to be especially watchful for consumer scams, con artists who prey upon our elderly and dishonest businesses. The attorney general is often the last defense for citizens who are not able to defend themselves. When a home improvement contractor takes a deposit and then walks away from the job, when polluters refuse to follow the law, when insurance companies refuse to provide the benefits they promised, the average person on their own is often powerless. The attorney general should be their champion.
\
One of my first tasks as attorney general will be to seek enabling legislation from the Connecticut legislature, as provided under the federal Dodd/Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. With enabling legislation, the attorney general's office could protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices by mortgage brokers, mortgage originators, mortgage servicers, non-bank lenders, foreclosure scam operators, debt collectors, consumer reporting agencies, student lenders, pay-day lenders and other consumer financial organizations. The failure of any adequate regulation over these financial organizations was primarily responsible for our current difficult economy.

\
ISSUE 1: Restore common sense.
\
My first priority as attorney general is to restore common sense to the attorney general's office so that law-abiding businesses and individuals can flourish again in Connecticut. The resurgence of a strong and competitive economy turns, in part, on recreating a legal climate in Connecticut that is based on fair and just law enforcement.
\
Legal actions by the AG's office will be the minimum necessary to achieve compliance with the law. I will end the practice of trial by press release that drives law-abiding companies away from Connecticut. I will vigorously enforce consumer protection and environmental laws, so that Connecticut continues to be a desirable place to live. I will end the state's unfortunate practice of bringing frivolous lawsuits so that only those cases that are supported by strong facts and clear law go forward in court.
\
I have the legal experience both on the side of law-abiding businesses and on the side of consumers and the environment to accomplish these objectives. In short, as attorney general, I will ensure that the AG's office is no longer part of the problem and is, instead, part of the solution.
\
ISSUE 2: End violations of the Constitution.
\
My second priority is to end federal and state government practices that violate the Constitution.
\
I will work to ensure that government stays within the constitutional limits on its power by: challenging the part of Obamacare that forces every American citizen to purchase a product; ending the inappropriate use of the AG's office to ""raise revenue,"" since this is the exclusive province of the legislature and this action by an AG is a gross abuse of power; and working with the legislature to reform Connecticut's eminent domain law so that never again does the government take private property and give it to a private developer in violation of citizens' property rights.

\
ISSUE 1: Government corruption and abuse of authority.
\
Our federal government spies on us, censors the news, interferes with our right to dissent, wages war illegally, tortures prisoners and depletes the public treasury without limit or accountability, all in defiance of our laws. At any given time, there is a host of mayors, governors, members of Congress and lesser officials answering accusations of bribery and abuse of power, usually without a significant risk of criminal prosecution. In Connecticut and across the country, Democrats and Republicans have apportioned graft and patronage so neatly that corrupt practice is mostly taken for granted in the public sector.
\
When it comes to holding public officials accountable for malfeasance, our state leadership has been a dead thing, capitulating to such grievous abuses of authority as the illegal deployment of our state militia for the armed occupation of foreign countries. State attorneys general can and should act in concert to end such abuses of authority. The attorney general should welcome complaints from government whistleblowers and people hurt by government corruption and pursue aggressively any and all crooked officials, regardless of party and regardless of office.
\
ISSUE 2: Injustice.
\
Equality before the law has ceased to be an objective of government. Legal proceedings are biased in favor of the rich and powerful. High-quality public education is rationed in a way that favors children of privilege and leaves the least fortunate pupils illiterate and unprepared for the rigors of life. Health care is reserved for the highest-paid segment of the work force. Public policy leaves the poor to bear a disproportionate share of the burdens of everyday living. Between late-payment penalties, up-front check-cashing fees, usurious interest on petty indebtedness, excessive bail bonds, for-profit jails and similar schemes to bleed the vulnerable, it has become easy to make a fortune exploiting the misfortune of others.
\
Workers lucky enough to have jobs earn far less than the value of their labor, and the unemployed are reduced to desperation, thereby keeping workers in constant fear for their livelihood. In spite of the social dislocations that accompany poverty, irresponsible government has increased the gap between the rich and poor and concentrated wealth in fewer and fewer hands. An independent attorney general could advocate humane public policy and protect the underprivileged from predation at the hands of greedy private parties and unscrupulous government officials.

In the 2010 legislative session, I authored a major jobs bill that supports small businesses, provides for job training for the unemployed, encourages the development of high tech industry, increases exporting assistance and fundamentally changes the state's economic development strategy. This initiative was a collaborative effort between the House and Senate, both political parties, the governor's office and leaders from business, labor and academics along with entrepreneurs and economists.
\
The secretary of the state's office is where most new businesses in Connecticut begin. As these businesses incorporate, the state must play the role of an advocate and a proactive partner for the success of new entrepreneurial ventures, fighting hard to reduce costs for small business. I will work to streamline the delivery of services from the secretary of the state's office and maximize web-based capabilities. We will find ways to eliminate duplicative forms and reports. By the time I leave office, I want businesses to be able to file and submit information online.
\
ISSUE 2: Increasing voter participation.
\
As our state faces historic challenges, we need more citizen participation, and increasing the number of voters who cast ballots on Election Day is the place to start. There is no greater way to demonstrate our patriotism than voting, but, sadly, many people feel that it makes no difference. To increase voter participation, we need to change attitudes and procedures.
\
We must make voting and registering to vote easier and more convenient. States that have instituted forms of early voting and no excuse absentee voting have seen voter turnout rates as much as 10-15 percent higher than states that have not made these reforms.
\
We need to give that a serious look in Connecticut.
\
Our state's population is changing, and as secretary of the state, I want to improve our efforts to reach out to our new citizens whose first language might not be English and make sure they, too, are active voters.
\
As a former teacher, I know that this civic outreach must begin with children, parents, community organizations and educators, and that is exactly what I will do as secretary of the state.

OCCUPATION: Commissioner, Department of Consumer Protection, state of Connecticut.

\
ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
The true economic engines of the American economy are small businesses. Farrell spent 11 years working in a small family business - and many of his legal clients had similar small, family-owned businesses. Jerry knows how challenging it is to earn the trust of each customer, all the while meeting a payroll, paying bills and keeping your head above water. He will act as an advocate for the interests of small business at the Capitol and around the state; he will establish a mentoring program, where established businesspeople can volunteer to give advice and assistance to new business owners and he will take the existing resources of the office and mobilize and reorganize them to assist those who want to create and expand small businesses. He will act as an advocate for the interests of small business at the Capitol and around the state. He will establish a mentoring program, where established businesspeople can volunteer to give advice and assistance to new business owners.
\
ISSUE 2: Technology and government efficiency.
\
Farrell has already begun this process as commissioner of the Department Consumer Protection. He has put in place a system consolidating the department's records and licensing systems. Once implemented, he recruited another agency to abandon its own similar plan and brought that agency into ours - saving taxpayers millions of dollars! By consolidating the state's record-keeping and using technology to reduce paperwork throughout the state, each agency can focus on its mission without the burdensome costs of paperwork and storage. Using the secretary of the state's constitutional authority, Farrell will fully implement this plan statewide, which could lead to millions of dollars saved each year.

\
ISSUE 1: Toolbox of Democracy.
\
A direct democracy proposal that puts you in the political driver's seat and creates more choices and more voices. Here are the tools that I support:
\
Immediate reform of Connecticut's campaign finance law. As the Green Party candidate for secretary of the state, why do I have to collect 208,000 valid signatures to get state campaign grants of more than a million dollars, when my two major opponents have to collect zero signatures to qualify for the same grant?
\
Initiative and referendum allowing voters to accept or reject statutes and proposals on their ballots.
\
Term limits of 10 years for the Connecticut House and Senate and eight years for statewide office.
\
Enactment of proportional representation that would allow minor parties one at-large House voting seat for every 15,000 votes cast for that party in all House legislative elections.
\
Instant runoff voting allowing voters to rank their preferences for candidates on the ballot and gives voters the ability to transfer their first choice to a second candidate if their first choice does not get a majority.
\
Ballot access reform.
\
Charter revocation for corporations convicted of crimes.
\
ISSUE 2: The Green New Deal.
\
The Green New Deal is a national Green Party program to create economic prosperity and ecological sustainability. Here are the details:
\
Create millions of jobs through massive public investment in renewable energy, mass transit and conservation. Create 200,000 Green jobs for Connecticut each year paid for by cuts in military spending.
\
Reduce military spending by at least 70 percent and bring our war dollars home to save our economy.
\
Establish ambitious, science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and enact legislation to establish a carbon tax.
\
Establish an enhanced and preventive medicine based Medicare that covers everyone in the United States.
\
Institute tuition-free public higher education for all students.
\
Change trade agreements to protect labor, environmental, consumer, health and safety standards. Create fair trade, not free trade.
\
Institute drug reform legislation, stop sending people to jail for drug offenses and offer effective and humane solutions to hard drug addiction.
\
Enact tough limits on credit card interest and lending rates and institute strict financial regulation. Create a progressive tax reform program.
\
Amend the U.S. Constitution to abolish corporate personhood and create a Green commonwealth based on social justice, sustainability, progressive economics and international peace.

\
ISSUE 1: Ballot access.
\
Restrictive ballot access laws exist solely to protect the entrenched Republican and Democrat parties and keep them in power. They prevent the voters from having any real choice in the voting booth. They unfairly suppress political opposition. Opponents of easy ballot access have argued that we would be swamped with candidates, making it unworkable, but that is untrue. Some states have very easy ballot access and they have never been troubled with a deluge of candidates. The foundation of our republic is based on free, open and honest elections. That foundation is weakened when access to the ballot is guaranteed for the major parties and severely restricted for third parties. Restrictive ballot access laws are simply un-American and represent a blight on the political health of our state.
\
ISSUE 2: Eliminate public campaign financing.
\
It is a serious violation of everyone's First Amendment right to free speech to use taxpayer money to fund political speech. Citizens are forced to subsidize political speech even if they oppose a candidate and his or her views. When our country was founded, it was clearly understood that political speech was the most in need of protection. Rulers throughout history kept power, in part, by silencing their opponents. The First Amendment to the Constitution was intended by the Founding Fathers to ensure that no person would ever have his right to unrestricted political speech hindered by those in power. It is just as serious a breach to force me to endorse, by using my tax money, the political speech of someone I oppose as it is to prohibit me from expressing my own views.

\
ISSUE 1: State deficit.
\
These difficult economic times with a looming state deficit require prudent and innovative ways to save the state, and therefore taxpayers, money. As treasurer, I have proven this is not only an issue for a campaign, but also for the day-to-day management of the state treasury. The treasurer must know how to exercise fiscal discipline, understand the core responsibilities of the office and know how to navigate the intricacies of capital markets with precision and effective risk management. This means that the state should not look for short-term savings by deferring any portion of its contribution to the state employees' retirement fund as it struggles to close the projected $3 billion budget deficit during the next biennium. That would not solve the state's structural budget imbalance and instead would merely add to the state's significant long-term unfunded pension liability. We must set aside short-term quick fixes that shortchange the state's future fiscal health. As an example, I will support a legislative proposal to require an actuarial assessment of any change to the state pension funds to fully understand its long-term impact. That is required currently for the municipal employees fund and should be required for the state employees pension fund.
\
ISSUE 2: Guard Connecticut's money.
\
As treasurer, I will continue to be a diligent guardian of the people's money and bring with that the attitude that every dollar counts. Those dollars really count when it comes to investing in Connecticut and its people. We are going to have to fight our way out of this recession, and to do that we need to expand our state's tax base while retaining and creating much-needed jobs. As treasurer, I have worked to ensure that Connecticut invests its money with banks and credit unions within our state so that businesses have access to the capital they need to generate jobs and economic activity in our own backyard. If I am fortunate enough to serve again as treasurer, I will continue to look for investment opportunities right here at home, including potential infrastructure investment opportunities so necessary for Connecticut's economic future.

\
ISSUE 1: The budget deficit and government efficiency.
\
Connecticut needs to make better, smarter budget decisions. The current practices have led to a 1950s government trying to compete in 2010 and beyond. There are layer upon layer of good (and not-so-good) ideas and programs, without a real discussion of effectiveness, mission and the role of government. We need to break the budget down, identify savings and rebuild based on today's needs and the growing, emerging needs of the coming decade. Another way to gain ground in the state budget deficit battle is by consolidating the acquisition of health care, an area where the comptroller's office has responsibility for more than $1 billion in purchasing, while another $5 billion-plus in health care is purchased by other state agencies. That means a significant portion of our $19 billion state budget is negotiated by multiple agencies with no collaboration. By consolidating health care purchasing and bringing the process under a common negotiator, the state not only has the potential to save the state millions, but would more easily allow for the implementation of cost-saving measures like electronic medical records and ""medical homes.""
\
ISSUE 2: Transparency in government spending; rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.
\
People have a right to know how government spends their hard-earned tax dollars. Greater transparency in our business practice gives residents the information they need to form opinions and take positions. The comptroller's office took a significant step forward on this issue when they created the Bond Allocation Database. I'm committed to building on this effort. As comptroller, I will work to provide access to state financial documents that detail what was spent, for what purpose, to accomplish what goal and at what value? We will compare the quality and cost of what we do with other, similarly situated states. This information will be held in a searchable, online database that is available to the public through the state website and updated regularly.
\
I am also committed to using the auditing authority of the comptroller's office to identify waste, fraud and abuse, and to put safeguards in place that prevent future mismanagement of resources.

\
ISSUE 1: Stop out of control state spending and tax increases.
\
I will use my successful business experience and decision-making ability to bring fiscal responsibility and common sense to Hartford in order to clean up the financial mess. I will help create an environment where business can grow and good paying jobs can be created.
\
As the state's chief financial officer, I will insist on financial transparency (including GAAP accounting) and will work towards a balanced budget without more taxes or debt. As the taxpayers' advocate, I will always give the unvarnished facts and I will put the heat on those politicians and bureaucrats who make irresponsible and wasteful budget decisions.
\
I have always made the hard decisions needed to successfully balance budgets, run an efficient operation and create jobs. I will bring this real world experience and success to Hartford and do the same for all of our citizens. Taxpayers will have a seat at the table when decisions are made by the politicians and bureaucrats on spending their hard-earned tax dollars. It's time for real world experience for a real difference for you.
\
ISSUE 2: Controlling health care costs with common sense and consumer involvement.
\
We must ""bend"" the cost curve for medical expenses with common sense approaches that are embraced by health care consumers if we are to achieve the goal of high quality and affordable health care for everyone.
\
Consumers need to be given incentives for health effective and cost saving usage, allowed flexibility on the more than 54 state mandates in order to get accessible plans and private insurers need to be subjected to more competition and constraints on promotional costs. Additional cost reductions will come from electronic medical records, medical malpractice reform wellness and the flexibility with the certificate of need.
\
These actions are the real path to cost control where there is less government intervention and more consumer activism with private insurers. As comptroller, I will institute these cost reducing reforms.
\
Therefore, I will oppose the public option, taxpayer-funded health care plan, SustiNet. This big government program will cost billions to taxpayers and will eventually destroy private health care.

EDUCATION THAT 'STRANGLES THE SPIRIT'
\
An educational environment defined by repetitive testing promotes anger and frustration. Suffocating individuality, creativity and artistic endeavors dehumanizes students.
\
Graduates not having discovered who they are and what they want to do are at a grave disadvantage. Killing the roots, focusing on the stem and ignoring the branches destroys balance and robs the heart of compassion, of that creative energy that adds meaning beyond the confines of a test.
\
Eliminating moments of movement, dance, art, song, tears and laughter with tests and drugs to subdue the body into attentive submission strangles the spirit and yields cognitive sterility.

John Michaels' May 30 letter, ""The NRA Wins Again,"" demonstrates an ignorance of how the current background-check system works when buying a gun at retail.

If the authorities knew that this man was dangerous, they could have taken steps to have him committed for treatment and then reported this to the background-check system. He would then be disqualified from buying a gun at retail under current law.

REAL ON SCIENCE
\
I am a Republican primarily following the principles of Teddy Roosevelt, who led the country in protecting the environment. I continue to support local and state Republican candidates and officeholders because they support reasonable goals while keeping budgets in check.
\
I have not recently supported national Republicans because the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has repeatedly tried to block or repeal environmental regulations that would save lives and save more in health costs than those regulations cost.
\
In order to win elections in states where a majority of voters believe in science, here is a suggested statement for candidates:
\
""I believe in global warming and climate change, but I believe we can deal with it without a lot of expensive, cumbersome regulations. One solution would be a revenue-neutral carbon tax. We could eliminate subsidies for the burning of high-carbon-dioxide-emitting fuels instead of subsidizing renewable generation -- a market-based solution.""

57,"I remember being 8 years old and feeling the shock of learning that the Perfect-Earth-As-I-Knew-It was not fixed, was not a permanent Garden of Eden achieved after millenniums of shifting continents.\I remember absorbing the dizzying knowledge that the Earth was still changing; was, indeed, alive. I remember confusion in fourth grade after learning about how terrible cars were for the environment. I couldn't wrap my 9-year-old brain around this absurdity - were we not smart enough to find another way?\I remember becoming sick to my stomach in fifth grade after researching acid rain for a science fair project. I remember the sharp pang as my junior high peers laughed, ""Who cares about global warming? I won't even be alive then!""\In a high school science class, I watched ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and was unable to sleep for days. I remember fellow teenagers whispering headlines in homeroom: ""If we don't do so-and-so within the next four years, it's over,"" ""If so-and-so doesn't get passed, it's over.""\For a while in my high school, it became cool to know these things. It was cool to announce Doomsday. ""It's over"" was the theme. ""It's over"" was unacceptable.\When I was 17, I organized a benefit concert for the Environmental Defense Fund. It felt embarrassing, because it was so not enough. A classical pianist, I got my pianist friends together and we booked a church with a grand piano and we printed off facts, fliers and handouts. On the day of the concert, a tornado was hitting the ground miles away. Severe weather was spiraling across Minnesota; winds were strong, roads were closed. I played Chopin's ""Fantasy"" to a smattering of people while piercing sirens sounded outside. Ninety percent of the papers we'd printed got thrown into a recycling bin. The irony was poignant.\It's one decade later. The Trump administration is only a few days old. I joined the women's march in New York City, where concerns about the health of our planet played a significant role. Small children with handmade signs walked together chanting, ""Climate change is real! Climate change is real!"" It would have been adorable had it not been so eerily powerful.\I'm still feeling like 9-year-old me, unable to wrap my brain around new facts: The Environmental Protection Agency can't tweet? The president says environmentalism is ""out of control""? We're back to running the pipelines through the Dakotas? What?\It is as astounding to me now as it was when I was in grade school that caring for our environment is perceived as a partisan issue. Clean energy is vital to everyone. In a divided country, it seems that at the very least we could unite in the desire to have a healthy planet and a livable world for future generations.\Thankfully, this sentiment is at the heart of Citizens' Climate Lobby. It is the most hopeful experience I've had as an Obama-spoiled young person since the election.\Citizens' Climate Lobby is fighting for the passage of carbon fee and dividend legislation, and is responsible for the formation of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House of Representatives, which currently consists of 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats. This bipartisan legislative effort supports passage of a revenue-neutral carbon tax with 100 percent of the net revenue returned to households. It will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it will save lives, it will boost the economy and a revenue-neutral carbon fee already has the support of Democrats and Republicans alike (yes, even Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson).\Pushing for a revenue-neutral carbon fee is the most effective path to environmental gains under the current administration. If you're feeling paralyzed by the number of issues you care about that are under attack, I urge you to truly, seriously, begin here. Without clean energy, there won't be anything else to fight for.\Lillie Gardner, 26, of West Hartford is studying for her doctorate in musical arts in piano performance at the University of Connecticut and is a member of Citizens' Climate Lobby.\The Courant invites writers younger than 30 to write essays of 650 words or less containing strong views.

58,"
The global economy must be radically restructured to curb the world's gluttonous appetite for resources and its climate-warming ways, or it will face ecological and social collapse, environmental guru Lester Brown said Saturday.
\
He acknowledged that most of the 200 people listening to his lecture at Wesleyan's Exley Science Center may already agree with him.
\
And as for everyone else, he said, ""What's happening in China will convince the rest of us.""
\
Brown brought his urgent and gloomy message -- and a hopeful look at the future -- to Wesleyan's third annual environmental studies symposium, which was focused on how we are vulnerable to global climate change.
\
Speakers looked at the possible increase in diseases such as malaria and other public health problems; the potential for more severe hurricanes; and how society might best respond to the challenges posed by a warming Earth.
\
Brown is president of the Earth Policy Institute, founder of the Worldwatch Institute and the author of scores of books. His talk Saturday mirrored his latest book, ""Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble.""
\
The economy, he contends, is on an unsustainable path that will lead to the breakdown of the environment and social order -- but we already have some of the means by which to extricate ourselves from this mess.
\
If a fast-developing country such as China models its economy after the United States, it will overwhelm the world's ability to provide what it needs to survive, Brown argued. China already has passed the United States in total consumption of basic resources, except for oil, Brown said.
\
If China's 1.4 billion people eventually come to match the U.S. in per capita consumption, the drain on resources would be staggering: twice what the world currently produces in paper, more than a billion cars, and more oil in a day than the world currently produces.
\
China teaches us that the Western model, the ""throw-away economy,"" won't work for China, ""nor for others in developing countries who are dreaming the American dream,"" he said.
\
""We are consuming renewable resources faster than they can regenerate,"" Brown writes in his book. ""Forests are shrinking, grasslands are deteriorating, water tables are falling, fisheries are collapsing, and soils are eroding. ... And we are discharging greenhouse gases into the atmosphere faster than nature can absorb them, setting the stage for a rise in the earth's temperature well above any since agriculture began.""
\
History illustrates how misuse of the environment destroyed civilizations such as the Sumerians and the Mayans, he said.
\
But Brown's vision includes solutions, many of which are already here: renewable energy from wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower and biofuels; alternative transportation such as hybrid cars, light rail and bicycles; and an economy built around reusable products and more efficient manufacturing and agriculture.
\
""We see it in the wind farms of Western Europe,"" which are already providing power to 40 million people, he said. He cited solar rooftops in Japan, geothermal energy in Iceland, the bicycle- friendly streets of Amsterdam and Copenhagen, and the growth of hybrid cars in the United States.
\
Brown issued a warning about the push to turn corn into biofuel, however.
\
As the price for ethanol grows more competitive with oil, more corn will be consumed as fuel, and that means less for food. And much of what we eat is corn-based, from beef raised on corn to milk and eggs to soft drinks and other processed foods.
\
So, the price of food will start to go up. As with many of the projected impacts of global warming, higher prices and shortages of food will hit harder on poor and developing countries.
\
Brown said the amount of grain needed to fill a car's tank with ethanol would feed a person for a year, and the entire grain harvest in the U.S. would supply only 16 percent of our energy needs. A far better system, he said, would have everyone driving gas-electric hybrid cars whose batteries are charged by wind-power-generated electricity.
\
Wind power ""is abundant, cheap, inexhaustible, widely distributed, clean, climate-benign, and it's ours: No one can cut off the supply, and the price never goes up,"" Brown said.
\
The key to change, Brown said, ""is to get the market to tell the truth"" about the costs we pay for our way of living. Gasoline may cost about $3 a gallon, but that does not include the cost of breathing polluted air and the effects of global warming caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions.
\
He said the United States needs to restructure its tax system to replace the income tax with a carbon tax to better reflect the costs of consuming fossil fuels.
\
Above all, he said, the need to deal with global warming is urgent. We have already set in motion changes to the climate that we won't feel for decades. ""Nature is the time-keeper,"" he said, ""and we can't see the clock.""
\
He urged the audience to become politically active in the push for change. As inspiration, he cited some of the dramatic changes of the past century -- the U.S. mobilization at the start of World War II and the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.
\
""Change can come quickly if we're convinced of the need for it.""

IRANIAN DEAL DETAILS IMPORTANT
\
President Barack Obama presented his rationale on Tuesday morning for encouraging Congress and the American people to approve the just-negotiated nuclear treaty with Iran. In addition, Secretary of State John Kerry gave some more specific technical details that after thoughtful review had been included within the document.
\
I contrast this with two Republicans, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Tom Cotton, who without benefit of reviewing or even seeing the specific treaty components, condemned its intent and effectiveness.
\
It's a familiar pattern as political rhetoric, already written before any thorough review or intellectual discussion, is proclaimed as truth. How can they be against something they have not studied or at least been briefed on by experts?
\
We need to sift through all of this political rhetoric and really listen to the technical and scientific safeguards that will monitor and prevent Iran from proceeding with its nuclear arms program. I believe this treaty is a necessary step in furthering our goal of eventual stability in the Middle East. Israel is our strongest ally there, and this treaty should not place it in a more vulnerable position.
\
Just as our scientists' and technical experts' testimony needs to be heard on environmental issues, so do they need to be consulted with nuclear treaties. Politicians should heed their advice.

A CRISIS UNTIL WAYS CHANGE
\
The Courant is right to warn taxpayers to prepare for more budgetary problems ahead [July 1, editorial, ""State Budget Is Better, But Problems Will Return""].
\
The state's budget chief has said Connecticut is in a ""permanent fiscal crisis."" More large deficits soon await us.
\
How long will we remain in crisis mode? As long as budgets are passed that do little to change the structure of how our state taxes and spends.

GOOD ROADS, GOOD GOVERNMENT
\
The editorial ""Another Old Bridge Breaks"" [July 9] insists that we are going to need money to fix our infrastructure. Taxpayers should ask, ""What happened to the money we already gave the state?""
\
Connecticut has had higher gas taxes than Rhode Island for decades. Are our highways in better shape than theirs?
\
The problem isn't money. The problem is how the government spends the money. A good infrastructure takes more than taxes. It requires planning, budgeting, design and implementation. It takes inspections and maintenance.
\
We have been building highways and bridges for more than 100 years. Why aren't our highways the best in the country? Why can't we get rid of the lights on Route 9 in Middletown? They have been causing accidents and traffic jams for 50 years.

\
STRONG BENEFIT OF ELECTRIC CARS
\
A letter writer asks why rebates on electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles make economic sense [July 2,""Why Offer Rebates For Electric Cars?""]. The answer is simple: Carbon dioxide from fossil fuels is causing enormous damage to the environment through climate change and ocean acidification. Any investment that reduces this damage will pay for itself many times over.
\
With the current mix of electricity sources in Connecticut, an electric car will cause far less carbon dioxide emissions than even a hybrid car. As the electric grid adds more solar and wind power, emissions from electric cars will eventually be reduced to zero.
\
It is essential for governments to use rebates and taxes in a way that reflects the true costs of technology. The rebates for hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles are entirely justified, but so far they have had only a modest effect. Ultimately, a substantial carbon tax will also be needed.

What Bill O'Reilly has discovered is that his publishers do not require of him real sources and data to back up his claims and calumny. Joe Nocera wrote in the New York Times last week that the economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a leader of the conservative American Action Forum, complains that the right wing is too sloppy on data. Defending the Export-Import Bank, which conservatives were attacking, Holz-Eakin said, ""I think too many conservative arguments are made on the basis of ideology and faith. We are dedicated to the numbers at A.A.F. We can't just assert that markets work; we have to show it."" It is time for the New Haven Register to hold its regular columnists to the Holz-Eakin standard of good journalism.
\
Bill O'Reilly diminishes the reputation of the Register with his unsupported partisan barbs and mudslinging. April 25, the target was again President Barack Obama. There is no question but that the world is a messy and dangerous place, but to read O'Reilly, the messes in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen and Russia are all Obama's fault. Such grandiose assertions sound impressive, until you remember that the disastrous war with Iraq was the misguided adventure against non-existent weapons of mass destruction of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz. Each trillion-dollar disaster seemed to contribute to the next. But don't take my word for it, the disaster was well reported by several writers, especially Bob Woodward, in his book, ""State of Denial.""
\
O'Reilly's list of disasters is a real list, but it is slimy to insist that Barack Obama is to blame for any of them without support or facts. For the rise of ISIS, to pick another example, the backbone of ISIS is reportedly remnants of the dismissed Sunni Iraq Army, which was fired by G.W. Bush and Rumsfeld after they were promised that they could run the country if they surrendered quickly to the U.S. invasion, which they did. Now they are getting back on their betrayers. O'Reilly also mocks Obama for saying that ""the greatest threat to our planet ... is climate change."" Again no facts, figures or sources, just, ""the administration is chasing the chimera of global warming."" That bombast is his support. There are many facts and stories that he ignores. The problems in Syria and Egypt started because of pressures from over-population, and an extended draught which destroyed the livelihood of many farmers. The droughts were exacerbated by climate change, according to leading scientists, reported Tom Friedman and others in the New York Times. Visitors to the Caribbean report that the coral reefs are dying or are dead.
\
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says on its website that they are the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988 to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts. From IPCCfacts.org: ""More than 2,000 scientists from 154 countries typically participate in the IPCC process."" The story I keep reading from reputable journalists, is that 97 percent of real climate scientists agree that climate change is a huge threat. The other 3 percent are either not real scientists, or are on the payroll of the oil, gas and coal companies and their owners, like the Koch brothers.

HOW is it possible that BP chief executive Tony Hayward hasn't been fired? At this point, how can anyone believe a word the man says? If he told me my mother loves me, I'd want a second source. Hayward has apologized for his one lapse of candor -- the now-famous whine May 29 that ""I'd like my life back."" It must be a nice life indeed: According to Forbes, Hayward's total compensation from BP in 2009 was about $4.6 million. The Louisiana fishermen who've been put out of work by the oil spill are accustomed to getting by on considerably less. In a Facebook posting, Hayward said his callous words ""don't represent how I feel about this tragedy, and certainly don't represent the hearts of the people of BP.""
\
Within hours, though, Hayward's foot was firmly lodged in his mouth yet again. The effort to contain the oil and keep it away from the Gulf Coast has been ""very successful,"" he told the Financial Times. ""Considering how big this has been, very little has got away from us.""
\
This sunny assessment came as television networks broadcast images of oil-soaked Louisiana marshes, where hazmat-suited workers -- who said they were under orders from BP not to talk to the media, on pain of getting fired -- were trying to sop up the mess with what looked like rags, as if this were a gargantuan kitchen mishap. Meanwhile, mousse-like clumps of ""weathered"" oil were being washed onto beaches in Alabama, and authorities in Florida were watching the approach of a menacing, oily sheen. Scientists have not even begun to assess the potential long-term effects of the oil spill on human health, marine life and coastal ecology. Carol Browner, the president's chief adviser on energy and the environment, said that the Deepwater Horizon incident is already the worst environmental disaster in United States history.
\
Give yourself another pat on the back, Tony.
\
Adm. Thad Allen, who is directing the response effort, is a nice guy -- in terms of his public handling of BP, too nice. On Thursday, as BP proceeded with its latest attempt to cap the flow, Allen praised the company for providing several different camera views of the action on the sea floor. But for weeks, BP refused to make public any television images of the oil leak, and relented only under pressure from U.S. officials.
\
Hayward's statements about the effort to plug the well have been consistently unreliable, and it hardly matters whether he's being deliberately misleading or just overly optimistic. The giant containment dome was going to work; it didn't. The second, much smaller containment dome would do the job; it was never even deployed. The ""top kill"" procedure was surely going to stop the flow, and early indications, according to Hayward, showed it was succeeding. Yet oil industry veterans such as T. Boone Pickens said the top kill was a long shot at best, and they were right.
\
And as for those giant underwater oil plumes that scientists and journalists keep discovering? Hayward denies they exist. His position is that of a philanderer caught in the act by an irate spouse: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?""
\
Since the explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig six weeks ago, BP's stock has lost more than a third of its value. Two ratings firms, Fitch and Moody's, have downgraded the company's long-term debt, and estimates of what it will finally cost BP to stop the leak and clean up its mess range from $3 billion to $30 billion. All this happened on Hayward's watch.
\
Somebody, please, give the man his life back.
\
But once that's done, let's turn our ire on the real villains. This exercise will require a mirror.
\
An accident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout was bound to happen sooner or later. There are nearly 4,000 oil rigs off the Gulf Coast, and those pumping most of the crude are in deep waters -- where, as we now know, state-of-the-art safety procedures are inadequate. President Barack Obama's moratorium on deep-water drilling will last only long enough for some sort of technological Band-Aid to be devised. Then we'll crank up the drills once again.
\
We know that our dependence on oil is ultimately ruinous, yet we refuse to take measures -- a meaningful carbon tax, for example -- to ease it. Long after Tony Hayward answers for his sins, we'll be paying for our own.

63,"
The departure of Commissioner Daniel C. Esty from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection next month leaves Connecticut with a broadly consolidated agency and an invigorated handle on energy issues.
\
Esty, the Yale University professor and environmental consultant hired months after Gov. Dannel P. Malloy took office, said Wednesday that he was resigning to resume his tenured position at Yale Law School in New Haven because his university-issued leave of absence ends in July.
\
His departure is effective Feb. 3, two days before state lawmakers begin the year's legislative session. No successor was named, although the governor's office said that it would release a name in coming weeks.
\
The understanding between Esty and Malloy was always that he would stay for three years, Esty said. The early exit, months before the end of his official leave, lets Esty begin teaching with the spring semester, and it positions the state to find a replacement, he said.
\
""I wanted to do it in a way that the transition was smooth,"" Esty, 54, said in a recent interview in his wood-paneled office on Elm Street.
\
Sen. Bob Duff, a Democrat and co-chairman of the legislature's energy and technology committee, called Esty the ""right person to be the first commissioner of the combined agencies."" He added: ""We were able to work together as partners, not necessarily as different branches of government.""
\
In three years, Esty's energy department drafted a comprehensive energy plan; oversaw a merger that created the largest utility in New England; established a ""green bank"" to pull private funds into the state's energy efforts; and launched an unprecedented expansion of natural gas pipelines through Connecticut.
\
""There's a lot of implementation to do,"" Esty said. ""The best ideas can get off the rails if people aren't attentive, so we need to keep pushing.""
\
His time as commissioner, though, had its obstacles. At various times, the department made enemies of heating oil dealers, clean-energy advocates and renewable-power developers. In October, state utility regulators publicly questioned the benefits of a Maine wind farm that Esty had chosen for a state contract.
\
There were other red flags, as issues surfaced regarding his previous consulting for the energy industry, and political contributions to his wife, U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty, from executives at companies that his department regulates.
\
Rep. Esty returned $4,500 in political donations from supporters with industry ties after pressure from political opponents.
\
Esty said that the areas of crossover between his and his wife's political careers has been ""managed very tightly.""
\
""There's going to need to be more recognition in the world ahead that you're going to have men and women, sometimes connected to each other, who need to be given the space to do their own careers and given some flexibility,"" Esty said.
\
Reacting to news of Esty's departure Wednesday, Malloy said in a statement that Esty ""led the way in integrating and reinvigorating our approach to environmental regulation and energy policy and building a strong foundation for 21st century action.""
\
""Innovative and breakthrough programs were put in place to successfully address long-standing environmental and energy challenges,"" said Malloy, who throughout his term has been intensely hands-on with energy decisions. ""Steps were taken to lighten the burden of electricity costs, an issue that has created real problems for our families and businesses.""
\
Rep. Laura R. Hoydick, the ranking Republican member of the legislature's energy and technology committee, said that Esty ""brought different perspectives"" to the office,"" hired ""intelligent, competent people,"" and ""focused on things that were languishing.""
\
She said that despite being a member of the minority party, ""I always had access to the commissioner.""
\
Sen. John Fonfara, a former Democratic chairman of the energy committee, said that Malloy's hiring of Esty ""brought one of the best minds in the country into his administration.""
\
OBAMA ADVISER
\
A Connecticut native, Esty studied at Harvard University, Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School. He practiced environmental law at Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C., before leaving the private sector for the federal government.
\
In 1989, he took a job with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, serving eventually as the deputy assistant administrator for policy, which took him as a negotiator to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change.
\
In 1994, he joined Yale University, teaching in the School of Forestry and the Law School as the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy. In 2007, he began advising then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama from Illinois during his campaign for president and as he transitioned into the White House.
\
Malloy tapped Esty for the state post in February 2011 to follow through on a plan to consolidate the Department of Environmental Protection with the Department of Public Utility Control and a dozen energy employees from the Office of Policy Management into a new department.
\
The first year, Esty said, was challenging. ""Change is hard, and that's true even when the status quo is demonstrably not working.""
\
By June of that year, lawmakers passed the consolidation bill that empowered the new agency with renewable energy programs, a centralized plan for buying electricity for most of the state, and additional energy efficiency tools. The legislation called for the state to draft a comprehensive energy strategy.
\
The Comprehensive Energy Strategy that was drafted called for an unprecedented expansion of the state's natural gas pipelines, a controversial recategorization of hydropower as a top-tier renewable energy source and a measure to increase funding for energy efficiency programs.
\
""That strategy, which the governor played a personal role in developing, is seen as a model,"" Esty said. ""No state in the country has a better foundation for policy decision-making, and certainly not in Washington where you see nothing like this.""
\
It was also that year that Esty began to weather criticism regarding his former work for the energy industry and his new duties regulating it.
\
In 2011, Esty's work as a consultant for Northeast Utilities from 1997 to 2005 raised concerns when he refused to recuse himself from a multimillion-dollar regulatory request from Connecticut Light & Power to install smart meters throughout its system.
\
Although he made $205,000 in those years, Esty said he didn't recuse himself because his relationship with the company ended six years prior and the management there had almost all but refreshed since then. The governor stood by Esty, saying that the case wasn't a conflict of interest.
\
Esty contends that his time as commissioner showed no favoritism for Northeast Utilities. He said he pushed for microgrids that made the utility uncomfortable, extracted millions of dollars for ratepayers during the merger between Northeast Utilities and NStar, and pressed Connecticut Light & Power on what regulators found to be its ""inadequate"" response to major storms in 2011.
\
FOCUS ON ENERGY
\
The technological leaps of recent years afford any number of yardsticks to gauge the state's progress in energy. How many electric vehicles are on the road? How energy efficient are homes? How much is a kilowatt hour? How resilient is the state's energy grid? How much does heat cost?
\
For Esty, a major measure focuses on how the use of energy interacts with the environment. In April 2011, he co-wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times titled ""Pain at the Pump? We Need More,"" arguing for a carbon tax to tackle climate change and reduce greenhouse gases.
\
""The best way to drive energy innovation would be an emissions charge of $5 per ton of greenhouse gases beginning in 2012, rising to $100 per ton by 2032,"" he and Harvard Business School Professor Michael E. Porter wrote in the piece.
\
Gas was already $4 a gallon throughout the country. Republicans attacked the idea from the new commissioner, and the Malloy administration said it wasn't its policy.
\
Since then, Esty's ideas on climate change have shifted.
\
""The truth of the matter is that the challenge of using some policy tool that might have been thought to be the best practice five or 10 years ago has proven to be so great that you need to be practical and be willing to shift gears,"" he said.
\
His new tack: Beat fossil fuels. ""What the last three years have demonstrated in Connecticut is that the key to progress in climate change is progress in clean energy,"" he said. ""And if we can bring down the cost of renewable power to bring it under the cost of the fossil fuel alternatives, that's when we'll transform the climate change picture.""
\
If and when the prices invert, Esty said, you wouldn't ""need the international treaties or big regulatory frameworks in Washington to change.""

64,"HAMDEN — Construction for a new ACES campus is under way, which will consolidate two special education programs into one new location, where a ground-breaking ceremony was held this week.\With the construction of the new facility, ACES is moving all programs from the three buildings on Skiff Street to the future site, which will open fall 2019. The school will hold new specialty laboratories, including occupational therapy rooms, sensory and aqua-therapy rooms, assistive technology training spaces, as well as vocational programs spaces including art, shop, and video studios.\The building at 130 Leeder Hill Drive will be the new home of ACES Whitney High School East/West/CREATE and ACES Whitney High School North campuses and the finished project will boast about 140,000 square feet to accommodate 300 students.\“This building is specifically designed for the student needs we have, so it really allows us to enhance the educational opportunity for our students,” ACES Director of Construction Services Tim Gunn said.\ACES provides academic and vocational programs for special needs students who have a range of cognitive, physical, behavioral, language and medical challenges. The school serves students 14 to 21 years old and places an emphasis on teaching and assisting with students’ transitions to independent life and work. It provides services for more than 30 school districts in South Central Connecticut, primarily for special needs students.\“Our program has grown and the opportunities we offer and the needs of our students, too, so we’re going to be better able to meet the needs of our students in this environment,” ACES teacher Nicole Flaherty said of moving to the new building. She works with students teaching life and vocational skills as well as functional academics, such as money counting to be able to make purchases. “Because we’re community based, the students get authentic real-life experiences, so the things we’re practicing in the classroom they’re able to generalize and use them out in the community,” she said. “There’s a lot of real-life learning opportunities to develop independent living skills.”\Silver/Petrucelli + Associates is the architectural firm handling the project, which is expected to cost $60 million. The Leeder Hill Drive building will be “renovated as new,” meaning the building will be fully gutted, have all new mechanical systems, a new facade, gymnasium, classrooms and site improvements, lead project manager Dave Stein said. It will meet the energy efficiency standard for high performance buildings and use sustainable materials, he said.\“Right now we’re in three different buildings and it’s difficult when students need to go from one building to another,” said ACES Transition Coordinator Carolyn Nelson, who works with students post graduation as they transition to finding jobs. “The accessibility of having everyone under one roof is a major factor.”\Many programs at the East/West and North campuses are also limited by their space, music therapy teacher Lynne Patnode said, including the classes she runs. At the current campuses, Patnode said the only space she has for music practice is the cafeteria, where they’re constrained by lunch time and other noise distractions in the space. When the campuses move to the new building, the music therapy program will have a 1,500 square feet of dedicated acoustic space, along with a sound recording booth and new equipment, she said, which “will make a huge difference.”\Similarly, the sensory and aqua-therapy programs are also limited in how much they can serve students, ACES physical therapist Sue Condren said. Teachers and students currently need to travel to the elementary school’s aqua-therapy room, a program that especially helps students who are wheelchair bound, she said, but the Leeder Hill Road campus will provide students with a larger aqua-therapy room of their own.\“A school isn’t just a building and it’s important to remember it’s not just about the facility,” said Glen Peterson, education division director of the Connecticut State Department of Education. “It’s the relationship, the administrators, the teachers, it’s the aids, the custodians, cafeteria workers and really it’s the students and the families for who the school is being built.”\\\Credit: By Clare Dignan"

A three-cent cut in the state tax on gasoline, a bipartisan political bow to a claque of motorists led by border town gas station owners, is now in effect; prices at the pump should soon reflect the reduction.
\
A related news item: Ford Motor Co. has unveiled its Navigator, proudly described as longer, higher and heavier than a ""typical luxury SUV,"" sport utility vehicle, and of course more luxurious. A slick 12-page color insert in my current issue of The Atlantic magazine avoids mentioning gasoline consumption.
\
Never mind; gasoline is cheaper.
\
It's been two decades since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel raised oil prices and Detroit found itself competing with Japan to sell fuel-efficient compacts.
\
Despite higher taxes that have just been slightly rolled back, gasoline is cheaper, adjusted for inflation, than it was when the nation worried about overreliance on imports and lined up for the every- other-day privilege of buying a few scarce gallons at suddenly higher prices.
\
The nation's concern for fuel efficiency has dwindled. Today, gas-guzzling SUVs have replaced thirsty pickup trucks as the fastest-growing segment of the automotive market.
\
Daily gasoline production late last month was 8.1 million barrels, up from 7.7 million a year earlier.
\
Another news item: Last week, Connecticut got an early start on a summer of dangerous air pollution. People with asthma and less-than-robust pulmonary systems were urged to stay indoors and avoid breathing hard.
\
Even those of us with healthy lungs may notice that the paint on our houses peels more quickly than it did a decade or so ago when the air was less corrosive.
\
It doesn't take a math wizard to calculate that it will take a lot of money saved on long trips to offset the cost of hiring someone to paint the house more often.
\
Another news item: President Clinton has reluctantly sided with Carol Browner, his chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, in setting higher standards for air pollution.
\
Much of Connecticut already falls short of federal standards for ozone; the new standards will put us even further out of compliance.
\
Automobile exhaust fumes are the primary ozone culprit. The day may come when the state will be compelled to forgo job-creating industrial and commercial growth to avoid further deterioration of the air we breathe.
\
Also in the news: Our world neighbors complain that despite brave American talk at international conferences, the United States hasn't done enough to reduce ""greenhouse gases."" Their impact on global warming, once a kooky theory of environmental nuts, is now accepted by the majority of scientists.
\
At the present pace, a warmer world atmosphere will melt polar ice caps and raise ocean levels. In time, people who once owned beachfront properties may need vehicles like the Navigator to make it over permanently flooded roads to reach houses that are awash, with no beachfronts.
\
Foresighted state policy would be to raise gasoline taxes. The revenue would pay for continued overhaul of the roads and fund better mass transit to lure people out of their single-occupancy commuter vehicles.
\
Higher prices would also make it economically more painful to drive to the office or the supermarket in vehicles originally designed for battlefields or trackless Arizona deserts.
\
Such policies, however, would require either foresighted voters or political leaders willing to lead.
\
Both are obviously in short supply. Many of the people who complain about the cost of filling up their tanks in Connecticut are buying those newly popular gas-guzzlers that require more frequent trips to fill up. And few politicians want to remind them of the long-range consequences.
\
Enjoy the lower gasoline prices. But avoid heavy breathing.

If you've been near a working radio lately, you know Connecticut has the highest gasoline tax in the nation. The talk show titans are teeing off on it. ""At least we're No. 1 in something,"" one guy ranted, heavy on the sarcasm.
\
The gabmeisters, as well as some lobbyists and legislators, are out to repeal planned increases in Connecticut's motor fuels tax, now at 36 cents a gallon. They insist the gas tax is something we should be ashamed of.
\
It isn't. It's actually a fair tax and good public policy. Hear me out.
\
Gas taxes don't come close to covering the costs of driving. They don't even cover the cost of building and maintaining roads.
\
David Morris, a transportation analyst with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that specializes in the environment and community development, said national studies by his organization indicate that user fees, such as gas taxes or license charges, pay for about half the costs of state and federal highways and only a third the cost of local roads.
\
A study by the World Resources Institute, an environmental group, said user fees pay about 60 percent of the cost of roads. Paying all road costs at the pump would add 20 cents a gallon.
\
Roads aren't the only cost of driving. A study in Pasadena, Calif., found 40 percent of police costs, 14 percent of fire expenses and 17 percent of the paramedic budget are related to driving. ""These are hard numbers,"" Morris said. Paying for them at the pump would add about 50 cents a gallon.
\
The cost of importing fuel, and protecting our access to it by keeping the peace in the Middle East, adds another 40 to 50 cents a gallon. The environmental costs of driving are hard to estimate, but they exist. These would include damage from air pollution, noise and vibration. The American Lung Association estimates the health cost of air pollution equals 40 to 50 cents a gallon in urban areas.
\
Other costs that can be attributed to drivng are land removed from the tax rolls for roads and parking; vehicle administration; parking, fuel and time wasted in traffic; destruction of urban neighborhoods for highways; uninsured health costs. Add these up, and $1.43 a gallon is a bargain. The real cost is $4 a gallon or more. We pay it, don't kid yourself, from other taxes.
\
That isn't fair. Should people who don't own cars subsidize families who own four-wheel yuppie trucks and Saabs? Morris believes as a minimum, user fees should pay all the direct costs of driving: roads, police and highway services.
\
Connecticut comes closer than any other state to meeting this goal. Spurred by the Mianus River Bridge disaster, Connecticut set up a special transportation fund in 1984 to restore and improve the state's roads. It pays for roads and bridges, and makes up the losses in bus and rail transportation.
\
Since then, the fund has been expanded to cover all costs, operations as well as salaries and pension and benefits, of the state departments of Transportation and Motor Vehicles, and of state police's highway patrol function. The legislature passed a gas tax increase, scheduled to go to 39 cents next year, to pay for these additional costs. This is the increase the talk show gang wants to roll back. That would be shortsighted. We fiscal conservatives think those who drive should pay what it costs. If I were king for a day, I'd raise the gas tax slightly and lower the property tax.
\
Covering all DOT, DMV and state police highway functions added 12 cents to the gas tax, said Charles Canane, chief financial officer of the DOT. The bus and rail subsidy equals 9 cents on the tax. If these came from other accounts, as they do in many other states, we'd have a lower gas tax. But it would just shift the costs, not make them go away.
\
When I told Morris that Connecticut had the highest gas tax in the country, which paid almost all the costs of state highways and police, he said, ""That's something Connecticut should be proud of.""
"
67,"
The irresponsible proposal from the legislature's Republicans to suspend the state gasoline tax for three months this summer is probably the worst bit of political pandering to emerge from this legislative session.
\
Although spending more than $50 to fill up a gas tank hurts, any short-term relief provided by the tax's suspension will be followed by long-term pain.
\
Suspension of the tax would mean the loss of $120 million in revenue for transportation improvements, including train and bus service. Mass transit users don't have to worry nearly as much about fuel prices.
\
There is no guarantee that suspension of the tax would result in a significantly lower gasoline price since the cost is set by the distributors, not the state.
\
The Republicans want to use the state surplus for this giveaway. But, they and Gov. M. Jodi Rell also want to use that same surplus to avoid raising the income tax to pay for $3.4 billion in additional local school aid.
\
The higher gasoline prices have forced many to think about giving up their gas guzzlers for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That's not only good for the environment, but an intelligent response to the future uncertainty of world oil supplies and even higher gasoline prices.
\
When all Connecticut and federal taxes are counted, they are the fourth highest in the country. That's high enough.
\
In February, Rell called for a cap on the gross receipts tax on the wholesale price of gasoline and rescinding the scheduled July 1 increase in the tax. These are both responsible and affordable steps the legislature should approve.
"
68,"The gas tax is at the core of the argument about whether to bring tolls back to Connecticut highways. But this story is not about tolls — it’s about the tax, its nexus with climate change, and what that means for the state.\At least one part of the story is fairly straightforward.\Because of climate change, experts predict, the gas tax will eventually disappear. That’s it. Connecticut, just about every other state in the nation, and most countries are realizing that a major way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are the chief cause of climate change, is by switching to electric vehicles.\This is great for the environment, but not so great for the transportation fund, which is how every state — including Connecticut — uses its gas tax. Electric vehicles, also known as EVs, don’t use gas.\No gas tax means no revenue.\It’s a policy conflict, admits Tom Maziarz, chief of policy and planning at the Connecticut Department of Transportation.\“That does create this tension in policies where you want to build and improve the transportation system but what we’re doing in terms of climate policy is working against that,” Maziarz said.\Let’s be clear - no one believes EVs will take over tomorrow, but just about everyone thinks it will happen.\Bloomberg’s 2018 outlook “shows sales of electric vehicles increasing from a record 1.1 million worldwide in 2017 to 11 million in 2025, then surging to 30 million in 2030.” It predicts that in 2040, 55 percent of new car sales and 33 percent of the overall fleet will be electric.\In the U.S., about half the states are beginning to deal with that transformation by exploring, if not already adopting, policies to deal with an EV-perpetuated gas tax crisis. That’s because they’re all similar to Connecticut - running out of transportation funding in part because gas tax revenue is decreasing, due both to increased sales of fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles, and because tax revenues don’t buy as much as they did in the past because the tax isn’t indexed to inflation.\But Connecticut has not begun planning. In fact, the state arguably has boxed itself into a corner with policies that are prohibiting it from exploring some of the solutions other states are already experimenting with.\Those solutions broadly aim at getting EV owners to pay into the transportation system they use - roads, bridges, things like that - but are not helping to fund to the same extent as drivers of non-electric vehicles. Annual fees on EVs are already collected in about 20 states and the idea of a road usage charge in the form of a mileage-based fee is being widely tested.\While these fees have been discussed in environmental circles, they are not part of the overall debate about Connecticut’s transportation fund even though there was some acknowledgment of the problem by the Governor’s Council on Climate Change.\The Council did not include the issue in its final report late last year recommending an interim greenhouse gas emission level of 45 percent below 2001 levels by 2030, and the longer-standing target of an 80 percent reduction by 2050.\But a separate document called “The Economic and Fiscal Impacts of Connecticut’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Strategies” filed on the Council’s web page, did explore the problem in detail.\It featured a chart showing a drastic discrepancy between required transportation funds and fuel tax revenue projections out to 2030, along with this: “We do not include in the economic model the gas tax revenue shortfall relative to the CONNDOT (Connecticut Department of Transportation) required revenue as a decline in state and local government spending because we assume there will be an offsetting revenue-generating policy.”\“That initial link, just to what’s happening to the gasoline tax, I think is recognized but probably not fully appreciated,” Maziarz said.\Maybe not in Connecticut, but plenty of other states appreciate it.\Other states and actions\Annual fees on EVs are the only widespread policy in the U.S. designed to make up some of the lost gas tax. They’re easy to implement, though some states have rejected the idea.\Connecticut hasn’t considered it - which is fine with the environmental community. Its broad view is that a fee would stop too many people from buying EVs. Groups, including Connecticut Fund for the Environment, argue that fees would be premature and the policy focus should stay with the immediate and more urgent challenge of cleaning up transportation emissions since they are the largest sector of greenhouse gas emissions in the state.\Connecticut is also part of a Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate with California and other states. As part of the mandate, Connecticut would have 500,000 ZEVs on the road by 2030, about 17 percent of registered vehicles.\Concerns about the state’s ability to achieve that if an EV fee existed may be well-founded.\A study conducted through the University of California at Davis’s Institute of Transportation Studies to assess alternatives to a $100 EV fee approved by that state legislature in 2017 found that as many as 20 percent of respondents said they would have reconsidered their EV purchase had they known about the fee.\More important, however, according to author Alan Jenn, the research director at Plug-In Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Center, fees alone are “not a very good replacement” for gas tax revenue. In California, Jenn found that the fee would only bring in about half the revenue that the vehicle would have contributed had it’s owner been paying a gas tax.\Jenn threw cold water on several other alternatives, including the idea of a surcharge on the electricity used to charge an EV, something advocated by Acadia Center in Connecticut.\“Its going to be the easiest option for consumers to understand because they’ve been paying taxes in that way as long vehicles have had a gas tax,” said Emily Lewis O’Brien, a senior policy analyst at Acadia.\But Jenn’s study showed that would require expensive separate meters for every vehicle. “Implementation-wise, it is almost entirely a non-starter,” he said.\The Connecticut DOT has been pushing for congestion pricing as part of its tolls package. Jenn said that this has been discussed, but never tried, in the U.S., despite being effective in other parts of the world as a way to reduce traffic.\“It’s not designed … for raising lots revenue,” he said. “It’s specifically meant to reduce traffic.”\So what does Jenn’s study actually recommend? A road usage charge (RUC) - but with a caveat.\RUCs east and west\RUCs are being piloted in about half the country and are operational in one state - Oregon. They charge a per-mile fee on vehicles, which gas-powered car owners pay instead of a gas tax.\But there is a host of growing pains. Drivers of old gas-guzzlers will save money paying per mile instead of per gallon, for one thing, and EV owners could have to pay just the same as anyone else.\RUC systems tested so far require drivers of gas cars to pay taxes at the pump and then get reimbursed for the state portion. Federal gas tax would still be required. That would require a clunky and expensive administrative system.\Mileage monitoring for EVs and other new cars would be easy using on-board diagnostics that most now include. Older cars would have to use GPS or cellphones - both of which come with privacy concerns.\“It’s sort of a blunt instrument,” said Acadia’s Lewis O’Brien. “If you apply it to all vehicles it would be fuel neutral - but it doesn’t take into account environmental contributions.”\Oregon, which instituted the nation’s first fuel tax in 1919, now has the nation’s first RUC, launched in 2015. But they started looking into it in 2001.\It’s voluntary, and capped at 5,000 cars. EV users can choose to pay the state’s annual $110 fee or the per-mile RUC of 1.7 cents.\Washington state, which has raised its gas tax three times since 2003, began looking into a RUC in 2007 and has just completed a one-year pilot with 200 drivers and a per-mile 2.4-cent fee. A report with results and recommendations is due next year.\In the meantime, the state has a $150 annual EV fee, but that money goes into a fund for EV infrastructure development.\Reema Griffith, executive director of the Washington State Transportation Commission conceded that startup costs are steep but “at the end of the day a road charge way out performs a gas tax.”\Jenn at UC Davis has heard and studied all of it. His report recommends that California adopt - or at least test - an EV-only RUC. It avoids all the extra administrative work and the problems with older cars, while finding a way for EVs to contribute financially to the transportation fund.\So far, Connecticut is having none of it.\The state is a member of the I-95 Corridor Coalition, which a few years ago began looking at the idea of a user fee. It won a federal grant requiring a 50-50 match to run demonstration projects.\Connecticut not only said no, it passed a law in 2017 that prohibited the use of state money for any kind of mileage fee study.\“They have made it clear they don’t want to participate in exploratory research,” said Patricia Hendren, executive director of the coalition. “It’s unfortunate.”\So the state missed out on a pilot last summer that included 13 states, a multi-state freight pilot that is just ending with 57 trucks that traveled through 27 states, and a 1,000-person pilot planned for this spring.\Rep. Roland Lemar, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Transportation Committee, said he had no plans to overturn the user fee ban, even though he voted against it two years ago.\“We will need to figure out some way for EV drivers to pay their fair share,” he said. “We’ve got to be open to the evolving market and not take options off the table.”\Rep. Laura Devlin, R-Fairfield, the ranking Republican on the committee, was unaware of the actions in other states. “We really need a comprehensive plan,” she said. “For EVs - what are our alternatives? That discussion needs to happen.”\Some believe it essentially is happening - through the Transportation Climate Initiative (TCI).\Waiting for a rescue\TCI is envisioned as a multi-state cap and invest program for the motor vehicle sector that would be modeled on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - a cap and invest program for the power sector designed to lower greenhouse gas emissions and generate revenue. RGGI has done both.\But an earthbound power plant is a whole lot easier to monitor and measure than millions of moving cars and trucks that cut across all socio-economic levels, move across state lines, and involve many other variables.\So far TCI encompasses all the RGGI states plus a few more. It’s been worked on for nearly 10 years. Late last year participants decided they were ready to move to the next phase - actually developing a program. While they pledged to have a plan by the end of this year, RGGI took four years to develop from the time states signed their memorandum of understanding.\In the meantime, the message coming to Connecticut from states that are already wrestling with gas tax decreases is to think holistically and long-term.\“The biggest challenge is public opinion,” said Michelle Godfrey, a spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Transportation.\The key, said Washington’s Griffith, is starting a conversation with the public to explain how infrastructure is financed and why that’s not sustainable now. Griffith has been having that conversation for seven years. “People are coming around to understand this is a solution,” she said. “People may not love it, but at least they understand the problem.”\And how soon should Connecticut start doing something?\“ASAP,” she said.\\Crédito: By Jan Ellen Spiegel, CTMirror.org"
69,"In the annals of Connecticut’s legislative brawls, this one has the makings of tolls 2.0.\The new transportation effort that is grazing the guardrails is the Transportation and Climate Initiative, TCI. It’s a climate change-combatting concept that seeks to replicate through the motor vehicle sector what the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) accomplished through the electric power sector — cutting greenhouse gases and other emissions while raising money to cycle funds back into related climate-change programs. In the case of TCI, it could also cycle funds into the state’s dwindling transportation fund.\TCI is envisioned as a cap-and-invest program for motor vehicles, just like RGGI is for power plants. Both essentially put a price on carbon pollution to incentivize using less of whatever is producing that pollution. In RGGI, for the right to pollute above a set cap that goes down over time, power plant owners buy emission allowances from their states through quarterly auctions. The states get the money, most of which is supposed to be invested in consumer benefits such as energy efficiency programs that help lower energy use further.\Only the broad outlines of TCI exist at this point. Enabling legislation needed to start the process of designing an actual plan, specific for Connecticut, has been hit with pushback rarely seen in Connecticut on matters related to climate change. Normally bi-partisan affairs, this measure made it through the environment committee on a party-line vote. And full-bore PR campaigns by supporters and opponents can make it tough to tell if the two sides are even talking about the same bill.\“Stop the gas tax” is the GOP and fossil fuel-related industries’ high-octane approach — focusing solely on the likelihood that TCI will cause gas prices to increase. It poses an arguably Trumpian-tactic that TCI supporters — who have been working towards this for more than a decade — have had to counter with less headline-grabbing explanations and decidedly lower-key outreach.\“They’re coming after the middle class wallet,” proclaimed Senate Republican Leader Kevin Kelly, R-Stratford, at a kickoff event last month during which the words “climate change” were uttered precisely once — though not by any of the legislators in attendance.\“Any time government puts their hand in our wallet, it’s a tax,” said House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, at the same event.\More News\*\News\New Haven environmental programs get boost through...\*\News\New Haven police investigating homicide on George Street\Staff Report\*\News\Former CT stay-at-home mom launches granola business that...\By Pam McLoughlin\*\News\Donation drive Saturday to benefit West Haven Animal Shelter\*\News\Proposal submitted in West Haven for 140 new apartments,...\By Brian Zahn\*\News\Bradley Airport: Tweed expansion calls for coordination...\By Mark Zaretsky\*\News\New Haven schools are getting $14 million less than...\By Linda Conner Lambeck\*\News\New Haven police identify Bridgeport woman killed in...\By Meghan Friedmann\*\News\New Haven deal on lead in homes would 'change life...\By Mary E.

Categorically, it’s not tax,” said James Bradbury, mitigation program director at the Georgetown Climate Center, which has acted as TCI’s facilitator since 2010 when 11 states from Maine to Maryland plus the District of Columbia signed the initial declaration of intent. Republican M. Jodi Rell was governor at the time. Virginia and North Carolina have since joined.\“It’s an environmental program that is first and foremost designed to reduce emissions,” Bradbury said. “It’s convenient for the opposition to call anything they don’t like a tax.”\But proponents have had to wind their way through the reality that gas prices are expected to rise about five cents a gallon when TCI is slated to go into effect in 2023. The increase is capped at nine cents, which has not stopped opponents from seizing on a study by Tufts University — now discounted by some, including the author himself — that gas prices could rise by 38 cents a gallon.\Opponents have also seized on the fact that of the 14 jurisdictions that have been working through the development of TCI, only four — Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia — signed the memorandum in December to move into the final stage, though all the remaining states say they are working toward that. Those three New England states account for three quarters of the region’s motor vehicle emissions.\“You counter it with the facts,” said Charles Rothenberger, climate and energy attorney at Save the Sound. “I think one sign of the desperation of the opposition is that they’re really resorting now to things that are factually untrue. A less-polite person would call them lies.”\Supporters point out that gas prices tend to fluctuate wildly in the best of times due to standard market forces. For instance, they plunged at the start of the pandemic and now have gone back up by almost $1, so five cents due to TCI would be negligible.\“Fundamentally, what this policy is is a cap on pollution that comes out of motor vehicle tailpipes,” Rothenberger said. “It’s that simple.”\Many moving parts\Coupled with plunging natural gas prices, RGGI was extremely successful and has all but eliminated coal and oil power plants in New England and provided billions of dollars to all the participating states, mostly for energy-efficiency measures to help further reduce the need for electricity.\But TCI has more moving parts.\In TCI, the cost of the carbon will be paid by large suppliers of transportation fuels — gasoline and on-road diesel — at the wholesale level. In Connecticut alone, it’s estimated those payments will bring in $89 million in 2023, increasing to as much as $117 million in 2032. Just as ratepayers picked up some of the cost under RGGI, consumers likely will pick up some of it under TCI — the per-gallon price increase. It’s not a tax.\But TCI deals with a more complicated sector than RGGI. Motor vehicles cut across every swath and socio-economic sector of life with impacts that are uneven. For instance, low-income people driving older, less-efficient vehicles would likely get hit harder at the pump, as would rural residents and others who have no public transit options to help defray costs. Wealthier people with newer, more efficient or even electric vehicles would obviously feel it less.\The regional structure for all the states — first released in 2019 — requires that at least 35 percent of each state’s auction proceeds from selling emissions allowancesbe re-invested in those communities and/or to the people that typically suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate change and pollution in addition to those with limited transportation options.\TCI states use that broad structure to tailor the programs to their particular needs. Just a couple of those specific adjustments are in Connecticut’s enabling legislation, including pushing that percentage of the auction proceeds going to the environmental justice community up to 50 percent, with specific language designating it for over-burdened and under-served people and areas — and taking great pains to structure the required equity advisory committee that helps design the state plan to represent as many constituencies as possible.\Katie Dykes, commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, a champion of TCI, has hit the road with Garrett Eucalitto, the state’s deputy commissioner of transportation, to sell the program to skeptical residents and lawmakers.\“It has all the hallmarks of climate programs that have proven successful in our region,” Dykes pointed out. “It’s market-based; it’s regional in scope; it’s ambitious. It’s tackling emissions in a sector that hasn’t been addressed yet. And it’s going to drive billions of dollars in investments in our communities.”\She points out that while climate change mitigation is the goal — since it will lower motor vehicle emissions broadly, by 26 percent — it will also provide public health benefits, potentially helping to lower the stubbornly high incidence of asthma in the state.\Last month, the American Lung Association’s annual “State of the Air” report once again found parts of the state among the most polluted in the country. Motor vehicles have for some time now constituted the largest sector of greenhouse gas emissions in the state and the nation, about 40 percent.\“It is a choice of opponents of this program to ignore those very real impacts and to refuse to propose an alternative solution and to call this a gas tax when in fact this is an incredibly cost-effective solution to address a growing source of emissions in our economy — the transportation sector,” Dykes said.\The opposition to TCIRepublican leaders have piggy-backed on the No Tolls CT campaign that’s still around from that fight, drawn in another piece of legislation to lower emissions standards on medium and heavy-duty trucks and posited their notion of a gas tax also being a food tax, even though there’s no indication such a move would do anything to food prices.\They’ve also gotten support from the conservative Yankee Institute for Public Policy. Similar conservative groups are fighting TCI in most of the partnered states. While the funding for the anti-TCI campaigns is not clear, many of the opposition groups receive money at least indirectly from well-known fossil fuel-supporting funders such as the Koch family.\The Yankee Institute is responsible for anti-TCI ads that have run recently on gas pump screens in service stations.\Ken Girardin, the Institute’s director of policy and research, is making a tax argument, as are other opponents, but with a twist. He’s calling it a new tax, which he said needs to be approved by the general assembly. Under the TCI procedure, the actual plan with the price increase that he calls a tax would not go through the legislature.\If the state’s objective is to get people to use less gasoline and diesel fuel, then government should say that, the way it did with tobacco, he said. “Instead we get these euphemisms, he said. “If you want to tax people to change people’s behavior, at least say ‘We’re going to tax you to change your behavior.’”\He and others also point to RGGI funds that were used to plug budget holes on several occasions as an example of what can go wrong with TCI’s likely similar format.\“It’s another slush fund,” said Michael J. Fox, executive director of the Gasoline and Automotive Service Dealers of America. “I just really find it is — appalling isn’t even enough of a word.”\Calling electric vehicles “good things,” his contention is that a modernized infrastructure and an electric grid to supply it should come first. And to pay for it: “The right way to get revenue is tolls,” he said.\If it’s all about climate, which he doesn’t necessarily agree with, everyone should pay, he said.\“Why are they only doing it through only one industry? If it’s climate, let’s put a 1 percent tax on everything that everybody buys and it goes into a climate fund.”\Candelora, while publicly making charges including “No one in my district is happy about paying another tax under the guise of air pollution control,” and all-but-admitting that the opposition’s gas tax tactic was chosen because it is “a very third-rail item,” was more subdued one-on-one. The differing interpretations between opponents and supporters, he said, is that the intent is to reduce carbon emissions on the front end. But on the back end, folks are looking at the result of how that’s done.\“I think both sides are right,” he said.\He also contended that TCI is not regional because most states haven’t signed on yet. It puts the burden on states like Connecticut to reduce carbon while the other states “can just be reckless,” he said.\The supporters of TCI\TCI supporters have called out such views as misinformation, which some say is being spread with abandon.\Environment committee Co-Chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, and others called the Republican stance frustrating, noting that TCI has always taken a regional approach and has been bipartisan state-to-state all along.\“Connecticut can’t solve for climate change alone,” she said. “Here we have this fantastic strong regional program that is bipartisan, and we’re getting this pushback.”\Sen. Will Haskell, D-Westport, as the youngest member of the senate, has been the voice of young adults. He said student groups he talks to are “shocked that this is controversial.”\“It’s clear to me most of my colleagues believe climate change is a problem. The question is whether they believe we ought to do something about it,” he said. “What we’re up against is a campaign of slogans.”\He said if they have a better program or funding idea, he’s happy to hear it. “The answer cannot simply be ‘no,’” he said.\Don't Miss\The wakeup call that made COVID real for a CT doctor\By mid-March last year, everyone at Yale New Haven Hospital had been talking about the coronavirus.

Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, an Environment Committee member, backing the legislation meant getting assurances that the needs of her sprawling rural district in the Northwest corner, which is almost entirely car-dependent with no public transit to speak of, would be considered.\“This is a tough issue for us in rural areas,” she said. “Your gas prices will go up. We will pay the cost but won’t see those benefits directly.”\She is keen on solutions such as using TCI funds for better broadband — something her district struggles with as well. It would give many residents a way to work from home and avoid their cars all together, at least part of the time.\“We’ve got to acknowledge that this is going to be an increase in gas cost and then weigh that as investment. I think of it as an infrastructure investment.”\In the meantime, a large coalition of supporting groups including environmental and social justice advocates such as Transport Hartford/Center for Latino Progress has been quietly fanning out around the state over the last couple of years, educating those likely to feel most of the impacts and picking up support in some unlikely places. The group has its own social equity coalition and a host of major corporations working through Ceres, which works with investors on multiple sustainability issues.\“The way the opposition wins is by scare tactics,” said Amy McLean, Acadia Center’s Connecticut director. “The way we win is putting together constituencies.”\Among their biggest challenges is that there are almost no examples to show how a TCI concept has worked elsewhere. Except California.\The benefits of California’s program\California has a cap-and-trade program, a slightly different animal than cap-and-invest, like RGGI and TCI. It covers the power and transportation sectors — about 75 percent of emissions overall, although transportation went into effect in 2015, a few years after the power portion. There really hasn’t been time to crunch the transportation data or separate it from the power portion in terms of the emissions impact. The program also started as the San Onofre Nuclear plants shut down, resulting in an emissions increase due to greater use of natural gas at the time.\But Climate-xchange, a research and information group that helps states transition away from fossil fuel, has researched the impacts of California’s cap-and-trade, pointing out that the benefits greatly outweigh the costs in terms of investments. The report also says that TCI states can expect equally robust financial benefits and avoid premature deaths.\The 2020 annual report on California Climate Investments Using Cap-and-Trade Auction Proceeds lists pages of programs that have benefitted, many directly from the transportation sector. California’s experience with how to get those revenues to the folks who need them most is instructive and goes beyond just getting people to buy EVs.\Fact sheets compiled by the Greenlining Institute include giving people money towards emissions repairs for their cars, new or used hybrids or plug-in vehicles, public transit passes worth as much as $4,500, providing hundreds of vanpools for agricultural workers in that state’s large farming areas, setting up community air pollution monitoring systems and planting trees in areas disproportionately impacted by air pollution. The group also developed a Clean Mobility Equity Playbook based on California’s experience.\Dykes will rattle off a laundry list of potential uses of the proceeds from TCI: EV rebates, EV charging systems, electrifying school buses and transit buses, expanding public transportation to rural communities, transit-oriented-development projects, smarter solutions like traffic signals that help reduce idling, bike trails and walking trails to help people get out of their cars, and more robust broadband service so people can stay connected without having to drive to an office if that’s an option.\With the Biden administration likely to provide funding for cleaner transportation, the revenues from TCI could be critical to providing the matching funds that are often needed to get government grants.\Electrifying fleet vehicles is getting some traction from both sides of the aisle. Eucalitto of DOT said fleets tend to have the most miles traveled, and with central charging points, they often don’t require the EV charging infrastructure that personal vehicles do.\“It’s an opportunity to lower costs for businesses,” he said. “Studies have shown when you target those high-mileage fleets, that’s where you get your biggest bang for your buck.”\Eucalitto said he’s been in touch with California officials on their programs as well.\Despite the examples from California, TCI opponents claim that transportation initiatives don’t work and Connecticut won’t meet its goals.\Danny Cullenward essentially says it depends. He is the policy director for CarbonPlan, an independent non-profit climate research organization, an expert in climate policy and carbon markets, in addition to being a lawyer teaching at Stanford.\He admits his views are somewhat oppositional after watching the California program move along. He says the kind of carbon pricing that TCI, like RGGI, is talking about is really pretty low.\“I’m in the camp that says this stuff is way too hard to get right to do anything other than help a little on the margins, which isn’t to say it’s not good,” he said. “These programs aren’t nearly as big as people talk about, but they’re also sometimes pretty good at their modest small scale.\“The fears are overblown. The benefits are typically overblown, too. But they’re there. They’re real. Everything’s just smaller than people make it out to be,” he said.\Cullenward suggests that a lot of the progress should come from local efforts like urban planning, bikeable areas, local zoning, permitting and planning changes that support the large-scale clean and lower carbon transportation policies and goals.\The biggest issue he said is the politics, something Connecticut is seeing first-hand.\“I think in some ways we’ve been emphasizing some of the wrong strategies. This is a good idea,” he said of carbon pricing programs like TCI. “Will the politics be feasible? I don’t know. It’s about the worst political recipe I can come up with. But it’s a good thing if you all get it done.”"

Most people don't like to pay taxes, which makes taxes an easy target for politicians looking for a quick boost in popular currency. But a proposal by Gov. M. Jodi Rell and House Republicans to give taxpayers a summer vacation from the state's 25-cents-a- gallon excise tax on gasoline is a bad idea for several reasons.
\
Mrs. Rell & Co. are proposing to suspend the excise tax from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Mrs. Rell has also proposed capping the state's 6.72 percent tax on the wholesale price of gasoline -- the so-called gross receipts tax -- at the wholesale price of $1.75 per gallon.
\
At the current wholesale price of $2.30 a gallon, the combined effect of Mrs. Rell's proposals -- theoretically -- would be a 40- cent-per-gallon reduction in state gasoline taxes. The governor says she will push for both versions of the gasoline tax cut during budget negotiations over the next three weeks.
\
Ms. Rell's proposed gas tax cuts contain a few impurities that could lead to problems down the road.
\
Advocates of tax-cutting seem to assume that a 40-cent-per- gallon drop in state taxes will translate into an equivalent drop in prices at the pump. That's a naive assumption. Although gasoline prices might drop somewhat, oil companies or retailers would be loath to overlook a potential windfall.
\
Mrs. Rell's plan would also reduce revenues to the state's Special Transportation Fund. The fund was created in the wake of the disastrous Mianus River bridge collapse in Greenwich in 1983 and is used for highway maintenance and repairs.
\
It's also the source of funding for some long-overdue mass- transportation initiatives, including new Metro-North rail cars, an expanded bus fleet, and restored commuter rail service between New Haven and Springfield. Reducing the flow of revenues to the fund could postpone those important projects.
\
The state's gas tax will be no more popular when it's reimposed after Labor Day than it is now. Meanwhile, the state will have lost more than $120 million in revenue. According to one estimate, former Gov. John G. Rowland's decision to cut the state's per-gallon gas tax by 7 cents back in 1997 has cost Connecticut $2.5 billion -- money that could have been used to fund transportation improvements.
\
Finally, cuts in the state's gas tax are bad public policy. Connecticut has dedicated itself to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Exhaust from cars and trucks is a significant source of those emissions. Painful though they may be, Connecticut's gasoline taxes have the effect of nudging consumers away from gas-guzzling SUVs and toward vehicles that are more fuel-efficient.
\
But global warming isn't the only concern. Reduced gasoline consumption nationwide means less dependence on foreign oil. It can also reduce pressure to sacrifice fragile natural areas to drilling - - such as our offshore waters and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It also helps to clear the air of smog and other pollutants.
\
Mrs. Rell and Connecticut's legislative leaders must resist the temptation to reduce the state's gasoline taxes. The resulting setbacks -- for important mass-transportation improvements, the environment and public health -- are too steep a price.

71,"Earlier this year, a tornado ripped through southern Connecticut, narrowly missing my parents' house and shearing rows of the heavy oak trees that lined their street.\My two brothers live near San Francisco, and like many Californians they are struggling to breathe due to some of the largest and deadliest forest fires California has known.\Puerto Rico, for years my family's winter escape, was devastated a year and a half ago by Hurricane Maria.\I thought that the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-influenced events would make it clear that climate change was real and costly, yet there are still those who deny it and many more who are complacent.\How real does it have to get? Our recent gubernatorial election focused more time and interest on taxes and tolls than on climate change. These issues are not unrelated.\Connecticut currently has no tolls, and the gas taxes do not cover the full cost of maintaining the roads. This means Connecticut residents are subsidizing driving, which is doing irreparable harm to the environment, with general tax dollars.\As the United Nations report on climate change states, and as the White House report on climate change reinforces, we have 12 years to make large reductions in fossil fuel consumption, or everyone still alive in 30 years will be living in a world with catastrophic environmental issues.\Raising gas taxes can decrease climate change. It makes even those who have no interest in their carbon footprint active participants in the solution. Higher prices cause people to make better decisions about minimizing fuel use, whether through combining errands, utilization of public transportation or ride sharing.\One immediate effect of higher fuel prices is that people will choose to drive the vehicle that gets better mileage and leave the gas guzzler sitting in the driveway.\Raising gas prices also encourages innovation. As a carpenter, I am very aware that some businesses require heavy vehicles that consume more gas. Automobile companies are just beginning to make hybrid pickups and eco-diesels for this work. Car manufacturers are now making long-term plans to transition to electric vehicles. Appropriately, high gas prices will speed the development of these innovations.\I propose not increasing the overall tax burden on the poor but shifting it so that the government is no longer subsidizing fuel consumption and encouraging environmentally detrimental behavior. The increased revenue from tolls and gas taxes could be used to reduce the crushing property taxes in our cities. Making cities more livable would also reduce the need for driving.\When taxes are raised on actions that should be discouraged, such as energy use, they can be lowered on things that should be encouraged, such as employment and housing. It is time our tax structure encourages a way of living that ensures future generations will have a world worth living in.\The struggle to pay at the pump pales in comparison to what we will be facing in 30 years if we do nothing. Everyone, including those living paycheck to paycheck, will be better off paying more at the pump than the alternatives people will be facing, such as relocating out of Florida because it is underwater, fleeing the arid west because of fires and lack of drinking water, or paying to build levees around New York, Philadelphia and Washington.\There are many ways Connecticut's government must address CO2 emissions, from power generation to farming. I have specifically addressed the gas tax because transportation is responsible for a third of the CO2 produced and is something in which we all participate.\Would you rather pay more at the pump or have the hurricanes that batter our shores every year increase in intensity due to warmer oceans? How many people need to go through the trauma of relocating and rebuilding before we act to reduce the effects of climate change?\The scientists have done their job and made clear the need for the reduction in CO2 emissions. It's our duty as citizens to push our leaders to improve the tax design and incentives so that Connecticut halves its fossil fuel use and mitigates the devastating effects of climate change.\Daniel Knudsen is a Cheshire resident and an independent carpenter.\Credit: By Daniel Knudsen\Caption: Former Connecticut Sen.

\
There could be scattered shortages of a special blend of gasoline and temporary price spikes in January when motorists in Connecticut and other states have to begin using the new formulations to combat air pollution, the U.S. Energy Department said Wednesday.
\
But the department's Energy Information Administration said that in general, there is expected to be enough of the new gasoline to meet the estimated demand of 105 million gallons a day.
\
""Very localized shortages and temporary price run-ups are possibilities,"" the agency cautioned in its energy forecast for early next year. It said that on average nationwide, the new gasoline will cost four to six cents more than conventional fuel because of increased production and distribution costs.
\
The ""reformulated"" gasoline will be required throughout Connecticut and state gasoline retailers and environmental officials familiar with the program are optimistic that there will be sufficient supplies. Any shortages that do occur are expected to be confined to small areas and last a short time, they said.
\
""We've been assured by many suppliers that it won't be a problem but you just don't know,"" said Charles S. Isenberg, executive vice president of the Independent Connecticut Petroleum Association, whose members distribute 53 percent of the gasoline in the state.
\
Isenberg said that besides the price increase for reforumlated gasoline, the state gas tax will increase by a penny Jan. 1, bringing combined state and federal gas taxes to 54 cents a gallon in Connecticut.
\
Joseph Belanger, director of planning and standards for the Department of Environmental Protection's bureau of air management, said his staff has been in contact with oil industry representatives ""and they haven't indicated any problems"" about supplies.
\
""The concern that we would have is that there might be scattered distribution problems that would show up as a short-term spike in the price,"" he said.
\
""But that would probably iron itself out in a couple of weeks,"" he said.
\
In the event a retailer did not receive a supply of the reformulated gasoline, the retailer likely would be able to continue to sell the usual blend while awaiting delivery.
\
The special gasoline, which must contain a certain amount of oxygen additive to allow it to burn more cleanly, is being required by the Environmental Protection Agency in nine cities with the worst air pollution problems as well as in parts of 14 states, mostly in the Northeast.
\
Along with Hartford, the cities are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Diego, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Houston and Philadelphia. The state DEP has extended the requirement to all of Connecticut.
\
Robin Veronesi, a spokeswoman for the Automobile Club of Hartford, the local affiliate of the American Automobile Association, said the organization nationally and in the state has not heard anything about possible shortages, although it was aware of the expected gasoline price increases.
\
Meanwhile the EIA, which is the Energy Department's statistic-gathering arm, predicted crude-oil prices likely will rise slowly next year, perhaps reaching $18 a 42-gallon barrel by the end of 1995. Crude prices recently have averaged $13 to $16 a barrel.
\
This year, U.S. petroleum demand was expected to increase 2.5 percent over 1993 because of robust economic growth, lower oil prices and the extreme winter weather during the first two months of the year, said the agency.
\
Slower economic growth, firm prices and an expectation of more normal winter weather patterns are likely to keep oil demand down in 1995 with expected growth likely to be only about 60,000 barrels a day. Demand grew by 430,000 barrels a day in 1994.
\
Heating-oil prices are expected to increase because of higher crude prices, although demand is likely to be down compared with last winter when much of the nation had particularly harsh weather.

Republicans frustrated by record gasoline prices returned to a favorite idea Monday: a temporary cut in the gas tax.
\
But the proposal received a cool reception from Democratic leaders in the General Assembly, who rejected a larger proposed gas tax suspension last year.
\
Gov. M. Jodi Rell, who supported the concept in the past, also questioned Monday whether saving people 10 cents a gallon would be wise during the economic downturn.
\
House Speaker James Amann, D-Milford, bluntly rejected the idea.
\
""Republicans love to talk about this sort of stuff. It's irresponsible,"" he said.
\
Republican leaders in the House and Senate said the state needs to respond to gas prices that are nearing $4 a gallon by cutting the only part of the price the legislature can control.
\
""We are talking about people in the toughest economy in a decade,"" said House Minority Leader Lawrence F. Cafero Jr. of Norwalk.
\
GOP legislators, as part of a larger plan to balance the state budget, proposed a 10 cent cut in the 25-cent-per-gallon gas tax for July and August. The cut in the excise tax would cost the state an estimated $25 million.
\
They also proposed reductions in the gross receipts tax on wholesale gasoline, which is passed on to consumers. The plan would include the elimination of a half-percent increase set to start in July. Republican leaders said changes to the gross receipts taxes would cost another $25 million.
\
If Republican proposals for reductions in government spending are approved, Cafero said, the state could absorb the $50 million loss in revenue created by the gas tax proposal.
\
Last year, Republican leaders, with Rell's support, proposed suspending the 25-cent-a-gallon excise tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day. But the idea never caught on and was criticized as encouraging gas consumption.
\
State Rep. Richard Roy, D-Milford, co-chairman of the environment committee, said he isn't so much concerned that people will drive more, but that the state can't afford to lose tax revenue at a time when government leaders are trying to prevent a deficit.
\
The Rell administration expressed similar concerns. Christopher Cooper, a spokesman for the governor, said Rell is willing to examine the Republican proposal, but he added that it is difficult to cut a source of revenue when the state is collecting less in taxes because of an economic downturn.
\
Amann questioned how the state can ensure that any gas tax cut would actually reach consumers and not just go into the pockets of oil companies. He also feared that a gas tax cut could reduce the money available for transit programs and other alternative transportation projects.
\
""We all know it's tough. But we have to understand that's the past,"" Amann said of proposals to cut the gas tax.

Connecticut has already laid out its goals for energy and environmental policy: cut greenhouse gas emissions, reduce reliance on foreign oil and expand the use of public transit.
\
If it cheats on those goals for the next three months, so what?
\
With gas prices near a record high, Republican legislators announced a plan last week to suspend the state's gasoline tax of 25 cents a gallon from Memorial Day to Labor Day. A vote on the proposal is expected soon.
\
Many legislators have been open to the idea, but economists and environmentalists say a tax cut only encourages people to drive more and burn more gasoline. At best, the moratorium will bring some small relief to consumers, they said.
\
""There is a direct relationship between gas prices and demand for gasoline,"" said Robert Puentes, a fellow at The Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.
\
Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University, agreed, but said a gas tax moratorium of just three months would change consumption by only a small percentage.
\
""If we tried, we may not be able to measure a consumer response,"" Stavins said.
\
Twenty years ago, people reacted more strongly to price changes, but that's different today in part because people have higher incomes, said Kenneth Small of the University of California at Irvine, who has studied the relationship between gas prices and consumption.
\
Environmentalists say making gas cheaper runs counter to Connecticut's stated policies to reduce fossil fuel use and to get more people on buses, bicycles and trains.
\
""It is a pro-global-warming move,"" said Gordon T. Geballe, associate dean at Yale University's School of Forestry & Environmental Studies.
\
""Everyone is doing the opposite.""
\
Don Strait, executive director for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, said: ""There needs to be price signals that encourage people to do the right thing. Keeping the price of gasoline artificially low is moving in the opposite direction.""
\
But Gov. M. Jodi Rell and state legislators who support a suspension of the gas tax say it's one of the few ways they can respond to complaints about gas prices of $3.20 or more a gallon.
\
Christopher Cooper, a spokesman for Rell, said people don't have a choice when it comes to driving. They're cutting back as they can, but most need to get to work and make other essential trips.
\
""The governor wants to see relief for energy consumers -- immediate relief,"" Cooper said.
\
Republican legislators who support the proposal say the driver of a Honda Civic would save about $3.30 for a tank of gas, and the driver of a Ford Explorer would save $5.60.
\
Economists agree that it will take a long period of high gasoline prices to bring about lasting changes in driving patterns.
\
Small pointed out that higher prices over the past few years have begun to inspire more people to switch from gas-guzzling SUVs to smaller cars. But Small said he believes gas prices would have to climb by $2 or more a gallon to prompt wider changes.
\
Stavins said economists often discuss the use of higher energy taxes to reduce fossil fuel consumption or to reverse global warming. But it's a hard line to sell.
\
""Economists talk about it, but politicians don't listen,"" Stavins said.
\
Critics see other problems with a gas tax cut. They point out that it offers higher benefits for people who drive gas-guzzlers than for those who have already switched to more efficient cars.
\
Some Democrats question whether the moratorium would result in lower prices for consumers or just boost profits for oil companies and gas stations. Also, money from the tax is used to pay for mass transit programs.
\
But Gene Guilford, executive director of the Independent Connecticut Petroleum Association, said people want some relief, short term or not, and elected officials are trying to respond. The other option is lowering the speed limit.
\
Members of his organization, which includes gas station owners around the state, would like to hear something other than complaints from customers.
\
""People aren't coming up to gas stations and saying: `It's over $3. Good. People will conserve,'"" Guilford said.

Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling: The state Supreme Court has ruled that the Hartford schools are unconstitutionally segregated and has ordered the state to come up with a solution. What remedy do you favor to correct this?
\
John J. Lescoe
\
Funding for magnet and charter schools, not busing. As a classroom teacher, I feel that if the environment, discipline, attendance and equipment improved, it would improve learning. Field trips, community service and tutorial services besides sports and arts should be stressed, but we must listen to the Hartford community and the blue ribbon committee.
\
Richard Leydon
\
By a decision of the state Supreme Court, schools in Hartford must be desegregated. Now the issue is how will this be accomplished. Most individuals agree that busing students should not be the way. Now that leaves redistricting the schools in the Hartford area as one of the best options. This is a quick solution, but will it last as a viable solution, time will tell.
\
Gas tax: The legislature failed to enact a bill to cut the state's gasoline tax -- the highest in the nation -- after lawmakers could not agree on how the cut should be paid for. The tax, now 38 cents a gallon, is scheduled to increase to 39 cents a gallon by Jan. 1. Do you support cutting the gasoline tax? If so, how far should it be reduced and how would you pay for it?
\
John J. Lescoe
\
Cut the gas tax. There are two proposals under consideration for presentation to the next legislative session. Each penny for taxes at the gas pumps raises about $13 million. By cutting spending and using the surplus monies in the transportation and general government funds and dedicating the new revenue from gambling, we can cut the gas tax.
\
Richard Leydon
\
Yes, we have the nation's highest gas tax at 38 cents a gallon. All other states in New England have gas taxes of less than 22 cents a gallon, except for Rhode Island, which has a 29 cents a gallon tax. This tax needs to be reduced as much as possible to be competitive with other surrounding states and to help the workers of Connecticut that have to commute every day. Two options were presented this year to reduce the gas tax, one by the Democrats, who three years ago in a party line vote approved the gas tax. This time, they wanted to increase the income tax in order to pay for the gas tax cuts. Still no solution, only more taxes. The second option was to reduce spending by one half of 1 percent, and the Democrats voted against this proposal.
\
Privatization: Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
John J. Lescoe
\
The workers in the state should be given the opportunity to improve the efficiency within their departments. They have the expertise and a vested interest. If efficiency is not attained, and IF it can be proven that privatization would reduce waste and produce a profit, it should take place.
\
Richard Leydon
\
We need to be careful with privatization. It may work for some projects but not for everything. I do believe that efficiency can be improved by private industries and waste can be reduced, but we need to remember that we also want quality jobs and quality service. We need to look at all aspects before deciding on each area we want to privatize. The state needs to look at all the services provided and see if privatization has been done in other states and what has been the outcome.
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
John J. Lescoe
\
Windham is one of the highest taxing districts in the state with ability to pay ranking near the bottom. We welcome property tax relief; it is a priority item. Decreasing the income tax and cutting the gas tax produces less revenue, but with an improved economy and frugal spending, a small reprieve may be possible.
\
Richard Leydon
\
Tax relief is one of the biggest issues in the 49th District. We are in the top 10 when it comes to taxation. The gas tax needs to be addressed, but the income tax and the property tax are even higher on the list. {The} property tax {rate} in Willimantic is 36.02 mills, making it very expensive to live in Willimantic. One solution to this problem is using 100 percent of the money coming from the casinos to help with the property tax as it was orginally intended, instead of placing part of this money in the general fund.

\
I believe strongly that children are our future. If we teach them well, we can let them lead the way. My remedy for our urban schools starts at home with our students' parents. We must involve parents in every aspect of their children's education. The Sheff ruling claims that our schools are unconstitutionally segregated. I believe we should be more concerned with moving the resources to the children than the children to the resources.
\
Minnie Gonzalez
\
Our public school system should be modified to create a network of magnet schools throughout the inner cities. A voucher system should be instituted that would be usable in public schools only. Connecticut must move away from its overreliance on local property taxes to fund education.
\
Gas tax: The legislature failed to enact a bill to cut the state's gasoline tax -- the highest in the nation -- after lawmakers could not agree on how the cut should be paid for. The tax, now 38 cents a gallon, is scheduled to increase to 39 cents a gallon by Jan. 1. Do you support cutting the gasoline tax? If so, how far should it be reduced and how would you pay for it?
\
Kevin Sheridan
\
As all candidates this season, I am in favor of cutting the gas tax. I would cut it by making sure that the revenue from the tax on gas is allocated only toward the Special Transportation Fund as it was originally intended. The Democrats' attempt to lower the gas tax at the end of 1996 was in no way a tax cut -- it was merely a tax shift.
\
Minnie Gonzalez
\
The Democratic proposal to replace the revenues lost by cutting the gas tax is most sensible. The Republican alternatives would be aimed -- as all previous unspecified reductions in spending have been -- at those members of our population who can least afford to make the sacrifices the cuts always require of them. We have a large number of very affluent residents who can well afford the modest increases the Democrats have proposed.
\
Privatization: Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Supporters say privatization could increase efficiency and reduce waste, but opponents say it could cost jobs. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
Kevin Sheridan
\
Privatization could indeed save our state money by increasing the efficiency by which services are administered. I support privatization of state services only when it can be clearly determined to save the state money.
\
Minnie Gonzalez
\
Our city and state residents will not be better served by having their vital public services provided by underpaid private workers. Many of the most sensitive public service jobs are dangerous for the workers who fill those positions. How motivated would a minimum-wage prison guard be? Some services are so vital to the general good that the government is the only logical provider.
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Kevin Sheridan
\
I believe both taxes are responsible for the poor condition of the state's economy. The governor is on the right track by lowering the income tax, and I would support those efforts. The facts are that Connecticut residents endure one of the highest tax burdens in the nation. When coupled with the high cost of living, it makes our state very unattractive for new businesses and residents to locate. I would be in favor of any tax relief that improved the conditions of our state, especially our cities, primarily through prudent spending deductions.
\
Minnie Gonzalez
\
The property tax is, by far, the most regressive. Income taxes are based upon one's ability to pay. Property taxes are regressive because they make no allowances, for instance, for senior citizens who may own their own homes but have very small disposable incomes to pay high property taxes. Our state income tax is not the terrible burden the Republicans make it out to be. We have the highest per capita income in the United States and we are nowhere near the top income tax rate of all the states. Ours has always been a very regressive tax-policy state with our reliances upon sales taxes and property taxes.

Responding to a robust economy in an election year, Gov. John G. Rowland pledged Wednesday to cut taxes, freeze public-college tuition, preserve open space and increase school spending.
\
In his State of the State speech, Rowland proposed the highest spending jumps in general expenses and construction projects in his fourth budget as governor. Some of the major projects include spending $130 million to expand Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, $120 million to fix state computers before 2000, and $8 million to bail out the cash-strapped Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford.
\
From education to the environment and from juvenile detention centers to nursing homes, Rowland proposed spending increases in virtually every state program and for virtually every age group. Programs for children, the blind, disabled, and senior citizens all would receive more money in a proposed budget of nearly $11 billion.
\
The biggest point of contention Wednesday was Rowland's plan to use $125 million of the state surplus to award rebates that would be mailed to most taxpayers about two weeks before Election Day. The plan calls for awarding a maximum of $200 for families and $100 for single filers.
\
""If the people of Connecticut pay more in taxes than we need to finance the cost of government, then they deserve a rebate,"" Rowland told a standing-room-only crowd at the state Capitol, just hours after the General Assembly opened its 1998 session. ""As I said, it's their money. They earned it. Let's give it back to them.""
\
Democrats, though, criticized the proposed rebate in unusually harsh language.
\
""What rebate?"" asked Rep. Carl J. Schiessl, the co-chairman of the legislature's tax-writing committee. ""It's dead. It ain't happening.""
\
Several key Democrats said they would never approve sending rebate checks to hundreds of thousands of taxpayers so close to the gubernatorial election. Some said they do not like the rebate concept at all; others said they liked it but would not mail the checks until Christmas -- long after the election.
\
""The timing is stupid,"" said House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, who also serves as co-chairman of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Barbara B. Kennelly's campaign. ""It's so political that it's transparent. His plan, as written, will not pass.""
\
Ritter, who is serving his last term as speaker, had been praised at the start of Rowland's speech, and they hugged each other in front of the packed crowd in the House chamber. Ritter joked later that he liked the beginning of Rowland's speech better than the ending.
\
Rather than vote for rebates, Ritter said, the legislature should instead use the ever-growing budget surpluses to set aside money in the state's ""rainy day fund"" for fiscal emergencies. After that, the state should try to pay down its $9.2 billion debt, he said.
\
Rowland's tax plans are subject to approval by the legislature, but no final decisions are expected until early May.
\
Kennelly, who represents the state's 1st Congressional District and is expected to challenge Rowland in the November election, was in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, but her campaign issued a detailed statement about Rowland's proposals.
\
""This is an election-year budget John Rowland is putting forward to get himself re-elected,"" Kennelly said in the statement. ""He's all speech and no record -- and no Rowland speech will change the Rowland record.""
\
Spending Plan
\
While Democrats sharply criticized the tax-rebate plan, there was less criticism of Rowland's spending plan, which proposes pouring money into traditional Democratic programs -- education, the environment, children's health insurance and the elderly. In a budget that would increase spending by $395 million over the current fiscal year, Rowland called for increasing rent subsidies for the elderly and providing an additional $25 million for nursing homes.
\
""If I didn't know better, I'd say it's a good Democratic budget,"" said Rep. William R. Dyson, the longtime Democratic co-chairman of the legislature's budget-writing committee. ""It's going to be good for the state of Connecticut.""
\
State Of The State
\
In a 41-minute State of the State speech that was interrupted by applause 48 times, Rowland recalled the difficult fiscal days of the early 1990s and said that Connecticut is now in ""a new era"" that will only get better. Within minutes after the speech ended, the state labor department announced that the state's unemployment rate had dropped to 4.4 percent, which is lower than the national rate of 4.7 percent. Connecticut's total employment of 1.63 million workers, in nonfarm jobs, is the highest since 1990.
\
""Today, the state of the state is healthy,"" Rowland said. ""It's vital. It's robust. A bright future is ahead. . . . Now is not the time to turn back. Let's continue on this path. Cutting taxes. Controlling the growth of government. Investing in our children and investing in the future.""
\
The centerpiece of his proposal, Rowland said, is an effort to lower tax rates ""for every single Connecticut resident.""
\
Rowland's co-chief of staff, Sidney J. Holbrook, who served in the House for 12 years and as head of the state Department of Environmental Protection before joining Rowland's staff, said the speech might have broken a record for the most interruptions by applause. When told it was also one of the longest speeches of Rowland's term, Holbrook responded, ""We had a lot to say. We've done a lot.""
\
Rowland's supporters and staff members were clearly pleased with the speech, despite the criticism by Democrats. One of Rowland's political advisers, Republican National Committee member Jo McKenzie, walked triumphantly out of the House chamber while giving the ""thumbs up"" sign and yelling, ""Yes!""
\
On the contrary, some Democrats were sounding like Republicans -- saying that Rowland wasn't providing enough tax cuts and was spending too much on bonding.
\
""The rebate doesn't cut anybody's taxes,"" said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan of West Hartford, the highest-ranking senator. ""What's amazing is there is so little tax relief in this budget -- less than $100 million. We would prefer to give tax relief that is long term.""
\
Sullivan refused to say that the rebate plan is ""dead on arrival"" in the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats, but he said, ""I think it's a difficult hurdle for this proposal. There has been a sense in Connecticut that people were going to see additional tax cuts. We promised that. We're gonna deliver that. This doesn't do it.""
\
Gasoline Tax
\
Besides the tax-rebate plan, Rowland called for cutting the state's gasoline tax by 4 cents a gallon on April 1, rather than a 3-cent-per- gallon decrease that is already scheduled by law for July 1.
\
Republicans and Democrats joined together last year to cut the gas tax, but Democrats seemed uninterested Wednesday in Rowland's plan to push the cut to 4 cents per gallon.
\
""One cent ain't gonna change consumer spending patterns,"" said Schiessl, whose constituents in Enfield and Windsor Locks have been clamoring for gas tax cuts for years. ""I find 1 cent offensive, as a [Massachusetts] border rep. It's meaningless. It's almost a slap in the face to border retailers.""
\
Both Ritter and Schiessl said the gas tax cut should remain on schedule for July 1.
\
""What I think today we saw is lip service to the gas tax issue,"" Schiessl said. ""I think the issue is dead. I don't think we're gonna see any [additional] gas tax relief.""
\
Rebate Defense
\
While Democrats raised questions, House Republican leader Robert M. Ward of North Branford said the state should take advantage of the fast-growing budget surplus, which is now projected at nearly $350 million for the current fiscal year.
\
""Because the revenues grew faster than we anticipated, it makes sense to return it to taxpayers rather than spend it on new programs,"" Ward said. ""And I'm also pleased we're coupling it with further [income tax] rate reductions. So it isn't just a one-time rebate; it's a one-time rebate coupled with a rate reduction that is permanent.""
\
********************************************************************
\
In their own words
\
Senate Majority Leader George C. Jepsen, D-Stamford
\
""There's a real problem with how he's paying for a lot of these new proposals. We do have the highest per-capita debt service in the nation.... The governor, himself, over the last three years has repeatedly spoken to the need to stick a lid on our debt -- and now he's basically taking the existing budget that has about $500 million in bonding, and he's increasing that by $350 million.... I would caution him, not so much on what he's proposing to spend but how he's proposing to pay for it. I think that you can do new bonding, or a rebate, but I would question the wisdom in doing both.""
\
Senate Minority Leader M. Adela Eads, R-Kent
\
""It's the first time in the years I've been here I can really agree when they get up and say Connecticut is economically sound. We have a surplus and this is what we are going to do with it... I don't think we are increasing spending that much. We are increasing it below the inflation level and we have got to (increase spending)... We're not bonding more than what we should. We're restraining ourselves, which the Republicans always have.
\
House Minority Leader Robert M. Ward, R-North Branford
\
""I'm thrilled with the speech and the proposal. His priorities are reducing taxes and targeting additional educational funds to programs that can best help the kids. I really can't think of a better plan. He is returning tax payer money.... Because the revenues grew faster than we anticipated, it makes sense to return it to taxpayers rather than spend it on new programs. And I'm also pleased we're coupling it with further rate reductions. So it isn't just a one-time rebate, it's a one-time rebate coupled with a rate reduction that is permanent.""
\
Deputy House Minority Leader Brian J. Flaherty, R-Watertown
\
""We tightened our belts when we had to, and because of that we have more money than we expected, and we are giving it back to the people who earned it, as they deserve it... It is not so much a matter of increasing spending as where you are putting it... These are focused investments, they are wise, they are aimed at children and other programs the government should be in the position of providing. We have the ability to cut taxes because the economy is good, and because, frankly, of good management, we can afford to do it, and we are also fattening our savings account for the rainy days that could be ahead.""
\
Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan, D-West Hartford:
\
""What's amazing in this is that there is so little tax relief in this budget -- less than $100 million....There has been a sense in Connecticut that people were going to see additional tax cuts. We promised that. We're gonna deliver that. This doesn't do it.""
\
Rep. William R. Dyson, D-New Haven, co-chairman, appropriations committee:
\
""I thought it was a reasonably good message. I didn't see whole lot that I had problems with, recognizng that we're going to take a look at all of it....I don't have a problem with the bottom line [because the state can afford it in a growing economy]. We just have to be responsible in what we do. We can't be overly optimistic about that [economic boom] continuing. There ought to be some caution we engage in.""
\
House Majority Leader Moira K. Lyons, D-Stamford
\
On whether Rowland's proposal for income-tax rebate checks in October is timed for the election: ""Oh, yes, of course ... If you look at when the rebate is going to be delivered to all of us ... what would you say?""
\
On the rebate proposal's chances of passage: ""As I stand here, not knowing all the particulars ... I suppose it's a 50-50 chance.... I never want to give anyone the impression that we [Demcorats] are not committed to tax reduction... It's a question of how you get the most back to the people and what's the best way to do it. ...I think our preference is still for property tax [reductions].""
\
House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, D-Hartford
\
""I liked the beginning of the speech better than the end."" (Rowland begun the speech by praising Ritter, who is retiring this year after six years as House leader.)
\
On a more serious note, Ritter said he was concerned that Rowland had recommended a 5.2 percent spending increase -- well above the rate of inflation.
\
""My general attitude is when times are good you fix the system, and we're not fixing the system. He's diverting money that should be going to the rainy day fund. We should be filling up the rainy day fund, we should be paying down debt service. Those are the kinds of things you can afford to do when times are good.
\
""My guess is we'll modify his plans and come up with something in the middle and we'll do something good by the state of Connecticut and be out in May.""
\
Governor John G. Rowland
\
""The budget adjustments I present to you today are consistent with my fundamental philosophy of cutting taxes, reducing the size of government, eliminating unnecessary regulations, and investing in the people and institutions that hold the key to our future.""
\
""It's time the people of Connecticut got their money back. I want to return of this year's surplus to the people of Connecticut through tax rebates. It's their money, they earned it and they're entitled to it.""

\
At a glance The Governor's Tax Cuts
\
Gov. John G. Rowland has proposed $200 million in income tax cuts, of which this-year-only rebates would account for $125 million. The additional $75 million would be involve changes to the tax tables.
\
* Tax rebate checks of $100 for single filers and $200 for joint filers would be mailed to those who qualify around October 15 for this year only.
\
* Taxpayers must owe both state income tax and property taxes on a car or dwelling to be eligible for the rebates.
\
* For joint-filers, the first $18,000 of taxable income would be taxed at 3 percent. Currently, the first $15,000 of taxable income is taxed at 3 percent. Beyond those wage levels, the tax would be 4.5 percent.
\
* The state gas taxes would drop by four cents a gallon on April 1. The proposal would replace a scheduled 3-cent cut in the state's highest-in-the-nation gas tax that would take affect July 1.
\
* No cuts have been proposed for sales tax or corporate tax.
\

\
A Closer Look At The Issues
\
BUDGET:
\
Overall, $10.92 billion in the second year of the state's two-year budget adopted last year. The governor proposed spending an additional $395 million in the next fiscal year, a 3.5 percent increase over the estimated spending for the current fiscal year. He would increase spending for such things as public school education, programs for foster children, prisons and juvenile detention centers, nursing homes and upgrading the state's computers.
\
With an expected surplus of nearly $350 million, the governor's recommended spending package boosts funding in many more areas, while allowing him to propose tax cuts on the other side.
\
The prognosis: The budget that is presented at the beginning of a legislative session rarely resembles the one that comes out at the end. Expect Democrats, who control both chambers, to add some things, subtract others and change what's left of the Republican governor's plan.
\
The buzz: Everybody gets a finger in the pie.
\
TAXES:
\
The governor proposes to continue cutting taxes. His program includes a $200 million income tax cut, the centerpiece of which is a cash rebate program for qualifying taxpayers. Also included is a $75 million savings based on state income tax table changes. He also would increase an already approved 3-cent cut in the gasoline tax to 4 cents, and would move the effective date up several months, to April 1. No new changes proposed for overall corporate taxes or the sales tax. But a targeted tax break for private water companies.
\
The prognosis: Everyone likes a tax cut, but several Democratic leaders already oppose the rebate program. The gas tax proposal is up in the air. With a projected surplus that continues to grow -- now estimated by some at nearly $350 million -- everyone expects measurable tax reductions by the end of the legislative session in May.
\
The buzz: Taxes go down. Watch the quest for political credit.
\
ENVIRONMENT
\
Preserving open space and restoring state parks are central to the governor's environmental initiatives.
\
Rowland's budget calls for $166 million over the next five years for acquiring land for open space. In the fiscal year that starts July 1, Rowland would add $20 million to the capital budget, so that more than $32 million would be available for the state to buy and set aside undeveloped land.
\
As part of a previously announced 12-year plan for restoring state parks, Rowland's proposal also calls for $12 million in bond money for state park renovations, alterations and construction. He also proposed spending $1.5 million in operating money for such items as reopening eight state parks and forests and hiring 26 people to work in the parks.
\
Prognosis: Environmentalists are expected to fall in behind the governor's plan. Legislators are likely to look for ways to get a piece of the action. With mainly bond money at stake, and little from the general fund, this is an easy vote for legislators.
\
The buzz: Feel-good legislation with little downside.
\
EDUCATION
\
Rowland proposes to spend an additional $93 million this year -- and as much as $500 million over five years -- to hire hundreds of new teachers to reduce class size and provide more help for students who are poor readers; provide more grant money to local school districts for school construction or renovation; and expand summer school and after-school programs. Democrats are proposing a three-year $265 million plan with many of the same priorities.
\
The governor and legislative leaders also agree that the state must pay for more special education costs for children who are placed out of district by state agencies. The governor has proposed spending $15 million on this, but Democrats have said they want to do more. On higher education, the governor proposed to freeze tuition at all state colleges and universities and to increase scholarship aid.
\
The prognosis: The proposals have broad bipartisan support, and, if anything, Democrats in the legislature may increase funding in some key areas. Additionally, there may be growing support for increasing the education funds the state gives local school districts, especially as reports about growing disparities among school districts increase. The freeze and scholarship plans also enjoy broad support.
\
The buzz: In a political year, skirmishing over the proposals themselves as well as who gets credit for them.
\
CRIME, PUBLIC SAFETY
\
Proposals include strengthening Megan's Law, under which sex offenders must register with local police after release from prison. Rowland would extend the registration period from 10 years to life and add some less serious crimes to the list of offenses that require registration. Registration would be with state police rather than local police. Also proposed: Tougher sentences for repeat sex offenders and a study of possible civil commitments of sex offenders for treatment once they have completed their sentences.
\
In other areas, the governor would send more prisoners out of state to relieve overcrowding. In the past, that had been billed as a money-saver. Now, the governor seeks an additional $7.5 million to cover fees charged by out-of-state prisons and transportation costs. He would add 94 special deputy sheriffs at new courthouses and would add 38 new positions, for $3 million, to the Department of Public Safety. More money for prison employees and additional space as well as more prosecutors and judges for child protection and juvenile cases.
\
The prognosis: Changes to Megan's Law are likely, but civil commitments of sex offenders are not. Critics note that Rowland has had authority since 1995 to send inmates out of state, yet has not done so -- and don't look for it to happen this year on a large scale. Juvenile justice changes, following up on landmark 1995 reforms, are likely to be approved.
\
The buzz: Crime won't be a major issue at the legislature, but will be a drumbeat heard often on the campaign trail.
\
TRANSPORTATION
\
The governor would spend $130 million to improve and expand Bradley International Airport as a business development initiative. He proposed to move forward with plans to relieve congestion on I-95 in Fairfield County and vowed to complete Route 11 in eastern Connecticut and work toward building a new and safer Route 6.
\
The governor's office said the proposal for I-95 would not involve any new spending but would increase incentives for use of mass transit and encourage car-pooling and flex-time hours.
\
The prognosis: Expansion of Bradley has long been planned and is likely to go forward. Relieving highway congestion is a permanent goal of all governors, but actually getting people out of their cars has proved next to impossible. Similarly, improvements to Routes 11 and 6 are every-year issues, with action better measured in decades than in years.
\
The buzz: Improving roads and reducing highway congestion end up legislative roadkill. Expanding Bradley has a good chance of taking off.
\
ELECTRIC DEREGULATION
\
A key issue at the Capitol this year. Proposed legislation would open Connecticut's electricity markets to retail competition and reduce rates by at least 10 percent on July 1, 1999.
\
The governor and legislative leaders agree they want to take action this session, to prevent Connecticut from falling behind other New England states that have given customers a choice of electricity suppliers.
\
The latest version of the bill that emerged from the legislature's energy and technology committee this week appears to solve some of the most controversial problems that derailed the competition bill last session. The bill would allow 35 percent of all electricity customers a choice of suppliers on July 1, 1999, and open the entire state to competition a year later. The state's regulated utility companies -- Connecticut Light & Power Co. and United Illuminating Co. -- would be required to sell off their power plants to be eligible to recover expenses they could not pass on in a competitive marketplace.
\
The prognosis: Some form of electric deregulation appears likely to pass this session. Legislative leaders agree the latest version is an improvement over last year's, which died in the Senate without a vote. Changes are expected as the bill travels through a half-dozen committees. Plans now call for a House vote in mid-March.
\
The buzz: Not as exciting as tax cuts, and loaded with detail, but it affects everyone.
\
HEALTH
\
In a major initiative, Rowland would provide an $8 million bail-out for the two-year-old Connecticut Children's Medical Center in downtown Hartford. The 123-bed hospital opened in April 1996 and completed each of the last two fiscal years with a deficit of $16 million.
\
About half of the losses were blamed on start-up costs for the $90 million building and on some strategic and management blunders by hospital founders that have since been repaired. The hospital is also hurt by the fact that it is a free-standing children's hospital, not eligible for federal reimbursement through Medicare, the health insurance for the elderly.
\
Rowland's proposal also would keep open Blue Hills Hospital in Hartford, which had been targeted for closure for budgetary reasons.
\
The prognosis: Both hospitals are in House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter's hometown and are strongly supported by another powerful local lawmaker, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan, D-West Hartford. The legislature approved a bill last year exempting the children's hospital from paying taxes that all other general hospitals pay, and Hartford area lawmakers led protests against the planned closing of Blue Hills.
\
The buzz: Anyone for closing a hospital? How about voting against a kids' hospital?
\
TECHNOLOGY
\
The governor proposed an additional $120 million in state bond money to fix what is commonly known as the ""Year 2000"" problem: a computer date-reading problem that threatens to derail everything from welfare checks to drivers' licenses if not corrected. The state allocated $15 million to repair the problem last year, but a private consultant said last month the problem is more serious and complex than originally thought. Most computers read only the last two digits for dates, assuming a 19 before them. They will read 1900 when the year 2000 rolls around.
\
Another Rowland initiative, to privatize the state's computer system, has been delayed, probably until late in the year.
\
Rowland also would create a statewide ""211"" telephone line for non-emergency requests for government information, similar to the 911 system for emergencies and 411 for telephone information. President Clinton proposed a similar phone system in 1996 as a way to unclog the 911 system, which is now burdened by thousands of non-emergency calls.
\
The prognosis: The millennium glitch is costly, but failing to fix it would be disastrous. Look for quick approval of at least some bonding money to solve the problem. The privatization initiative is strongly opposed by state unions and Democrats and may be too hot to handle in an election year. The new telephone line could be a winner if costs can be controlled.
\
The buzz: The 2000 issue is an easy sell. Privatization won't come up this session.
\
FAMILIES
\
In addition to the initiatives on Connecticut Children's Medical Center and juvenile justice, Rowland would spend about $3 million to hire new assistant attorneys general to handle child-protection cases and add five new judges to hear cases involving abused and neglected children.
\
Rowland also would add 66 child-welfare case workers in the Department of Children and Families, work to speed up the process of terminating parental rights from 18 months to 12 months and improve screening programs for newborn infants. And he again touted his HUSKY plan to offer free or affordable insurance to as many as 90,000 children who are now uninsured. The state would spend $34.5 million on the program in the fiscal year that starts July 1.
\
The prognosis: These proposals face smooth sailing. The HUSKY plan -- Healthcare for Uninsured Kids and Youth -- has already been approved.
\
The buzz: Politicians love to say it: Kids are the future. And their parents vote.

78,"
In a mostly civil exchange of views, candidates for the 52nd House District seat debated Thursday night after weeks of disagreement over whether to meet at all.
\
Incumbent Rep. John D. Mordasky, D-Stafford, and Republican challenger Allen Bacchiochi spent about an hour answering questions about health care, education and taxes posed by an audience of some 35 people at Woodstock Town Hall.
\
Mordasky and Bacchiochi generally agreed on the need for a lower gas tax and increased funding for education, and both opposed term limits. But Bacchiochi attacked his opponent's record on the environment, the state budget surplus and campaign finance reform.
\
One such criticism, over Mordasky's vote in favor of a package of loans and tax credits for a Stamford investment bank, the former Swiss Bank, that could be worth as much as $200 million over 15 years, sparked the sharpest clash of the night.
\
Bacchiochi said he favored paying off the state's $11.3 billion debt and giving taxpayers a rebate instead of aiding a multibillion- dollar company.
\
Mordasky said the tax credits will ultimately earn money for the state because of the investment bank's commitment to create as many as 2,000 new jobs.
\
""Those people who work for Swiss Bank have an average income of $70,000 a year,"" Mordasky said. ""People who have $70,000 in income pay a lot of income taxes.""
\
As for giving taxpayers a rebate, Mordasky said, ""I think we would make more money for constituents by paying the debt instead of giving them 50 bucks.""
\
Bacchiochi also took aim at Mordasky's environmental stance, accusing him of ignoring a bill to clean up the ""Filthy Five,"" the state's five dirtiest power plants.
\
""Mr. Mordasky has not sponsored one bill on the environment in the last four years,"" Bacchiochi said.
\
Mordasky disagreed. ""I'm very interested in the environment, and if Mr. Bacchiochi checks it, I co-sponsored cleaning up the filthy five,"" Mordasky said.
\
Bacchiochi scoffed, ""Co-sponsoring means absolutely nothing. You put no effort, no time and no energy into it.""
\
On campaign finance reform, Bacchiochi said he wants full donor disclosure and limits on contributions, and said Mordasky supports the status quo.
\
""My opponent voted for you to finance his campaign,"" Bacchiochi said.
\
Mordasky said the campaign finance bill he voted against was flawed, and added that he supports a limit on contributions of $250 each person to state House candidates, $500 each person for state Senate candidates and progressively higher limits for executive offices.
\
""That's the only way to do it,"" Mordasky said.
\
Thursday's meeting came after weeks of disagreement between the campaigns over how many times to debate, where to debate and who should moderate. The only other scheduled meeting between Bacchiochi and Mordasky is Nov. 1 on Putnam radio station WINY-AM, 1350, from 9 to 10 a.m.

\
And the winners of this year's Fill 'Er Up and Airwave Pollution awards are Gov. John G. Rowland and Environmental Protection Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque Jr., respectively, for their supporting roles in misleading radio ads.
\
First, Gov. Rowland. A recent commercial, paid for by his re-election committee, scolded Democratic legislators for refusing to rubber-stamp his proposed cut in the state gasoline tax. The ad is designed to win votes from Connecticut's motoring public, which includes just about everyone over the age of 16. Unfortunately, it's replete with half-truths, untruths and whoppers.
\
Exhibit I. ""Under Gov. Rowland, the gas tax in Connecticut has been cut by 3 cents per gallon."" Half-truth. In 1997, the legislature approved a bill, subsequently signed by the governor, that lowered the gas tax in two steps: 3 cents on July 1, 1997, and 3 cents on July 1, 1998.
\
Exhibit II. ""Now {the governor} has a plan to cut the state's gas tax further by another 4 cents beginning April 1."" Untruth. In February, Rowland proposed adding a penny onto the already enacted 3-cent drop and speeding up the timetable by three months. He later raised the ante by a penny.
\
Exhibit III. ""Some Democrats in the legislature refuse to even schedule a vote on Gov. Rowland's plan to cut the gas tax."" Untruth. The Democrat-controlled finance committee last week scheduled, voted on and unanimously approved an additional 2-cent reduction and sent it to the House.The only item the committee failed to endorse was the April 1 start-up date.
\
Exhibit IV. ""Gov. Rowland's gas tax would save Connecticut's motorists $1 million a week, money that could go for other things like groceries, day care and even another car."" Whopper. The 2-cent-a-gallon savings would put about $1.20 a month, or $14.40 a year, in the pocket of a motorist who uses 15 gallons of gas a week. Groceries? More like a hot dog, hold the sauerkraut. As for a car, the governor must drive the matchbox variety.
\
But never mind. The next time you pull into a service station, turn off the radio, fill up the tank and think of all the groceries you can buy with the 30 cents you're about to save. Thanks, governor. And pass the mustard.
\
Now for Art Rocque, the guardian of our environment. The state DEP, which has been assailed by federal officials for staffing shortages, is spending $60,000 on a public service announcement aimed at discouraging Connecticut residents from doing stuff that pollutes the air. In truth, the spot is a thinly disguised attempt to repair the image of an agency that has been maligned -- and rightly so -- for ineptitude, misallocation of resources and cutting deals with fat cat polluters.
\
In the radio ad, Rocque touts the progress that Connecticut has made in lowering ozone levels. The state has ""many programs to improve air quality,"" he boasts. What the commissioner fails to mention is that two months ago, the Rowland administration rejected a stringent auto emissions control program in favor of one with lower standards.
\
Rocque also asserts that Connecticut's air quality has ""really improved"" over the past five years. By some estimates, however, 97 percent of state residents still breathe air that the EPA considers unhealthy. If the air quality has, in fact, ""really improved,"" imagine how vile it was five years ago.
\
In the governor's defense, spokesman Dean Pagani points out that Rowland has taken pro-environment stances, including suing New York City for spilling untreated sewage into Long Island Sound.
\
But suing Rudy Giuliani doesn't qualify as an act of courage. It's doubtful that the New York City mayor has contributed to Rowland's gubernatorial campaign. The same can't be said of the corporate scofflaws whose fines have been made to vanish by an agency so politicized that even lawmakers cozy with the administration can no longer bury their heads in the sand. The legislature has launched a full-scale investigation of the DEP.
\
Although the inquiry is focusing on lax enforcement, political favoritism and staffing levels, lawmakers would be remiss if they didn't look closely at Vito ""The Fixer"" Santarsiero Jr. A low-level Rowland appointee, Santarsiero allegedly engaged in various and sundry shenanigans, all the while earning $20,000 in overtime pay in 1996 and 1997.He recently left the DEP after a spotlight was shined on his questionable activities.
\
The air quality is bad enough without Rocque fouling it further with his public relations hooey.

\
Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling: The state Supreme Court has ruled that the Hartford schools are unconstitutionally segregated and has ordered the state to come up with a solution. What remedy do you favor to correct this?
\
Robert A. Landino
\
He favors the creation of magnet schools that provide opportunities that would attract students from cities and suburbs. Landino wants to open up suburban schools and make it easier for students from the state's larger cities to attend suburban schools on a voluntary basis. He supports public school vouchers that would give all students more opportunities to attend the school of the students' and their parents' choice. He supports increased funding for urban schools that would expand educational opportunities in these schools.
\
Daniel W. Gallagher
\
Gallagher supports a voucher system that would allow parents to choose the best educational environment for their children. He wants to give all parents the opportunity to send their children to private or parochial schools, no matter their income. He feels forced busing is not a viable alternative, saying it inevitably alienates parents from their children's education, which is a detriment to a child's education.
\
Gas tax: The legislature failed to enact a bill to cut the state's gasoline tax -- the highest in the nation -- after lawmakers could not agree on how the cut should be paid for. The tax, now 38 cents a gallon, is scheduled to increase to 39 cents a gallon by Jan. 1. Democrats said they could cut the gas tax to 32 cents a gallon by 1998 by raising income taxes on the wealthiest 13 percent of wage earners, while Republicans said a similar rollback could be accomplished through unspecified reductions in spending. Do you support cutting the gasoline tax? If so, how far should it be reduced and how would you pay for it?
\
Robert A. Landino
\
He wants to reduce the gas tax and believes this should be done by some fiscally responsible mechanism that would reduce the size of state government over a seven- to eight-year period without wholesale ""axing"" of state jobs. Landino believes this could be done through attrition and retirement of state workers. He does not favor large, dramatic personnel cuts in state government. He wants long-term restructuring rather than a wholesale cut.
\
Daniel W. Gallagher
\
He supports cutting the gas tax by 4 cents. That will mean people who now go a short way to another state to buy gas will decide to buy in Connecticut, he says. This will raise additional revenue for state, he says. Gallagher believes the reduction in the gas tax can be financed by revenue from the additional gas purchased in the state, and small cuts from every department of state government.
\
Privatization: Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Supporters say privatization could increase efficiency and reduce waste, but opponents say it is a thinly disguised union-busting effort that could cost jobs and lead to the elimination of some necessary services. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
Robert A. Landino
\
Landino says we must be very careful about what parts of state government are privatized. Under no circumstances should state prisons be privatized, he says, but the state should study the possibility of privatizing motor vehicle inspection services. In other states these inspection services are done by small automotive service stations. This is something that could benefit some of the state's small businesses, which might do the job more efficiently, he says.
\
Daniel W. Gallagher
\
Gallagher supports privatization for nonessential state services such as the lottery. He supports Gov. John Rowland's efforts to privatize the lottery.
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Robert A. Landino
\
Landino says the the sales tax is the most regressive tax in Connecticut. He favors reducing it over a long period of time. The state income tax is deductible from a person's federal tax return, which is a progressive tax, he says. Cutting the sales tax or the property tax would have many more immediate benefits for the middle class, he says.
\
Daniel W. Gallagher
\
Gallagher wants to decrease the income tax. Municipal government and municipal taxes are more responsive to the will of voters; voters have far less control over the state income tax, he says. Gallagher supports Rowland's efforts to phase out state income tax.

Mary Mushinsky
\
Mushinsky favors cutting the property tax because it ""is not based on ability to pay, but rather falls most heavily on the elderly and on those taxpayers trapped in municipalities with shrinking tax bases."" She says the state could provide cities with more aid and help them to save money through insurance pools. She voted to lower the income tax, but said it would be ""irresponsible to eliminate it entirely.""
\
Barbara Chayer

Chayer would cut the income tax. ""I would like to see it eliminated but I cannot predict how to do it or by when."" She says savings might be found in education and social services.
"
82,"
Responding to a robust economy in an election year, Gov. John G. Rowland pledged Wednesday to cut taxes, freeze public-college tuition, preserve open space and increase school spending.
\
In his State of the State speech, Rowland proposed the highest spending jumps in general expenses and construction projects in his fourth budget as governor. Some of the major projects include spending $130 million to expand Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, $120 million to fix state computers before 2000, and $8 million to bail out the cash-strapped Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford.
\
From education to the environment and from juvenile detention centers to nursing homes, Rowland proposed spending increases in virtually every state program and for virtually every age group. Programs for children, the blind, disabled, and senior citizens all would receive more money in a proposed budget of nearly $11 billion.
\
The biggest point of contention Wednesday was Rowland's plan to use $125 million of the state surplus to award rebates that would be mailed to most taxpayers about two weeks before Election Day. The plan calls for awarding a maximum of $200 for families and $100 for single filers.
\
""If the people of Connecticut pay more in taxes than we need to finance the cost of government, then they deserve a rebate,"" Rowland told a standing-room-only crowd at the state Capitol, just hours after the General Assembly opened its 1998 session. ""As I said, it's their money. They earned it. Let's give it back to them.""
\
Democrats, though, criticized the proposed rebate in unusually harsh language.
\
""What rebate?"" asked Rep. Carl J. Schiessl, the co-chairman of the legislature's tax-writing committee. ""It's dead. It ain't happening.""
\
Several key Democrats said they would never approve sending rebate checks to hundreds of thousands of taxpayers so close to the gubernatorial election. Some said they do not like the rebate concept at all; others said they liked it but would not mail the checks until Christmas -- long after the election.
\
""The timing is stupid,"" said House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, who also serves as co-chairman of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Barbara B. Kennelly's campaign. ""It's so political that it's transparent. His plan, as written, will not pass.""
\
Ritter, who is serving his last term as speaker, had been praised at the start of Rowland's speech, and they hugged each other in front of the packed crowd in the House chamber. Ritter joked later that he liked the beginning of Rowland's speech better than the ending.
\
Rather than vote for rebates, Ritter said, the legislature should instead use the ever-growing budget surpluses to set aside money in the state's ""rainy day fund"" for fiscal emergencies. After that, the state should try to pay down its $9.2 billion debt, he said.
\
Rowland's tax plans are subject to approval by the legislature, but no final decisions are expected until early May.
\
Kennelly, who represents the state's 1st Congressional District and is expected to challenge Rowland in the November election, was in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, but her campaign issued a detailed statement about Rowland's proposals.
\
""This is an election-year budget John Rowland is putting forward to get himself re-elected,"" Kennelly said in the statement. ""He's all speech and no record -- and no Rowland speech will change the Rowland record.""
\
Spending Plan
\
While Democrats sharply criticized the tax-rebate plan, there was less criticism of Rowland's spending plan, which proposes pouring money into traditional Democratic programs -- education, the environment, children's health insurance and the elderly. In a budget that would increase spending by $395 million over the current fiscal year, Rowland called for increasing rent subsidies for the elderly and providing an additional $25 million for nursing homes.
\
""If I didn't know better, I'd say it's a good Democratic budget,"" said Rep. William R. Dyson, the longtime Democratic co-chairman of the legislature's budget-writing committee. ""It's going to be good for the state of Connecticut.""
\
State Of The State
\
In a 41-minute State of the State speech that was interrupted by applause 48 times, Rowland recalled the difficult fiscal days of the early 1990s and said that Connecticut is now in ""a new era"" that will only get better. Within minutes after the speech ended, the state labor department announced that the state's unemployment rate had dropped to 4.4 percent, which is lower than the national rate of 4.7 percent. Connecticut's total employment of 1.63 million workers, in nonfarm jobs, is the highest since 1990.
\
""Today, the state of the state is healthy,"" Rowland said. ""It's vital. It's robust. A bright future is ahead. . . . Now is not the time to turn back. Let's continue on this path. Cutting taxes. Controlling the growth of government. Investing in our children and investing in the future.""
\
The centerpiece of his proposal, Rowland said, is an effort to lower tax rates ""for every single Connecticut resident.""
\
Rowland's co-chief of staff, Sidney J. Holbrook, who served in the House for 12 years and as head of the state Department of Environmental Protection before joining Rowland's staff, said the speech might have broken a record for the most interruptions by applause. When told it was also one of the longest speeches of Rowland's term, Holbrook responded, ""We had a lot to say. We've done a lot.""
\
Rowland's supporters and staff members were clearly pleased with the speech, despite the criticism by Democrats. One of Rowland's political advisers, Republican National Committee member Jo McKenzie, walked triumphantly out of the House chamber while giving the ""thumbs up"" sign and yelling, ""Yes!""
\
On the contrary, some Democrats were sounding like Republicans -- saying that Rowland wasn't providing enough tax cuts and was spending too much on bonding.
\
""The rebate doesn't cut anybody's taxes,"" said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan of West Hartford, the highest-ranking senator. ""What's amazing is there is so little tax relief in this budget -- less than $100 million. We would prefer to give tax relief that is long term.""
\
Sullivan refused to say that the rebate plan is ""dead on arrival"" in the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats, but he said, ""I think it's a difficult hurdle for this proposal. There has been a sense in Connecticut that people were going to see additional tax cuts. We promised that. We're gonna deliver that. This doesn't do it.""
\
Gasoline Tax
\
Besides the tax-rebate plan, Rowland called for cutting the state's gasoline tax by 4 cents a gallon on April 1, rather than a 3-cent-per- gallon decrease that is already scheduled by law for July 1.
\
Republicans and Democrats joined together last year to cut the gas tax, but Democrats seemed uninterested Wednesday in Rowland's plan to push the cut to 4 cents per gallon.
\
""One cent ain't gonna change consumer spending patterns,"" said Schiessl, whose constituents in Enfield and Windsor Locks have been clamoring for gas tax cuts for years. ""I find 1 cent offensive, as a {Massachusetts} border rep. It's meaningless. It's almost a slap in the face to border retailers.""
\
Both Ritter and Schiessl said the gas tax cut should remain on schedule for July 1.
\
""What I think today we saw is lip service to the gas tax issue,"" Schiessl said. ""I think the issue is dead. I don't think we're gonna see any {additional} gas tax relief.""
\
Rebate Defense
\
While Democrats raised questions, House Republican leader Robert M. Ward of North Branford said the state should take advantage of the fast-growing budget surplus, which is now projected at nearly $350 million for the current fiscal year.
\
""Because the revenues grew faster than we anticipated, it makes sense to return it to taxpayers rather than spend it on new programs,"" Ward said. ""And I'm also pleased we're coupling it with further {income tax} rate reductions. So it isn't just a one-time rebate; it's a one-time rebate coupled with a rate reduction that is permanent.""

\
Top three priorities if elected:
\
1. A state constitutional amendment to nullify the Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling and implement common sense education reform that addresses the academic needs of Hartford school children.
\
2. The legislature must continue to prune the state budget so that Connecticut becomes more attractive to new businesses. Without new and energized employers, there can be no new jobs.
\
3. Eliminate statutes that allow dangerous students to return to classrooms after expulsions.
\
Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling: The state Supreme Court has ruled that the Hartford schools are unconstitutionally segregated and has ordered the state to come up with a solution. What remedy do you favor to correct this?
\
Kevin B. Sullivan
\
Connecticut succeeds when all our children succeed, but it's about basics -- not busing. We must focus urban schools on readiness, parent education, higher expectations and less top-heavy bureaucracy. We should also continue voluntary interdistrict efforts through magnet programs, teacher exchanges, grass-roots charter schools and more public school choice.
\
Geoffrey Fisher
\
We must amend the state constitution to nullify the Sheff ruling and guarantee no forced busing. The Legislature must enact true education reforms for the Hartford public schools -- provide more teachers in the primary grades, end social promotion of students by requiring all students to master the needed skills before moving to the next grade, {and require} fluency in English withing two years to ensure success.
\
Gas tax: The legislature failed to enact a bill to cut the state's gasoline tax -- the highest in the nation -- after lawmakers could not agree on how the cut should be paid for. The tax, now 38 cents a gallon, is scheduled to increase to 39 cents a gallon by Jan. 1. Do you support cutting the gasoline tax? If so, how far should it be reduced and how would you pay for it?
\
Kevin B. Sullivan
\
Senate Democrats proposed a nine-cent cut in the gas tax by reducing spending and shifting operating costs to existing general fund revenues. We were defeated on a party-line vote. Connecticut consumers and businesses need relief from the highest-in-the-nation state gas tax.
\
Geoffrey Fisher
\
I support decreasing the gas tax but only through additional economies within the state budget. The hike in the tax was originally enacted due to the infrastructure problems of our highways and that fund must not be jeopardized. I do not favor any increases in the state income tax.
\
Privatization: Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Supporters say privatization could increase efficiency and reduce waste, but opponents say it could cost jobs and lead to the elimination of some necessary services. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
Kevin B. Sullivan
\
Privatization is no cure-all. What's missing are clear standards and safeguards. We also need more flexibility and a level playing field so state employees can compete to provide services more efficiently without losing public accountability.
\
Geoffrey Fisher
\
I do support the privatization of state agencies if those agencies do not provide cost effective quality service. The state should not be looked to as employer but as the vehicle for the private sector to create new jobs. the marketplace should be supported, not hindered.
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Kevin B. Sullivan
\
Property taxes are Connecticut's most burdensome and this is an issue for all our towns -- especially older suburbs. I fought cuts in property tax relief for the elderly and support a fair homestead exemption as well as personal and corporate income tax offsets for proportionally high local property taxes.
\
Geoffrey Fisher
\
Although an argument can be made that the property tax is more onerous than the state income tax, it should be remembered that the latter drives the state budget and increases spending. Indeed, the state income tax means more power in the capital city vs. the local chambers of government. So I would favor a reduction in the state income tax with some exploration of whether enabling legislation can be written that would allow local communities to experiment with other taxing plans.
"
86,"
In the late 1960s I had a summer job at a paper box mill in Montville. The mill was on a creek, which fed a pond. One day as I went to work, I couldn't help but notice that the pond was bright yellow. This wasn't a metaphorical golden pond; someone had dumped ink into the creek.
\
It wasn't unusual to see water of different colors in those days. The Connecticut River, for example, had a brownish-gray tinge. Thankfully, you don't see many yellow ponds or brown rivers anymore.
\
Connecticut residents of a certain age, actually anyone born before 1985, has seen dramatic improvements in the state's environment. The air and water are cleaner, tidal wetlands have been restored and ospreys are back.
\
But, as is pointed out in the state Council on Environmental Quality's recently released annual report, ""genuine problems persist.""
\
Indeed, those born since 1985 have seen barely any improvement in the environment. That's in part due to earlier successes. For example, most hazardous wastes are collected and neutralized, not tossed into the water.
\
But it's also due to the fact that we're treading water, so to speak. We haven't made much progress in the past decade. Air quality is a little better, but the number of bad air days is about where it was 10 years ago. Water quality is better, but spreading development pollutes more small streams. Beach closing days on Long Island Sound are about the same. Open space acquisition is going well but farmland preservation virtually ground to a halt in 2003, with no farms preserved. The average Connecticut resident drives more miles each year; bus ridership fell 13 percent in 2002.
\
We may not need another Earth Day, but we could use an Earth Afternoon, at the very least. We need to get moving again. What to focus on?
\
Land.
\
""The one resource that will determine the fate of all the others is Connecticut's land, and it remains the one in most need of attention,"" the report says. ""Agricultural vistas and large forests are broken up, traffic spreads, small streams get polluted and many species of wildlife diminish as land is consumed to serve Connecticut's fast-sprawling (but slow-growing) population.""
\
The Council said its focus for the next year will be how the state can meet its demand for land development while conserving the water, air and wildlife that derive their quality from the land.
\
This ought to be everyone's focus for the next year, starting with Gov. Jodi Rell.
\
We are inexorably and relentlessly developing the state's land. A study by the University of Connecticut's Center for Land Use Education and Research, covering 1985 to 2002, found the state is losing an average of 18 acres of forest per day and adding 12 acres each day of high-density development -- buildings, parking lots and roads. This seemingly inexorable sprawl development puts pressure on the environment.
\
There is a finite amount of land. If this development continues - - and what's to stop it -- the state will be built out, in our children's' lifetimes if not ours.
\
How should Connecticut look, when the last gas grill goes on the last deck? Will we be the cul-de-sac state, a massive undifferentiated collage of strip malls and subdivisions? It's irresponsible not to ask.
\
Several groups along with the council are struggling with this complex question, which involves tax policy, state subsidies, market forces and local zoning regulations.
\
The state will remain essentially suburban. There won't be a groundswell to turn in cars and take the monorail to work. But we ought to set some realistic goals to help our beleaguered environment.
\
Let's try to get 5 percent of the cars off the road, by producing more commuter rail and bus service, ferries and bike paths. Let's add a cent to the gas tax for use on bike trails. Let's do more brownfield projects such as the Pfizer complex in New London, a brilliant reuse of urban land.
\
Let's make local plans consistent with the state plan of conservation and development.
\
I look back incredulously on the yellow pond in Montville. I hope some college student today will look back at the six to eight hours a day of choking gridlock on I-95 with the same bemused gratitude that it's long over.
"
87,"
Responding to a robust economy in an election year, Gov. John G. Rowland pledged Wednesday to cut taxes, freeze public-college tuition, preserve open space and increase school spending.
\
In his State of the State speech, Rowland proposed the highest spending jumps in general expenses and construction projects in his fourth budget as governor. Some of the major projects include spending $130 million to expand Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, $120 million to fix state computers before 2000, and $8 million to bail out the cash-strapped Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford.
\
From education to the environment and from juvenile detention centers to nursing homes, Rowland proposed spending increases in virtually every state program and for virtually every age group. Programs for children, the blind, disabled, and senior citizens all would receive more money in a proposed budget of nearly $11 billion.
\
The biggest point of contention Wednesday was Rowland's plan to use $125 million of the state surplus to award rebates that would be mailed to most taxpayers about two weeks before Election Day. The plan calls for awarding a maximum of $200 for families and $100 for single filers.
\
""If the people of Connecticut pay more in taxes than we need to finance the cost of government, then they deserve a rebate,"" Rowland told a standing-room-only crowd at the state Capitol, just hours after the General Assembly opened its 1998 session. ""As I said, it's their money. They earned it. Let's give it back to them.""
\
Democrats, though, criticized the proposed rebate in unusually harsh language.
\
""What rebate?"" asked Rep. Carl J. Schiessl, the co-chairman of the legislature's tax-writing committee. ""It's dead. It ain't happening.""
\
Several key Democrats said they would never approve sending rebate checks to hundreds of thousands of taxpayers so close to the gubernatorial election. Some said they do not like the rebate concept at all; others said they liked it but would not mail the checks until Christmas -- long after the election.
\
""The timing is stupid,"" said House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, who also serves as co-chairman of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Barbara B. Kennelly's campaign. ""It's so political that it's transparent. His plan, as written, will not pass.""
\
Ritter, who is serving his last term as speaker, had been praised at the start of Rowland's speech, and they hugged each other in front of the packed crowd in the House chamber. Ritter joked later that he liked the beginning of Rowland's speech better than the ending.
\
Rather than vote for rebates, Ritter said, the legislature should instead use the ever-growing budget surpluses to set aside money in the state's ""rainy day fund"" for fiscal emergencies. After that, the state should try to pay down its $9.2 billion debt, he said.
\
Rowland's tax plans are subject to approval by the legislature, but no final decisions are expected until early May.
\
Kennelly, who represents the state's 1st Congressional District and is expected to challenge Rowland in the November election, was in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, but her campaign issued a detailed statement about Rowland's proposals.
\
""This is an election-year budget John Rowland is putting forward to get himself re-elected,"" Kennelly said in the statement. ""He's all speech and no record -- and no Rowland speech will change the Rowland record.""
\
Spending Plan
\
While Democrats sharply criticized the tax-rebate plan, there was less criticism of Rowland's spending plan, which proposes pouring money into traditional Democratic programs -- education, the environment, children's health insurance and the elderly. In a budget that would increase spending by $395 million over the current fiscal year, Rowland called for increasing rent subsidies for the elderly and providing an additional $25 million for nursing homes.
\
""If I didn't know better, I'd say it's a good Democratic budget,"" said Rep. William R. Dyson, the longtime Democratic co-chairman of the legislature's budget-writing committee. ""It's going to be good for the state of Connecticut.""
\
State Of The State
\
In a 41-minute State of the State speech that was interrupted by applause 48 times, Rowland recalled the difficult fiscal days of the early 1990s and said that Connecticut is now in ""a new era"" that will only get better. Within minutes after the speech ended, the state labor department announced that the state's unemployment rate had dropped to 4.4 percent, which is lower than the national rate of 4.7 percent. Connecticut's total employment of 1.63 million workers, in nonfarm jobs, is the highest since 1990.
\
""Today, the state of the state is healthy,"" Rowland said. ""It's vital. It's robust. A bright future is ahead. . . . Now is not the time to turn back. Let's continue on this path. Cutting taxes. Controlling the growth of government. Investing in our children and investing in the future.""
\
The centerpiece of his proposal, Rowland said, is an effort to lower tax rates ""for every single Connecticut resident.""
\
Rowland's co-chief of staff, Sidney J. Holbrook, who served in the House for 12 years and as head of the state Department of Environmental Protection before joining Rowland's staff, said the speech might have broken a record for the most interruptions by applause. When told it was also one of the longest speeches of Rowland's term, Holbrook responded, ""We had a lot to say. We've done a lot.""
\
Rowland's supporters and staff members were clearly pleased with the speech, despite the criticism by Democrats. One of Rowland's political advisers, Republican National Committee member Jo McKenzie, walked triumphantly out of the House chamber while giving the ""thumbs up"" sign and yelling, ""Yes!""
\
On the contrary, some Democrats were sounding like Republicans -- saying that Rowland wasn't providing enough tax cuts and was spending too much on bonding.
\
""The rebate doesn't cut anybody's taxes,"" said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan of West Hartford, the highest-ranking senator. ""What's amazing is there is so little tax relief in this budget -- less than $100 million. We would prefer to give tax relief that is long term.""
\
Sullivan refused to say that the rebate plan is ""dead on arrival"" in the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats, but he said, ""I think it's a difficult hurdle for this proposal. There has been a sense in Connecticut that people were going to see additional tax cuts. We promised that. We're gonna deliver that. This doesn't do it.""
\
Gasoline Tax
\
Besides the tax-rebate plan, Rowland called for cutting the state's gasoline tax by 4 cents a gallon on April 1, rather than a 3-cent-per- gallon decrease that is already scheduled by law for July 1.
\
Republicans and Democrats joined together last year to cut the gas tax, but Democrats seemed uninterested Wednesday in Rowland's plan to push the cut to 4 cents per gallon.
\
""One cent ain't gonna change consumer spending patterns,"" said Schiessl, whose constituents in Enfield and Windsor Locks have been clamoring for gas tax cuts for years. ""I find 1 cent offensive, as a {Massachusetts} border rep. It's meaningless. It's almost a slap in the face to border retailers.""
\
Both Ritter and Schiessl said the gas tax cut should remain on schedule for July 1.
\
""What I think today we saw is lip service to the gas tax issue,"" Schiessl said. ""I think the issue is dead. I don't think we're gonna see any {additional} gas tax relief.""
\
Rebate Defense
\
While Democrats raised questions, House Republican leader Robert M. Ward of North Branford said the state should take advantage of the fast-growing budget surplus, which is now projected at nearly $350 million for the current fiscal year.
\
""Because the revenues grew faster than we anticipated, it makes sense to return it to taxpayers rather than spend it on new programs,"" Ward said. ""And I'm also pleased we're coupling it with further {income tax} rate reductions. So it isn't just a one-time rebate; it's a one-time rebate coupled with a rate reduction that is permanent.""
\

\
In their own words
\
Senate Majority Leader George C. Jepsen, D-Stamford
\
""There's a real problem with how he's paying for a lot of these new proposals. We do have the highest per-capita debt service in the nation.... The governor, himself, over the last three years has repeatedly spoken to the need to stick a lid on our debt -- and now he's basically taking the existing budget that has about $500 million in bonding, and he's increasing that by $350 million.... I would caution him, not so much on what he's proposing to spend but how he's proposing to pay for it. I think that you can do new bonding, or a rebate, but I would question the wisdom in doing both.""
\
Senate Minority Leader M. Adela Eads, R-Kent
\
""It's the first time in the years I've been here I can really agree when they get up and say Connecticut is economically sound. We have a surplus and this is what we are going to do with it... I don't think we are increasing spending that much. We are increasing it below the inflation level and we have got to (increase spending)... We're not bonding more than what we should. We're restraining ourselves, which the Republicans always have.
\
House Minority Leader Robert M. Ward, R-North Branford
\
""I'm thrilled with the speech and the proposal. His priorities are reducing taxes and targeting additional educational funds to programs that can best help the kids. I really can't think of a better plan. He is returning tax payer money.... Because the revenues grew faster than we anticipated, it makes sense to return it to taxpayers rather than spend it on new programs. And I'm also pleased we're coupling it with further rate reductions. So it isn't just a one-time rebate, it's a one-time rebate coupled with a rate reduction that is permanent.""
\
Deputy House Minority Leader Brian J. Flaherty, R-Watertown
\
""We tightened our belts when we had to, and because of that we have more money than we expected, and we are giving it back to the people who earned it, as they deserve it... It is not so much a matter of increasing spending as where you are putting it... These are focused investments, they are wise, they are aimed at children and other programs the government should be in the position of providing. We have the ability to cut taxes because the economy is good, and because, frankly, of good management, we can afford to do it, and we are also fattening our savings account for the rainy days that could be ahead.""
\
Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan, D-West Hartford:
\
""What's amazing in this is that there is so little tax relief in this budget -- less than $100 million....There has been a sense in Connecticut that people were going to see additional tax cuts. We promised that. We're gonna deliver that. This doesn't do it.""
\
Rep. William R. Dyson, D-New Haven, co-chairman, appropriations committee:
\
""I thought it was a reasonably good message. I didn't see whole lot that I had problems with, recognizng that we're going to take a look at all of it....I don't have a problem with the bottom line {because the state can afford it in a growing economy}. We just have to be responsible in what we do. We can't be overly optimistic about that {economic boom} continuing. There ought to be some caution we engage in.""
\
House Majority Leader Moira K. Lyons, D-Stamford
\
On whether Rowland's proposal for income-tax rebate checks in October is timed for the election: ""Oh, yes, of course ... If you look at when the rebate is going to be delivered to all of us ... what would you say?""
\
On the rebate proposal's chances of passage: ""As I stand here, not knowing all the particulars ... I suppose it's a 50-50 chance.... I never want to give anyone the impression that we {Demcorats} are not committed to tax reduction... It's a question of how you get the most back to the people and what's the best way to do it. ...I think our preference is still for property tax {reductions}.""
\
House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, D-Hartford
\
""I liked the beginning of the speech better than the end."" (Rowland begun the speech by praising Ritter, who is retiring this year after six years as House leader.)
\
On a more serious note, Ritter said he was concerned that Rowland had recommended a 5.2 percent spending increase -- well above the rate of inflation.
\
""My general attitude is when times are good you fix the system, and we're not fixing the system. He's diverting money that should be going to the rainy day fund. We should be filling up the rainy day fund, we should be paying down debt service. Those are the kinds of things you can afford to do when times are good.
\
""My guess is we'll modify his plans and come up with something in the middle and we'll do something good by the state of Connecticut and be out in May.""
\
Governor John G. Rowland
\
""The budget adjustments I present to you today are consistent with my fundamental philosophy of cutting taxes, reducing the size of government, eliminating unnecessary regulations, and investing in the people and institutions that hold the key to our future.""
\
""It's time the people of Connecticut got their money back. I want to return of this year's surplus to the people of Connecticut through tax rebates. It's their money, they earned it and they're entitled to it.""

\
At a glance The Governor's Tax Cuts
\
Gov. John G. Rowland has proposed $200 million in income tax cuts, of which this-year-only rebates would account for $125 million. The additional $75 million would be involve changes to the tax tables.
\
* Tax rebate checks of $100 for single filers and $200 for joint filers would be mailed to those who qualify around October 15 for this year only.
\
* Taxpayers must owe both state income tax and property taxes on a car or dwelling to be eligible for the rebates.
\
* For joint-filers, the first $18,000 of taxable income would be taxed at 3 percent. Currently, the first $15,000 of taxable income is taxed at 3 percent. Beyond those wage levels, the tax would be 4.5 percent.
\
* The state gas taxes would drop by four cents a gallon on April 1. The proposal would replace a scheduled 3-cent cut in the state's highest-in-the-nation gas tax that would take affect July 1.
\
* No cuts have been proposed for sales tax or corporate tax.
\

\
A Closer Look At The Issues
\
BUDGET:
\
Overall, $10.92 billion in the second year of the state's two-year budget adopted last year. The governor proposed spending an additional $395 million in the next fiscal year, a 3.5 percent increase over the estimated spending for the current fiscal year. He would increase spending for such things as public school education, programs for foster children, prisons and juvenile detention centers, nursing homes and upgrading the state's computers.
\
With an expected surplus of nearly $350 million, the governor's recommended spending package boosts funding in many more areas, while allowing him to propose tax cuts on the other side.
\
The prognosis: The budget that is presented at the beginning of a legislative session rarely resembles the one that comes out at the end. Expect Democrats, who control both chambers, to add some things, subtract others and change what's left of the Republican governor's plan.
\
The buzz: Everybody gets a finger in the pie.
\
TAXES:
\
The governor proposes to continue cutting taxes. His program includes a $200 million income tax cut, the centerpiece of which is a cash rebate program for qualifying taxpayers. Also included is a $75 million savings based on state income tax table changes. He also would increase an already approved 3-cent cut in the gasoline tax to 4 cents, and would move the effective date up several months, to April 1. No new changes proposed for overall corporate taxes or the sales tax. But a targeted tax break for private water companies.
\
The prognosis: Everyone likes a tax cut, but several Democratic leaders already oppose the rebate program. The gas tax proposal is up in the air. With a projected surplus that continues to grow -- now estimated by some at nearly $350 million -- everyone expects measurable tax reductions by the end of the legislative session in May.
\
The buzz: Taxes go down. Watch the quest for political credit.
\
ENVIRONMENT
\
Preserving open space and restoring state parks are central to the governor's environmental initiatives.
\
Rowland's budget calls for $166 million over the next five years for acquiring land for open space. In the fiscal year that starts July 1, Rowland would add $20 million to the capital budget, so that more than $32 million would be available for the state to buy and set aside undeveloped land.
\
As part of a previously announced 12-year plan for restoring state parks, Rowland's proposal also calls for $12 million in bond money for state park renovations, alterations and construction. He also proposed spending $1.5 million in operating money for such items as reopening eight state parks and forests and hiring 26 people to work in the parks.
\
Prognosis: Environmentalists are expected to fall in behind the governor's plan. Legislators are likely to look for ways to get a piece of the action. With mainly bond money at stake, and little from the general fund, this is an easy vote for legislators.
\
The buzz: Feel-good legislation with little downside.
\
EDUCATION
\
Rowland proposes to spend an additional $93 million this year -- and as much as $500 million over five years -- to hire hundreds of new teachers to reduce class size and provide more help for students who are poor readers; provide more grant money to local school districts for school construction or renovation; and expand summer school and after-school programs. Democrats are proposing a three-year $265 million plan with many of the same priorities.
\
The governor and legislative leaders also agree that the state must pay for more special education costs for children who are placed out of district by state agencies. The governor has proposed spending $15 million on this, but Democrats have said they want to do more. On higher education, the governor proposed to freeze tuition at all state colleges and universities and to increase scholarship aid.
\
The prognosis: The proposals have broad bipartisan support, and, if anything, Democrats in the legislature may increase funding in some key areas. Additionally, there may be growing support for increasing the education funds the state gives local school districts, especially as reports about growing disparities among school districts increase. The freeze and scholarship plans also enjoy broad support.
\
The buzz: In a political year, skirmishing over the proposals themselves as well as who gets credit for them.
\
CRIME, PUBLIC SAFETY
\
Proposals include strengthening Megan's Law, under which sex offenders must register with local police after release from prison. Rowland would extend the registration period from 10 years to life and add some less serious crimes to the list of offenses that require registration. Registration would be with state police rather than local police. Also proposed: Tougher sentences for repeat sex offenders and a study of possible civil commitments of sex offenders for treatment once they have completed their sentences.
\
In other areas, the governor would send more prisoners out of state to relieve overcrowding. In the past, that had been billed as a money-saver. Now, the governor seeks an additional $7.5 million to cover fees charged by out-of-state prisons and transportation costs. He would add 94 special deputy sheriffs at new courthouses and would add 38 new positions, for $3 million, to the Department of Public Safety. More money for prison employees and additional space as well as more prosecutors and judges for child protection and juvenile cases.
\
The prognosis: Changes to Megan's Law are likely, but civil commitments of sex offenders are not. Critics note that Rowland has had authority since 1995 to send inmates out of state, yet has not done so -- and don't look for it to happen this year on a large scale. Juvenile justice changes, following up on landmark 1995 reforms, are likely to be approved.
\
The buzz: Crime won't be a major issue at the legislature, but will be a drumbeat heard often on the campaign trail.
\
TRANSPORTATION
\
The governor would spend $130 million to improve and expand Bradley International Airport as a business development initiative. He proposed to move forward with plans to relieve congestion on I-95 in Fairfield County and vowed to complete Route 11 in eastern Connecticut and work toward building a new and safer Route 6.
\
The governor's office said the proposal for I-95 would not involve any new spending but would increase incentives for use of mass transit and encourage car-pooling and flex-time hours.
\
The prognosis: Expansion of Bradley has long been planned and is likely to go forward. Relieving highway congestion is a permanent goal of all governors, but actually getting people out of their cars has proved next to impossible. Similarly, improvements to Routes 11 and 6 are every-year issues, with action better measured in decades than in years.
\
The buzz: Improving roads and reducing highway congestion end up legislative roadkill. Expanding Bradley has a good chance of taking off.
\
ELECTRIC DEREGULATION
\
A key issue at the Capitol this year. Proposed legislation would open Connecticut's electricity markets to retail competition and reduce rates by at least 10 percent on July 1, 1999.
\
The governor and legislative leaders agree they want to take action this session, to prevent Connecticut from falling behind other New England states that have given customers a choice of electricity suppliers.
\
The latest version of the bill that emerged from the legislature's energy and technology committee this week appears to solve some of the most controversial problems that derailed the competition bill last session. The bill would allow 35 percent of all electricity customers a choice of suppliers on July 1, 1999, and open the entire state to competition a year later. The state's regulated utility companies -- Connecticut Light & Power Co. and United Illuminating Co. -- would be required to sell off their power plants to be eligible to recover expenses they could not pass on in a competitive marketplace.
\
The prognosis: Some form of electric deregulation appears likely to pass this session. Legislative leaders agree the latest version is an improvement over last year's, which died in the Senate without a vote. Changes are expected as the bill travels through a half-dozen committees. Plans now call for a House vote in mid-March.
\
The buzz: Not as exciting as tax cuts, and loaded with detail, but it affects everyone.
\
HEALTH
\
In a major initiative, Rowland would provide an $8 million bail-out for the two-year-old Connecticut Children's Medical Center in downtown Hartford. The 123-bed hospital opened in April 1996 and completed each of the last two fiscal years with a deficit of $16 million.
\
About half of the losses were blamed on start-up costs for the $90 million building and on some strategic and management blunders by hospital founders that have since been repaired. The hospital is also hurt by the fact that it is a free-standing children's hospital, not eligible for federal reimbursement through Medicare, the health insurance for the elderly.
\
Rowland's proposal also would keep open Blue Hills Hospital in Hartford, which had been targeted for closure for budgetary reasons.
\
The prognosis: Both hospitals are in House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter's hometown and are strongly supported by another powerful local lawmaker, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan, D-West Hartford. The legislature approved a bill last year exempting the children's hospital from paying taxes that all other general hospitals pay, and Hartford area lawmakers led protests against the planned closing of Blue Hills.
\
The buzz: Anyone for closing a hospital? How about voting against a kids' hospital?
\
TECHNOLOGY
\
The governor proposed an additional $120 million in state bond money to fix what is commonly known as the ""Year 2000"" problem: a computer date-reading problem that threatens to derail everything from welfare checks to drivers' licenses if not corrected. The state allocated $15 million to repair the problem last year, but a private consultant said last month the problem is more serious and complex than originally thought. Most computers read only the last two digits for dates, assuming a 19 before them. They will read 1900 when the year 2000 rolls around.
\
Another Rowland initiative, to privatize the state's computer system, has been delayed, probably until late in the year.
\
Rowland also would create a statewide ""211"" telephone line for non-emergency requests for government information, similar to the 911 system for emergencies and 411 for telephone information. President Clinton proposed a similar phone system in 1996 as a way to unclog the 911 system, which is now burdened by thousands of non-emergency calls.
\
The prognosis: The millennium glitch is costly, but failing to fix it would be disastrous. Look for quick approval of at least some bonding money to solve the problem. The privatization initiative is strongly opposed by state unions and Democrats and may be too hot to handle in an election year. The new telephone line could be a winner if costs can be controlled.
\
The buzz: The 2000 issue is an easy sell. Privatization won't come up this session.
\
FAMILIES
\
In addition to the initiatives on Connecticut Children's Medical Center and juvenile justice, Rowland would spend about $3 million to hire new assistant attorneys general to handle child-protection cases and add five new judges to hear cases involving abused and neglected children.
\
Rowland also would add 66 child-welfare case workers in the Department of Children and Families, work to speed up the process of terminating parental rights from 18 months to 12 months and improve screening programs for newborn infants. And he again touted his HUSKY plan to offer free or affordable insurance to as many as 90,000 children who are now uninsured. The state would spend $34.5 million on the program in the fiscal year that starts July 1.
\
The prognosis: These proposals face smooth sailing. The HUSKY plan -- Healthcare for Uninsured Kids and Youth -- has already been approved.
\
The buzz: Politicians love to say it: Kids are the future. And their parents vote.

HARTFORD -- A bill to put tolls on Route 11 to pay for completion of the long-stalled Southeastern Connecticut highway failed to win passage in 2011, but advocates are pressing for a different outcome this year.
\
""This is a very sensible piece of legislation and I hope that you will pass it,"" former Salem First Selectman Peter Sielman told the legislature's transportation committee at a hearing Monday.
\
Sielman and other supporters said finishing Route 11 would save motorists time and make travel safer. In addition, Sen. Andrea Stillman said, the highway could provide an efficient evacuation route in case of an emergency at the nearby Millstone Power Station in Waterford.
\
Toll money would pay for the state's 20 percent share of the estimated $1 billion construction project, which calls for completion of the road and construction of two interchanges connecting the highway with interstates 95 and 395.
\
Critics say Route 11 is an expensive boondoggle that would harm the environment.
\
""I am wondering why we are discussing a proposal to put tolls on what I would call a phantom road,"" said Molly McKay of Mystic, the transportation chair of the Connecticut Sierra Club. ""For Connecticut to even be considering an investment of more than a billion dollars for an 8-mile highway that entails building a triple-decker interchange to connect with two interstates ... I consider this fiscal insanity.""
\
McKay and other opponents said the state should be investing in mass transit, not more efficient ways to move more cars.
\
""We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said. ""To build a new road where the incentive is to have as much traffic as possible to pay for it, that's not good transportation planning.""
\
Tolls have long been the third rail of Connecticut transportation politics. They were abolished after a fiery crash at a Stratford toll plaza killed seven people in 1983.
\
But the state's reliance federal aide and the gas tax has caused some to take another look at tolls as an alternative way to raise money for road and bridge repair.
\
""Obviously I've been a proponent of tolls,"" said Antonio Guerrera, D-Rocky Hill, the co-chair of the transportation committee. ""We cannot rely on our federal government for our moneys; they don't have it.""
\
The bill under consideration stipulates that tolls would be limited to Route 11, and that once all the bonds issued to fund the completion of the road have been retired, the tolls would be discontinued. It also specifies that electronic tolls be used, not the toss-a-coin-in-a-bucket system that was in use at the time of the Stratford crash.

With expenses rising and gas tax revenue stagnant, the state may have to postpone more of its big-ticket transit initiatives, said the co-chairman of the General Assembly's transportation committee.
\
Among the projects that need a second look: the New Britain busway, Sen. Donald DeFronzo, D-New Britain, said.
\
""A number of projects have to come in for additional scrutiny,"" DeFronzo said in an interview.
\
DeFronzo might have even more influence over those projects after Dan Malloy is sworn in as governor next month. At the Capitol, DeFronzo is widely rumored to be on Malloy's short list of potential appointees to run the Department of Transportation.
\
Recent estimates by the Office of Fiscal Analysis show the Special Transportation Fund, which pays for most of Connecticut's big-ticket highway and transit initiatives, will slip into deficit in the next fiscal year.
\
""That's three to four years ahead of what we expected to be the case. We won't have the money to fund everything, so we'll have to prioritize,"" DeFronzo said.
\
Last year, then-Transportation Commissioner Joseph Marie offered a similar analysis, and put forward a series of potential reductions to Connecticut's long-term list of major transportation projects. The fiscal outlook has worsened since then, and the transportation fund shortfall is projected to total $140 million between mid-2011 and mid-2014. That means the state must consider more reductions, DeFronzo said.
\
Marie never suggested the busway as a potential cut, and his successor, Commissioner Jeff Parker, has supported the project. New Britain Mayor Timothy Stewart consistently calls it a component of his downtown revitalization plan, and most members of New Britain's legislative delegation have supported it, too.
\
But DeFronzo, along with several Bristol-area lawmakers and Rep. David McCluskey, D-West Hartford, has said the 9.6-mile bus-only highway is too expensive to build.
\
The DOT estimates the project will cost $567 million, with federal funds covering 80 percent. The state had hoped federal transportation officials would formally commit to their share of the costs this year, but that didn't happen. The DOT is now looking for that commitment before March, when it plans to begin seeking construction bids.
\
""We're in a favorable bidding environment now, and we want to get out to bid,"" said Mike Sanders, manager of the busway initiative.
\
The project already has some state funding committed, but would need another $22 million in state bonding, according to the DOT.
\
Connecticut has already spent $60 million on the busway, including about $48 million in federal funds. Marie warned last year that the state might have to repay the federal money if it scraps the busway.
\
The DOT projects that 15,000 people a day will use the busway, alleviating some of the rush-hour congestion on I-84 in West Hartford and Hartford. After this year's delays, the DOT's new timetable is to begin construction next year and start daily service in August of 2014.

Mileage Tax Worth Look
\
The Aug. 11 editorial trashing a proposal by state agencies in Connecticut and other states to study the concept of replacing the gas tax with a mileage tax as a means of funding transportation infrastructure both hit and missed the mark [""Mileage Tax Study A Waste""].
\
As the editorial pointed out, there are very real implementation hurdles that would have to be overcome before a switch from a fuel-consumption to road-use model of funding transportation spending could be implemented. Privacy and cost of implementation hurdles in particular would have to be resolved before such a plan could move forward.
\
However, in stating that ""the gas tax is a mileage tax. The more residents drive, the more gas they use, the more gas tax they pay,"" the editorial really missed the mark. The reality is that gas tax revenues per mile driven are dropping. As cars and trucks become more efficient, and switch to other fuels such as electricity, this trend will accelerate and exacerbate the problem of underfunded transportation infrastructure.
\
Refusing to even consider possible alternatives to the gas tax is a shortsighted, penny-wise and pound-foolish approach that can only hurt Connecticut's drivers and economy in the long run.

Poor Disabled Access
\
To Hartford Courthouse
\
A recent trip to the Hartford Superior Court-Civil, at 95 Washington St. in Hartford, painfully taught me how the state of Connecticut pays lip service only to disabled access.
\
I need a walker to get around. The courthouse has a single handicapped parking space that is 60 yards from the main entrance of the building, which is not handicapped accessible. There is a ramped handicapped accessible door that is about 70 yards from the parking space. Yet once in the building, it is another 35 yards to the security check-in.
\
There are two other handicapped parking spots; one is kitty-corner to the ramped handicap entrance, about a half-block away. The other parking space is on the same side of the building as the ramped handicapped entrance, about 80 yards from the handicapped entrance. That is it, three spaces I could find. Definitely not very accommodating for public handicapped access.
\
There certainly is plenty of easily accessible parking adjacent to the building (many spaces were empty); restricted for employees, none for disabled members of the public.

Cheers Amazing Olympics Women
\
I have always been amazed at female athletes. The primary windows that I've seen them through are the Olympics, which don't happen that often. And the older I get, the more I focus on the women athletes instead of the men. It's like a slow-motion discovery that was intensified when the U.S. women won the FIFA World Cup a few years ago, and Florida won the NCAA softball championship in 2015. Those women were amazing!
\
It was only four years ago when I, alone in my man cave, practically burst into tears watching the closing ceremonies: the end of 16 days that I didn't want to end; a showcase of stunning physical perfection. Then oblivion set in. I started to forget what I had seen. And now, four years later, after having watched only a few events, I am starting to remember what's going to happen in Rio over the next two weeks and the pathetic shape I'll be in during the closing ceremonies. The Summer Olympics are one in the plethora of gifts that make life worth living.
\
Yes, I will be mostly focusing on the women: on beach volleyball, and swimming, and gymnastics, and soccer, and track and field. But it's all good.

Sullying Swimmer's Medal
\
American swimmer Lily King deprived Russia's Yulia Efimova of more than the gold medal in the women's 100-meter breaststroke - she took the swimmer's precious accomplishment and sullied it.
\
Ms. King, apparently infuriated by a finger wave made by Ms. Efimova after winning the semifinal heat for the event, decided to take her condemnation of illegal performance drugs and Ms. Efimova's previous use of them to the national stage. Ms. Efimova had been punished for using these kind of substances with an 18-month suspension.
\
The Olympic committee allowed the Russian woman to participate in the event and it was not up to Ms. King to vilify her participation and success. The fact is, Ms. Efimova won the silver medal for the women's 100-meter breaststroke and drugs were not a part of it.

Jazzed For Mondays In Hartford
\
There's a lot wrong with Hartford these days, but Monday Night Jazz in Bushnell Park hits all the right notes. Last week, on a stunning summer evening, what seemed like a perfect cross-section of the Greater Hartford community brought lawn chairs, picnic blankets and dogs to the park for live jazz (from a local prodigy, no less) and an ideal way to kick off the workweek.
\
Here's to the coordinators and volunteers behind this great, free public event - a weekly reminder that it's not all doom and gloom in our capital city.

"
91,"
Some 50 years ago, Connecticut built highway bridges with a 50-year life span. At about the same time, the state and New York took over commuter rail service that ran on the bones of a century-old railroad.
\
So perhaps it is not surprising that the state faces $3 billion in transportation infrastructure improvement projects.
\
Unfortunately, the state doesn't have the $3 billion.
\
If transportation funding isn't another fiscal cliff, it's at least a steep hill. At both the state and federal levels, the cost of transportation is outstripping the funding mechanisms created to pay for it.
\
FORGET FEDERAL FUNDS
\
The federal Highway Trust Fund has been essentially bankrupt since 2008. It brings in about $90 billion a year, but the federal government spends about $140 billion on roads, bridges, airports and transit, so the general budget has to make up the difference. This adds to the country's deficit and, things being as they are in Washington, is not likely to continue.
\
The federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon isn't bringing in enough money to pay the bills, but Congress has not had the will to raise the tax, even to adjust it for inflation, since 1993. That and other funding ideas are being talked about, though action is not seen as imminent.
\
This year Congress passed a two-year transportation funding bill, which kept funding stable but did not address the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. If there is a cut in federal funding after 2014, the effect on Connecticut, which historically has relied heavily on federal transportation funding, could be devastating.
\
The state's situation bears similarities to Washington's. State officials created the Special Transportation Fund in 1984, primarily supported by a gas tax. It was supposed to be in a lock box, but someone at the General Assembly got hold of the key. The fund has been tapped over the years to balance the general budget.
\
Also, the state lowered the gas tax from 39 to 25 cents beginning in the late 1990s. The state would have the needed $3 billion if the tax had been left at 39 cents and the fund left alone. The combination of less driving and more fuel-efficient cars is now lowering the take from the gas tax.
\
The long and short is that the state has some key projects it must do -- upgrade the New Haven rail line, replace the I-84 viaducts in Hartford and Waterbury, among others -- and for which it does not have the money.
\
So, the state is going to have to raise more of its own money for transportation. It won't be easy.
\
TRY A BETTER PITCH
\
There was some talk about tolls at a recent forum at the state Capitol sponsored by Transit for Connecticut, a coalition of 30 groups coordinated by the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. Tolls are a direct user fee, a fair way to pay for roads and bridges. But under an antiquated federal law, states that have abandoned their highway tolls, such as Connecticut, generally cannot bring them back on interstate highways.
\
Connecticut can toll intrastate highways, new bridges (we blew the chance to toll the new Q bridge in New Haven) and new lanes in some cases, but not interstates. It would take a change in federal law.
\
The gas tax is also a user fee but, as at the federal level, raising it is politically difficult. Gov. Malloy proposed a 3 cent increase last year, and it went nowhere.
\
What's needed is marketing. Most people aren't stupid; they understand that transportation is essential to the state's economy and quality of life, that it costs money and that the money doesn't come from the tooth fairy. But they need to know what they are paying for.
\
Voters around the country approved more than three-quarters of transit referendums in the past five years, even if it has meant taxing themselves.
\
The takeaway: Voters might not approve $100 million for ""infrastructure,"" but they might go for a ""one-hour ride to New York.""

Give The Irish Reparations, Too
\
I fully agree that some restitution should be made for the indignities suffered in slavery. This would be truly the American way [letter, June 17, ""Approve Reparations For Slavery""].
\
It should be very easy to administer. All that would be needed would be the birth certificate of the slave and a letter from the slave owner stating that he did indeed own said slave from the date of his birth to the end of the Civil War.
\
As to recompense, perhaps it should be 25 cents a day, which could have been the pay of a farm laborer 125 years ago.
\
Once former slaves had been compensated, then all the Irish who were discriminated against from 1860 to 1900 could also seek reparations. All that would be needed would be a letter from the employer who posted the sign ""Irish need not apply.""
\
Once the past injustices were taken care of, we could all live happily ever after.

Bush And Gore: More Of The Same
\
Why should I continue to subscribe to a newspaper that prints George F. Will and Laurence D. Cohen, both of whom I strongly dislike?
\
They represent the fraudulent Republican agenda. Republicans have consistently favored regressive economic policy, concentrated media, shredded social programs, deteriorating infrastructure (not including stadiums), covert agencies, the permanent war economy and the indefensible Star Wars program.
\
The results are clear: people with record debt, environmental decay, record prison populations. Democrats are not much different.
\
Ralph Nader is the only candidate to oppose Star Wars, champion universal health care and strongly support consumers' interests.
\
The only meaningful difference between George W. Bush and Al Gore is over abortion. Otherwise, they differ only in how fast and fully they will accede to the corporate contract on America. Nader means change; Gore and Bush mean more of the same.

Her participation in safe shooting sports represents the vast majority of young shooters today and is an outstanding example of how guns can be used in a positive manner.

Gore's Policies Reduce Energy Supplies
\
Vice President Gore claims that one of the major purposes of his proposed environmental trust fund is to lower energy prices [Page 1, June 28, ""Gore Outlines Energy Policy; But Presidential Race Still Lacks A Catalyst""].
\
Throughout his political career, Mr. Gore has favored policies that reduce energy supplies and raise prices.
\
In fact, current high gasoline prices are largely the result of actions taken by the Clinton-Gore administration. These include numerous Environmental Protection Agency regulations, closing federal lands to oil exploration and a 4.3-cents-per-gallon gas-tax increase.
\
The real goal, as explained in his book, ""Earth in the Balance"" (published in 1992 and republished this year), is to make saving the environment the central organizing principle of civilization. Mr. Gore says this will require everyone to make sacrifices, including using much less energy.
\
What's new about the vice president's latest plan is that he's proposing to buy the support of American industry, labor unions and other special interests with tens of billions of taxpayer dollars.

93,"
President-elect George W. Bush nominated two politically polarizing figures to his new administration Friday: Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri as attorney general and New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to be director of the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
Both are well qualified for their positions. On balance, Mr. Bush's choices for top jobs so far have been within the mainstream.
\
Earlier in the week, Mr. Bush filled the top housing, commerce, agriculture and treasury posts with low-profile, noncontroversial nominees. Paul H. O'Neill, the chairman of aluminum-maker Alcoa who was designated to be treasury secretary, was faulted by some conservatives for supporting an increase in the federal gas tax. But the grumbling was minor. Mr. O'Neill is a known quantity on Wall Street, has extensive experience in government service and is firmly committed to Mr. Bush's plans for an across-the-board tax cut.
\
Even so, Mr. Bush has been under increasing fire from his party's most conservative factions for assembling an administration that the right believes is too middle of the road.
\
The designation of Ms. Whitman to lead the EPA, rumored for several days before her formal appointment, stirred up the most resentment. Her reputation as a moderate and an outspoken advocate of abortion rights cost her any chance to be on the Republican national ticket this year. But abortion won't be an issue in her new job.
\
Ms. Whitman has a mixed record on the environment in New Jersey. She cut the budget for environmental enforcement by state agencies, which is worrisome if those agencies are hampered in doing their job adequately. But she has also been a strong supporter of open-space acquisition and of emissions testing to reduce air pollution.
\
Mr. Bush, who had a poor environmental record as governor of Texas, can't afford to appoint an EPA chief who will take a hatchet to environmental laws.
\
In her new job, Ms. Whitman can be judged by how well she lives up to her own beliefs, expressed in this quote: ""We know that open land is at a premium and we must preserve it. We know that clean air is invaluable and we must safeguard it. We know that clean water is priceless and we must do all we can to protect our watersheds.""
\
It is probably no accident that Mr. Bush announced Mr. Ashcroft's nomination before officially naming Ms. Whitman.
\
Mr. Ashcroft, defeated for re-election, was at the top of conservatives' list of attorney general hopefuls. The son and grandson of Assembly of God ministers, he comes with the reputation for being one of the most ardently conservative senators, especially in his opposition to abortion rights.
\
Ideology aside, the Yale- and Chicago law school-educated Mr. Ashcroft, who is a former attorney general of Missouri, will be charged to enforce the law equally, as he promised to do. Mr. Bush added Friday that ""there is no question that he will enforce the civil rights laws of America.""
\
Little more can be asked of an attorney general, liberal or conservative.
\
With only a few more key posts to fill, Mr. Bush is assembling a Cabinet that is diverse and that reflects his desire to govern from the center.

Q & A
\
Courant Editorial Page Editor John J. Zakarian interviewed Gov. John G. Rowland Thursday in the governor's office. Here are excerpts from the interview.
\
You've been in public office for nearly 14 years as a state legislator, a member of Congress and governor. How have you changed over the years? How would you describe your philosophical leaning today?
\
I don't think philosophically I have changed much -- although I definitely have more gray hair.
\
The fun part has been shifting from the legislative side. It's the best change I ever made. Having served in the legislature and then down in Washington, I always think of this as a merry-go-round; you jump on every once in a while and you jump off every once in a while. Sometimes it spins out of control, sometimes it works well. So for me, the dramatic change or shift that took place was going from being one of 435 members of the House participating at some level, some degree, in many cases at the committee level, and then shifting to the executive branch. This is far better public service.
\
You can set the agenda, you can set the tone, you can have a greater impact. Pete du Pont, governor of Delaware, said you can do more in a weekend as a governor than you can in a term as a legislator. I listened to Nancy Johnson talking about getting an amendment passed after eight years.
\
So my past two years have been exciting. The first year was very difficult going through the transition of getting people hired. In literally 60 days you've got to get your commissioners, your people in place, get your agenda set, get your priorities set and do a two-year budget -- all at the same time. It's brutal.
\
The second year has been a lot easier because people have gotten into the swing of things, we've got our timing down a little bit.
\
It has been said there is no such thing as permanent enemy or permanent friend in politics. Do you agree?
\
I think in politics there are some natural enemies and natural friends or natural allies. The old line in Washington is, ""If you want a friend, buy a dog."" In my case, the natural allies have been the business community, the natural enemies have been the unions. That has been going on for 14 years. But those alliances are more a function of the parties, a function of the philosophy and a function of where people feel comfortable in terms of where they want to wind up.
\
What do you consider the three standout accomplishments of your first two years?
\
I'd say welfare reform, changing the tone of state government to be more positive, to be more business friendly, to stake out the private-public partnership and to set the tone of bipartisanship.
\
For example, in the past two years every Wednesday during the legislative session we met with all the leadership in the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat, to get everybody on the same page. Because of that relationship, we were able to reform the welfare system.
\
I think the tax cuts and just changing the debate are notable accomplishments. I think it's a good debate -- whether we're going to cut property taxes or the gas tax or corporate tax or the income tax. I even heard that Senate Democrats want to cut the corporate tax at a faster rate than we do, which I thought was pretty interesting.
\
Looking ahead at the next two years, what should people expect from your administration?
\
Hopefully, more of the same: to continue to try drive the budget, keep it down, to empower people. I think if I use one phrase or philosophy or one word that kind of drives us, it would be empowerment. We are trying to empower welfare recipients, business people and state employees. What I'm going to try to do in the next couple of years are some pretty big things, such as getting government out of the business of information technology. We will try to do some enterprising things in health care. We spend about $4 billion a year in health care when you combine all client services, state employees and retirees. We could save an incredible amount of money, or maybe we can even insure the uninsured if we use our buying power in managed care.
\
You left out Sheff vs. O'Neill.
\
Sheff vs. O'Neill is going to be probably the biggest issue in the legislature this year. It's not going to be nearly as confrontational as a lot of people thought it would be. The Educational Improvement Panel did a great job because it hashed out some of the debate already. It made 15 recommendations that we can pretty much all agree upon. The question is whether we can fit it all into one session or two sessions.
\
What I tried to do in my budget message today with some of our modest proposals is to begin resolving the Sheff vs. O'Neill situation. I think it is important to point out that one legislative package is not going to resolve all the problems. It was interesting to listen to the debate of the panelbecause what really came out at the end of the day is that as you battle to do something about racial isolation, you still find the debate going to poverty. And you still find the debate going back to large cities. So a lot of those sidebar issues are going to be with us a long time.
\
By the end of your first term, do you expect that schools in Connecticut will be substantially desegregated?
\
It is interesting because in listening to the parents and the people of Hartford, they are saying they don't want to go to suburban schools. They want their schools to be better. It is interesting because it is a double-edged sword: As we try to get rid of racial isolation, how do we encourage people to go out into the other communities? One of the proposals that I have in my budget is to expand Project Concern. There there are two ways to expand it. One is to give an incentive to the communities because if they are not going to make room in their schools, you can't force them. But you can give them incentives. We are going to give more money to the receiving towns. We want to expand Project Concern to include New Haven and Bridgeport.
\
But as I understand the Supreme Court decision, it isn't enough that schools have to improve. They must also desegregate because that is the best possible environment for a good education. So if the schools in Hartford improve tremendously but remain segregated, would they still meet the Supreme Court test?
\
I don't know what meets the Supreme Court test. You don't know whether what you have done is adequate enough until you go back to the court. The two possible solutions would be total outright forced busing or total outright choice.
\
I'd make the argument that if you had pure choice and allowed anybody to go to any school they wanted to, how could you then argue that the state is the cause of racial isolation? So, absent those two solutions, which are not going to be in the legislative proposals, you are going to have some school choice, a lot of interdistrict work, minority teacher programs, Project Concern, more magnet schools, more charter school. It is going to take a long time before some of the isolation numbers to begin to change. It is not going to happen after one or two years.
\
Would you favor legislation that would allow the state to take over failing school districts?
\
I don't think our bureaucrats are any better than city bureaucrats. What I mean by that is Ted Sergi {state education commissioner} spent a lot of time working with Hartford to find out what some of their problems are. If we took over the Hartford school system tomorrow, the problems would still be there. I think what you need to do is give them more flexibility. One superintendent recently talked about getting rid of some of the state mandates and allowing more flexibility. I still think if you work harder at engaging more parents, more business leaders, more family members and so forth, that will probably have a more positive impact than having the state bureaucrats take over a school system.
\
You have said, as others have, that budgets should not be balanced with smoke and mirrors. But minutes after your budget address, there's already talk that your fiscal plan contains smoke and mirrors. Does it?
\
No. We worked very hard and close to three months on every line and detail. Rather than taking the budget of the previous year and automatically adding on 5, 6 or 7 percent -- the traditional approach -- we tried to scrutinize and scrub every program in detail. The hard part in doing that is that you have a lot of restrictions from union contracts. These contracts make it very difficult to shift things and move priorities. If we close a hospital, for example, we will still have to have the same number of employees at that hospital even though it is closed. Local 1199, in particular, has done a spectacular job of writing the rules so they can never be impacted adversely.
\
So we have tried to do it in a very thoughtful way. I know that the Democratic spin machine today was ""smoke and mirrors."" But let's sit down and work together.
\
Two years ago we did the same thing. We proposed a budget and worked with the legislature on it and we stuck close to the bottom line. It is going to be tougher to stick to the bottom line two years later. It is easy to do it once, it is harder to do it the second time.
\
Especially with the Senate now in Democratic hands.
\
I think it is good the Senate is Democratic. It makes them responsible, it makes them part of the process. They have to be part of the solution.
\
Democrats are saying that your early retirement proposal has been tried by the city of Hartford and by the state, without success. How would it be different this time?
\
The state did this during the O'Neill administration, but they screwed it up. You have to use your head. You have to do it the way The Courant did it. When you have an early retirement plan, you flavor the pot so that people will buy into it. But then what you also do is you make sure you don't hire, which is what happened during O'Neill's administration -- they hired half the ""retired"" people back as consultants.
\
Because they needed them?
\
It was all political. They hired half the people back as consultants and, in addition, brought in new employees to backfill some of those positions.
\
The key with the early retirement plan is not to hire back one for one, but we've even talked about one to four or one to five.
\
Let's look at the state police, for example. Most of the higher level personnel are inside pushing paper. So if those guys retire, we are not going to be suffering from any paper pushers leaving. With new technology, you don't need as many state employees. Nobody does. UTC doesn't need them, The Hartford Courant doesn't need them and neither does state government.
\
Unlike some companies, you have to deal with unions. My understanding is that an early retirement plan has to be negotiated.
\
We've got some agreements that have been reached. We can make the offer, we can go with the early retirement plan. The first process is to go through the state employees. But we can do it through the legislature. The legislature can do that tomorrow morning.
\
Contravening a contract?
\
The legislature can do that because I don't think the contracts speak to early retirement. Rank-and-file employees would also want to do it.
\
Could the Democratic control of the legislature be a blessing in disguise for you, by giving you an opportunity to blame the other party for failing to eliminate the income tax in five years?
\
I've heard that suggested by people of the other political party. I'm not interested in any blaming. I plan to be here for a few more years, and we put together a good, thoughtful budget that legislators can work on. No one wins the blame game. Look at what is happening in Washington. I never want to see this place adopt Washington's ways.
\
Clinton won the election by blaming the other party, wouldn't you say?
\
Clinton won the election by the process of elimination. I didn't see anybody doing any somersaults at the polls in this last election. I'm not sure, but I don't think he won on blaming the Republicans. Their wounds were pretty much self-inflicted.
\
I have heard it said that you and President Clinton have something in common. For example, both of you have moved to the center, he from the left and you from the right. Do you agree?
\
I'm not sure where he even started. He was the head of the Democratic Leadership Council, so he was supposed to be a moderate-Democrat southern governor. I'm not sure where things went wrong for him. I think his first few months in office were a disaster. He was all over the place trying to appease various special interest groups.
\
I don't think I've tried to move to the center. I've not purposely tried to be philosophically in the middle, to the right or to the left. Frankly, we don't have a lot of time to figure that out, even if we wanted to. You guys give me more credit than I deserve sometimes on all of that.
\
We take each issue as it comes. All of us as politicians are part of our environment. Growing up in the city, I recognize that we have to do something about our cities and if people think that is left of center, then that's fine. But I think if you look at some of the issues we worked on this year -- tax cuts, welfare reform and more policing, changing the way we do things in the Department of Correction, trying to use the private sector as often as possible, trying to get the state employees union to concede a little bit -- I wouldn't say they are either liberal or conservative. They're pragmatic.
\
Is there any doubt in your mind that you will be seeking re-election in 1998?
\
I'm sure as heck not going to announce it today. I'm going to try to do a good job for the next two years and work on this budget and we'll see what happens in a year or so.
\
If you were to run, do you expect the campaign would cost you $4 million plus?
\
That would probably be a reasonable guess.
\
Have you started raising money?
\
We have.
\
But you still have not decided whether you want to run.
\
I have not announced yet.
\
Where do you stand on campaign finance reform?
\
I'm not opposed to a campaign finance reform bill, and I know that there are probably two or three bills that have been out there. I've talked to Jeffrey Garfield {executive director of the State Elections Enforcement Commission} about some of their ideas and I've told them privately about some of the things that I think are good and some of the things that won't work.
\
It sounds like on this issue you would rather react than take a leadership position.
\
I think between getting the economy turned around, working the welfare reform issue and working the budget issue, we are busy enough.
\
I've seen stories in the last two weeks about state Senate campaigns costing $200,000. Does that concern you?
\
Absolutely. I hope the Connencticut legislature passes campaign finance reform this year. As a matter of fact, the best thing the Congress should do is start to adopt some of the rules we have here in Connecticut. We've got some of the toughest rules in the entire country.
\
Who in your party will be the toughest challenger for Sen. Chris Dodd next year?
\
I think Chris Burnham will be tough. I think Nancy Johnson would take a run. Chris Shays would be another natural. Both he and Nancy seem pretty happy with what they are doing, though. I suspect Gary Franks will take a run. I would look at Franks and Burnham as the two potentials. As a matter of fact, I think Franks had some money left over from his congressional race.
\
Will Dodd be tough to beat?
\
Chris is smart. He never takes any race for granted. He's a very good campaigner, he's a great speaker. I think the Democratic National Committee campaign finance controversy has tarnished him a bit.
\
About a month ago, you talked about studying the feasibility of building a hockey arena in Hartford for the Whalers. We have not heard anything more since then about this and also about a football stadium for UConn. Can you tell us where you are?
\
We've got a couple things in the works. You might as well put the Patriots in there, too, although I don't give that a lot of credence. We are looking at the possibility of combining a UConn facility, which will be basketball and/or football, and whether that would work with the Whalers facility as well.
\
Secondly, we're trying to determine if an arena works on a stand-alone basis for the Whalers. If you did 17,000 seats, what would it cost? How would we arrange to pay off the bonds? Is there another $15 million in the community to support the hockey program?
\
You mean from private sources?
\
From corporations and ticket holders. The Whalers are projecting they would need about 80 skyboxes at $100,000 a pop. You need that private commitment every year for 20 years. You then also have to have a commitment from the Whalers that they are going to stay for 20 years. Then the follow-up question is, what do you do with the existing Civic Center? How do you convert that to a convention center?
\
We've got architects, financial people, investment bankers and everybody from the Indians to Bob Kraft {Patriots owner} and others working on this.
\
Do you have a timetable?
\
I would say in the next two to three weeks we should be in pretty good shape in terms of having all the marketing information done.
\
Is this a long shot?
\
I'd say it's 50-50.
\
Connecticut's income tax burden is about average nationally compared with other states. Connecticut's property taxes are among the top two or three highest in the country. Yet you seem to focus on cutting the income tax rather than the property tax. Why?
\
I focus on the taxes that the state imposes.
\
We don't impose the federal tax and I don't have any way of affecting that. We don't impose the property tax. I've yet to see a property tax cut proposal laid on the table. Even the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities' plan was not a property tax reduction, although it was played as that. It was an income tax reduction with a whole spectrum of things you had to do to get a break.
\
If the legislators are serious about helping the cities and towns to cut their taxes, they should support us in getting rid of binding arbitration. They should support us in getting rid of some of the mandated programs.
\
We drive up a lot of their costs. We are spending $2 billion on cities and towns this fiscal year. But it doesn't result in any local tax reduction. Every time the state just gives more money to municipalities, it does not result in property tax cuts.
\
You seem not to be very generous with the University of Connecticut -- 12.5 percent cuts in the first year. What is the rationale for that?
\
Everybody is taking a cut. No one has been spared. As a matter of fact, I think in the second year of the biennial budget UConn actually gets an increase. It comes out to about a 2 percent increase in the second year.
\
We are trying to get the universities and community colleges to refocus and re-engineer. I suspect that some of these things will be negotiated and worked on, but we've got to get UConn to start to raise some of its own funds. It just started doing that.
\
We've also made a huge investment to the endowment and we're also contributing $112 million this year alone in bonding. So we are making a huge capital investment, $1 billion over 10 years. On the operating side, they have to tighten up. They have to see where they can save some money just like everybody else.
\
What is non-negotiable in your budget?
\
The bottom line.
\
But everything else is negotiable.
\
Absolutely. This is a partnership.
\
Including taxes?
\
No, no, that's not negotiable. Well, we'll see how negotiable that is. If they have something that really cuts property taxes I'd like to see it.
\
House Speaker Tom Ritter may have a quid pro quo: You want an income tax, you'd better deliver on some sort of a property tax. Have you talked with him regularly?
\
Hey, we're buds.
\
Is it your sense that he will run against you?
\
No. I don't think he's even going to run again for the House. No, I don't think he'll run for governor. I don't think he has got the fire in the belly. I think he always wanted to get three terms in and he's done what he has always wanted to do.

HARTFORD -- Gov. Dannel P. Malloy announced plans Monday to create a new interagency work group to address the state's transit-oriented development needs.
\
Malloy, speaking at a transportation funding forum organized by Transit for Connecticut, a program of New Haven-based Connecticut Fund for the Environment, said the panel will ""make sure that a constant and ongoing conversation takes place"" regarding spin-off development from major transportation projects.
\
""Addressing Connecticut's transportation challenges is key to growing our economy,"" Malloy said. While the state has made progress over the past two years, ""much more needs to be done.""
\
He said he has asked Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Catherine Smith to have the department serve as the lead agency for the new panel.
\
""We have to understand, on a short-term and long-term basis, Connecticut competes with the other 49 states,"" Malloy said.
\
But so far, ""they've been better at it than we have,"" he said.
\
""We've got to get this thing going, and this has got to be a joint effort between the builders and the payers, and the users, and it all comes together,"" Malloy said.
\
The forum featured a keynote address by Jack Basso, the outgoing director of program finance and management for the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. It also featured a speech by state Commissioner of Transportation Jim Redeker and a panel discussion.
\
It focused largely on ways to accomplish necessary investment in transportation infrastructure in the face of what is expected to be a shrinking pool of state and federal dollars in the years to come.
\
""It is no secret that transportation funding in the current economic climate is scarce both in Connecticut and federally,"" said Karen Burnaska, Transit for Connecticut's coordinator.
\
The federal gas tax hasn't been raised in 20 years, Basso said, suggesting that as one way to address future needs and generate an additional $1.7 billion annually. Raising oil import fees could generate $3.5 billion a year, he said.
\
""We have an opportunity to do for the American people what Eisenhower and Roosevelt did,"" by finding new ways to fund transportation investment, he said.
\
But in order to do so, ""we must be able to make a case to the people who pay the bills,"" Basso said.
\
The panel discussion featured Redeker; onetime state DOT Commissioner Emil Frankel, now director of transportation policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington; Oz Griebel of the MetroHartford Alliance, who previously was chairman of the state's Transportation Strategy Board, and Joe McGee of the Business Council of Fairfield County.
\
Frankel said Connecticut ""finally is going to have to get over this now-over-30-year aversion to thinking about ... more direct user fees. It's the only way we're going to move forward with major projects.""
\
Frankel -- a resident of the District of Columbia -- said """"there are a lot of misconceptions"" about the gas tax and ""it's remarkable how low"" Connecticut's gas tax is compared to other charges.
\
Connecticut's gas tax is the second highest in the nation -- 48.6 cents per gallon, tied with California and second to New York's 49 cents per gallon, according to the Tax Foundation.
\
""Our transportation tax dollars are an investment,"" McGee said.

Top Issues
\
The Economy: Our economy faces significant challenges not seen since the Great Depression and I am angry that for the last eight years an 'anything goes' policy has jeopardized middle-class homeowners, retirement plans, and college savings.
\
I voted against the recent Wall Street bailout twice because it fails to address the underlying causes of the economic crisis - falling home prices caused by record foreclosures.
\
The best economic recovery plan is one that creates good paying jobs. I secured nearly $700 million to increase submarine production at Electric Boat, which helped to create hundreds of new jobs and prevented thousands more employees from being laid off.
\
I voted for two economic stimulus packages to energize the national economy and make overdue investments in America's failing infrastructure, which will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
\
Finally, health care costs are strangling small business. That is why I joined a bipartisan effort in Congress to introduce the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Act, endorsed by labor and business organizations. The bill creates purchasing pools for small businesses and the self-employed, makes health insurance rating reforms; and offers tax credits to make healthcare more affordable for owners and employees.
\
Energy: We need short-term price relief for consumers and long-term solutions to our energy challenges.
\
In September, I voted for comprehensive energy reform that increases domestic oil exploration and production and voted for historic increases in funding for alternative energy, which will be the backbone of our future energy supply.
\
I joined my colleagues to increase fuel efficiency standards to an average 35 MPG for the first time in more than 30 years.
\
I voted multiple times to crack down on energy traders who artificially drive up the price of oil. The energy commodity market needs balanced regulation to prevent the free for all that has been the Bush Administration's policy for the last eight years.
\
I also secured tens of millions of dollars to help companies such as STR in Enfield to develop new and innovative solar and alternative energy technologies. These additional funds helped STR hire 50 additional employees.
\
We need more investments in alternative energy technologies, and I voted for an extension of the Investment Tax Credit to accomplish that goal.

Top Issues
\
Taxes: Connecticut families are paying too much already. Connecticut families pay two dollars to Washington for every one dollar returned in federal assistance.
\
Connecticut families can do a better job of spending our money than the government can. Paying more taxes will only widen the ""Connecticut family gap."" Joe Courtney voted for a budget that will raise the amount taken from Connecticut families by an additional one Billion dollars per year, $3,800 per family in Eastern Connecticut!
\
Tax laws need to change to protect our families and our economy. Standard deductions should be indexed for regional cost of living.
\
The AMT should be eliminated. The tax cuts of the past decade need to be made permanent.
\
Energy: Invest in alternative sources, including renewable energy, biofuels, fuel cells and nuclear power. Increase the tax incentives to help homeowners and businesses convert to more efficient and environmentally friendly systems. Standardize nuclear power plant design to speed regulatory approval of new plants.
\
The Economy: Small businesses need help to be more competitive. Allow businesses to join health care cooperatives across state lines.
\
Health savings accounts and tax credits for individually-purchased health plans will also relieve the costly burden of health care from small business.
\
Promote technical education and training to grow skill workers. Reduce taxes and regulations that discourage job growth.

\
Top Issues
\
The War: I will vote against continued funding for the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq and will take the floor of Congress to push for total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq within 10 months after being sworn into office. Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq not only will save American and Iraqi lives but also ameliorate an estimated 40% American casualty rate (including both physical and emotional wounds) for which our military provides excellent in-situ/field and short-term care, but notoriously inadequate long-term care.
\
If elected, I will remain a staunch supporter of our military personnel by correcting that latter deficiency.
\
If stopped tomorrow, whether the ""surge"" is succeeding or not, the war will cost American taxpayers 31/2 trillion dollars in ""indirect costs"" over the next several decades, money which is being borrowed from foreign sources and contributing to America's debtor-nation status, devaluing the dollar and contributing to our serious economic recession.
\
I will introduce legislation to reduce the military budget by 20%-25%, reducing the burden of our federal taxes and redirecting a portion of military spending to infrastructure repair, to affordable education (including a Green Corps community service program), and to jump start single-payer universal health care (which will pay for itself in reduced administrative costs).
\
The Environment: Once elected to Congress, I will introduce legislation to reverse ecological destruction in CT, the U.S. and around the world by introducing legislation to immediately increase U.S. fuel efficiency standards and to end corporate welfare and subsidies for industries that pollute, including the oil and fossil fuel industries, which continue to receive subsidies and taxpayer dollars while making record profits.
\
As a scientist, rather than a run-of-the-mill lawyer or career politician, I will bring to Congress the scientific knowledge and environmental experience necessary to solve the complex problems facing this nation and putting our planet in ecological peril. I am opposed to expanding off-shore oil drilling, as well as drilling in the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge, either as an alternative to development of alternative energy sources or as a false choice to conservation.
\
Just as John F. Kennedy promised the world that we would put a man on the moon in less than a decade, so too, we must make a concerted national commitment to fully developing alternative, clean, renewable sources of energy to replace our addictive dependency on fossil fuels. Expanding nuclear power, failing to exercise restraint in utilization of finite resources and blindly going after the last remaining petroleum deposits on earth as if climate change, finiteness of resources and energy inefficiency were not ecological facts will only make our paradigms shifts and ultimate changes in lifestyle more drastic and take us to the brink of the precipice.

Top Issues
\
The Economy/Jobs: The key to economic recovery is investing in the hard work and ingenuity of Americans. We face an array of economic challenges. Invention and innovation, production and efficiency are the engines that will allow us to overcome these challenges.
\
The federal government must invest heavily in rebuilding our infrastructure. Expanding mass transit and rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges are just two areas for increased investment. Green technology and high-tech industries are also critical. A continued commitment to education is our most important investment.
\
Community colleges have a unique roll to play in this economy because we must expand the number of Americans ready for high skill jobs. I sponsored important legislation that will increase funding for our community colleges so we can retrain our work force to compete for the technologically advance jobs of the future.
\
It will take all these efforts and more to restore our economy. I am committed to fighting for the investments we need.
\
Energy: This issue is critical to rebuilding our economy. Just as President Kennedy challenged America to land a man on the Moon in ten years, we must challenge the ingenuity of Americans to develop the technology we need to move beyond oil.
\
That means significant investments in alternative energy. Fuel cells, like those made right here in Connecticut, are a key and I have already helped pass legislation that provides grants and tax incentives to grow this technology.
\
My recent appointment to the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming will allow me to help lead the effort to develop alternative energy. An energy revolution is possible. It will help our economy in two critical ways. We will stop shipping billions to oil producing countries and we will create high pay high skill jobs.
\
I am also working to help control current energy costs. Working with local businessmen I developed legislation to stop oil speculators from driving up the cost of oil. We fought for two years to pass this legislation and this summer we won. The legislation is already making a difference.

\
The American Military: As economic globalization continues to increase, we see competition for resources turning into aggression with oil being the most sought after commodity.
\
With Russia poised to begin military maneuvers with Venezuela in the western hemisphere as well as its invasion into Georgia and terrorist acts in Pakistan next door to Iran which is developing nuclear capabilities while China aggressively grows her military, it becomes crystal clear that America needs to reinforce and retool our military to protect our citizens and our interests.
\
We cannot continue as a nation to fight among ourselves regarding the use of unilateral military force when threats loom from unseen enemies, once friendly Nations, rogue nations or extremists funded by shadow foreign governments.
\
Connecticut has always been a leader in defense and will continue to provide our military with the products and services it needs to wage a 24/7 vigilant effort against threats both at home and abroad.
\
Developing technologies will help our military do more with less and can provide our political leaders with real time accurate intelligence. If elected to Congress I will support reinforcing our military and providing greater resources and protection for our soldiers, veterans, citizens and our Nation.
\
Energy: Congress must act in a bipartisan manner to write a new comprehensive energy plan which will promote, regulate and oversee the energy industry without limiting or restricting growth.
\
The American small businessman should not be locked out of any new energy plans or development due to government over-regulation or big business monopolization. Big energy must not be allowed to take hold of our resources as it has in the past.
\
America has it all, on our land and off our shores, above our heads and under our feet and there is no reason that millions of new American jobs cannot be created from utilizing shale oil, coal to gas, renewable sources, retooling our auto industry, conservation, clean and safe nuclear, hydrogen, solar, wind or any other form of energy.
\
Connecticut has every resource needed to become a leader in new technologies and product development for the New Energy era beginning today -- especially in areas concerning the environmental impact of existing and emerging technologies.
\
If elected to Congress I promise to look out for the small businessman because I am one, watch out for big business and call out all those who would continue to make energy a political football for special interest.

Top Issues
\
Free Press Betrayed: Of all the forces that combined to involve our country in warfare, the mass media must be reckoned the most blameworthy. Print and broadcast reporters cheered loudly and almost unanimously with each wave of bombings and troop deployments.
\
They presented a parade of government shills, posing as experts, to convince Americans that killing people in foreign lands would be a sound policy. They suppressed all dissident opinion and allowed no moral reservations to be expressed.
\
Today, after almost seven years of daily bloodshed, the war policy is in catastrophic failure, and the mass media have imposed a news blackout. The activities of soldiers in the field are not reported. The mission is unstated. The cost is never discussed. Soldiers' deaths are not mentioned except in the towns where they get buried and, even then, they're on the back pages. Reporters on the scene in Iraq and Afghanistan pass on information from Army press releases, but they don't say what they are seeing or why they're not talking.
\
This is censorship, and it's an abuse of the rights conferred on the free press by our Constitution. I challenge this newspaper to act responsibly and professionally.
\
Corrupt Government: Among our leaders are people so thoroughly influenced by private interests that they are incapable of acting on behalf of the public. The corruption of government transcends political party and extends from local officials all the way up to governors and presidents.
\
Our electoral system, depending as it does so heavily on money, makes it easier for unethical people of both parties to hold public office.
\
Connecticut voters have seen corruption up close, and the federal government is even worse. Several former members of the House of Representatives are serving jail terms. Not a single one was exposed by his colleagues in Congress. Unfortunately, members' loyalty is to each other and not to ethics and the rule of law.
\
From the voter's standpoint, it appears that the point of serving in Congress is to generate lucrative government contracts for your district, to be performed by privileged, politically-connected patrons. There seems to be an agreement between the crooks and their facilitators to keep this system intact.
\
As a lawyer and a non-Democrat, non-Republican with a record of activism, I will bring honest people together to clean up this mess.

Crime Prevention: Restore the importance of fatherhood: 95% of male prisoners have never had a significant positive relationship with any father figure. And, many of these prisoners have children with whom they have no relationship. We need to break this cycle and reduce repeat offenses by prisoners.
\
I have advocated the Fatherhood Task Force to bring together all parties involved with families, children and law enforcement. This initiative will review existing state policies and determine how to change them to encourage the importance of fathers in their children's lives.
\
There are state programs that inadvertently discourages interaction between fathers and their sons and daughters. As the former Drug-Free Schools Coordinator, I know that we need to further channel our resources to prevent crime through drug education and other intensive intervention with youth at risk of committing crime.

The budget and not raising taxes: Ladies and gentlemen of the 7th District, I'm asking for your vote November 4th. We're facing a $300M budget deficit, with an additional $500M structural gap. I stood with Governor Rell to oppose the Democrat's plan for a huge 1.6 billion dollar tax and spend increase just 2 years ago.
\
In 2007 Governor Rell vetoed the Democrat's $800 million tax increase, I helped her sustain that veto and we ended up passing the Republican no tax increase budget. I will do all I can to limit state spending and cut taxes that hurt small businesses and working people.
\
That's why I've been endorsed by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association and National Federation of Independent (Small) Businesses. Higher taxes in a weak economy will cost us jobs and hurt working families and our struggling middle class.

Affordability: The greatest economic challenge we face in the 7th district is making Connecticut a more affordable place to live and do business. I understand how hard families have been hit by the rising cost of heating, gas and oil.
\
I would support subsidies for homeowners that add solar panels, geo thermal technology or fuel cells to their homes invest in energy efficient appliances and replace inefficient heating systems. This region had the highest job loss in that state in 2007.
\
By investing in clean and renewable sources of energy, we can help revitalize our towns with good paying jobs with benefits to the area. This will also attract our young people back to the district following college. Leadership on energy related legislation will be the greatest contrast between my opponent and me.
\
The most important piece of Energy related legislation was the 2007 Energy bill. With his job as a corporate attorney or Northeast Utilities, my opponent was forced to abstain from voting on this issue. The 100,000 people of the 7th District deserve a senator who will solve these problems, not run from them.

The Budget: The main item the General Assembly needs to focus upon, in the short term, is our budget shortfall. The office of fiscal analysis, a nonpartisan office, estimates a budget deficit of almost $300 million in 2009 and over $1 billion in 2010 and 2011.
\
The shortfall is the result of the tax revenues coming in much lower than estimated. In my opinion, this is unlikely to be a short term problem due to the financial situation in the state and the nation.
\
The General Assembly needs to focus its spending in four basic areas, public education, public safety, public health and infrastructure. We cannot continue funding high-risk ventures such as the convention center. We need to stop giving away millions of taxpayers' dollars for film tax credits and tax credits to major corporations. We need to get back to the basics.

The Economy: The issue that I am contacted most about these days is the economy; gas prices, home heating oil prices, and job stability. As a legislature, we have to not only provide a safety net for those who really need assistance, (visit my website to find the latest information on CT's energy assistance plans), but we have to keep money in our resident's pockets.
\
This is not the time to increase taxes. This is the time to cut taxes so that people have more money to put into their own budget.

The Budget: In recent years, the Connecticut General Assembly has made our beloved state unaffordable. The residents of Connecticut have reached a breaking point, and it is time for change in the state legislature.
\
Legislators have allowed the state budget to balloon to epic proportions while seeing revenues decline at a steady pace. We are now entering the realization that next year's budget will be faced with a deficit reaching into the hundreds of millions. With this budgetary prospect, unless new members are elected to the legislature, we will see our taxes raised once again so the legislature can continue its spending spree at our expense.
\
We are all now facing tough personal budget decisions, so why should the legislature be any different? As your legislator, I will work tirelessly to make Connecticut more affordable by supporting legislation that lowers taxes while limiting spending in Hartford so real change can take place in our legislature.
\
The time for limitless spending and excessive tax increases has passed, and change is needed to steer Connecticut back in the direction of affordability and an efficient, balanced budget. I am prepared to offer this change for the people of East Windsor and Ellington.

Education: I support all levels of education, however, I support a concerted effort to improve quality early childhood care and education experiences.
\
Research has shown that early intervention and quality programming can maximize the effectiveness of hard won education dollars and spare students prolonged academic struggles. The earlier we address issues associated with developmental delays like speech and language, reading, or socialization, the better we mitigate issues down the road that can cost significantly more and can impact the readiness level at kindergarten and later primary grade success.
\
We also need to continue to invest in our community college system. Our community colleges not only support the goals of higher education in terms of offering traditional college credits and degrees, but also provide support in new emerging fields in our ever-changing global economy.
\
Asnuntuck Community College is a great example, with programs such as our Manufacturing Technology Program. I voted for the expansion of this program, allowing for $545,000 to be put into improving the already thriving Manufacturing Technology Center in our state community colleges. Students of all ages are graduating and securing positions that pay a living wage.

Rescind the Gas Tax Increase: Connecticut residents pay the highest gasoline taxes in the country, amounting to nearly 70 cents on every gallon sold, with less than 19 cents of that total imposed by the federal government. The rest comes from a complex formula that increases the amount of state taxes paid when the price of gasoline increases.
\
We also are hit with double taxation, because part of the state gas tax is based on a percentage of the wholesale price. So, every time the cost of gas goes up, the amount of tax being levied increases too.
\
This facet of the gas tax is now on the back burner waiting for another increase that the legislature has already passed, but not yet enacted.
\
The Big Oil companies are continually blamed for the cost of gas, but the truth is that oil companies make about 8 cents per gallon profit, while the government makes nearly 70 cents. This is a burden that the average motorist and taxpayer can not bear. The state can take a huge burden off our backs by rolling back the gas tax.

Property Tax Reform: There is no greater challenge facing state lawmakers than reforming the property tax system that continues to burden our state's municipalities and residents.
\
The cost of education is one of the biggest drivers of the local property tax. We need to continue to work to improve the Education Cost Sharing to our town, as well assume more of the cost of special education.
\
I voted to cut each household's property tax by $1,000 a year. Last year I introduced legislation that would require 6 percent of the Hotel Bed tax go directly to the town. This would produce considerable revenue for the town I represent.
\
I worked for the expansion of the state health care system to reduce municipal costs and provide tax relief. I believe that we have to promote regional cost sharing among cities and towns to save money.

We lose millions in ECS funding, $13.4 million in Windsor alone. The cost to each household in Windsor is $1,639 in property taxes. That is your money that is funding inept government and education in Hartford, New Haven & Bridgeport.

The state also bonds almost $3 billion per year for local town projects. In the last 10 years my opponent has not delivered one state bond to her district. Our tax dollars are funding ball field lights in Wethersfield, football fields in Westport and downtown redevelopment in Somers but we can't get any of this same funding in our town; funding that we need and would help ease our burden.

Connecticut is losing population including the fastest loss of 18- to 34-year-olds in the nation. We need to act decisively to improve the economic environment in our state, attract new jobs and reverse the ""brain drain.""

I plan to attract businesses to our state and help to foster their growth by easing the tax burden they face and creating incentives for start-up companies. We must eliminate the business entity tax, we must help small businesses purchase health insurance for their employees, we must help start-up companies cope with the sky high utility costs so they can get off the ground. These are ways we can provide real help, attract new jobs and keep our best and brightest living and working here.

Economy: Connecticut, along with the entire country, is facing an unprecedented economic crisis. Real solutions require that everyone -- State and local governments, democrats, republicans and independents - work together to identify, prioritize and promptly implement economically viable cost cutting measures and alternative revenue sources without reliance on crippling tax increases. We must start with a thorough line item analysis of our current $18.5 billion budget, focusing on the elimination wasteful and inefficient State funded programs without compromising appropriate funding levels for education, public safety, healthcare and senior services.
\
We must also develop more reliable methods of testing the efficient use of taxpayer dollars, further reducing wasteful or inefficient programs. We must focus on the development and implementation of practical programs - such as State sponsored small business lending programs to ensure the availability of credit -- which recognize that small businesses are the lifeline of our economy and the key to long term economic recovery. We must take real steps toward property tax reform by focusing on ""outside the box"" revenue sources, thereby protecting our seniors, families and local businesses from being taxed out of our communities while maintaining essential local programs. Finally, State government must re-focus on responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars to ensure maximum investment returns without unnecessary and inappropriate risk.

Democrats said they could cut the gas tax to 32 cents a gallon by 1998 by raising income taxes on the wealthiest 13 percent of wage earners, while Republicans said a similar rollback could be accomplished through unspecified reductions in spending. Do you support cutting the gasoline tax? If so, how far should it be reduced and how would you pay for it?
\
Allen Hoffman
\
Yes. The commitment to reduce the gas tax and the fairness of `paying for it' are primary, the amount of the reduction, secondary. Shifting tax liabilities to accommodate tax reductions is unfair and dishonest. Tax reductions should reduce the overall tax burden.
\
John Ritter
\
I support the Democratic bill that would have lowered the gas tax to 32 cents. This bill would not have raised taxes at all, but would not have extended the July 1, 1996, income tax cut to people with incomes greater than $100,000.
\
Privatization: Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
Allen Hoffman
\
Absolutely. Serious downsizing of state government must include further privatizations; necessary services must be provided in an affordable and efficient manner. Institutional food services and building maintenance are two potential areas. Unions should be encouraged to participate in the bidding process.
\
John Ritter
\
There should be a presumption against privatization but we should continue to seek ways to save the taxpayers' money. If privatization is to occur, we need to be cognizant of the rights of employees and safeguards must be established.
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Allen Hoffman
\
All taxes are onerous if they are excessive, if they are assessed unfairly and if they create a negative impact by perception or in fact. Our overall state tax liability can and should be lowered by reducing spending while reducing the size of state government.
\
John Ritter
\
Property tax is more onerous because it creates an uneven playing field between cities and towns and unfairly burdens our homeowners as well as our business community who pay 70 percent of the property tax. We should fully fund the PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes).

A good budget proposal is like a hand of cards in a long game.
\
The players -- in this case, Gov. John G. Rowland and the Democratic-controlled legislature -- keep some cards in their hand and play others to get what they want.
\
In the high-stakes jockeying game, Rowland declined to provide several major items this year that are near and dear to Democratic hearts: a tuition freeze at the University of Connecticut and other public colleges; expansion of the low-cost HUSKY insurance program; and more money to buy land as open space.
\
These prominent omissions are not necessarily signs that these things will not be done. But if Democrats want them -- and they do -- they must give Rowland something else.
\
So, while Democrats are complaining about Rowland's plan to cut the state's gasoline tax by 7 cents per gallon, Republicans are predicting a Democratic cave-in on the issue before the legislative session ends May 3. They observe that Democrats complained constantly for two years about Rowland's tax-rebate proposals, then voted for the rebates in both years.
\
""I think it's easier for this gas-tax cut to pass in an election year than in a non- election year,"" said Sen. William Aniskovich, R- Branford, a deputy minority leader. ""I think it should be 7 cents, and I don't think the governor should back down.""
\
The gas-tax cut is one of Rowland's highest priorities, and he has already taped radio commercials on the proposal that will be broadcast starting next week. The ads are being paid for by the Republican State Central Committee and will be broadcast on stations statewide.
\
Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan, D-West Hartford, contended that Democratic priorities were purposely kept out of Rowland's budget, but Republicans responded that a Republican governor has the right to put his own stamp on the proposal.
\
""It is the executive power at its least attractive,"" Sullivan said of the deliberate omissions by Rowland. He was amazed, Sullivan said, ""at the sudden realization of the hours that were spent combing through a $12 billion budget in order to stick it to the legislature in the hope that those legislators would have to spend all their time on one iota of the budget, while the rest of the tractor- trailer speeds along at 90 miles per hour.""
\
Sullivan pointed out a specific example: The proposed budget removes a $2 million initiative to expand enrollment at community colleges. The measure is the work of House Majority Leader David Pudlin, D-New Britain, who now will be spending energy to get that back into the budget.
\
""It is a part of the game, and it's all over the budget,"" Sullivan said.
\
Republicans said that Rowland's budgets have been criticized internally in recent years for including too many of the Democratic wishes on education and the environment, among others.
\
But Democrats were flummoxed to learn this week that Rowland had eliminated funding for the HUSKY insurance program. The legislature had set aside $5 million for the program to take effect July 1, but Rowland rejected the idea because he said the program will actually cost $23 million annually.
\
The program would have allowed low- income parents, who include widows with young children, to purchase low- cost insurance that they might not otherwise be able to afford. The proposal was placed in the budget at the behest of House Speaker Moira K. Lyons and others, and she said she will work to restore the funding.
\
At the same time, Democrats were concerned that Rowland is proposing a new tax credit of $10.5 million for health maintenance organizations that provide medical coverage under the HUSKY program.
\
""I'm trying to see how we are cutting money for low-income adults, while providing a tax cut for HMOs,"" said Rep. Andrew Fleischmann, D- West Hartford, a member of the legislature's budget- writing committee.
\
Fleischmann pointed out the trade-off during a committee meeting Thursday, but Rowland's budget director, Marc S. Ryan, said the actions were not contradictory.
\
""It is an incentive for HMOs to stay in the Medicaid managed care program,"" Ryan responded. ""I think it has meant better prevention. I do believe what we did was reasonably consistent.""
\
As the budget process moves forward in the next 11 weeks, the sword of Damocles that will stop expenditure excesses will be the state-mandated spending cap, Ryan said.
\
""I believe there is, from a financial standpoint, not a whole lot of room to bargain out there because of the spending cap,"" Ryan said. ""In the past, there has been a lot more bargaining. The governor is very clear that we need a 7- cent reduction [in the gas tax] to get competitive with other states.""
\
The stance by Senate Democrats to not reopen the two-year budget is also viewed by some Republicans as a bargaining chip. Sullivan says the legislature should instead use the budget that was passed last year, rather than approving the adjusted budget that Rowland revealed Wednesday.
\
""If the Democrats are making a decision to forego gas-tax cuts and not spend $90 million in new school construction, I guess the burden will be on them to explain that,"" said Dean Pagani, Rowland's spokesman. ""It's an election year, and it would seem opposing tax cuts would be handing their Republican opponents an issue.""

Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling: The state Supreme Court has ruled that the Hartford schools are unconstitutionally segregated and has ordered the state to come up with a solution. What remedy do you favor to correct this?
\
I believe the stronger legal reasoning is with the three dissenters in Sheff vs. O'Neill. The proposed solutions must restore to our urban public education systems' most important stakeholders, students and their parents, a greater sense of belonging to and authority over schools which exist only to serve them. To that end, I will support decentralized neighborhood-based schools in which parental participation is integral to the mission of the school and will oppose any coercive or non-consensual movement of students.

1. Repeal of 4-4-12 (Public Acts 95-283 & 96-218), a state-mandated bill that will reduce the power of the towns, eliminate the input of the taxpayers and increase voter apathy. We need real property tax relief, not more government regulations.
\
2. In order to attract new businesses to the state we need to create a better business climate.We need an environment where businesses can prosper. This can be achieved with lower taxes, regulation reform, improved roads and a highly educated work force.
\
3. Cities and towns are losing local control of their schools and town governments due to the oppressiveness of state mandates. We have to eliminate mandated programs and return government to the people.
\
Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling: The state Supreme Court has ruled that the Hartford schools are unconstitutionally segregated and has ordered the state to come up with a solution. What remedy do you favor to correct this?
\
Shawn T. Johnston
\
Any remedy we should recommend would ideally be a combination of voluntary measures such as voluntary parental choice measures, increased targeted investments in programs which emphasize intensive parental involvement, and other possible changes to state law regarding school districting and accountability.
\
William A. Warner
\
I would oppose any solution that involved busing -- forced or coerced. I believe the solution is a voucher system that allows parents to send their children to any accredited school in the state. The parents should assume the responsibility of the student's transportation.
\
Gas tax: The legislature failed to enact a bill to cut the state's gasoline tax -- the highest in the nation -- after lawmakers could not agree on how the cut should be paid for.

\
Shawn T. Johnston
\
I support cutting the gas tax and was one of 49 representatives to vote yes last session on the amendment to the budget which would have lowered the tax to 31 cents a gallon and also would have brought all of the non- transportation-related expenses out of the special transportation fund and back onto the general budget where they belong. I would support a similar proposal.
\
William A. Warner
\
The gas tax was originally established as a user fee to build and maintain our roads. If we stopped diverting money from this fund for other uses, we could lower the gas tax while improving the roads.
\
Privatization: Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Supporters say privatization could increase efficiency and reduce waste, but opponents say it is a thinly disguised union- busting effort that could cost jobs and lead to the elimination of some necessary services. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
Shawn T. Johnston
\
I support privatization of state services if and when accurate cost-benefit analysis shows that the same level of services can be provided, and these savings will be a result of efficiencies and not merely a reflection of lower wages, less benefits and a more part-time temporary work force.
\
William A. Warner
\
A bipartisan commission should be established to review privatization and make recommendations. I believe some of the services performed by the Department of Motor Vehicles could be privatized.
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999.

Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Shawn T. Johnston
\
Without question, the property tax is more onerous. In the last two years, we have begun to lower the corporate tax rate, the income tax, the inheritance tax and also the state hospital tax. None of these will be possible to sustain without continuing to improve upon controlling state spending. I will continue to work hard at the appropriations committee level to control state spending, and if this can be accomplished, I would be happy to support compromise legislation to reduce certain taxes.
\
William A. Warner
\
The Independence Party was formed during the fight to repeal the state income tax. We believe in a smaller, more efficiently run state government. I would support necessary reductions in state spending to enable the repeal of the income tax.

\
Eileen M. Daily
\
The governor has appointed a task force to offer suggestions to legislators in January. The task force needs the support of every public official, every candidate and every taxpayer in the state, she says. Public officials have a responsibility to have an open mind and to review and re-examine positions they have taken in the past, before the court decision, and to guarantee a good and a quality education to each child in the state, Daily says. The governor declared at the outset that busing was not the answer, and everyone hopes that any remedy doesn't take the nature of force, she adds.
\
John A. Johns
\
This matter obviously started as a racial matter, Johns says. ""I would want to do everything possible to help educate children and not have it end as a racial matter,"" he says. He opposes busing children to ""inferior systems."" To make it better for one group of kids and worse for another is not the answer, he says. Johns says people must address neighborhood problems; this is more than just a school issue.

\
""I was part of the unsuccessful movement in the Senate to reduce the gas tax. That movement was not only opposed but stonewalled by the Senate majority party,"" Daily says. She would recommend reducing the tax by 1 cent per fiscal quarter and compensate by removing from that revenue that goes to the Department of Motor Vehicles and the state police.
\
John A. Johns
\
He supports a reduction in the tax. Johns notes the gas tax was a special fund to take care of highway construction and maintenance. ""I would remove other expenditures from that fund and not play gimmickry with it,"" he says.

Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place.

\
Eileen M. Daily
\
""That, for the most part, is probably the worst of all possible worlds,"" Daily says. Private companies would receive the tax breaks of government without the accountability of government, she says. ""We need to examine the kinds of responsibility the government has to the public. Government should do only what government is charged with doing,"" Daily says. ""It there's something we're not charged with doing, it should be done by the private sector.""
\
John A. Johns
\
Johns would support privatization if it's proven more economical. ""One really has to start with the budget. I did the same thing as first selectman, which was to look closely at what you're trying to do.""
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Eileen M. Daily
\
Daily believes the property tax is more onerous and says she would work to decrease it. She says we first need to educate people about the need for reforming the property tax. Property tax reform would require restructuring how education is funded, including the level of responsibility placed on municipalities. Daily also takes issue with the sales tax. ""There's no federal deduction for it, and it involves our businesses as agents of the state. . . . The poor, who have no disposable income, are hit hardest,"" she says.
\
John A. Johns
\
""I would choose to reduce the gas tax. It raises the cost of consumer products, or everything that we get. It's one of the taxes that tends to hurt, and it doesn't just end at the pump."" Johns says he favors cutting all taxes, though. ""You have to look at what you're trying to fund and take special care not to hurt children and the elderly. Democratic legislators don't seem all that worried about property tax when they pass all these mandates that affect our towns.""

After more than a decade of talking about it, many major employers in downtown Hartford are doing something they should have done more than a decade ago. They're going to charge their employees market rate for parking, but increase subsidies for mass transit.
\
It's a good idea. More than 100,000 people commute into Hartford every day, almost half of them driving alone. It's wasteful.

But what if we took it a step further? Instead of just charging what it costs to park, what if we also charged what it costs to drive?
\
Wait, you say, doesn't the gas tax take care of the roads?
\
Not even close, says David Morris, a transportation analyst with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a Washington-based nonprofit that specializes in the environment and community development.
\
Morris says that road and driving costs, direct and indirect, are so heavily subsidized by general taxes that ""the car is on welfare.""
\
He said studies by his organization indicate that ""user fees,"" such as gas taxes or license charges, pay for about half the real costs of state and federal roads and only a third the cost of local roads.
\
In Connecticut, nearly all the state's transportation costs are paid by the transportation fund, which is supported by user fees such as the gas tax. However, cities such as Hartford pay a bundle for driving from their general funds.
\
Going through the budget, I can see about $10 million worth of street costs Hartford taxpayers are picking up. This includes such things as reconstruction and resurfacing, plowing and electricity for streetlights.
\
That figure, Morris says, is artificially low. Driving has another set of less-direct costs. Citing a study done in Pasadena, Calif., he said as much as 40 percent of police, 14 percent of fire and 16 percent of paramedic costs are related to automobile traffic.
\
There's also the loss of taxable land that is used for roads and highways, which may be one-fourth of the city's land area. The American Lung Association estimates the medical costs from auto-emitted air pollution at 40-45 cents a gallon. There's also been a serious esthetic loss to cities such as Hartford that have been carved up by highways and partly leveled for parking lots. This, too, costs something.
\
The real cost of running a car might be $4$5 a gallon, Morris said. If so, he thinks that's what we ought to charge.
\
For one thing, it would cure a clear economic injustice; taxpayers who don't own cars subsidizing those who do. Morris said about 20 percent of the U.S. population doesn't own a car, and said the figure is much higher in urban centers. He said a third of the families making more than $50,000 have three cars. If general tax revenues support driving, this is trickle-up economics.
\
Secondly, paying an artificially low price for driving hides its true cost, which encourages more vehicle use and poor public policy. There's no incentive to use commuter trains, for example, even though a full train can take 120 cars off the road.
\
We aren't going to do away with the car, and we shouldn't. But by charging what cars really cost, we'd encourage the creation of a transportation system that offers lower-cost alternatives, from buses and rail to fiber-optic networks.
\
Urban legislators should support the concept of a statewide full-cost gas tax, because it would benefit the cities. Mass transit only makes sense when you can bring large numbers of people to a central location. Soon, even people from Windsor would be asking, ""Pardon me, boy, is that the Griffin Line choo-choo?

Gas Prices
\
Raise Questions
\
I was wondering how much fuel is consumed by NASCAR and other automobile racing activities just for entertainment purposes. I also wonder how much difference it would make if waste like this could be limited. I don't mean to pick on auto racing -- it just seems like such an obvious example of misuse of a critical resource.
\
I don't know how high the price of gasoline has to go before a majority of drivers modify their behavior. Obviously, many people are complaining about rising prices, but so far, not many seem to be changing their driving habits.
\
I wonder if we'll eventually get to the point where it becomes necessary to implement not only some form of price control, but rationing as well.
\
Some form of prioritization based on necessity is necessary in an environment where prices are increasing dramatically and increasing the supply is in serious doubt.

With oil refineries in New Orleans sustaining damage, and the ongoing troubles in the Middle East, now is the time for some real leadership. Rather than a temporary gas tax cut (which is being considered by Gov. M. Jodi Rell) or a cap on wholesale gas prices (an idea floated by Lt. Gov. Kevin Sullivan), how about putting some money toward increasing the number and frequency of bus routes between Hartford and the surrounding suburbs?
\
Any solution that encourages consumption is just keeping us chained to our dependence on foreign oil. Let's try and break free.

Once again, The Courant mystifies me. In the Sept. 3 Motoring section, The Courant presented articles on two new SUVs with stated gas mileage ratings of 8 mpg and 15 mpg. Where the heck do those vehicles fit in with the current gas price crisis and efforts to improve overall gas mileage?
\
It seems that the writers featured in the Motoring section don't read the front page.

Logic On Cities
\
Any fool could have seen the New Orleans catastrophe as inevitable [Commentary, Sept. 4, ""New Orleans Can't Stand In Nature's Way""]. But people put their heads in the sand and then look around to dispense blame in all directions. Will political considerations take over amid the storm of indignation surrounding this event? If so, you know the politicians will try to restore the city and create an even bigger time bomb.
\
Seattle was rebuilt at a higher level.
\
New York City, anchored on rock, has problems with high tides: The sewers back up. The subways are below the water level at all times. Something could let go.
\
Boston Harbor is built on a landfill begun in Colonial days. The ""Big Dig"" is already leaking. How would it fare against Katrina and the accompanying increased hydrostatic pressure?
\
Only the Dutch can handle living below sea level and mastering the sea, and even they have had their hard times.
\
The problem is not just in New Orleans. How will all cities on the sea deal with the ever-rising sea level?
\
Professor Robert M. Thorson, a highly respected authority, presented a learned yet easy to read article. But if he really wants the world to wake up and face the future, maybe he should write a novel based on what has happened, could happen and should be done. Hollywood could turn it into a blockbuster. Special effects would be far more convincing than logic to the majority of U.S. voters.

Good Attendance
\
Expected
\
In response to the Sept. 4 article ""Ice Cream Bells Say: Come To School"" [Connecticut section]:
\
I was appalled to read that Hartford teachers and administrators have to appeal to parents' and guardians' baser wants to get kids into school. A principal shouldn't have to do something as petty as offering free ice cream to get kids to come to school. If things like this are a normal function of the school system, especially in Hartford, then major education reform is necessary.
\
It's a shame that Hartford has to go through the same thing every year because attendance is so low.
\
My family lives in Middletown. It's not the greatest of towns, but school attendance is always good, with only a few students absent, mostly because of sickness or extended family vacations.
\
I'm surprised that the state Department of Social Services and the Department of Children and Families don't ensure these Hartford kids are in school. I'm also surprised that the Hartford Board of Education isn't more involved in ensuring that each child is receiving the education he or she needs.

UConn Is
\
Second To None
\
As a parent of a first-year student at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, I think it's time The Courant added some balance to its reporting about UConn.
\
It may be true that taxpayers could have expected more out of one of the country's most ambitious public university building programs. But news of those mistakes should not eclipse the magnitude of what has been done right at UConn.
\
Last year, as part of our college selection process, my son and I visited major public universities throughout New England and New York. In comparing library and research facilities, chemistry labs, business school facilities and college athletics, as well as general campus look and feel, we discovered that UConn is second to none. Our visits left me convinced there is no public university within a five-hour drive of Hartford that holds a candle to UConn.
\
Connecticut taxpayers have every reason to be proud of what is happening at Storrs. Even with construction glitches, UConn is a shining example of Connecticut's commitment to excellence in higher learning.

Convinced Of Helmet's Worth
\
I couldn't believe my eyes when I read the Sept. 1 editorial ""Proof: Helmets Save Lives.""
\
Just the prior evening, at about 5 p.m., I was riding my mountain bike on the outskirts of town. While heading back into town, riding with traffic, a car suddenly veered over and laid me out on the asphalt. While recuperating from numerous abrasions, a dislocated shoulder and chest wall contusions, I decided to inspect the helmet I had been wearing at the time of the accident. I was surprised to see scraping on the left side and a lifting and wrinkling of the outer shell from the inner core.
\
Yes, I believe I was saved from severe head injuries and the possibility of a lifelong disability.
\
It seems sensible to have mandatory helmet use. I am all for it and have firsthand proof.

Taxes: With Connecticut's economy booming, the state government has had budget surpluses each of the past four years. This year, the governor and legislature voted to return more than $115 million in rebates to taxpayers. With the current volatility on Wall Street and other global stock markets and the possibility of an economic slowdown in Connecticut, some worry that the state could face a budget deficit in future years. Do you support continued tax cuts in 1999? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
I feel that the legislature should continue with the same fiscal restraint it has demonstrated over the past few years. I feel that we still need to reduce Connecticut's current gas tax -- one of the highest in the country. The current high tax on gasoline in the state puts gas stations in north-central Connecticut and other border towns in a difficult situation as residents cross over the line to purchase their gas due to the lower cost. We really need to address this problem in the upcoming legislative session. We are already phasing out Connecticut's inheritance tax over the next few years. This will help our desire to have residents continue to live in the state in their older years.
\
Patients' rights: Government regulation of managed care has become a major issue in Connecticut and nationally. Democrats such as gubernatorial candidate Barbara Kennelly and U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd support a ""patients' bill of rights"" that they say would force managed care companies to put patient care ahead of profits. One of the ""rights"" Kennelly supports is the right of patients to sue their managed care insurance companies, a right patients do not now have. Gov. John Rowland has also said he supports this right. Do you support a patients' bill of rights, including the right to sue a managed care company? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
I support a patients' bill of rights. As a legislature, it is important that we ensure that health care is affordable and accessible -- whatever your age. Health maintenance organizations should not have the right to arbitrarily cancel policies for elderly customers. I would support a patient's right to sue a managed care company. When the insurance industry begins to dictate the type of medical care a patient will receive, in a manner that is not in the best interest of the patient, this is not acceptable and drastic measures need to be taken.
\
Megan's Law: The state has a version of Megan's Law on the books, requiring that sex offenders register with police. A new version of the law, allowing state police to post the name of sex offenders on the Internet, goes into effect Jan. 1. Some lawmakers say the state needs to go further and require widespread community notification when a sex offender moves into a neighborhood. Earlier versions of the law have not required such notification, in part because of a fear of vigilantism or double punishment of an offender. Others say the community's safety outweighs those concerns. Do you support further expansion of Megan's Law to require community notification? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
I support expanding the current Megan's Law. As a parent of two young children, I support community notification when a sex offender moves into a neighborhood. The more well-informed we are as a community, the better protected our families and children will be.
\
Environmental protection: Kennelly and some employees at the state Department of Environmental Protection have complained that, under Rowland, the agency has not been enforcing environmental regulations stringently enough. Rowland and DEP Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque deny that and say the criticism comes from a small group of disgruntled employees and political opponents of the governor. Do you believe the DEP adequately enforces environmental regulations? If so, do you think criticism of the DEP is valid? If you do not think enforcement is satisfactory, do you think legislation is needed to ensure that it improves?
\
As a member of the legislature's environment committee, I feel that the Department of Environmental Protection is doing the best it can to enforce regulations. I do feel that regulations need to be equally enforced among all constituencies and companies. We cannot enforce more strongly with one company and less so with another for any reason. I do not necessarily feel that more legislation is necessary. I simply feel that we need to more strongly adhere to the checks and balances we currently have in place.

The Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce recently asked state legislative candidates in its member towns to write a letter telling chamber members why the business community should support them. John N. Anderson, president of the chamber, said the organization is not endorsing any candidate, but asked The Courant to print the candidates' responses as a public service. The responses received appear below.
\
State Rep. Christopher Stone, Democratic candidate running for re- election to the 9th House District seat:
\
By way of personal background, Linda and I live in East Hartford with our three children. I am counsel to the East Hartford Chamber of Commerce, and have been chairman of the East Hartford School/ Business Partnership. As the owner of a small business, I share many of the concerns of the business community relating to workforce development, insurance costs and government regulation.
\
During my first term in the legislature, with each vote I cast, I attempted to balance the often-competing interest of labor and the business community. I attempted to decide issues in a manner that reflected the constituency I serve. In fact, my 1999 rating by the CBIA [Connecticut Business and Industry Association] was within single percentage points of CBIA's district rating for the 9th Assembly District.
\
On the major issues facing our state, I have taken positions that are consistent with a recognition of the vital role that the business community plays in our local, state and global economy. I supported measures to provide significant business tax relief, and supported development projects such as Adriaen's Landing and the University of Connecticut football stadium. I worked within committee to make sure that prior reforms to our workers' compensation system were not undone. I support increased funding for our local schools, as well as for vocational and secondary education. I recognize the need for a trained, qualified work force to meet the ever-changing demands of our expanding economy.
\
We also need to protect and promote the quality of life in Connecticut, both to attract people to our state and to ensure that the residents we train stay. I supported increased funding for open space preservation, particularly within our urban areas. I also supported legislation for brownfield development.
\
Our work in this area is far from over. For example, we need to confront the transportation crisis facing our state. The recently convened transportation summit provided not only a forum for the exchange of ideas, but also contained the all-important effort of raising the public's awareness of the problem -- a problem of statewide concern, not just a problem for Fairfield County. With the amount of state investment required to tackle the problem, it is imperative that the public appreciate the direct connection between the transportation crisis and continued growth of our state economy. Public education on this issue is vital, and must be ongoing.
\
Dennis A. Brenner, Republican candidate for the 9th House District seat:
\
Without a doubt, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce should be most supportive of the candidacy of Dennis Brenner. You see, Dennis knows Manchester.
\
I know the community because I work closely with civic and business leaders as a resident and as a real estate salesman for D.W. Fish. An example of my involvement in the community was the school bond issue last fall. I insisted that any plan that left out the needs of the middle schools and the high school would only harm the community in the end. I am presently serving on the human relations committee for the town.
\
No-nonsense legislation will be a high priority. There are a plethora of legislative issues that continually add to the confusion and paperwork of the business community. I will introduce and support only legislation that can and will be enforced. In the end, legislation that only appeals to the emotions becomes randomly enforced, and results in anger. Common sense is fundamental to a healthy business community, but sometimes it seems it is just overlooked. I will support legislation that will lend itself to less government regulation. There is an overabundance of burdensome paperwork that often consumes and debilitates the small businessperson. I will support a healthy environment for the business community.
\
Only one who has run a small business can identify with other small business owners. I have done just that. I know the struggle of payroll, tax collection and tax reports. I will fight for small businesses to receive back a portion of the tax they collect to offset the paperwork and bookkeeping that is involved in collecting the state's revenues. Few people even reflect on all the paperwork that is involved to collect the state's monies. Those who own small businesses and merchants are all too familiar with the process and the cost.
\
Work is a positive word to me. I have always enjoyed whatever task I have attempted. I worked hard to pay my own way through college and grad school. I worked for nonprofit institutions for over 26 years. Six years ago, I began selling real estate. Last year I achieved nearly $5 million in gross sales while volunteering in the religious community and teaching a college-level course on ""Leadership for the 21st Century.""
\
Systematic by nature, I have often been called a Renaissance Man by those who know me best. I have spent a good portion of my life as a multifaceted person accomplishing several tasks at one time. I am always in search of new and better ideas for dealing with individuals and organizations. I believe my academic training, life's experiences, strong work habits and high degree of integrity will be an asset to the Manchester merchants and the entire community.
\
I believe that I can and will represent the Manchester community in a way that will benefit our town in a superior way.
\
State Rep. David Blackwell, a Republican running for re-election to the 12th House District seat:
\
This year, I am running unopposed for the 12th House District seat. Nevertheless, it is my obligation to solicit the views of the people I represent and to inform the people of Manchester of my views.
\
For more than two years, I have been telling the people of Manchester that three issues are particularly important to our town: taxes, jobs and education. Of the three, education clearly has been on the minds of all Manchester residents. A sound educational system is important for residents, but it is also important for business. The overall quality of public schools in a community is a factor considered by homeowners and businesses alike. People want to live in towns with solid schools. Without solid schools, home values depreciate and businesses are often left to shoulder a greater tax burden.
\
Although much has been made of Manchester's education issues, I believe that our community has made, and is poised to make, exciting improvements in education. Already, we have seen significant success from a townwide endeavor to reduce an alarmingly high dropout rate in our high school. My part in this effort was to persuade the state legislature to appropriate $100,000 for a dropout prevention demonstration program. While my contribution was but one part of the solution, the overall effect has been a dramatic reduction in Manchester's high school dropout rate.
\
Following the defeat of the referendum on school construction last year, a survey questioned people's reasons for voting against the plan. One reason was the lack of certainty about the state's share of reimbursement for construction. As a legislator, it is my role to assist my town's application to the state for construction reimbursement. This past session, the legislature passed a bill that I proposed, which allowed communities to submit a feasibility study and cost analysis, prepared by an independent licensed architect, together with its application. In this manner, communities now can make a better case for receiving the desired state reimbursement.
\
Education is not the only issue, however. In this session alone, the state legislature provided $221 million in new tax relief for Connecticut taxpayers. Because the tax package passed both the House and Senate by near-unanimous votes, just about every legislator can say that he or she supported tax cuts. For some legislators, however, that support was real. For instance, in order to rally public support for a 7-cent cut in the gas tax, I joined a handful of legislators statewide who actually pumped gas for constituents. Efforts like these made it difficult for those opposed to tax cuts to prevail. Today, Connecticut's gas tax has been cut by 7 cents, putting us in line with neighboring states.
\
Connecticut's economy has improved dramatically over the past few years. Still, we have a lot of work to do. We still consistently rank in the top five most-taxed states. We still can improve the business climate in Connecticut and create even more high-wage jobs. I will continue to support the kind of policies that improve that climate. According to the Connecticut Business and Industry Association's Sept. 21 press release, ""With so much at stake in the New Economy, it is important to have legislators who understand the importance of encouraging economic growth and opportunity. David Blackwell has shown a clear grasp of the economic issues facing the people of the 12th House District.""
\
Ross Garber, the Republican candidate for the 4th Senate District seat:
\
I believe this election is of critical importance for businesses in the Manchester area. It presents a clear choice between a candidate who is committed to growing the region's economy by supporting small businesses and a legislator who has been deemed one of the state's worst on business issues.
\
Just last week, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association officially endorsed my candidacy, making me one of only two state Senate challengers in Connecticut to receive this prestigious endorsement. I take this as a reflection of my commitment to working with the business community to pass initiatives that will benefit us all. Unlike my opponent, I understand the vital role our businesses and investments have and that they are free from unnecessary regulation, oversight, taxes and fees. I will fight for smaller government so that our business community will continue to prosper in Manchester and throughout all of Connecticut.
\
My opponent, on the other hand, has been rated by the CBIA as one of the worst lawmakers in the state on business issues. Her legislative agenda is characterized by an outdated anti-business sentiment, deeply indebted to the special interest politics of tax and spend liberalism. She has sponsored numerous initiatives that would have hampered small businesses in our region, including so- called ""corporate responsibility"" legislation and regular attempts to undo worker's compensation reform. She is considered by the CBIA to be one of the two legislators in the state most out of touch with the business concerns in their district.
\
Unlike my opponent, I am running for office so that the people of Manchester will have a strong, effective voice at the Capitol. I will be an advocate for our concerns, not the concerns of special interest groups. I believe that may opponent is ""bad for business"" and will fail to bring our region its fair share of the economic vitality enjoyed by the rest of the state. I believe that I will be a lawmaker who will help Manchester live up to its enormous potential in this booming economy, and I don't think we can afford to wait any longer.
\
State Sen. Mary Ann Handley, a Democrat running for re-election to the 4th Senate District seat:
\
While a member of the Manchester Board of Directors and as deputy mayor, I successfully fought for many proposals that helped small and medium-sized businesses in Manchester, including:
\
Strong advocacy for the use of grant money for the renovations and improvements of the Main Street facade to restore the character and business climate of downtown Manchester.
\
The relocation and creation of new jobs that still exist at ScanOptics.
\
A tax credit for certain machinery at Allied Printing in exchange for new jobs and a promise to stay in Manchester.
\
Since my election to the state Senate in 1996, I have continued my efforts to make Connecticut a better place to live and do business. My record includes:
\
Continued reductions in the corporate tax rate.
\
Strong support for Manchester Community College and the programs that local businesses rely on for worker training.
\
The creation of an economic stimulus package to invest in new manufacturing, biotech and finance businesses.
\
Investments in improving local vocational schools and training for workers in the areas of technology and manufacturing to match the needs of the local business community.
\
Support for tax-credit incentives to encourage innovative companies to undertake research and development initiatives in Connecticut.
\
Work to improve the Bradley Airport infrastructure to move goods and services to and from our area more competitively.
\
Additionally, I have supported:
\
Tax reductions totaling $655 per year for the typical family, including cuts to the income tax, sales tax, gas tax and property tax.
\
Substantial improvements to the formula that sends school aid to communities to bring more back to Manchester to help pay for the education budget and hold down property taxes.
\
Constituent service to local businesses that have had difficulty working with state government or who have concerns about legislation.
\
The economic climate in Connecticut has continued to improve over the last four years, thanks in part to the efforts of the state legislature. I would appreciate your support once again this year so I can continue to work to improve the quality of life for Connecticut residents.
\
John W. Thompson, a Democrat running for re-election to the 13th House District seat:
\
First, I believe I have served the town of Manchester effectively over the past 30 years. I am intimately familiar with the workings of town government, having served as deputy mayor for one term and mayor for two terms. During that period I actively interacted with the business community, attending your events and participating in dialog about business interests and the economic future or our community.
\
Senior members of the chamber may recall my appointment of a Downtown Action Committee, which recommended improvements to Purnell Place and its parking lot, which were carried out. Our general manager at that time, Bob Weiss, was actively engaged in the expansion of our economic base, and he received our support. I believe much of the growth of economic activity in Manchester can be traced to the foundations that were developed in the early- to mid- 1970s.
\
The first act I sponsored and pursued as a state representative in 1987 was a grant to the instructors of the handicapped (IOH) to help complete an addition to our high school swimming pool. The grant for $50,000 supplemented money raised by IOH, contributions from the town and money and in-kind services by many businesses. This community action, a coalition of a private non-profit organization, citizens, the business community and government, represented to me what is best about Manchester. We are a community that cares and we work at it. The pool continues to be used weekly by the IOH, and also supports a variety of youth, adult, and senior citizens programs. Swim therapy and swim exercise programs are features of the pool.
\
I was a leader in welfare reform in our state, since I co-chaired the appropriations subcommittee that created reform over the past nine years. To make reform work we knew we had to build in job opportunities, child care and access to health care by the poor. When I convened a meeting in Manchester to discuss the expansion of health care, one of the participants was the chamber, through its president. When I approached MARC Inc. to consider working with welfare recipients, using the same model as it does with disabled persons, it agreed and now has the most successful welfare-to-work programs in our state. The success of MARC, I believe, is due in part to its ability to work in and with the business community.
\
As we embark on a new program to help teenagers at risk of leaving school before graduation, by providing school-work training alternatives to traditional education programs, the cooperation of MARC Inc., the chamber, town and board of education has been outstanding.
\
I have supported major change in our workers' compensation laws, corporate taxation, business incentives and tax credits during my 14- year tenure as legislator. My peers, in polls taken over these years by Connecticut Magazine, have rated me as among the top-performing legislators. In the last poll taken several years ago I was listed as the House member with the highest integrity. Sen. Adela Eads, senate minority leader, shared that honor with me.
\
Over the years, I have served on a number of committees, was the first chairman of the Select Committee on Children, and currently serve as assistant majority leader. I believe my voice is heard and listened to in the General Assembly. My experience in government, running my own business, and being active in the community, my church, and civic affairs has earned me the support of our business community.
\
Stephen Ryan, the Republican candidate for the 13th House District seat:
\
I am Steve Ryan, and I am staunchly pro business. As the pro- business candidate for the 13th Assembly District, I have concrete and definitive plans to promote the business environment in Manchester. These ideas are supported by many of our members and it is about time that we have representation in the legislature that promotes your agenda.
\
First and foremost, this means that I will protect all Manchester businesses, and will not only sponsor but vote for any legislation that will promote the economy and business climate of our town. The time has come to make Connecticut a business-friendly state, and to provide a climate that encourages businesses to set up shop here. There's no better place to begin making these positive changes than right at home in Manchester.
\
The CBIA and National Federation of Independent Business both give my opponent, the opponent of business, a consistently poor rating. One can only conclude that with this rating, business concerns have not been represented at all for the last 14 years. For example, my opponent was the only area legislator to oppose the construction of the UConn stadium, which will bring economic development and jobs to Manchester residents.
\
When addressing the concerns of business owners, large or small, the bottom line is money. As state representative for the 13th House District, I would fight like a lion to reduce the cost of doing business in Connecticut. To realize this goal, I would propose and support legislation that would allow businesses to recoup a portion of their sales tax in order to defray their administrative costs. I will work closely with Gov. Rowland on achieving this goal.
\
I am asking for your support and endorsement so that I can fight for your most pressing concerns in the state legislature. We must not settle for complacency and passive presentation. I give you my word and my unwavering commitment to represent both the best interests of Manchester's residents and business community. Together we can build a brighter future; consider me a vested partner in the success of your business.

There's been no shortage of ideas about how to soften the sticker shock for motorists when they pull up to the gas pump and see numbers spinning faster than the lemons on a slot machine going at warp speed.
\
Some public officials propose suspending the state's 25 cents- per-gallon gas tax. Others suggest rolling back or imposing a moratorium on the gross receipts tax on petroleum, which was increased on July 1 to help raise funds for much-needed statewide transportation improvements. Additional proposals include scaling back clean-air requirements and launching an investigation of the petroleum industry, which is suspected of price-gouging.
\
A timeout is needed. In their headlong rush to temporarily ease the burden on motorists, officials need to ask themselves what is the best long-term energy policy for the state and the nation. The answer seems clear: Motorists must begin weaning themselves from ever-bigger, ever-thirstier, ever more fuel-inefficient vehicles.
\
We know from experience with cigarette sales that the most effective way of changing consumer behavior is to ratchet up prices. From California to Massachusetts, studies have shown that when smoking became prohibitively expensive because higher taxes were instituted, young people didn't light up and older people kicked the habit.
\
High gas prices -- they've receded somewhat in recent days but remain far higher than a year ago --may be a bitter pill to swallow, but harsh medicine is what's needed to break Americans of the oil- abusing habit. We can't go on obliviously buying gas-guzzling vehicles without regard for finite supplies, environmental degradation, and the shortages that global disruptions and growing economies can spark.
\
The gas tax is a regressive tax that hits hardest those least able to afford it. That's regrettable, especially in a state with few mass transit options.
\
But if the federal government had not capitulated to the insatiable demands of U.S. auto manufacturers, motorists might not be in this predicament. After fuel economy standards rose steadily from 1970 to 1990, they hit the skids in the 1990s.
\
The Bush administration has compounded the problem by rolling back fuel-efficiency requirements and exempting light trucks that weigh more than 8,500 pounds, including Hummers and large SUVs. Meanwhile, up until the latest price spike, U.S. drivers have shown little inclination to give up their guzzlers. Of the 17 million vehicles projected to be bought this year, only 234,000 are expected to be fuel-efficient hybrids. Unless that trend changes, there will be little long-term price relief.
\
State politicians should back off plans to suspend the gas tax and instead apply the extra revenue generated by the gross receipts levy to mass transit. There's no better way to curb gas consumption, lower costs and protect the environment than by leaving the driving to others.

Commuters, business leaders and environmentalists pleaded with lawmakers Thursday night to keep the Shoreline East, Waterbury and Danbury commuter trains on their tracks.
\
For many of the speakers, their testimony Thursday night marked the second time in two years they have trekked to the state's capital to protect the rail service they have grown to depend on.
\
Under his proposed 1997-1999 state spending plan, Gov. John G. Rowland would discontinue the three rail lines and replace them with bus services along similar routes to pay for gasoline tax cuts. The rail service was threatened two years ago but ultimately retained.
\
Supporters of the rail services highlighted the reliability and comfort of trains and questioned why the governor would suggest adding more bus lines when state highways already are congested.
\
""It's obvious that traffic on I-95 has gotten heavier. Is this the time to be reducing rail service and forcing more traffic onto the highway?"" asked Stewart Low, a Guilford resident who commutes to Norwalk via the Shore Line East train and Metro-North. ""I think not.""
\
Karyl Lee Hall, a staff attorney with the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, told lawmakers that rail service reduces congestion on the highways that could threaten the area's economy and environment.
\
""Connecticut has the fourth- worst ozone smog problem in the country, with the most significant source of this problem being automobiles,"" Hall said.
\
Joseph McGee, vice president of public policy for The Business Council of Southwestern Connecticut, said rail links are critical to the revitalization of Bridgeport and New Haven. McGee, a former state commissioner of economic development, also said the state must provide modern mass transit to attract business development and tourism.
\
Rowland wants to increase bus fares 25 percent over two years and eliminate the state-subsidized Waterbury and Danbury lines of Metro-North and the Shoreline East service between New Haven and New London. Each train ride is subsidized by the state -- $18.70 for Shoreline East, $18.29 for the Waterbury line and $6.59 for the Danbury line.
\
""If popular sentiment wishes a gas-tax cut, then let's cut the gas tax. However, let us not imagine that we have also reduced the transportation needs of the state,"" McGee said.

Democratic incumbent Stephen M. Jarmoc is seeking a third term representing the 59th District in the legislature, he announced Monday.
\
Jarmoc said his experience in the Capitol has positioned him to be particularly effective during another term.
\
""You learn a lot about the process in four years, and you develop a camaraderie with other legislators -- both Democrats and Republicans -- that you need to accomplish things,"" Jarmoc said.
\
Jarmoc was an Enfield council member and deputy mayor before being elected in 1992 to the 59th House District, which covers sections of Enfield and Somers. He now serves as co-chairman of the legislature's public safety committee and also serves on the environment committee and the committee on internships.
\
""Steve is one of the rising stars in Hartford,"" said Jack Mancuso, chairman of the Enfield Democratic Town Committee. ""He's a young legislator who is gaining respect in Hartford and taking care of the taxpayers back home at the same time.""
\
Jarmoc, a 34-year-old Enfield tobacco farmer, said cutting Connecticut's gas tax would be a chief priority if he is re-elected in November.
\
""It has to be a real reduction, whether it's 4 cents, 5 cents, 8 cents -- those are the numbers that it will have to come down in order to make us more competitive with Massachusetts,"" he said.
\
Gas stations, and perhaps retailers, in Connecticut's border towns are suffering because of the tax imbalance that puts Massachusetts' gas prices substantially lower, he said.
\
""When we visit my wife's parents in Massachusetts, it's amazing the number of cars with Connecticut plates that are at those stations,"" Jarmoc said. ""If we could produce those same prices, it would be an incentive to Connecticut people to stay here. They might even shop here more.""
\
Jarmoc also said he'd be vigilant in keeping state government from building more prisons in north central Connecticut.
\
""Our area is doing its fair share. We have to maintain control in those institutions rather than build new ones,"" he said.
"
110,"
With the state budget in the red and federal aid at risk of plunging in two years, how will Connecticut maintain its highways and expand its mass transit network?
\
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy on Monday told a transportation forum that Connecticut needs to come up with answers.
\
""Addressing Connecticut's transportation challenges is key to growing our economy, creating jobs, and making the state more competitive,"" Malloy said. ""Fewer [federal] dollars will be coming to our state. What do we do about falling gas tax revenues? How do we build out Route 11 or the 395 interchange or the widening of 95 in the eastern part of the state?""
\
At least part of the answer is to find ways to draw revenue from successful private development around new transit stations as they're built, the governor said.
\
""Transit-oriented development is here to stay,"" Malloy said, drawing applause from the audience of regional planners, construction industry representatives and transit and affordable-housing advocates.
\
State Transportation Commissioner James Redeker repeated a warning that his predecessors have issued for the past several years: Connecticut has a backlog of more than $3 billion worth of bridge, highway and transit system repairs without money to pay for it. Conditions are on track to get worse after 2014, the expiration of a stopgap transportation bill that Congress reluctantly approved this year.
\
""There's a funding dilemma coming,"" Redeker said.
\
Estimates suggest Connecticut could lose about a third of its annual $486 million federal highway aid after 2014. Much of that money goes to massive road and bridge projects, such as the Q Bridge replacement in New Haven. Connecticut faces more big-ticket expenses in the coming decade, such as replacing the I-84 viaduct in Hartford and the elevated I-84 and Route 8 interchange in Waterbury. ""Those are multiple billions of dollars,"" Redeker said.
\
""Fifty years ago we built a lot of stuff with a 50-year life span,"" said Lyle Wray, executive director of the Capitol Region Council of Governments. ""Now we're having to pay the piper.""
\
Virtually all of the options for raising more money are politically unpopular, the forum participants acknowledged. But levying highway tolls, raising the state gas tax or passing a supplemental gas tax still have to be considered, they said.
\
""We're going to have to develop new revenue sources. I think we have to look at tolling,"" said Emil Frankel, former state transportation commissioner. ""Connecticut is going to have to get over this aversion to direct user fees -- it's the only way we'll be able to move forward with major projects.""
\
The New-Britain-to-Hartford busway and the proposed Springfield-Hartford-New Haven commuter rail line will create opportunities for developers to build relatively high-density housing near stations to accommodate young workers and empty-nesters, several speakers emphasized. The state can help coordinate that development and adopt policies that allow more public-private financing to relieve the strain on taxpayers, they said.
\
Along those lines, Malloy announced that he's forming a ""working group"" run by Redeker, the Office of Policy and Management and the commissioners of economic development, energy and economic development.
\
""With two major transit lines in the works, Connecticut is in great position to begin implementing transit-oriented development,"" said Roger Reynolds, senior attorney for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment.
\
""It's imperative that we work with our state and federal officials to find new [funding] sources as soon as possible,"" said Karen Burnaska, coordinator of Transit for Connecticut. ""If we don't our roads, bridges and transit lines will suffer.""

111,"
Gov. M. Jodi Rell's proposal to boost Connecticut's bus and train fares is drawing protests from commuter councils and transit advocates, who call it a disguised tax and an unreasonable burden on workers, low-income residents and the disabled.
\
They're taking their case to the Democratic-dominated General Assembly, and are rallying transit riders to lobby lawmakers before they set a new budget.
\
""If the legislature approves the fare increase there will be public hearings, but they'll be a meaningless, moot exercise. If you oppose a fare hike, call your state lawmakers now,"" Jim Cameron, chairman of the Metro-North Commuter Council, wrote this week on his ""Talking Transportation"" blog.
\
Rell is seeking to raise Metro-North fares by 10 percent and CT Transit bus fares by 40 percent, a move that she projects would shave $45 million from Connecticut's projected $8 billion deficit for the next two years.
\
Cameron calls it a violation of Rell's promise not to create new taxes, and cautioned that ""a fare hike now is a tax on commuters and another disincentive to live or work in Connecticut.""
\
In letters this week to lawmakers, the Transit for Connecticut Coalition argues that ""bus transit is essential to improving Connecticut's economy and environment"" and asks them to block Rell's CT Transit proposal. The coalition includes 14 agencies and planning organizations, including the Connecticut League of Women Voters, AARP, Connecticut Fund for the Environment and the Business Council of Fairfield County.
\
Rell's staff defends the increases as necessary because the state's transportation fund is on track to run a deficit by 2011. The fund is heavily dependent on gas tax receipts, which have fallen steeply this year. The General Assembly this spring talked about adopting a congestion pricing system of highway tolls, but met public opposition and did not put forward legislation.
\
""Fare increases are always a last resort, especially in these economic times. But the simple fact of the matter is that both Metro-North and CT Transit are running deficits and the money is needed to keep the Special Transportation Fund balanced,"" said Rich Harris, a spokesman for the governor.
\
Rell's proposal would boost the cost of local bus trips from $1.25 to $1.75, and add 10 percent across the board to Metro-North fares.
\
The Special Transportation Fund covered more than $250 million in subsidies for mass transit last year, according to the governor's office. Metro-North's fare box revenue totaled $240 million last year, compared with $387 million in operating expenses, Harris said. CT Transit collected $40 million in fares, but spent $160 million on operations.
\
Transit advocates have said that raising the gas tax a penny a gallon could generate as much as Rell's fare hikes.
\
Nationally, transit systems have been handling sharply increased demand in the past year, but also running into budget gaps. Many cities have warned of service cutbacks as well as fare increases. New York City is raising bus and subway fares by about 10 percent, and Dallas is charging about 20 percent more for bus and light rail rides.
\
The federal stimulus funding for mass transit has been directed toward infrastructure improvements, fleet acquisition and similar one-time expenses, not operating subsidies.

\
Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling: The state Supreme Court has ruled that the Hartford schools are unconstitutionally segregated and has ordered the state to come up with a solution. What remedy do you favor to correct this?
\
Peter Metz
\
Segregation is less of an impediment to equal access to quality education than poverty, inadequate preschool preparation, negative learning incentives outside of school and lack of family involvement. Accordingly, the long-term solution lies in agressive measures to improve the urban environment and encourage the return of businesses and homeowner-taxpayers to the city. I support early intervention programs, preschool learning incentives, interdistrict programs proposed by the statewide ""diversity"" panels and public school choice on a pilot basis.
\
Todd R. Foust
\
I favor concepts such as magnet schools. Parents will want to send their children to a school that offers an excellent education.
\
Gas tax: The legislature failed to enact a bill to cut the state's gasoline tax -- the highest in the nation -- after lawmakers could not agree on how the cut should be paid for. The tax, now 38 cents a gallon, is scheduled to increase to 39 cents a gallon by Jan. 1. Do you support cutting the gasoline tax? If so, how far should it be reduced and how would you pay for it?
\
Peter Metz
\
I will support a reduction of not more than 10 cents in the next legislative session. Reduced spending and transfer of ""inappropriate"" transportation expenditures back to the general fund will support the rollback. Shifting the burden of the gas tax to the income tax -- or any other tax -- is unacceptable.
\
Todd R. Foust
\
Our gas tax should be less than or equal to rates of surrounding states. It will take a combination of a tax shift from another source and spending reductions.
\
Privatization: Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
Peter Metz
\
I support privatization of certain government functions, mostly those involving limited, finite projects, or those that require skills or equipment not practically maintained in the state work force. Some charter schools or specialized prisons could appropriately be run privately, but I would not support privatization of our entire public education or prison systems.
\
Todd R. Foust
\
I do not support privatization. It's an attempt to take decent well-paying jobs away from people in the interest of short- term profits.
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Peter Metz
\
I will work with the governor to reduce the income tax so long as it does not interfere with reductions previously enacted but not yet implemented in corporate, succession and hospital taxes. Property tax relief is a high priority and can be accomplished through mandate reduction, increased funding for education and full state funding of special education, road aid and other obligations.
\
Todd R. Foust
\
High property taxes have made it difficult for young people and people on fixed incomes to live in places like Madison, he says. They are also driving businesses out of the state. The cost of mandates should be shifted to the state. Foust also calls for effective restrictions on new unfunded mandates, and a systematic review of existing mandates to eliminate those that are unnecessary.

SHEFF VS. O'NEILL RULING:
\
The state Supreme Court has ruled that the Hartford schools are unconstitutionally segregated and has ordered the state to come up with a solution. What remedy do you favor to correct this?
\
The Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling invalidated the state statute which provides that each town may have its own local public school district. That ruling effectively gives the State Board of Education more control over the operation of local public schools. For that reason, I believe that we should change state law to provide the popular election of the members of the State Board of Education, who are currently appointed by the Governor. I also favor legislation authorizing towns to voluntarily form inter-town regional school districts to operate public schools within their area.
\
GAS TAX:
\
The legislature failed to enact a bill to cut the state's gasoline tax -- the highest in the nation -- after lawmakers could not agree on how the cut should be paid for. The tax, now 38 cents a gallon, is scheduled to increase to 39 cents a gallon by Jan. 1. Do you support cutting the gasoline tax? If so, how far should it be reduced and how would you pay for it?
\
Cutting the gasoline tax should be our top budgeting priority, and it should be achieved by achieving greater efficiency in our spending in the transportation sector.
\
PRIVATIZATION:
\
Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
With the privatizing of the state lottery already started, I believe that our next frontier in privatizing state services should be our state prison and jail system. While insisting on appropriate quality control standards, our state government, I believe, may be able to achieve major cost- savings by soliciting bids from private contractors to operate our system of several state prisons and jails. So long as suitable quality control standards are enforced, I would not expect there to be any significant loss of job opportunities for career penal officers who would still be needed to work for the private contractors.
\
TAX RELIEF:
\
Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Cutting the state income tax should also be pursued by seeking greater efficiency in our spending in non-transportation areas. The property tax burden can also be alleviated by tightened and more efficient state controls in public education spending resulting from Sheff vs. O'Neill reforms.

Sheff vs. O'Neill
\
As the dust settles on the 1997 General Assembly, mermories of the endless hearings of the six month session and the frantic dash to its adjournment deadline at midnight Wednesday will fade quickly. History will remember the winners and the losers.
\
WINNERS:
\
Gov. John G. Rowland
\
He won a narrow victory in the last minute budget deal to create a new Department of Information Technology, a massive effort to privatize the state's executive branch computer and telecommunications systems. Democrats and labor unions had sought bills that would have blocked Rowland's ability to arrange a potential $1 billion contract, over at least five years, with a private company to consolidate and operate the computers. But It was a narrow victory for Rowland: To keep his initiative on track, he ended up giving the legislature the right to reject the proposed contract by a 60 percent vote of either legislative chamber. It is no coincidence that the Democrats control more than 60 percent of the House, so the big battle may still be ahead.
\
Democratic leaders
\
House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter and Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan, two moderate Democrats, formed an uneasy alliance and came away with veto power of the computer privatization proposal, and a low-growth budget that restores funding for key Democratic constituencies, including education, the environment and those who use mass transportaion. The budget also calls for property tax cuts that Democrats have long sought, as well as income tax cuts sought by Rowland and gas tax cuts sought by everyone. Ritter also won approval of a measure to advance the cause of early childhood education, which he has championed for years. House Majority Leader Moira K. Lyons, D-Stamford, who risked her poltical prestige -- and a likely run for House Speaker in 1999 -- by successfully pushing for the difficult-to-achieve managed care reform bill.
\
Hartford schools
\
The state took over the city's school board, naming a new board of trustees who assumed control June 1.
\
HMO patients/breast cancer patients
\
A wide-ranging managed care reform bill passed, expanding consumer protections by adding an independent appeals process for those denied care and prohibiting `gag' rules that prevent doctors from discussing certain treatment options with patients. The state also banned so-called `drive-through' mastectomies, ensuring breast cancer sufferers a 48-hour minimum stay in a hospital after surgery.
\
Gas Station Owners
\
After lobbying for two years, they finally got a cut in the state's highest-in-the-nation gasoline tax; the budget-and-tax package adopted by the legislature cuts the gas tax by 3 cents July 1 and another 3 cents in July 1998.
\
Children
\
Expansion of school readiness and child-care programs. Expansion of Megan's Law to ensure that sexual offenders convicted before 1995 register with police. Tougher criminal penalties for those who leave their children unsupervised. Legislature outlawed baby-selling, making the tranfer of a child for money a felony.
\
Workers Compensation Recipients
\
Cost of living adjustments were restored for widows, widowers, orphans and the permanently disabled who lost the adjustments upon the passage of wide-ranging workers' comp reforms in 1993.
\
UConn football fans
\
In a classic legislative tradition, lawmakers voted on one issue and found out that they had voted on another. As time was running out, legislators approved on House Bill 5186, whose title was ""An Act Concerning the Membership and Scope of the Gas Turbine Task Force.""
\
It turns out that section 34 of the gas-turbine bill called for a study of building an open-air football stadium for the UConn team. The study must be completed by Sept. 15.
\
LOSERS:
\
Sheff plaintiffs
\
Lawyers who brought a lawsuit over school desegregation were unhappy with the legislature's response, which adds schools programs for young children, preserves a 30-year voluntary busing program in Hartford, pays for a handful of new regional schools and hands the state Department of Education the task of assessing the inequalities between school districts and drafting a five-year plan to eliminate them.
\
Clarence Jackson
\
The 24-year-old Hamden man came up a loser again as Senate leaders opted to not vote on an amendment that would have granted him $5.8 million in lottery winnings that he claimed a few days too late.
\
Drivers
\
A measure to increase the speed limit to 65 mph and reduce speeding fines crashed in the General Assembly in the final days of the session. In addition to that, motorists won't get the 8-cents per gallon gas tax cut that a task force on the issue had recommended.
\
Electric consumers
\
One of the session's biggest bills -- to deregulate the state's electric power industry and let people choose their electric providers -- was not voted on in either chamber after the Senate pulled the plug on the bill.
\
Many blamed Sen. Melodie Peters, D-Waterford, the bill's chief sponsor, who withdrew it abruptly after concluding it was too complicated to complete this year. Critics accused Peters of caving in to pressure from the state's main electric provider, Northeast Utilities, which also happens to be the biggest employer and taxpayer in Peters' hometown. Peters denied that and said a reworked version of the bill will be reintroduced next year.
\
State prison employees
\
The Senate dealt a blow to the union by rejecting, in a 24 to 12 vote, a five-year arbitrated award that would have provided union members with retroactive pay raises. Instead, the legislature approved a seven-year contract, giving union members signing bonuses, or lump sum payments, in lieu of retroactive pay raises. The contract also gives members three percent raises each of the budget years between 1997 and 2001.
\
Organized labor
\
Failed in its effort to win passage of ""corporate responsibility"" legislation that would have placed higher standards on the behavior of companies doing business with the state; unions also sought unsuccessfully to include a total no-layoff provision in the new early-retirement plan, and to block Rowland's computer-privatization plan, which survived. Unions' losses were mitigated, however, by limitations on Rowland prerogatives, such as the provision that Rowland can only lay off employees in a financial crisis. Also, the computer-privatization was subjected to oversight by lawmakers.
\
Campaign-finance and ethics laws
\
First, the House knocked down the big campaign-reform measure of the session, which would have established a public-financing system for top statewide campaings, starting in 2002. Then, in the final days, the Senate failed to take up even the weaker remnants of the tattered bill that the House had approved.
\
Also lost in the final shuffle was a bill that would further restrict gifts, food, and drink that lawmakers can accept.
"
115," Finally, Democrats say, they have found the key to unlock an electoral victory this fall: rail incessantly at Republicans for high gasoline prices.\ But the GOP is fighting back hard. The Republican-dominated Senate is likely to consider sweeping energy legislation next week. Wednesday, the House passed GOP-authored legislation to outlaw gasoline price-gouging.\ Democrats say Republicans are jumping belatedly on the bandwagon.\ ""It's taken Democrats eight months to finally convince the Republican leadership to pass a gas-gouging bill,"" said Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich.\ Democrats view the high price of oil as the elusive political gold the party has sought all year.\ ""This issue alone will determine the election this fall,"" said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.\ Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., explained why: ""Oil is a metaphor for what's wrong with the people in charge. It's cronyism, it's incompetence.""\ But experts say this issue also could fade for the Democrats, in much the same way as previous ""Big Ones,"" including lax port security, government response to Hurricane Katrina, lobbyist scandals, immigration policy and Donald Rumsfeld's Pentagon stewardship.\ ""Public opinion is responsive to prices,"" said Carroll Doherty, editor at the Pew Research Center, so if oil prices tumble this summer, the political debate could again move on.\ For now, Democrats are eagerly oil-dependent. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., Thursday joined with colleagues to present a comprehensive package of reforms, including a requirement to cut in half by 2036 U.S. dependence on oil and to provide federal tax incentives for fuel efficiency. The plan, which has some GOP backing, is expected to be debated in the full Senate next week.\ In the House, Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-3rd District, is pushing legislation requiring oil firms to open their books to government investigators, and Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, has three bills to help consumers.\ But most notably, Democrats plan to keep talking about how much they care about consumers. ""People want to know you get it,"" Dodd said.\ The party is trying to use a strategy that has proved highly useful in modern elections: Find one issue the public cares about intensely and own it.\ In 1968, for instance, the GOP won the White House by stressing ""law and order,"" a catchphrase with a lot of meanings.\ The phrase ""symbolized unease about changing social values, drug use, crime, the sexual revolution and changes in family relations,"" said Michael Flamm, chairman of the history department at Ohio Wesleyan University.\ ""It became important for politicians to speak in shorthand and tell voters they stood for traditional values,"" said Flamm, author of ""Law and Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s.""\ Democrats prospered in 1974 and 1976 as the party that would clean up government in the wake of Watergate.\ In 1982, recalled Karlyn H. Bowman, political analyst at Washington's American Enterprise Institute, Democrats scored big gains in Congress by blaming Republicans for the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression.\ And in 1994, Republicans preyed on public unease with the new Clinton administration, particularly its efforts to reform health care and confusion over crime policies, by crafting the easily understood ""Contract with America."" The GOP won control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.\ Democrats today see their best opening in years to wrest back control, and have seized on one issue after another in an attempt to ignite political momentum.\ Energy resonates like nothing else, Bowman said, because ""it's personal.""\ ""The rise in energy prices has crystallized concern about economic security in a major way,"" added Flamm.\ GOP politicians have no intention of yielding exclusive rights to the issue to Democrats.\ ""If you don't like Big Oil, support this bill,"" Rep. John M. Shimkus, R-Ill., urged colleagues in the House when the price- gouging bill came up for a vote.\ In Connecticut, Alan Schlesinger, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has called for Congress to immediately suspend the 18.4- cent-a-gallon federal gas tax.\ Schlesinger said he even would consider supporting a refinery in Connecticut, an unlikely development, if one were proposed.\ Gov. M. Jodi Rell has taken a different approach, calling on Exxon to return some profits to consumers.\ Independent political analysts say it's too soon to say with any certainty whether oil will be the issue that matters most this fall. Polls still show the Iraq war as by far the most pressing matter on voters' minds, with others lagging well behind.\ Although polls show that voters blame all incumbents, from both parties, for a wide range of policy problems, including energy, the dominant GOP has the most to worry about if oil remains the political focus.\ ""No one can look at gasoline prices now,"" said G. Terry Madonna, director of Pennsylvania's Keystone Poll, ""and say this is a good environment for the Republican Party."""
116,"
In 2004, writer David Owen wrote a piece for The New Yorker magazine that knocked conventional environmental thinking on its ear. His thesis was that if you look at what's important - the amount of fossil fuels burned per capita - the greenest city in the country, far and away, is New York, N.Y. Loud, smelly, gritty Gotham, the Big Apple, is greener than Portland, Seattle, Austin or anywhere in Vermont.
\
I happened to run into Owen at a conference earlier this year, and he said he had expanded the magazine piece into a book. I wished him well but wondered if there was enough more to say to fill a book.
\
There is. He did. ""Green Metropolis - What the City Can Teach the Country About True Sustainability""(Riverhead Books) is a marvelously clear-eyed analysis of the growing energy/ environmental crisis.
\
""Every serious discussion of the environment . . . is ultimately about oil, whether it specifically mentions oil or not,"" Owen writes. The explosive growth and general prosperity of the past century have been made possible by the ""prodigious abundance"" of oil; the problems of the coming century will involve ""oil's increasing scarcity and cost.""
\
Owen is not a crank or true believer about peak oil; he reports that the decline of oil production has been predicted for nearly a century. He looks at what we know for sure: However much oil is left, it's being used up at a rate of about 350 billion gallons a day; it's getting more expensive to produce; and demand is growing as China and India push ahead to repeat America's mistakes.
\
About two-thirds of all the oil produced in the U.S. and Canada goes to transportation, mainly cars, ""a use for which there is currently no attractive fuel substitute.""
\
And it's not just the Hummer in the driveway, Owen observes, it's everything the Hummer makes possible - sprawl and its duplication of the built environment, oversized houses and irrigated lawns, added roads, costly extension of the power grid, 100-mile commutes, etc.
\
This whole way of life is dependent on cheap oil. Sooner or later, cheap oil will be over. Then what?
\
Make no mistake, it is going to be really, really hard to change, to restructure the American lifestyle. We like it and don't want to hear the clock strike 12. Most Americans are at least vaguely aware that importing foreign oil has a downside, yet continue to buy cars that are too big and to drive them too fast.
\
And it's not just cars: Petroleum products are part of the cost of everything we buy and do - plastics, food products, clothing, etc. We're not taking a little gasoline with dinner, we are pounding it back all day. Owen convincingly dismisses the notion that ethanol, fuel cells, solar panels or other alternatives are even remotely ready to fill the coming energy void. People who put solar panels on the roof of a 7,000-square-foot house are kidding.
\
The one thing offering any serious hope for a plausible future in the age of less oil is living more densely, as we did before the age of cheap oil.
\
Extraordinary compactness is why New York City is so green. Manhattan has 67,000 people per square mile, more than 800 times the national average. Eighty-two percent of employed Manhattanites travel to work by transit, bike or on foot, 10 times the national average. If New York City became the 51st state, it would rank 51st in per capita energy use.
\
So, Owen reasons, maybe it's time to revise the long-held notion that cities are part of the problem. Sure, their streets are congested. Congestion, however, is a driving problem but an environmental asset when it encourages people to use transit. Indeed, anything that is encouraging more driving isn't helping the environment (He notes that the HOV lane on I-84 east of Hartford is a ""good example of a bad idea."").
\
We've thought without really thinking that a cabin in the woods of Vermont is much greener than an apartment in New York. Not so. Apartment buildings, with shared walls, are among the most energy-efficient buildings in the world, especially in cities where residents take transit. Unfortunately, even environmental groups don't get this.
\
Owen reports that the headquarters of the highly respected Rocky Mountain Institute is built on virgin and fragile land 7,100 feet above sea level in Snowmass, Colo., in a thinly populated area that necessitates a lot of driving by employees and visitors. This is sprawl. Move to Denver.
\
At some point soon, we need to shift settlement patterns so we can ""live smaller and live closer."" To get started, we might take a lesson from the 2008 gas price spike. When gas hit $4 a gallon, people stopped buying gas guzzlers, stopped much casual air travel and started using transit.
\
""Money really does talk . . . people do what they are given incentives to do,"" Owen rightly observes.
\
So, if our leaders have the will, we should think about some form of additional taxation of fuels, and put the money toward better transit. We should line up the incentives with the policy goals; if New Yorkers are using less electricity, don't charge them more for it. I would add, don't raise the train fare, raise the gas tax. You want people to take the train.
\
We must create good buildings and other incentives to bring people into cities and town centers. Owen and his wife moved from Manhattan to northwestern Connecticut (Washington) and they like it here. What he liked about Manhattan were second-run movie theaters and pretty good restaurants. That makes eateries and theaters tools of smart growth. Things that make long drives tolerable - books on tape, Starbucks drive-throughs, electronic toll collection - are environmental liabilities. Did I mention that it is going to be hard to change?
\
But not impossible. We can create more density in center cities; most of Connecticut's large cities have been doing it for a decade or more. It's also possible to have appealing density in small cities and towns. I was in Provincetown in the early fall, a lovely place with a lot of gorgeous small houses, compactly arranged. When the shops closed at 5 p.m., I was pleasantly surprised to watch so many workers walk home.

\
Sheff vs. O'Neill ruling: The state Supreme Court has ruled that the Hartford schools are unconstitutionally segregated and has ordered the state to come up with a solution. What remedy do you favor to correct this?
\
Anthony J. Pecoraro
\
The state legislation will not come up with a remedy in regards to Sheff vs. O'Neill. This is a complicated issue dealing with children whose values for education have not been developed. It is also an issue that is money related. As has happened throughout the country, forced anything never had a successful solution. I would urge that a panel of justices and members of the state Judiciary Committee bring about a solution which would order enactment.
\
John J. Mitchell
\
This will be a top issue in the state legislature. I will work with the governor and legislator toward a solution that will provide incentives for parental involvement and defend high academic standards: as long as it does not jeopardize the safety or quality education for South Windsor students. Against forced busing as a solution.
\
Nancy E. Kerensky
\
The legislature has already established a range of voluntary options in the form of Project Concern, magnet schools and charter schools. These should be fully implemented and their effectiveness carefully evaluated. The real issue is performance. Since school performance is directly related to parental involvement and support, these options allow optimal results for all participants.
\
Gas tax: The legislature failed to enact a bill to cut the state's gasoline tax -- the highest in the nation -- after lawmakers could not agree on how the cut should be paid for. The tax, now 38 cents a gallon, is scheduled to increase to 39 cents a gallon by Jan. 1. Democrats said they could cut the gas tax to 32 cents a gallon by 1998 by raising income taxes on the wealthiest 13 percent of wage earners, while Republicans said a similar rollback could be accomplished through unspecified reductions in spending. Do you support cutting the gasoline tax? If so, how far should it be reduced and how would you pay for it?
\
Anthony J. Pecoraro
\
I would not support cutting the current gax tax, however, I would not increase it by any amount from its current level. The state DOT has done a miserable job in administering not only state but local projects. There is sufficient funding both from federal as well as state taxes to continue, and maintain present, and future projects, by eliminating waste, at the DOT and local level.
\
John J. Mitchell
\
Part of reducing Connecticut's high tax burden starts with cutting the gasoline tax. This tax should in no way be any more than the average state tax on gasoline of all other New England states. Cuts in spending (significant) would make this possible to offset revenue loss.
\
Nancy E. Kerensky
\
I fully support cutting the gas tax 8 cents over the next three to four years. The reduced revenues would pay only to fund road and bridge improvements as originally intended. Operating expenses for Department of Motor Vehicles and state police will back into the general fund. We will pay off transportation bonds with the special transportation fund surplus so we don't have to raise taxes to cover the debt.
\
Privatization: Gov. Rowland has proposed privatizing some state services, such as prisons and schools, but apart from converting the state lottery into a quasi-governmental agency, very little privatization has actually taken place. Supporters say privatization could increase efficiency and reduce waste, but opponents say it is a thinly disguised union-busting effort that could cost jobs and lead to the elimination of some necessary services. Do you support privatizing state services? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?
\
Anthony J. Pecoraro
\
I would support privatizing some state functions. The privatization of those would include the prison system, the elimination of the DOT over the period of five years through a bidding process of selected areas or departments. I would also eliminate the Department of Administrative Services by privatizing its bidding as well as administrative duties and returning authorities to local government.
\
John J. Mitchell
\
Taxpayers should get the best out of their tax dollars. Any effort to privatize should be tempered by a full and complete financial analysis of the cost effectiveness and benefits to be derived. Full consideration should be first given to long and valued state employees before any attempt to privatize is initiated.
\
Nancy E. Kerensky
\
Our goal should be efficiency and waste reduction, but that does not require privatization. We need to provide the opportunity for the actual service providers and the unions to become partners in determining the procedures for maintaining services while reducing costs.
\
Tax relief: Gov. Rowland has made cutting the state income tax a top priority since taking office last year, and has promised to eliminate it by 1999. Meanwhile, Democrats say cutting local property taxes would do more to help the state's struggling cities, which on average have a higher tax burden than suburbs. Which tax, the income tax or the property tax, do you think is more onerous, and which would you work to decrease? How would you do that?
\
Anthony J. Pecoraro
\
I would work to decrease the state income tax, which has in many cases not been effective. We have seen government grow instead of being reduced. The state legislature really has no effect on the governing of local property taxes in spite of the redistribution of monies paid by town residents back to town, which is more like a shell game. The communities that pay the most normally receive the least. There must be a balance in funding for all communities, which will establish a greater cooperation between those communities and state government.
\
John J. Mitchell
\
The legislature has already cut the income tax from 4.5 percent to 3 percent for some taxable income. We need to cut the income tax for all Connecticut residents. Cutting the income tax will do the most for our sluggish economy. Property taxes could be reduced by cutting state mandates.
\
Nancy E. Kerensky
\
We should decrease the property tax burdens by continuing to reduce state mandates on towns, providing towns the opportunity to participate in cheaper statewide plans (such as health care) and build on our success in encouraging the growth of small- and medium-sized businesses. Managing and reducing long-term debt is crucial.

\
Taxes: With Connecticut's economy booming, the state government has had budget surpluses each of the past four years. With the current volatility on Wall Street and other global stock markets and the possibility of an economic slowdown in Connecticut, some worry that the state could face a budget deficit in future years. Do you support continued tax cuts in 1999? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Barbara W. Puffer
\
Yes, I support additional tax cuts in 1999. I belive that a key component in facing the challenges of a possible economic downturn is to further strengthen our economic base. Although we have had some cuts, in my opinion, much more needs to be done while times are good. This can be achieved by controlling spending, reducing debt, and improving the efficiency of government.
\
Patricia M. Widlitz
\
During my two terms representing the 98th District, I voted for reductions to the gas tax, income tax, corporate tax and the phasing out of the state's inheritance tax, while eliminating various items from the sales tax, increasing property tax credits and paying down the state debt. This financial package was designed to strengthen our economic base, give families tax relief and encourage our seniors to stay in Connecticut. Revenue from soaring transactions in the finanical markets provided us with record surpluses that cannot be depended upon in the future.
\
Patients' rights: Government regulation of managed care has become a major issue in Connecticut and nationally. Democrats such as gubernatorial candidate Barbara Kennelly and U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd support a ""patients' bill of rights"" that they say would force managed care companies to put patient care ahead of profits. Do you support a patients bill of rights, including the right to sue a managed care company? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Barbara W. Puffer
\
I do support the right of a patient to sue a managed-care company. I agree that it is appropriate that a patient have rights in these matters. No entity should be indemnified of responsibility for negligent actions.
\
Patricia M. Widlitz
\
I do support a patient's bill of rights, including a patient's right to sue when care is denied and there is a negative consequence to the patient. I also support the establishment of a health care advocate based on the model of the child care advocate.
\
Megan's Law: The state has a version of Megan's Law on the books, requiring that sex offenders register with police. A new version of the law, allowing state police to post the name of sex offenders on the Internet, goes into effect Jan. 1. Some lawmakers say the state needs to go further and require widespread community notification when a sex offender moves into a neighborhood. Do you support further expansion of Megan's Law to require community notification? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Barbara W. Puffer
\
I absolutely oppose the argument of privacy for offenders. I view registration as a necessary public safety step and a component of a convicted offender's penalty. I will continue to vote for the strengthening of laws against those who would do harm to our children. My opponent voted against the current version of Megan's Law.
\
Patricia M. Widlitz
\
Rather than further expansion of Megan's law, I support a stronger law. The recent legislation expanded the list of offenders to such an extent that it would require registration of a 17-year-old consensually touching the intimate parts of a 15-year-old friend without engaging in intercourse. Are these the names we really need to have on the Internet for 10 years? Including so many offenses on the list runs the risk of diluting the effect of having truly dangerous people registered.
\
Environmental protection: Kennelly and some employees at the state Department of Environmental Protection have complained that, under Gov. John Rowland, the agency has not been enforcing environmental regulations stringently enough. Rowland and DEP Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque deny that. Do you believe the DEP adequately enforces environmental regulations? If so, do you think criticism of the DEP is valid? If you do not think enforcement is satisfactory, do you think legislation is needed to ensure that it improves?
\
Barbara W. Puffer
\
Preservation of our environment is a family issue for me. We are boaters on {Long Island} Sound and belong to the West Lake Civic Association, Guilford Agricultural Society, Faulkner's Light Brigade and Guilford Land Conservation Trust. My husband is an active sportsman, Guilford's shellfish warden and a shellfish commissioner. I believe that environmental protection efforts can co-exist with increased recreational facilities and sound economic development.
\
Patricia M. Widlitz
\
In an effort to ""streamline"" government and to be more business friendly, tremendous pressures have been brought to bear on the employees of the DEP. It is not in anyone's best interest to shift employees' efforts to speed up permitting at the expense of the enforcement division. The agency needs to be better funded with a stronger focus on enforcement.
"
119,"
The Governor's Budget
\
Correction ran February 15, 1997 on Page A2. * A section in a chart on Page A15 Friday about Gov. John G. Rowland's budget proposal dealing with the Department of Mental Retardation was incorrectly labeled ``Mental Health.''
\
Prisons/Public safety:
\
The Department of Correction would eliminate 146 positions, and transfer 330 inmates out of state, by closing the Northeast Correctional Institution in Storrs; shut down the correction-run fire department at the prison complex in Enfield and Somers, where town fire companies would assume that role; and cut 35 administrative jobs at department headquarters. Overall, corrections spending would drop four percent, to $394 million.
\
At the Department of Public Safety, the governor would provide $4.65 million over two years to fund three state police classes, to lessen the impact of an expected wave of early retirements. Overall public safety spending would increase about two percent, to $106 million.
\
The politics: Corrections, which accounts for more than eight percent of state spending, has been a popular target for cutbacks since Rowland took office. Last year, Commissioner John J. Armstrong recorded a $46 million budget surplus and reduced year-to-year spending for the first time since the 1970s.
\
This time around, department management found itself struggling to match its own prior successes -- Armstrong recently remarked in frustration that the governor's budget-makers expect a repeat performance. On the upside for the commissioner, the department's belt-tightening has weakened calls for wholesale prison privatization, and with that volatile issue on the back burner, he is more likely to find legislative support for the low-profile, piecemeal cuts Rowland proposes.
\
The prognosis: Look for union resistance.
\
Privatization:
\
The governor has proposed to transfer a number of government functions to private companies. Among them:
\
DATA PROCESSING: Much of the state's largely-fragmented computer system would be placed with a private vendor, which would be overseen by a new state Department of Information Technology. Rowland argues that the government has proved it cannot handle this function as efficiently as the private sector. Savings estimate: $50 million
\
MENTAL HEALTH: Operation of 22 group homes, now financed by the state Department of Mental Retardation, would be turned over to the private sector. Some staff from these state-operated group homes would be transferred to the Southbury Training School. Savings estimate: $1.6 million.
\
HEALTH SERVICES: Competitive bidding of prescription drugs for all ConnPACE and Medicaid recipients not in a managed care plan, removing the state as middleman. Competitive bidding to move about one-third of Medicaid recipients into managed care plans. Contract with private health maintenance organizations for more than 200,000 recipients of Temporary Family Assistance. Estimated savings from bidding prescription drugs is $25.1 million in fiscal year 1997-98, and $27.2 million in fiscal year 1998-99.
\
Other areas of privatization include portions of the state driving test, as well as certain automobile safety inspections: Child support collections for clients not on Temporary Family Assistance.
\
The politics: Look for skepticism and resistance on several fronts from Democrats, who hold sway in both the House and Senate and are not by nature privatizing types. Democrats will be careful to say they will consider any proposal that will save taxpayers' money -- but, in general, they listen more than Republicans to state labor unions, who strenuously oppose privatization moves.
\
The prognosis: A tough sell, but a good bargaining chip for Democrats.
\
Transportation:
\
Connecticut Transit bus fares would increase 15 percent on July 1, from $1 to $1.15 and would go to $1.25 on July 1, 1998.
\
The governor also would discontinue the Shoreline East, Waterbury and Danbury rail lines and replace them with bus services along similiar routes. Savings estimate: $7.6 million in year one, and $9 million in year two. By eliminating the rail lines, the state will not have to pay what the Governor considers ""exorbitant"" rail subsidies per passenger that the state now covers.
\
The politics: No consensus was apparent Thursday on the bus fares. House speaker Thomas D. Ritter, a Hartford Democrat, questioned the proposed hikes as counter to the effort to promote mass transit. But lawmakers have not balked in recent years at requiring more from the largely urban riders of public transportation. Eelimination of Shoreline East is highly unlikely, members of both parties said. Rep. Robert Simmons, R-Stonington, ranking member of transportation committee, and other GOP lawmakers from the shoreline led the fight to restore Shoreline East two years ago and Simmons said he will do so again. ""One of the reasons we worked so hard to restore {funding for} Shoreline East two years ago, was so we can reduce traffic on I-95,"" he said. ""If you terminate that service, effectively you put people back on the highways, and that's not a step in the right direction.""
\
The Prognosis: Fare hikes may get a big ride; Shoreline East stays on track.
\
Environment:
\
The budget proposal cuts spending on the Department of Environmental Protection by 2.9 percent in the coming year.
\
Among the biggest cuts: $500,000 from an allocation for chemical and oil spill cleanups; $300,000 by reducing the seasonal workers who primarily help maintain state parks; $250,000 by eliminating four regional park managers, and $110,000 by eliminating three land-acquisition staff positions.
\
Rowland would add $650,000 for mosquito control -- including four positions, trapping and testing, and ground and aerial insecticide spraying -- to avoid another Eastern Equine Encephalitis outbreak.
\
The Politics: The environment takes it on the chin in Rowland's budget, critics say. A lower gas tax and higher public transit fares means ""drive your cars, don't take the bus,"" which translates into more air pollution, said Rep. Jessie G. Stratton, D-Canton, co-chairwoman of the legislature's environment committee.
\
Rowland also would cut the DEP's budget and workforce while it is under fire from federal officials and environmentalists for inadequate enforcement of environmental laws, blamed in part on staff shortages. The state also has been criticized for lagging far behind other nearby states in acquiring public land.
\
Rep. Terry Backer, D-Stratford, an environment committee member, said the proposed cuts on emergency spill cleanups ""almost border on environmental irresponsibility and can put the state's residents and resources at risk.""
\
The Prognosis: Look for stiff opposition from the Democrat-controlled environment committee, particularly on cuts in staff and on money for spill cleanups.
\
State employees:
\
The governor proposes to reduce the state payroll by about 4,000 workers over the next two years. He would entice 2,500 to take early retirement, saving the state an estimated $175 million. He plans to reduce the state payroll by an additional 2,000 positions by cutting agency personnel budgets, and if this goal were not met by attrition, his aides say there is always the possibility of layoffs.
\
About 8,500 state workers will be eligible to leave under the proposed early retirement program, and the state expects 30 to 35 percent of those to go. The early retirement package would allow vested state employees to collect better benefits by adding three years to either their ages, or to the number of years they actually have worked. One in five of the state workers who leave under this plan would be replaced.
\
The politics: State employee union leaders say the administration's goals are extravagantly unrealistic, while Rowland's office calls them conservative and practical. Who's wrong? Rowland has little to lose in this one; he has made at least a mini-career of battling the unions, who hold little political leverage over him because they always support his opponents, anyway. If layoffs happen, Rowland can play the tough-decision-maker to a receptive public that believes the state work force has it cushy.
\
The prognosis: Look for changes to the proposal. Democrats who control both legislative chambers will oppose wholesale job cuts.
\
Taxes:
\
The governor's tax proposals include:
\
* A $365-million reduction in the personal income tax by the second year of the two-year budget.
\
* Exempting Social Security checks from the income tax. This change would affect 110,000 taxpayers, Rowland budget officials said, and would amount to an estimated $15 million annually.
\
* A 5-cent-per-gallon cut in the state's highest-in-the-nation gasoline tax of 39 cents per gallon. The proposed cut would amount to $65 million per year.
\
* An increase in the tax on diesel fuel, effective July 1, from the current 18 cents per gallon to 21 cents per gallon, which would equalize it with Massachusetts' and generate an additional $7.5 million annually.
\
* Resinstatement of a tax on the purchase of new automobile tires, which would generate $4 million more annually.
\
* Repeal of a property-tax reduction already on the books, a phased-in cut in motor vehicle taxes approved in 1994 and due to take effect next year.
\
The politics: Rowland wants to cut income taxes: Democrats want to cut local property taxes. That could lead to negotiation -- or strife. Rowland might have to give in on items such as UConn spending, early-childhood education programs and other priorities of Democrats led by Speaker Thomas Ritter in the House and President Pro Tempore Kevin B. Sullivan in the Senate -- both UConn Law alums.
\
The prognosis: They negotiate: They split the difference.
\
Education:
\
In response to the state Supreme Court's Sheff decision, the governor would spend $37 million over the next two years on programs to improve schools in Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven and Waterbury and to reduce racial isolation statewide. The proposal includes $14 million for preschool programs and $5.4 million to expand voluntary busing in Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven. Nearly $13 million would go to create innovative schools and interdistrict programs.
\
The politics: Rowland provided some support for early childhood programs, but far less than what many in the legislature say is needed. Others sharply question paying for the initiative by making cuts in other areas of the budget.
\
The prognosis: A starting point.
"
120,"
The Governor's Budget
\
Prisons/Public safety:
\
The Department of Correction would eliminate 146 positions, and transfer 330 inmates out of state, by closing the Northeast Correctional Institution in Storrs; shut down the correction-run fire department at the prison complex in Enfield and Somers, where town fire companies would assume that role; and cut 35 administrative jobs at department headquarters. Overall, corrections spending would drop four percent, to $394 million.
\
At the Department of Public Safety, the governor would provide $4.65 million over two years to fund three state police classes, to lessen the impact of an expected wave of early retirements. Overall public safety spending would increase about two percent, to $106 million.
\
The politics: Corrections, which accounts for more than eight percent of state spending, has been a popular target for cutbacks since Rowland took office. Last year, Commissioner John J. Armstrong recorded a $46 million budget surplus and reduced year-to-year spending for the first time since the 1970s.
\
This time around, department management found itself struggling to match its own prior successes -- Armstrong recently remarked in frustration that the governor's budget-makers expect a repeat performance. On the upside for the commissioner, the department's belt-tightening has weakened calls for wholesale prison privatization, and with that volatile issue on the back burner, he is more likely to find legislative support for the low-profile, piecemeal cuts Rowland proposes.
\
The prognosis: Look for union resistance.
\
Privatization:
\
The governor has proposed to transfer a number of government functions to private companies. Among them:
\
DATA PROCESSING: Much of the state's largely-fragmented computer system would be placed with a private vendor, which would be overseen by a new state Department of Information Technology. Rowland argues that the government has proved it cannot handle this function as efficiently as the private sector. Savings estimate: $50 million
\
MENTAL HEALTH: Operation of 22 group homes, now financed by the state Department of Mental Retardation, would be turned over to the private sector. Some staff from these state-operated group homes would be transferred to the Southbury Training School. Savings estimate: $1.6 million.
\
HEALTH SERVICES: Competitive bidding of prescription drugs for all ConnPACE and Medicaid recipients not in a managed care plan, removing the state as middleman. Competitive bidding to move about one-third of Medicaid recipients into managed care plans. Contract with private health maintenance organizations for more than 200,000 recipients of Temporary Family Assistance. Estimated savings from bidding prescription drugs is $25.1 million in fiscal year 1997-98, and $27.2 million in fiscal year 1998-99.
\
Other areas of privatization include portions of the state driving test, as well as certain automobile safety inspections: Child support collections for clients not on Temporary Family Assistance.
\
The politics: Look for skepticism and resistance on several fronts from Democrats, who hold sway in both the House and Senate and are not by nature privatizing types. Democrats will be careful to say they will consider any proposal that will save taxpayers' money -- but, in general, they listen more than Republicans to state labor unions, who strenuously oppose privatization moves.
\
The prognosis: A tough sell, but a good bargaining chip for Democrats.
\
Transportation:
\
Connecticut Transit bus fares would increase 15 percent on July 1, from $1 to $1.15 and would go to $1.25 on July 1, 1998.
\
The governor also would discontinue the Shoreline East, Waterbury and Danbury rail lines and replace them with bus services along similiar routes. Savings estimate: $7.6 million in year one, and $9 million in year two. By eliminating the rail lines, the state will not have to pay what the Governor considers ""exorbitant"" rail subsidies per passenger that the state now covers.
\
The politics: No consensus was apparent Thursday on the bus fares. House speaker Thomas D. Ritter, a Hartford Democrat, questioned the proposed hikes as counter to the effort to promote mass transit. But lawmakers have not balked in recent years at requiring more from the largely urban riders of public transportation. Eelimination of Shoreline East is highly unlikely, members of both parties said. Rep. Robert Simmons, R-Stonington, ranking member of transportation committee, and other GOP lawmakers from the shoreline led the fight to restore Shoreline East two years ago and Simmons said he will do so again. ""One of the reasons we worked so hard to restore {funding for} Shoreline East two years ago, was so we can reduce traffic on I-95,"" he said. ""If you terminate that service, effectively you put people back on the highways, and that's not a step in the right direction.""
\
The Prognosis: Fare hikes may get a big ride; Shoreline East stays on track.
\
Environment:
\
The budget proposal cuts spending on the Department of Environmental Protection by 2.9 percent in the coming year.
\
Among the biggest cuts: $500,000 from an allocation for chemical and oil spill cleanups; $300,000 by reducing the seasonal workers who primarily help maintain state parks; $250,000 by eliminating four regional park managers, and $110,000 by eliminating three land-acquisition staff positions.
\
Rowland would add $650,000 for mosquito control -- including four positions, trapping and testing, and ground and aerial insecticide spraying -- to avoid another Eastern Equine Encephalitis outbreak.
\
The Politics: The environment takes it on the chin in Rowland's budget, critics say. A lower gas tax and higher public transit fares means ""drive your cars, don't take the bus,"" which translates into more air pollution, said Rep. Jessie G. Stratton, D-Canton, co-chairwoman of the legislature's environment committee.
\
Rowland also would cut the DEP's budget and workforce while it is under fire from federal officials and environmentalists for inadequate enforcement of environmental laws, blamed in part on staff shortages. The state also has been criticized for lagging far behind other nearby states in acquiring public land.
\
Rep. Terry Backer, D-Stratford, an environment committee member, said the proposed cuts on emergency spill cleanups ""almost border on environmental irresponsibility and can put the state's residents and resources at risk.""
\
The Prognosis: Look for stiff opposition from the Democrat-controlled environment committee, particularly on cuts in staff and on money for spill cleanups.
\
State employees:
\
The governor proposes to reduce the state payroll by about 4,000 workers over the next two years. He would entice 2,500 to take early retirement, saving the state an estimated $175 million. He plans to reduce the state payroll by an additional 2,000 positions by cutting agency personnel budgets, and if this goal were not met by attrition, his aides say there is always the possibility of layoffs.
\
About 8,500 state workers will be eligible to leave under the proposed early retirement program, and the state expects 30 to 35 percent of those to go. The early retirement package would allow vested state employees to collect better benefits by adding three years to either their ages, or to the number of years they actually have worked. One in five of the state workers who leave under this plan would be replaced.
\
The politics: State employee union leaders say the administration's goals are extravagantly unrealistic, while Rowland's office calls them conservative and practical. Who's wrong? Rowland has little to lose in this one; he has made at least a mini-career of battling the unions, who hold little political leverage over him because they always support his opponents, anyway. If layoffs happen, Rowland can play the tough-decision-maker to a receptive public that believes the state work force has it cushy.
\
The prognosis: Look for changes to the proposal. Democrats who control both legislative chambers will oppose wholesale job cuts.
\
Taxes:
\
The governor's tax proposals include:
\
* A $365-million reduction in the personal income tax by the second year of the two-year budget.
\
* Exempting Social Security checks from the income tax. This change would affect 110,000 taxpayers, Rowland budget officials said, and would amount to an estimated $15 million annually.
\
* A 5-cent-per-gallon cut in the state's highest-in-the-nation gasoline tax of 39 cents per gallon. The proposed cut would amount to $65 million per year.
\
* An increase in the tax on diesel fuel, effective July 1, from the current 18 cents per gallon to 21 cents per gallon, which would equalize it with Massachusetts' and generate an additional $7.5 million annually.

* Resinstatement of a tax on the purchase of new automobile tires, which would generate $4 million more annually.
\
* Repeal of a property-tax reduction already on the books, a phased-in cut in motor vehicle taxes approved in 1994 and due to take effect next year.

"
121,"
Last week, state officials asked Connecticut commuters to ride to work with others at least one day next week during the annual ""Ride Together"" promotion.
\
They have conducted similar promotions for five years now. And guess what? When the ride-together campaign was launched in 1988, surveys showed 81 percent of state commuters drove by themselves. This year, their figures show drive-alones are up to 84 percent. (Although according to the 1990 U.S. Census, 78 percent of workers said they drove alone).
\
People obviously aren't listening. ""Ride Together Week,"" which offers a trip to Florida and other prizes, isn't a bad idea, but it doesn't seem to translate by itself into more carpools and increased use of buses.
\
The responsibility, and attendant blame, belongs at all levels: government, business and the public.
\
The state spends nearly $100 million a year to subsidize train and bus transportation. That's not bad. However, during the first eight years of the state's infrastructure repair campaign, capital spending for trains and buses totaled only slightly more than 10 percent of the $6.55 billion allocated for all construction. It should have been more.
\
Some corporations have taken a leading role in promoting ride-sharing, but most don't do enough. Many Hartford companies indirectly encourage driving alone by offering free parking at downtown locations. Some say they would risk losing workers by charging the going rate for prime downtown parking. Tax laws also make it cheaper for an employer to provide free parking than to pay for a monthly bus pass.
\
Stringent requirements in the federal Clean Air Act will restrict the number of single-occupant vehicles allowed at large companies. That will help, but it shouldn't take that kind of prodding.
\
The public's view of ride-sharing and mass transit seems to be similar to its feelings about the environment: Everybody's for it, but who's willing to make the sacrifice?
\
Sacrifice is an important word to consider. For most people, including myself, driving alone is more convenient and offers more freedom. Despite general support for mass transit, most people are unlikely to make the sacrifice, unless they are provided attractive alternatives.
\
Incentives help, but you have to come up with some big pluses to get people to give up their cars and walk a few blocks to a bus stop or submit themselves to the clockwork schedule required for an efficient vanpool.
\
Money is probably the best incentive. If people can save money on gasoline (state law exempts authorized vanpools from the gas tax) or insurance (by listing the cars they wouldn't use for work as pleasure vehicles),they may be persuaded to ride with others.
\
Negative incentives seem to work best, unfortunately. Ridesharing peaked around here when gas prices were at their highest.
\
We also subject transit spending to greater scrutiny. I have received many calls from readers concerned about the costs of train and light-rail systems. But I rarely get complaints when the state spends $100 million to widen a highway.
\
Despite cost concerns, we tend to look for grand, magical solutions, too. The vision of gleaming trains moving down the Griffin Line has more sex appeal than the thought of waiting for a van in a commuter lot.
\
But while trains and light-rail solutions should be considered seriously, it is the less glamorous options -- the carpool, vanpool and bus -- that can be taken advantage of today, using roads that exist right now.
\
The prize here isn't a trip to Florida. But cleaner air and fewer traffic jams aren't a bad consolation.

Although it's not hard for government to waste a billion dollars, I think we'd agree it ought to be avoided wherever possible.
\
Here's such an opportunity. Don't build the Route 11 extension.
\
The proposed superhighway, an eight-mile stretch from Salem to Waterford, is a billion-dollar boondoggle, though the true cost hasn't been revealed to the public.
\
The state's estimate -- $440 million -- falls far short of the truth. When U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta put the project on fast-track status last year, at the request of 2nd District Rep. Rob Simmons, it was $500 million. But even that does not include several major cost outlays including land purchase and construction of the triple-decker interchange to connect Route 11 with I-95 and I-395. These asphalt giants alone have cost $400 million-$700 million in other parts of the country -- areas where labor costs are lower.
\
The existing Route 11, which runs from Colchester to Salem, was originally planned to extend to the shoreline. But in 1972, the state ran out of money. Today, the road is notorious for being almost empty much of the time.
\
So why was it ever built? Legend has it that in the 1960s, Gov. John Dempsey wanted a direct route from Hartford to his beach house. Back then, highways could be planned on a whim. As state Department of Transportation Project Manager Paul Corrente commented recently, ""In the old days, they used to draw a line on a map and start the rights-of-way acquisition. They don't do that anymore.""
\
The unfinished road has been a thorn in the side of the DOT and town officials for many years. Despite unwavering opposition from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the last 20 years, the state doggedly pushes the project. DOT tweaks the proposed alignment of the road year after year in hopes that the EPA will yield, even though that agency has said Route 11 should never receive a Clean Water Act permit because the damage to pristine wetlands and wildlife habitats can never be mitigated adequately.
\
The Sierra Club concurs with EPA and, in addition, is questioning the legality of the process.
\
The club has hired a lawyer to assess whether DOT might be violating the National Environmental Policy Act. By law, agencies contemplating a transportation project must do a thorough analysis of all the alternatives -- no-build, partial-build, upgrade of existing infrastructures, mass transit, full-build. They must choose the ""least environmentally damaging practicable alternative,"" known by the acronym LEDPA. This isn't done by whim. It's the law.
\
In 2001, DOT arbitrarily threw all the alternatives off the table except the full-build. Yet, in its own cost/benefit analysis, the upgrade of nearby Route 85 would meet the purpose and need of the project at a much lower estimated cost of $35 million.
\
Who really wants the Route 11 extension and why? The politically connected road-paving industry? Town officials, because big-box stores at every exit ramp would pay taxes?
\
Or how about Rep. Simmons, because he will bring home the bacon and cut a ribbon in his district? He has also promised to get money for the Route 11 Greenway (preserved land on each side of the highway) claiming this will be the first ""environmental highway"" in the nation. EPA and the Sierra Club aren't buying it.
\
Responds Greg Gardener of the Sierra Club: ""With a highway serving as a nature preserve, there will either be dead wilderness or dead wildlife.""
\
What's wrong with building this new road? The same thing that was wrong with making I-84 east of Hartford a 12-lane megalith sufficient to empty the city in a nanosecond on a good day.
\
It's not needed. It's overkill and a waste of tax money. According to one engineer, the amount of driving time the Route 11 extension will save over Rt. 85 is 10 minutes. Is 10 minutes worth a billion dollars? Should we sacrifice one square foot of open land to get people to the casinos a few minutes faster (because that's what this is really about)?
\
This boondoggle is emblematic of DOT's obsession with pavement at a time when commuters on the Northeast corridor are crammed into filthy rail cars with broken toilets and heating and air conditioning unworthy of a Third World country.
\
Hundreds of miles of underutilized rail lines in Connecticut could give us high-speed commuter rail between Hartford and New York, Providence and Stamford, New London and Worcester, boosting the economy without wrecking the environment Why doesn't DOT consider it?
\
Because the system is rigged. The way we fund transportation investment in America is, and has been for 75 years, skewed toward highway construction only. The federal gas tax goes directly into the Highway Trust Fund, with only a small amount programmed for transit.
\
Connecticut's share of the federal pot will be sucked up by huge projects like Route 11, the Q Bridge in New Haven (another billion- dollar project that will reach vehicle capacity three years after it opens) and widening I-95, crippling badly needed transit projects for decades.
\
DOT officials will tell you that they have no money for anything but highways. That's a half-truth: DOT has systemically concealed funds that were and are available for transit.
\
The governor has asked for citizen input on the DOT process. Here is our suggestion:
\
We suggest the governor force DOT to become a transportation agency, not a highway department. The interstate highway era is over.
\
We urge the governor to reprogram highway money for investment in rail, transit, bike trails and barge-freight capacity. Anything less will continue the harm to our health, our economy and our quality of life.

Special Section: 1997 Guide to The Connecticut General Assembly
\
Spending and taxes
\
Politicians like nothing more than giving tax cuts, and it appears that's what the public will be getting from the 1997 legislative session.
\
Gov. John G. Rowland has vowed to cut the state income tax this year, and both Republicans and Democrats agree that taxes should be reduced. The difference, though, is that each side disagrees on which taxes should be sliced.
\
While Rowland has long favored cutting the personal income tax, Democrats have tried to help their constituents in the cities by reducing the property tax.
\
A major change this year is that Democrats will control the state Senate after two years of Republican reign. The new Senate co-chairman of the tax-writing finance committee, Sen. Martin M. Looney, D- New Haven, will play a key role in deciding which taxes will be cut.
\
""The most important one would be to reduce the property tax,"" Looney said. ""It benefits anyone who lives in a high-tax community or anyone who had a decline in their income.""
\
Looney favors a so-called ""circuit breaker"" that has been debated and rejected at the state Capitol in recent years. With Democrats controlling both chambers, the circuit breaker concept has a better chance than in the past, officials said.
\
Under a 5 percent circuit breaker that is currently being discussed, a family would be eligible for a tax cut if their property taxes represent more than 5 percent of their income. A family earning $50,000 annually that is paying more than $2,500 in property taxes, for example, would receive a credit on their personal income tax -- and the amount of the credit would depend on the overall package that is passed by the legislature.
\
Opponents, though, say the circuit breaker would not provide any relief for young workers who do not own a home or a condominium. The primary beneficiaries would be elderly citizens who have low incomes in their retirement years and relatively high property taxes.
\
A two-income family earning $80,000, for example, would not be eligible for any tax relief unless their property taxes were more than $4,000 annually.
\
Rowland and legislators also have vowed to cut the state's gasoline tax, which is currently the highest in the nation. The tax increased to 39 cents per gallon on Jan. 1, and lawmakers have vowed to reduce it to 37 cents when the new fiscal year starts July 1.
\
The size of the income-tax cut depends on potential cuts in the state budget, which is currently $10.02 billion. The longtime Democratic co-chairman of the budget- writing appropriations committee, Rep. William R. Dyson of New Haven, said he would not predict the size of any tax cut. Instead, Dyson said he is interested in passing a lean budget that provides fairness for all agencies that might suffer any cuts.
\
In preparing his budget, which will be unveiled to the legislature in February, Rowland has asked his commissioners to submit proposals that would cut spending by 10 percent. Rowland's aides, though, say that some agencies will have cuts lower than 10 percent and others may be higher. Each commissioner also was told by Rowland to look for areas for privatization in each agency.
\
The two-year budget, which is expected to cover at least $20 billion in spending, is subject to approval by the House of Representatives and the Senate.
\
Education
\
On the education front, the legislature is expected to consider some fundamental changes in public schools, including proposals to allow parents to enroll children in schools outside of their home district.
\
The expansion of parental choice, along with a substantial increase in preschool programs across the state, will be debated as the legislature looks for ways to comply with a court order to desegregate Hartford's public schools.
\
The state Supreme Court ruled in July that racial isolation in Hartford's system -- where nearly 95 percent of the students are black or Hispanic -- violates the state constitution.
\
The court, however, did not specify a remedy and instead left the issue in the hands of the General Assembly.
\
The ruling is expected to have implications beyond Hartford, and a state advisory panel has listed school choice and more preschool education as possible ways to improve urban schools across the state. The debate also is certain to include ideas such as regional magnet schools and charter schools, which are innovative, publicly funded schools centered around special themes or academic programs.
\
Ethics and elections
\
Advocates of campaign-finance reform believe that recent national events -- such as questionable foreign contributions to the national Democratic campaign -- give them a better chance of making significant changes in state campaign laws this session.
\
In recent years, the legislature has rebuffed such proposals as voluntary campaign spending limits for state campaigns.
\
""I think that currently there's more momentum -- from the national picture, with the question marks that were raised during the last weeks of the presidential campaign,"" said state Sen.-elect Gary LeBeau, D-East Hartford, who will be co-chairman of the legislature's government and elections committee. ""Generally I think there is a kind of public . . . distaste for the amount of money spent on campaigns and the perceived influence that buys.""
\
Also on the government and elections committee's agenda, although not related to campaign finance, will be another try at further limiting gifts and meals that lobbyists buy for legislators. The so-called ""gift ban"" died in the 1996 session when the Senate and House passed conflicting versions.
\
Transportation
\
The transportation committee will be the scene of some of the debate over one of the legislature's hottest issues this session: the gas tax.
\
The tax increases enacted a few years ago that made the state's gas tax the highest in the nation are now something nearly every lawmaker hates, and many campaigned against the tax last fall.
\
Another issue likely to appear before the transportation committee is amending a measure passed last year to require that 16- and 17-year- old drivers obtain a six-month learner's permit before receiving full driver's privileges. The current bill requires all newly licensed drivers of any age to obtain a permit.
\
Health care
\
A renewed attempt to place some state control on -- health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, could be a rematch of a fight that ended last year with the bill's death in the final days of the session.
\
This year, with Democrats back in control of the state Senate and heightened public awareness about managed care, the regulations are expected to have a better chance.
\
The regulations are certain to be subject to intense negotiations, but the bill is expected to include at least some of the following:
\
* Disclosure by HMOs of how patient care decisions are made and how it determines what treatments are ""medically necessary.""
\
* Licensing of HMOs by the state Department of Public Health. HMOs now operate under the auspices of the state Insurance Department, which only scrutinizes them for financial solvency. No state agency looks at the quality of medical care they deliver.
\
* Creation of an independent panel to consider appeals by HMO patients. Now, a patient who disagrees with a decision by an HMO can appeal only within the HMO.
\
Insurance
\
Reform of managed care is also expected to be one of the leading issues before the insurance and real estate committee. Ideas that may show up in bills are a proposal to create a report card system to help consumers choose among health plans, and proposals to get state health regulators more involved in the regulation of managed care companies instead of leaving that to the Department of Insurance.
\
One or more bills are expected that would prohibit health plans from refusing to pay for hospital stays for mastectomy patients, or dictating what length of stay they will cover.
\
The other big consumer issue for the insurance committee is expected to be a challenge to the system of territorial rating for auto insurance, which urban legislators and dwellers long have objected to. Auto insurance rates vary according to where you live, and cities typically have much higher premiums than suburbs or rural areas.
\
Commerce
\
The legislature's commerce committee is expected to continue refining economic development legislation that is already in place
\
The House in the prior session passed legislation that called for the state to recognize certain broad industry clusters, such as financial services and technology manufacturing. The committee is expected to discuss ways of nurturing more industry clusters in the upcoming session.
\
The committee also will hear proposals from legislators seeking to expand enterprise zones, in which businesses in targeted locations receive tax breaks or other benefits. There was some backlash in the previous session from legislators who said the expansion of the zones had already gone too far.
\
Labor
\
Rep. Christopher G. Donovan, D- Meriden, one of the new co-chairmen of the labor committee, said an issue of particular interest to him is the question of whether effects of the state's economic recovery are reaching working people across the state.
\
""I would like to make sure that when one works, one receives the benefits from it,"" Donovan said.
\
The Connecticut Business and Industry Association says it is not planning to bring any major initiatives before the committee in 1997. Among the issues on organized labor's agenda: holding corporations that receive state aid accountable for the way they treat workers, and rolling back some of the benefit cuts made in the state's workers' compensation system in 1993.
\
Consumer affairs
\
Among the consumer bills expected to be considered by the general law committee is a consumer privacy law being proposed by state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. The bill would ban unsolicited advertising over computer e-mail. It also would prohibit financial institutions from selling the names of their credit cardholders without obtaining permission and prohibit supermarkets from collecting and selling marketing information on their customers without permission.
\
Two other measures would add motorcycles to the types of vehicles covered by the state's new car lemon law and expand the used car lemon law to require dealers to refund customers' money if they cannot repair a vehicle so that it complies with the warranty.
\
Other bills would require hospitals to provide patients with itemized bills within 30 days and expand protections for those who give funeral homes advance payments toward future funerals.
\
Children
\
The top issue before the select committee on children this year is likely to be a proposal to expand state programs that promote school readiness, such as preschool programs for children ages 3 to 5.
\
Also on the agenda will be a proposal to restrict the use of state child-care subsidies only to licensed or registered child-care providers.
\
The committee also will consider the effect of managed care on children with special needs.
\
Energy and utilities
\
The energy and technology committee faces one of the biggest and most complex issues of the legislative session: whether to give Connecticut consumers a choice of electricity providers and, if so, when.
\
While a legislative task force was unable to agree on a restructuring plan after nearly two years of work, several proposals are being circulated by various interest groups.
\
House and Senate leaders and Rowland said they would like to see some action on the issue this year, and the utility companies, business and consumer groups most affected by the issue are optimistic some agreement can be reached.
\
Crime and punishment
\
The judiciary committee's new Senate chairman, Sen. Donald E. Williams Jr., D-Thompson, and the returning House chairman, Rep. Michael P. Lawlor, D-East Haven, each say that restoring full services at the state's courthouses is a top priority -- but one that may not be easy to achieve.
\
Judicial services have been hobbled since March, when 178 mostly clerical workers were laid off after the legislature declined to reject arbitrated pay raises totaling 43 percent over six years.
\
Most of the laid-off workers have been rehired, and the remainder will be rehired under an agreement this month between the judicial department and its unions.
\
Williams and Lawlor also pledge to review operations of the state Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, which has come under fire in recent years for failing to live up to its charge of promptly investigating allegations of employment discrimination and civil rights violations.
\
The committee also will take up the nomination of a number of new judges.
\
Banking
\
Now that national banks are poised to gain broad powers in selling insurance, the banks committee may have to wrestle with extending similar powers to state-chartered banks.
\
In Connecticut, the courts, siding with the U.S. Supreme Court, have granted Fleet Bank the right to sell insurance in towns with populations of 5,000 or less. The courts have not yet ruled on the crucial question of whether Fleet can headquarter its sales in a small town and sell to the entire state.
\
If Fleet wins such broad selling powers, national banks in Connecticut would have a big leg up on state- chartered institutions and would likely lead to a push for a level playing field, banking lobbyists said.
\
State Banking Commissioner John P. Burke also is expected to introduce a bill that would create a community bank charter, easing the capital requirements for chartering a new bank.
\
Gambling
\
Aid for ailing parimutuel businesses, hit hard by competition from the two Indian casinos in southeastern Connecticut, is expected to be the main gambling issue before the legislature.
\
The state's three remaining parimutuel operators are seeking lower taxes and the ability to run high- stakes bingo games. They made pleas for assistance this fall before a task force created by the legislature to study the state's gaming policies and make recommendations.
\
The task force did not endorse the bingo proposal, which is certain to be opposed by churches and other charitable organizations that raise more than $30 million a year through bingo.
\
Environment
\
The environment committee does not expect a lot of action. Its biggest issue this session probably will be restructuring the electric-utility industry.
\
Members anticipate discussions of clean-air issues related to the potential reliance on coal-burning power plants in other states for generating power, and the possibility for increasing the use of clean- energy power sources, such as solar, wind and biomass.
\
Members also are expected to deal with liability issues involving landowners who allow open-space corridors, such as hiking and biking trails, to be used for recreation.

\
German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck observed that the two things no one should ever see made are laws and sausages. Nevertheless, below are some ingredients that go into lawmaking--the agendas of groups that influence the General Assembly or wish they could.
\
The Courant asked a variety of leaders, lobbyists and lawmakers to give us their agendas for this year's session, which begins on Feb. 9 and lasts only 12 weeks. The agendas vary from outlawing shoplifting devices to preserving open space, and from increasing school aid to financing political campaigns with taxpayer money.
\
Senate Democrats
\
Our challenge is to keep the 2000 session short, simple and smart. With only 12 weeks, we first need to do no harm and then focus on priorities that really matter. As Connecticut's economy continues to grow, we can help with better job training, incentives for e- commerce and less grandiose plans but more lasting action to revitalize Hartford and all our cities.
\
Our adopted biennial budget is already below the state spending cap and not only balanced but in surplus. It already provides more tax relief and invests significantly in education, health care, crime prevention and the environment. There is no reason to reopen this blueprint for fiscal prudence to election-year politicking.
\
As to the surplus, let's end the gimmicky rebates and avoid the temptation just to spend. Instead, let's build our rainy-day reserves, pay cash to avoid costly borrowing for school construction and technology, freeze college tuitions, defuse the financial time bomb of unfunded liability for teacher retirement, preserve more open space and create a state reserve for working families who lose health care coverage.
\
Finally, the taint of corruption left by the last state treasurer demands that we restore trust. We must put aside partisanship and work together to limit campaign spending, offer voluntary public financing, stop executive branch fund-raising from those doing big business with the state and let Connecticut voters decide the constitutional fate of a failed state sheriff system.
\
Kevin B. Sullivan, D-West Hartford, is the president pro tempore of the state Senate.
\
Senate Republicans
\
In the many years that Connecticut has been my home, I cannot remember a time when the quality of life here was any better than it is right now.
\
However, we cannot take our prosperity for granted. Despite the fact that Connecticut is expected to again end the next fiscal year with a budget surplus, it would be a grave mistake for the legislature to abandon the fiscal restraint of recent years and return to the out-of-control spending practices of the past.
\
Several years ago, when both jobs and money were scarce, the legislature established a statutory spending cap. That spending cap - - agreed to in concept by an overwhelming majority of voters -- was established to protect the fiscal health of our state in both good times and bad. To honor the spending cap, the legislature must make adjustments to the state budget approved for fiscal year 2000-01. Failing to do so would force the state to exceed the statutory spending cap by several million dollars. Even more important, failing to make necessary adjustments in next year's budget would leave some state agencies, including those important to children and senior citizens, without sufficient funding for their programs.
\
The General Assembly must act this year to both honor the statutory spending cap and ensure appropriate funding for necessary state programs. To do anything else would be the height of irresponsibility.
\
M. Adela Eads, R-Kent, is the minority leader of the state Senate.
\
House Democrats
\
House Democrats view the 2000 legislative session as a window of opportunity to build upon the strong foundation we have already established in education, the environment and access to quality health care.
\
First, we must honor the existing spending cap, while at the same time continuing to seek tax relief, especially for working families.
\
In education, House Democrats will continue to work toward our ultimate goal of a 50 percent state contribution to local education. Our four-year-old program that brought computers to many classrooms statewide will be complemented with teacher training so that this new technology gets used. We have proposed a competitive grant program for underperforming schools, and will continue our commitment to the nationally acclaimed School Readiness and Early Reading Success program.
\
Our health care agenda includes adding parents to the HUSKY insurance program. Making prescriptions more affordable for seniors, improving mental health treatment and diagnosing the financial crisis at the UConn Health Center are also issues that demand workable solutions.
\
We propose an open-space trust fund to preserve available land now, for our children's future. And we anticipate moving forward on the revitalization of our capital city.
\
Moira K. Lyons, D-Stamford, is the speaker of the state House of Representatives.
\
House Republicans
\
Can we take bold steps in education, health care and government reform -- yet stay under a spending cap and deliver permanent tax cuts to hard-working families? For the House Republicans, the answer is a firm yes.
\
We propose $75 million in tax relief, including tuition tax credits to help families send kids to college, a gas tax cut to make us competitive with surrounding states and reduced occupational licensing fees that people pay on top of their state income tax.
\
In education, we propose an exit exam for high school seniors so that employers know that our graduates have the skills to receive a diploma and work in 21st-century jobs. We support Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell's plan to assure that students have access to technology they will need after graduation. A process to manage chronically underperforming school districts is long overdue. Funds to recruit minority teachers also would be a sensible expenditure.
\
In health, our initiatives include medical savings accounts to allow people to take advantage of these new health plans. We propose allowing people with disabilities to keep their health benefits after they take a job, registering home health care aides and assisting struggling hospitals.
\
We recommend an independent board to check the treasurer's enormous investment powers. We would ban finders' fees to political insiders, and increase public disclosure of campaign contributions -- but oppose using taxpayers' dollars to pay for campaign commercials.
\
Robert M. Ward, R-North Branford, is minority leader of the state House of Representatives.
\
Labor
\
Gov. Rowland and state legislators should use the upcoming General Assembly session to close Connecticut's widening wage and wealth gap, promote the creation of good jobs with decent wages and strengthen the social insurance safety net.
\
As the voice of more than 260,000 workers throughout the state, the Connecticut AFL-CIO will advocate to:
\
Raise the state minimum wage. Connecticut's minimum wage ($6.15 an hour) is an inadequate wage floor for supporting the working poor. It should be increased to $6.75 an hour and indexed to the cost of living to prevent further erosion in its purchasing power.
\
Extend collective bargaining rights to agricultural workers. This would bring the prospect of economic justice to thousands of low- wage Connecticut workers who presently lack the legal right to form unions.
\
Improve workers' compensation benefits and strengthen the solvency of the unemployment insurance system. Along with affordable, accessible health care, these benefits form a three-legged stool of support for workers in their time of need.
\
Reserve state economic development assistance for companies that pay a living wage and abide by labor, environmental and other laws. Our tax dollars should go only to companies that are willing to reinforce the link between good jobs and strong communities.
\
Fix the UConn Health Center and John Dempsey Hospital. This institution -- made up of public employees working for the public good -- contributes invaluably to the quality of life in Connecticut. The legislature should find a way to help make it financially viable.
\
Lori J. Pelletier is secretary-treasurer of the Connecticut AFL- CIO in Rocky Hill.
\
African Americans
\
African Americans represent 8.3 percent of Connecticut's population, but own less than 2 percent of the wealth of the state. The high incidence of AIDS, teen pregnancy, infant mortality and drug addiction; the low educational attainment, high unemployment and poverty facing African Americans are symptoms of a larger concern -- the disenfranchisement of the population in the economic mainstream. If opportunities cannot be created for African Americans in the richest state, it will never happen.
\
The African-American Affairs Commission has established economic development as its top legislative priority. In 1999, public hearings were conducted. The key findings were the following:
\
There are not enough resources for business development in the inner cities.
\
There is a need to increase the private-sector equity capital for investment in the inner cities.
\
There is a need to expand retail for residents in inner cities.
\
There is a need for job and training programs that include placement and job retention services.
\
There is a need to provide education in economic development for residents and organizations.
\
The commission has worked closely with the state Department of Economic and Community Development in the creation of the Connecticut Inner City Business Strategy Initiative. This is by far the most significant urban initiative for the state in the last 40 years. The African-American Affairs Commission will support the governor in advocating that the legislative body provide all the needed financial resources for the proper implementation of the initiative.
\
Kurt Harrison is a legislative analyst for the African-American Affairs Commission in Hartford.

Digital Courant The Courant's site on the World Wide Web has an archive of stories about the gubernatorial race. Point your browser to: http://www.courant.com
\
When Gov. John G. Rowland and companions put on dark glasses and grooved to a rhythm-and-blues beat on The Bushnell's stage this summer, they were saying, in effect: ""We are new Republicans, and we've got soul.""
\
That bit of political theater, at the Republican state convention, symbolized how high the nation's youngest governor, at 41, is riding: After clawing to a narrow 1994 victory, he's now getting public applause for his program of tax cuts and popular spending initiatives, and he's in a solid groove toward re-election Nov. 3.
\
Even so, questions still hover around Rowland: What's behind the dark glasses? Where is his political soul?
\
""The soul is very simple,"" said Rowland. ""It's a belief that people can do good things in a community. It's a belief that public service is a great calling if it's used right. It's a belief in empowerment -- it drives my interest in urban revitalization. . . . I mean, to me, a legacy would be to turn the cities around. That's part of my soul.""
\
Yet critics say he has none.
\
Democrats paint Rowland as a chameleon-opportunist possessing personal charm and political skill but lacking ""core beliefs."" He was a conservative, anti-abortion, Reagan Republican in the 1980s as a state legislator and congressman, they say, but now has morphed into a Clintonesque, pro-choice moderate.
\
""Believing in nothing makes the transitions a lot easier,"" said Rowland's defeated Democratic opponent from 1994, Bill Curry.
\
Rowland and allies insist such comments are incorrect, but the flip-flop questions clearly get to him.
\
The Pragmatist
\
Rowland's dark hair is entering the salt-and-pepper zone, putting a final gubernatorial touch on his constantly televised image. He looked at home as he sat for a recent interview with The Courant in the historic second-floor office at the State Capitol with the big desk, high ceiling, dark woodwork and steel-blue carpet. Pictures of his kids are all around. To one side, a wooden shelf is freighted with photos of Rowland or wife Patricia with the likes of George Bush and actors Bruce Willis and Tom Selleck.
\
Rowland talked expansively about his first term's accomplishments, describing a record of constancy -- despite, he says, the naysaying by his favorite foils, the press and Democrats.
\
""We brought out a budget, right in the beginning, that was very low. . . . Everybody said that would never happen. We got it through,"" he said. ""We cut the income tax, inheritance tax, gas tax . . . all those taxes. Nobody said it was ever going to be done. Welfare reform -- they said no . . . that'll never happen.""
\
It is a characteristic refrain for him, and he warmed to it. But he cooled visibly when talk turned to changing positions on issues.
\
Rowland did not like the term ""pragmatic,"" a term his own press secretary has applied to him. When speaking of his urban agenda, Rowland said, ""I don't know how that fits into your `pragmatic' thing . . . but I've always been interested in the cities. I grew up in Waterbury. . . . I talked about welfare reform at age 22, so my soul and my instincts were to improve the cities and try to empower people, to get them off welfare, to have more economic opportunity.
\
""If you're not pragmatic, then how the hell do you govern? I mean, I could be Tom Scott"" -- a conservative Republican who was one of Rowland's three major gubernatorial competitors in 1994 -- ""and say: `OK, these are the three principles I adhere to. And nothing else is ever going to change. . . . I will not talk to anybody or work with anybody.' ""
\
""You can't be a governor or a leader"" without a willingness to compromise, he said.
\
Democrats say the problem is not compromise, but a lack of any ideological compass besides what is expedient.
\
Far from having an urban soul, they say, Rowland did very little for the cities until this year, an election year, when he won legislative approval for projects that ultimately would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven, New London and other cities.
\
Rowland also didn't care about the environment or education for his first three years, Democrats argue. It galls them that Rowland has done to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Barbara B. Kennelly, 62, this year what Bill Clinton did to Bob Dole in 1996: move to the political center and occupywhat normally would be his challenger's ideological turf.
\
Rowland's leftward shift has kept Kennelly from exploiting such issues as education and the environment. Rowland has had luck, too. The economy is good, and one recent poll showed that an amazing 81 percent of voters are satisfied with life in Connecticut. Bottom line: Kennelly has been unable to give voters a reason that they should want to fire the incumbent. Recent polls show Rowland well ahead, one by 44 percentage points, and another by 37.
\
Elasticity
\
Rowland's reputation for elasticity on issues goes back nearly a decade, to October 1989, when he was in his third term as U.S. representative from the relatively conservative 5th Congressional District and had voted for years against abortion-rights measures.
\
Five days before he announced his candidacy for the 1990 gubernatorial election -- a statewide contest in which voters would generally be more favorable to abortion rights -- Rowland, a Roman Catholic, voted to allow federal funding for poor women's abortions.
\
Asked about that, Rowland said: ""I think that there's a tendency for people in the press to say, OK, here's a line in the sand, right here, this is what this guy was 15 years, 20 years ago . . . and here's what he is now. I would hope there'd be a little bit of a growth curve here {over time}. . . . Life is not the same each and every day.""
\
That's for sure: In 1990, the local director for the National Abortion Rights Action League criticized Rowland for the ""incredible callousness"" of his voting record. Last week, the Connecticut NARAL endorsed both Rowland and Kennelly for governor, in light of Rowland's pro-choice record as governor.
\
""It's amazing to me that the same guy who gets a quote like that said about him in 1990 gets the NARAL endorsement this year,"" said Kennelly campaign manager Jonathan Pelto. ""That sort of sums up the transformation of John Rowland.""
\
Life-Changes
\
Pelto may see a transformation, but not Rowland. How has he changed since he first ran for governor, and lost, in 1990? To hear him tell it, not much: ""In eight years? No mustache. Gray hair, 4 1/2 pounds heavier. Smarter -- no, that's stretching it. More experienced.""
\
Rowland's two decades in politics have brought significant life- changes, though: Married young, with three children; divorced in 1994; remarried late that year to his high-school sweetheart, Patricia Largay, herself recently divorced, after he won the 1994 election; and now, between them they have five children aged 10 to 14.
\
Rowland's public career began at 23, when he became a state representative from Waterbury in 1981. But his political experience dates back to Holy Cross High School in Waterbury, where he was senior class president in 1975.
\
Since then, he has never ducked electoral risks. One critic recalls with frank admiration that Rowland, as a young state representative, had said ""it's up or out for me"" -- in other words, he would not linger too long in the legislative rank and file.
\
Rowland got into Congress in the 1984 Reagan re-election landslide and followed his ""up or out"" credo again in 1990, abandoning the safe 5th District seat only to lose the governor's election to Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
\
That was a jolt. Rowland had worked only briefly outside government, mainly in his family's insurance business, but after his loss he started a consulting firm representing Connecticut companies, such as United Technologies, in Washington.
\
It was lucrative and carried him to 1994. Although Rowland says his Washington work was not lobbying, it was part of the same milieu. And so Rowland has seen government from all sides -- as a legislator, a chief executive and a representative of outside interests. He knows how to work things.
\
For example, he worked the Democratic leaders who control the House and Senate to win approval of this year's special, pre- election rebates to taxpayers. Rowland used both public pressure and private arguments to convince the leaders that the rebates were in every incumbent's interest -- his, as a Republican, and theirs, as Democrats.
\
Same Guy
\
Longtime friends look at Rowland as governor and say he is still the same guy he was, the eldest of five children in a middle-class Waterbury family who became a gregarious fraternity president while earning a degree in business administration at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.
\
When not being asked about sore subjects, Rowland generally spouts quips and anecdotes, and possesses a well-developed sense of irony.
\
He'll tell you his favorite punchlines from Pink Panther movies: ""That is not my dog"" and ""Sorry, I'm a little short.""
\
He works humor into his political rhetoric. For about a year, he has been touting one of his first gubernatorial directives -- requiring state employees to answer the phone by stating their names and asking ""how may I help you?"" -- by telling an anecdote about former Army Gen. William C. Westmoreland.
\
In it, Westmoreland phones a lowly military clerk and gets no cooperation. ""Do you know who this is?"" Westmoreland demands. When the soldier learns he's talking to a general, he is unimpressed and then asks Westmoreland: ""Do you know who this is?""
\
""No,"" Westmoreland replies.
\
""Then goodbye, stupid,"" the soldier says, and hangs up.
\
Rowland cultivates a down-to- earth persona: He says he's a country-music fan and an an avid fisherman, and is heavily into family outdoor sports such as skiing. He is at home in a gritty Waterbury bar, or on live TV, or in a Greenwich Scotch-and-sirloin power den, impressing the Republican money types.
\
Now, with a Nov. 3 landslide possible, he carefully avoids the political sin of saying it's in the bag. But the real question seems to be how far he can go after re-election.
\
Would he ever run for the U.S. Senate?
\
""I really can't see myself doing that,"" he said. ""I know you should never say `never,' but the idea of being part of the Senate doesn't excite me at all.""
\
Rowland believes in the saying that a governor can do more on a Monday morning than a legislator -- being one of many -- can accomplish in a career. And so, concerning the Senate, he said, ""I just don't think I can go back to that legislative process. . . . If I had not served in the House, then I could at least be naive enough to say, `gee, I think the Senate would be exciting.' ""
\
What about the commonly held belief that Rowland would call it quits after two terms as governor, in 2002?
\
""Oh, it's not absolute at all,"" he said. He said he would seek to remain as governor ""as long as I enjoy this job"" and ""would definitely leave . . . open"" the possibility of a third term.
\
Some in the nation's capital even talk of the possibility that Rowland might be tapped as a Republican vice presidential nominee.
\
""You hear him {Rowland} talked about largely in terms of geography,"" said Jennifer Duffy, a political analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report in Washington, D.C.
\
But there's a cloud over Rowland's national chances, she said. It's the 1994 domestic incident between Rowland and his ex-wife at their former Middlebury home. Both Rowland and his political ally, the Middlebury police chief, successfully fought a state Freedom of Information Commission order that a report on the incident be released.
\
Even though the Middlebury police classified the 1994 incident as nonviolent and verbal, it would be likely that someone would send copies of old press clippings to the likes of ABC's Sam Donaldson -- and, once that happened, the GOP might quickly turn to another prospect who had no issue with even a suggestion of domestic violence to explain.
\
Asked if he was concerned that this might plague him, Rowland said: ""What it is is what it is. I don't think about how something plays out 10 years from now or four years from now, nationally or otherwise.""
"
126,"
It's now been 35 years since the first Arab oil embargo provided America with a wake-up call about the dangers associated with the nation's over-reliance on oil imports from countries that don't really like us.
\
Since then, Americans have been in a permanent state of denial about the dangers that our energy profligacy has created for our economy and environment. We now know that our excess fuel consumption is undermining not only our national defense, the value of the dollar and the well-being of the U.S. economy, but the health of the world's climate as well.
\
So what have our policy responses been to this challenge? Over the past three decades, cars and trucks have gotten larger and less fuel efficient, total vehicle-miles traveled have burgeoned, and we have taken virtually no steps to develop alternative fuels or alternatives to ever-longer commutes on increasingly crowded highways.
\
Consequently, the nation's energy supply has gone from one-third to two-thirds reliant on foreign oil. America's energy and tax policies have been stuck in the 1950s, when we were the world's largest petroleum exporter, instead of the largest importer that we are today.
\
With oil hovering around $120 per barrel and gas prices exceeding $4 per gallon, political leaders are looking for scapegoats, not real solutions, to the mess that is our national energy policy.
\
Most are blaming greedy oil companies and commodity speculators for high prices, not the nation's wasteful use of energy, growing consumption, and competition from China and India for scarce resources.
\
Presidents and Congresses from both parties can fairly share the blame for ducking this issue and continuing to pander to voters instead of proposing real solutions. The last serious presidential candidate to propose raising gas taxes to limit consumption and fund alternative energy research and mass transit was Sen. Paul Tsongas in his 1992 presidential bid. His campaign ended in the Michigan primary, when voters resoundingly rejected his proposed 50-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase.
\
Since then, we've gotten only gauzy promises for increased ethanol production or energy independence from both Republican and Democratic candidates - responses based largely on results of focus groups, not on the urgent need to reduce the nation's overconsumption of imported oil.
\
The bipartisan failure of leadership on this issue reached a new level this month with the announcement that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was joining John McCain in calling for a ""gas tax holiday"" for the summer.
\
This ""holiday"" will save the average U.S. family anywhere from $0 to $70 over the course of the summer, depending on whose estimate you use, and speed the bankruptcy of the transportation trust fund, already expected to move into deficit by the end of 2009. It won't do a thing to focus the nation on what we really need: national energy and related tax policies designed to reduce oil consumption and oil imports and put us on the track to an alternative energy future.
\
This isn't just a national issue. Proposals to suspend state gas or petroleum taxes have circulated in the legislatures of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. What America and the region really need is leadership, not pandering on an issue that is fundamental to the nation's future security, competitiveness and the success of global efforts to manage climate change.
"
127,"As anyone who drives a car in Connecticut knows, our transportation infrastructure needs repair — and needs it now.\One-third of the state’s rural roads are in poor condition. And we’re home to six of the 100 worst traffic bottlenecks in the country. But road and traffic conditions are only the beginning of transportation problems we must address.\Gov. Ned Lamont has called on the Legislature to pass a bill that would authorize the state to participate in a new Transportation and Climate Initiative, or TCI. Our legislators will soon vote on TCI, which would revitalize transportation for all the state’s residents — whether they live in urban, suburban or rural communities.\The program, which includes 11 other states and Washington, D.C., would enable our state to fund significant investments to improve the way we get from place to place — and yield benefits for our economy, health and environment in the process.\TCI would require corporations that sell fuels like gasoline and diesel to buy credits permitting them to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide. The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection estimates that sales of those credits will bring Connecticut $89 million in 2023 and $117 million a year by 2032.\The state will invest much of that money in historically overburdened and underserved communities — urban and rural alike. At least 50 percent of the funds must go to projects in places that either lack adequate transportation options or suffer from extreme air pollution. That means at least $44 million for these communities in the first year of TCI and $514 million between 2023 and 2032.\There’s no shortage of good those dollars would do, going toward repaving highways, adding traffic signals and converting intersections to roundabouts. Each of these changes would substantially improve road safety and ease traffic. People would spend less time idling, wasting gas and putting more harmful emissions into our atmosphere.\TCI funds would also be available to underwrite new green transit options, from high-speed rail and additional train stations to electric vehicles and bike lanes.\Electric cars aren’t just luxury vehicles. Car companies are now making more affordable electric models, including SUVs and trucks with little difference in performance or sticker price compared to gas-powered versions.\For those that don’t drive — particularly the elderly, disabled and those of limited means — TCI could provide more frequent bus service. That’d be a boon for rural residents in particular, who often lack convenient public transit options.\Most Popular\1.\Judge threatens default against Alex Jones if he doesn’t turn over evidence to Sandy Hook families\2.\‘They took my golden star’: Family, friends mourn loss of slain 18-year-old New Haven man\3.\Historic New Haven mansion and property for sale for $2.25 million\4.\Police: Former West Haven councilwoman charged with selling narcotics out of her bakery\5.\Feds: Former CT property manager stole over $400K in funds\6.\Richard Arnold, a ‘tough, but fair’ judge, former CT GOP chairman, dies at 72\7.\Bufalina in Guilford converts old VW bus into a mobile bar\TCI would even allow people to skip commuting altogether. As many of us learned over the past year, a fast and reliable internet connection makes working remotely a reality. While most people in our state have reliable internet service, some rural towns and neighborhoods and cities still have dead spots. TCI funds for new fiber-optic lines to reach these “last mile” places would make affordable, universal broadband a reality.\All these improvements result in meaningful benefits for local economies. TCI could increase GDP across all 13 jurisdictions slated to participate in the pact by $570 million by 2032. Over that same period, the initiative is projected to create more than 2,500 new job opportunities.\By decreasing vehicle emissions, TCI would also improve air quality, and thereby deliver substantial public health benefits, like fewer cases of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. And that means lower health care costs for our state.\Given all these benefits, it’s no wonder two in three Connecticut voters support TCI. A survey that we at The Nature Conservancy sponsored found that over 70 percent of small-town and rural voters would support a relatively small increase in the prices charged by fuel suppliers — estimated at five cents and capped at nine cents per gallon under TCI. Claims by those opposed to TCI that it’s a new gas tax are simply not true.\The bottom line is that TCI is a win for the people of Connecticut. The financial and human value of the benefits it will produce is far greater than its potential cost. While The Nature Conservancy is an organization committed to protecting the environment, we nonetheless see in TCI programs that would meaningfully improve the lives of Connecticut residents in so many other ways. It will help provide a sustainable future not just for our environment but for our health, our jobs, and our quality of life.\It’s time for our legislators to get this initiative going.\\"
128,"Connecticut has four cities, Hartford, New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport, in the top 30 in the nation for zero-car households. In seven neighborhoods in Hartford, more than 40 percent of the households have no cars. Almost two-thirds of Hartford's workforce, many of them using bus transit, work outside of Hartford.\During the 2018 transportation budget crisis, the state Department of Transportation threatened to cut funds from the regional transit districts while raising bus and rail fares across the state. Raising transit and rail costs while cutting service is a terrible strategy for getting Connecticut residents to work.\Cars are not an option for many of our state's low-income residents, and cutting their connection to jobs is not fiscally sound. Employers need workers, and transit gets them where they need to go. A robust multi-modal transportation system is egalitarian and provides key jobs access for both our urban professionals and the rest of the state's workers.\A transportation system that requires car ownership prevents many workers and families from building family savings and following the American dream.\The Center for Latino Progress, as a grassroots organization, is in support of investment in our transportation system generated by tolls. Toll revenue must be dedicated to building the sustainable transportation infrastructure of Connecticut's future. Tolls, as fees for highway use, are sorely needed for maintenance, bridge replacements and continued investment in our transit and rail systems. A modern, multi-modal transportation system will allow businesses and communities to thrive while supporting the workers that power the economy.\The state's commerce and community health should be driving the decision-making. Connecticut has the eighth-oldest population in the nation and needs transportation options that support our aging seniors while simultaneously attracting a generation of young adults and professionals that are moving back into cities and town centers. Both of those groups are looking to drive less and have an appetite for environmentally sustainable transportation that improves health, supports their neighborhoods and connects them to opportunities.\A state that values all workers invests in accessible and high-quality transit systems and focuses on new development around transit corridors and stations. Not everyone is going to take CTtransit, CTfastrak, or the Hartford Line commuter rail to work, but as more do, it will lift our local economies, reduce highway congestion, and improve our environment. Considering the equity impact of tolls, we must provide a reduced fare structure for the working poor who are driving to work.\While federal and state gas tax rates have been flat for decades, transit fares have continued to rise. We need to consider how the transportation system of the future will serve our children and grandchildren with a livable world and green jobs. Forty percent of the state's greenhouse gas emissions are from the transportation sector, the largest contributing sector by far. Without a shift to a higher percentage of transit, rail, walking and biking for commutes, we will be contributing to the global climate catastrophe. As a coastal state, Connecticut cannot pretend to ignore the ravages we will face from rising waters and extreme weather events.\The state legislature and the governor are currently considering the structure and funding for Connecticut's infrastructure investments and transportation system that will serve future generations. We are one of a few Northeast states that have yet to re-implement highway tolls, and that hinders our ability to invest in a transportation system that builds a vibrant and sustainable state. Gas tax revenues are flat and will be falling as cars become more efficient and the percentage of electric vehicles climbs.\We are not reducing the number of highways, while the costs for maintenance and replacement of those aging interstate structures are climbing rapidly as they reach the end of their useful lives.\A highway toll is a reasonable user fee that needs to be implemented to invest in our state's future.\Yanil Terón is the executive director of the Center for Latino Progress.\Credit: By Yanil Terón\Caption: Increased toll revenue would help Connecticut put more money into public transportation and other infrastructure projects.\Patrick Raycraft/Hartford Courant"

Several million dollars into his half-completed campaign for re-election, Republican Gov. John G. Rowland formally announced his candidacy Monday -- in a series of made- for-the-media appearances across the state.
\
""We are asking the people of the state to let us finish the job that we've started,"" Rowland said Monday morning to chants of ""four more years"" from 250 supporters under the shade of a big tent at The Marina at American Wharf in Norwich.
\
Less than two weeks before his scheduled renomination at the upcoming Republican state convention, Rowland cited the state's ""economic renaissance,"" as well as $1.5 billion in tax cuts since 1995, the year he took office, as reasons he deserves a second term.
\
Rowland, 41, also talked of surpluses totaling $593 million over the past three budget years, rising employment, lower crime, and state initiatives to reform the welfare system, improve education, help cities, rebuild state colleges, expand open space, and protect children and the environment.
\
The former congressman's 20- minute message was the same at the other three announcements in Stamford, West Hartford and, on Monday night, in Middlebury at the Quassy amusement park -- which his well-funded campaign organization rented as parents and children from the area of his native Waterbury enjoyed free admission, food and rides.
\
""I want every child to have the best access to education. I want to continue the policies that have led to reduction in crime,"" he said. ""I want to continue running state government like a business, so we can return the savings to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts and tax rebates.""
\
The day of announcement speeches, with the election less than four months away, was only a formality. Along with publicity, it was intended to generate campaign enthusiasm among the party faithful who made up the day's enthusiastic audiences.
\
Rowland already has amassed $4.3 million in campaign cash over the past two years, and, after spending about $1.9 million on the effort, he still has $2.4 million left in the bank for a TV-advertising blitz. That is nearly four times the bank balance of his Democratic challenger, veteran 1st District Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, 62, of Hartford.
\
Meanwhile, Rowland held a 28- percentage-point lead over Kennelly in the most recent Courant/Connecticut Poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. If this were football, Rowland's formal declaration comes at halftime. Kennelly needs a furious second-half rally.
\
But so far her forward progress has been limited, in part because of Rowland's skillful use of his incumbency to push initiatives on issues that he has been criticized on, and which Kennelly thought she could claim as her own -- such as education, the environment and the plight of the state's big cities.
\
Rowland kept strumming those same rhetorical chords Monday, saying his ""greatest challenge"" in a second term would be rebuilding the cities by continued use of public-private partnerships. ""I want to see Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, Waterbury, Norwich, New London become the most vital cities in the northeastern part of our country,"" he said.
\
A reporter asked Rowland in Norwich about an issue his speech did not cover: the key promise of his 1994 campaign to eliminate -- not just reduce -- the state's income tax by the year 2000. Rowland has not come close to fulfilling that pledge. He got three questions that gave him an opportunity to reaffirm that abolish-the-tax pledge.
\
But he held back each time, saying things like: ""We've done a great job in the last four years not only of cutting the income tax, but cutting the inheritance tax, the corporation tax, the gas tax, {and providing research-and-development} tax credits for businesses. So we've cut taxes by $1.5 billion dollars. . . . I would have loved to have cut more taxes. If I had more Republicans in the House or the Senate we probably could have done that. . . . My goal is to continue to reduce {the income tax}."""" My goal is to continue to reduce {the income tax}.""
\
Rowland oozed confidence, clearly believing the tax issue is a strength despite his failure to keep the 1994 promise. Kennelly, trying to make headway on taxes, promised several months ago to deliver a four-year plan to reduce local property taxes -- but, so far, has produced only a spokesman's pledge that it will be disclosed ""sooner rather than later.""
\
About the time of Rowland's Norwich kickoff Monday, Kennelly was leaving a breakfast appearance in Cromwell and telling reporters that Rowland lacks ""innovative education plans for the future."" Also, she said, ""I'm very worried about or environment. . . . And I'm certainly concerned about protecting all our children.
\
It appears that the two will have ample chance to debate their differences, head to head -- because Rowland, despite his commanding lead, said he would still like ""six to eight"" debates, saying that has been the tradition, ""and I think it'd be a great chance for both candidates to talk about the issues and their positions, and I'm looking foward to it.""
\
Patricia Rowland was next to the governor at each appearance, and he introduced her as ""my co-pilot in life."" When Rowland was asked if a second term as governor would be his final one, he laughed and said, ""I will defer to Patty Rowland,"" who was nodding affirmatively. Later on the day's tour, she hedged on that when asked to elaborate beyond that first impression.
\
Rowland, meanwhile, called Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell his ""co-pilot in government."" She, GOP state chairman Chris DePino and members of the Republicans' intended statewide ticket stood with Rowland at each stop -- including, in West Hartford, Santa Mendoza, running for attorney general; Ben F. Andrews, running for secretary of the state; State Treasurer Paul J. Silvester; and former congressman Gary Franks, running for U.S. Senate.
\
Rowland expressed pride in the ethnic and racial diversity of the GOP ticket. When asked about the possibility that Kennelly will lead an all-white Democratic ticket -- if Hartford's Denise Nappier, the only remaining African-American candidate, is not nominated for state treasurer -- Rowland said: ""I think you should have a ticket that exemplifies the rest of the state.""

Top Issues
\
The Economy: Our economy faces significant challenges not seen since the Great Depression and I am angry that for the last eight years an 'anything goes' policy has jeopardized middle-class homeowners, retirement plans, and college savings.
\
I voted against the recent Wall Street bailout twice because it fails to address the underlying causes of the economic crisis - falling home prices caused by record foreclosures.
\
The best economic recovery plan is one that creates good paying jobs. I secured nearly $700 million to increase submarine production at Electric Boat, which helped to create hundreds of new jobs and prevented thousands more employees from being laid off.
\
I voted for two economic stimulus packages to energize the national economy and make overdue investments in America's failing infrastructure, which will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
\
Finally, health care costs are strangling small business. That is why I joined a bipartisan effort in Congress to introduce the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Act, endorsed by labor and business organizations. The bill creates purchasing pools for small businesses and the self-employed, makes health insurance rating reforms; and offers tax credits to make healthcare more affordable for owners and employees.
\
Energy: We need short-term price relief for consumers and long-term solutions to our energy challenges.
\
In September, I voted for comprehensive energy reform that increases domestic oil exploration and production and voted for historic increases in funding for alternative energy, which will be the backbone of our future energy supply.
\
I joined my colleagues to increase fuel efficiency standards to an average 35 MPG for the first time in more than 30 years.
\
I voted multiple times to crack down on energy traders who artificially drive up the price of oil. The energy commodity market needs balanced regulation to prevent the free for all that has been the Bush Administration's policy for the last eight years.
\
I also secured tens of millions of dollars to help companies such as STR in Enfield to develop new and innovative solar and alternative energy technologies. These additional funds helped STR hire 50 additional employees.
\
We need more investments in alternative energy technologies, and I voted for an extension of the Investment Tax Credit to accomplish that goal.

Top Issues
\
Taxes: Connecticut families are paying too much already. Connecticut families pay two dollars to Washington for every one dollar returned in federal assistance.
\
Connecticut families can do a better job of spending our money than the government can. Paying more taxes will only widen the ""Connecticut family gap."" Joe Courtney voted for a budget that will raise the amount taken from Connecticut families by an additional one Billion dollars per year, $3,800 per family in Eastern Connecticut!
\
Tax laws need to change to protect our families and our economy. Standard deductions should be indexed for regional cost of living.
\
The AMT should be eliminated. The tax cuts of the past decade need to be made permanent.
\
Energy: Invest in alternative sources, including renewable energy, biofuels, fuel cells and nuclear power. Increase the tax incentives to help homeowners and businesses convert to more efficient and environmentally friendly systems. Standardize nuclear power plant design to speed regulatory approval of new plants.
\
The Economy: Small businesses need help to be more competitive. Allow businesses to join health care cooperatives across state lines.
\
Health savings accounts and tax credits for individually-purchased health plans will also relieve the costly burden of health care from small business.
\
Promote technical education and training to grow skill workers. Reduce taxes and regulations that discourage job growth.

\
Top Issues
\
The War: I will vote against continued funding for the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq and will take the floor of Congress to push for total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq within 10 months after being sworn into office. Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq not only will save American and Iraqi lives but also ameliorate an estimated 40% American casualty rate (including both physical and emotional wounds) for which our military provides excellent in-situ/field and short-term care, but notoriously inadequate long-term care.
\
If elected, I will remain a staunch supporter of our military personnel by correcting that latter deficiency.
\
If stopped tomorrow, whether the ""surge"" is succeeding or not, the war will cost American taxpayers 31/2 trillion dollars in ""indirect costs"" over the next several decades, money which is being borrowed from foreign sources and contributing to America's debtor-nation status, devaluing the dollar and contributing to our serious economic recession.
\
I will introduce legislation to reduce the military budget by 20%-25%, reducing the burden of our federal taxes and redirecting a portion of military spending to infrastructure repair, to affordable education (including a Green Corps community service program), and to jump start single-payer universal health care (which will pay for itself in reduced administrative costs).
\
The Environment: Once elected to Congress, I will introduce legislation to reverse ecological destruction in CT, the U.S. and around the world by introducing legislation to immediately increase U.S. fuel efficiency standards and to end corporate welfare and subsidies for industries that pollute, including the oil and fossil fuel industries, which continue to receive subsidies and taxpayer dollars while making record profits.
\
As a scientist, rather than a run-of-the-mill lawyer or career politician, I will bring to Congress the scientific knowledge and environmental experience necessary to solve the complex problems facing this nation and putting our planet in ecological peril. I am opposed to expanding off-shore oil drilling, as well as drilling in the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge, either as an alternative to development of alternative energy sources or as a false choice to conservation.
\
Just as John F. Kennedy promised the world that we would put a man on the moon in less than a decade, so too, we must make a concerted national commitment to fully developing alternative, clean, renewable sources of energy to replace our addictive dependency on fossil fuels. Expanding nuclear power, failing to exercise restraint in utilization of finite resources and blindly going after the last remaining petroleum deposits on earth as if climate change, finiteness of resources and energy inefficiency were not ecological facts will only make our paradigms shifts and ultimate changes in lifestyle more drastic and take us to the brink of the precipice.

Top Issues
\
The Economy/Jobs: The key to economic recovery is investing in the hard work and ingenuity of Americans. We face an array of economic challenges. Invention and innovation, production and efficiency are the engines that will allow us to overcome these challenges.
\
The federal government must invest heavily in rebuilding our infrastructure. Expanding mass transit and rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges are just two areas for increased investment. Green technology and high-tech industries are also critical. A continued commitment to education is our most important investment.
\
Community colleges have a unique roll to play in this economy because we must expand the number of Americans ready for high skill jobs. I sponsored important legislation that will increase funding for our community colleges so we can retrain our work force to compete for the technologically advance jobs of the future.
\
It will take all these efforts and more to restore our economy. I am committed to fighting for the investments we need.
\
Energy: This issue is critical to rebuilding our economy. Just as President Kennedy challenged America to land a man on the Moon in ten years, we must challenge the ingenuity of Americans to develop the technology we need to move beyond oil.
\
That means significant investments in alternative energy. Fuel cells, like those made right here in Connecticut, are a key and I have already helped pass legislation that provides grants and tax incentives to grow this technology.
\
My recent appointment to the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming will allow me to help lead the effort to develop alternative energy. An energy revolution is possible. It will help our economy in two critical ways. We will stop shipping billions to oil producing countries and we will create high pay high skill jobs.
\
I am also working to help control current energy costs. Working with local businessmen I developed legislation to stop oil speculators from driving up the cost of oil. We fought for two years to pass this legislation and this summer we won. The legislation is already making a difference.

Top Issues
\
The American Military: As economic globalization continues to increase, we see competition for resources turning into aggression with oil being the most sought after commodity.
\
With Russia poised to begin military maneuvers with Venezuela in the western hemisphere as well as its invasion into Georgia and terrorist acts in Pakistan next door to Iran which is developing nuclear capabilities while China aggressively grows her military, it becomes crystal clear that America needs to reinforce and retool our military to protect our citizens and our interests.
\
We cannot continue as a nation to fight among ourselves regarding the use of unilateral military force when threats loom from unseen enemies, once friendly Nations, rogue nations or extremists funded by shadow foreign governments.
\
Connecticut has always been a leader in defense and will continue to provide our military with the products and services it needs to wage a 24/7 vigilant effort against threats both at home and abroad.
\
Developing technologies will help our military do more with less and can provide our political leaders with real time accurate intelligence. If elected to Congress I will support reinforcing our military and providing greater resources and protection for our soldiers, veterans, citizens and our Nation.
\
Energy: Congress must act in a bipartisan manner to write a new comprehensive energy plan which will promote, regulate and oversee the energy industry without limiting or restricting growth.
\
The American small businessman should not be locked out of any new energy plans or development due to government over-regulation or big business monopolization. Big energy must not be allowed to take hold of our resources as it has in the past.
\
America has it all, on our land and off our shores, above our heads and under our feet and there is no reason that millions of new American jobs cannot be created from utilizing shale oil, coal to gas, renewable sources, retooling our auto industry, conservation, clean and safe nuclear, hydrogen, solar, wind or any other form of energy.
\
Connecticut has every resource needed to become a leader in new technologies and product development for the New Energy era beginning today -- especially in areas concerning the environmental impact of existing and emerging technologies.
\
If elected to Congress I promise to look out for the small businessman because I am one, watch out for big business and call out all those who would continue to make energy a political football for special interest.

\
Free Press Betrayed: Of all the forces that combined to involve our country in warfare, the mass media must be reckoned the most blameworthy. Print and broadcast reporters cheered loudly and almost unanimously with each wave of bombings and troop deployments.
\
They presented a parade of government shills, posing as experts, to convince Americans that killing people in foreign lands would be a sound policy. They suppressed all dissident opinion and allowed no moral reservations to be expressed.
\
Today, after almost seven years of daily bloodshed, the war policy is in catastrophic failure, and the mass media have imposed a news blackout. The activities of soldiers in the field are not reported. The mission is unstated. The cost is never discussed. Soldiers' deaths are not mentioned except in the towns where they get buried and, even then, they're on the back pages. Reporters on the scene in Iraq and Afghanistan pass on information from Army press releases, but they don't say what they are seeing or why they're not talking.
\
This is censorship, and it's an abuse of the rights conferred on the free press by our Constitution. I challenge this newspaper to act responsibly and professionally.
\
Corrupt Government: Among our leaders are people so thoroughly influenced by private interests that they are incapable of acting on behalf of the public. The corruption of government transcends political party and extends from local officials all the way up to governors and presidents.
\
Our electoral system, depending as it does so heavily on money, makes it easier for unethical people of both parties to hold public office.
\
Connecticut voters have seen corruption up close, and the federal government is even worse. Several former members of the House of Representatives are serving jail terms. Not a single one was exposed by his colleagues in Congress. Unfortunately, members' loyalty is to each other and not to ethics and the rule of law.
\
From the voter's standpoint, it appears that the point of serving in Congress is to generate lucrative government contracts for your district, to be performed by privileged, politically-connected patrons. There seems to be an agreement between the crooks and their facilitators to keep this system intact.
\
As a lawyer and a non-Democrat, non-Republican with a record of activism, I will bring honest people together to clean up this mess.

Crime Prevention: Restore the importance of fatherhood: 95% of male prisoners have never had a significant positive relationship with any father figure. And, many of these prisoners have children with whom they have no relationship. We need to break this cycle and reduce repeat offenses by prisoners.
\
I have advocated the Fatherhood Task Force to bring together all parties involved with families, children and law enforcement. This initiative will review existing state policies and determine how to change them to encourage the importance of fathers in their children's lives.

There are state programs that inadvertently discourages interaction between fathers and their sons and daughters.

\
Taxes: It took 350 years for Connecticut's budget to reach $7 billion. Just seventeen years later, the budget has nearly tripled and now stands at $18.4 billion.
\
Connecticut must fundamentally alter a mindset by which politicians -- and the public -- do not seriously question efforts to raise taxes and to keep state spending at current levels. Because of this mindset, Connecticut finds itself unable to compete with other states for businesses and jobs.
\
Today we face a $300 million deficit. This is a deficit which everyone saw coming, except the Connecticut Legislature. Last year, when we briefly experienced a $1 billion surplus and a flush Rainy Day Fund, the legislature voted for a $800 million tax and spending package. Had that tax and spending package passed, the deficit would be $1.1 billion today.
\
Still, the legislature seems unable to see the effect of its actions. They do not understand that Connecticut's private sector is increasingly unable to support the state budget, and so chooses more often to take its business to another state altogether.
\
Our choice is simple: raise taxes or decrease spending. But increasing taxes only drives businesses away. It's time to make Connecticut competitive again by controlling spending, reducing taxes and encouraging economic growth.

Creating and retaining high-quality jobs: If Connecticut is going to maintain its high quality of living, it is vital that we create more high-quality jobs, and keep the jobs that we do have. For too long, Connecticut has lagged behind almost all the other states when it comes to job growth, and the effects have been profound: More and more families struggling to make ends meet, and higher taxes because there are fewer people contributing.
\
In order to start growing jobs, we must do the following:
\
Stabilize health care costs by creating a pool for small businesses and their employees to join. Lower energy costs by investing in alternative energy. Improve our outdated transportation infrastructure
\
Of course other reforms are needed, such as building a better educated work force, streamlining government so businesses aren't hampered by a sea of red tape and increasing the availability of affordable housing.
\
As Senate president, I am proud of our accomplishment in these areas - just this past session we passed legislation that would lower health care costs for small businesses. I believe we can - and must - do more, and that will be one of my top priorities in the Senate.

The Economy:
\
Stabilizing the economy and lowering the cost of energy: During this time of economic struggle, we will be asked to do more to protect our families.
\
My priority is most definitely working on our tax code to try to achieve greater fairness for all citizens. When our tax obligation is equitably shared, the majority of people within our community will experience financial relief. Reforming our tax code is a responsible and effective measure to ensure all our citizens fare better in these difficult economic times.
\
For those who are worried about how to heat their homes this winter, we have already increased the funds available for heating assistance and I promise to remain vigilant for any increasing need. Though this assistance may suffice currently, I am committed to long-term solutions to remedy this crisis. It is unacceptable that big oil and gas companies are making millions while families are struggling to heat their homes.
\
Issues of the economy, environment, and cost of fuel can all be addressed by pursuing alternative and renewable energy sources. I have also supported tax credits to help homeowners buy Energy Star appliances or upgrade to more efficient furnaces.

Taxes: Connecticut's reputation for being a high tax state is known nationally. It is the primary reason that it is so expensive to live and work here.
\
Last year, my opponent, chairman of the budget and appropriations committee, proposed and voted for the single largest tax increase since the inception of the income tax.
\
This year, in an attempt to tax residents even further, my opponent proposed a tax on delivery services. Whenever you shipped a package to a relative or had medical services delivered to your home, the state would have taxed the delivery. In a state already burdened with high taxes, my opponent proposes more of the same.
\
As your state senator, I will reject calls to raise taxes at the state level. We need to move beyond the tired, old practices of taxing people first while proposing an expansion in the size and scope of government. With budget deficits now projected in the billions of dollars, I will work to ensure that we can close the budget gap without raising taxes on a population that is already taxed too much. To assist our towns in the 33rd District, I will also support legislation that places a cap on the growth of local property taxes.

The Budget: The main item the General Assembly needs to focus upon, in the short term, is our budget shortfall. The office of fiscal analysis, a nonpartisan office, estimates a budget deficit of almost $300 million in 2009 and over $1 billion in 2010 and 2011.
\
The shortfall is the result of the tax revenues coming in much lower than estimated. In my opinion, this is unlikely to be a short term problem due to the financial situation in the state and the nation.
\
The General Assembly needs to focus its spending in four basic areas, public education, public safety, public health and infrastructure. We cannot continue funding high-risk ventures such as the convention center. We need to stop giving away millions of taxpayers' dollars for film tax credits and tax credits to major corporations. We need to get back to the basics.

Tax policy reform: It is clear to me that we cannot continue to put the greatest percentage of the cost of town services on property tax. That is why I have joined a subcommittee of the legislature's smart growth committee to work with others to provide recommendations for tax reform for the 2009 legislative session.
\
We are evaluating personal and business property tax burdens in Connecticut as compared to others states and as compared to towns within our state. The end result hopefully will provide modifications and alternatives to our present system of taxation that will provide relief to our citizens and also promote smarter land use policies. Such policies would aim to control sprawl and encourage development where infrastructure already exists.
\
The state would need to fund a much larger share of education and fully fund PILOT for that portion of revenue that the towns lose due to state-mandated property tax exemptions. If new state revenues are provided in order to reduce the local property tax burden, the legislature will also need to adopt measures to ensure municipal fiscal accountability so that taxpayers see property tax relief.
\
Property tax relief is my highest priority, and I am committed to moving it forward in the next session.

Rebuild our economy: The most serious issue facing us is the economy. Connecticut has seen a decline in the work force at major employers such as defense and insurance industries for decades.
\
Small businesses now are the backbone of the state economy, yet the state legislature seems determined to close us down with crushing regulations and unnecessary fees, as well as energy costs that discourage new businesses from locating here.
\
We should review the regulations and fee structures with an eye to eliminating those that are unnecessary and redundant. We should roll back the taxes on gasoline and other forms of fuel to bring our energy costs in line with other states.
\
We have a fantastic location between the New York City and Boston metropolitan areas, and Interstate highways that could be the pride of the nation. But our infrastructure has not been maintained, we have minimal public transportation, thus our prime location is being squandered.
\
Try asking small businesses owners how they feel about the business equity tax, a supposedly ""one-time"" fee of $250, now charged annually just to register a business. This tax was originally enacted in 2003 to cover a projected deficit.
\
But it is still on the books and just one small example of the overwhelming burden of business regulations. The current legislature has shown no inclination to relieve these unnecessary burdens.
\
A new course must be taken and as a business owner, my experience and knowledge is what is needed to right this course.

Taxes: Reduce property taxes by properly funding education: Property taxes and education funding are two critical issues that are inextricably linked. Educating our children is essential to our economic future and we need adequate funding to provide a top-rate education.
\
The local property tax system is outdated and inefficient for meeting the needs of our communities, driving a wedge between families with children versus families who are retired or on fixed incomes. This is unfair to all of our communities. State government has a responsibility to properly fund education and provide property tax relief.
\
I will work to see that it happens. We can free up the necessary revenue to do this by eliminating or consolidating state programs. We need to provide incentives for municipalities to work collaboratively to reduce duplication of services and create economies of scale regarding purchases of capital equipment and delivery of local services. Connecticut will not be the state that it can be without reforming our property tax system.

Economic Relief: Connecticut citizens are presently burdened by some of the highest taxes and highest prices, for gas, food, electricity and housing in the nation. My wife and I are lifelong Connecticut residents. Our state has been a great place to grow up, live, work and raise our children. Unfortunately, it now costs too much for many families, especially our seniors with fixed incomes, to live here.
\
If elected to the General Assembly I pledge to work for economic relief for our citizens. We need to cut wasteful government spending, while still providing essential services. In this way, the new legislature can lower taxes so that families can have more disposable income for the necessities of life.

Taxes:The property tax system is regressive and needs to be comprehensively reformed.
\
We must find other ways to raise revenues and reduce cost to provide the services necessary to meet the community needs. Towns and cities must review how these services are delivered and how they can be more cost-effective.
\
Towns and cities perform duplicate work that can be delivered with scale of economy when combined. This approach requires regional cooperation among municipalities to achieve the quality of life our citizens expect.
\
This type of cooperation is not generally accepted by municipalities but must be demanded by our citizenry to ease their burden on the cost of government. With incentives for towns and cities to work cooperatively, I believe this approach can be achieved through Smart Growth policies.

Educational funding: Adequate funding for our school has been and continues to be an incredible financial burden on to the towns in the 11th Assembly District.
\
It will be my goal to make sure that both communities I represent receive the educational cost sharing dollars that are committed to them by the state education funding formula.
\
During my term as mayor of East Hartford, we were the town that was most underfunded when it came to education funding. I worked with the legislative delegation to make sure East Hartford's state education aid was increased. As a result, we were able to make good progress in closing the funding gap.
\
The underfunding of the ECS formula by the state simply translates to increased local property taxes or reduction in needed education programs and services at the local level. Neither option is acceptable.
\
We need to keep the ECS funding formula working. We also need to find cost savings inside education budgets. I believe significant savings can be found in shared service agreements between the town and boards of education for non-classroom/curriculum expenses such as benefits, facilities and data processing. In addition, salaries and benefits need to be in line with a town's ability to pay. Health insurance co-pay and deductibles are tools that towns need to continue to use to make health benefits affordable.
\
In addition we need to ask the federal government to live up to its commitment of more funds for special education and to adequately fund the No Child Left Behind law.

The Cost of Higher Education: Controlling the cost of higher education and exploring ways for students to pay for it is a top priority.

I believe that access to state colleges should not be hindered because of an applicant's financial hardship.

This proposal, called the Higher Education Perpetual Trust Fund bill, passed unanimously in the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, the legislative clock ran down and the measure did not get onto the Senate agenda.

Health Care for All: I believe in universal health care, but if anything should be clear at this point, it's that achieving universal health care is going to be a challenge for years to come. Meanwhile, healthcare costs have skyrocketed and have become cost prohibitive for many.
\
One interim solution to this problem is to make use of underutilized medical resources in our communities. We have, for instance, community health centers, non-profit organizations that enjoy special privileges under federal law, including substantial funding. I believe that these centers can provide the backbone of a community-based health care network. I have worked hard over the last several years to ensure that the state work closely with the centers to enable them to provide more care to more people.
\
In the last session, I promoted a pilot project to make care from specialists available for patients at these centers. I also will be working with hospitals and the centers to decrease the number of unnecessary emergency room visits. This can be accomplished through the use of new software systems that allow hospitals to redirect patients seeking non-emergency care to the centers by making appointments on the spot. It is estimated that these efforts could save the Medicaid program $4 billion nationally and $200 million in Connecticut.

Control Taxation and Spending: Tough economic times, soaring energy costs, lack of affordability in housing and healthcare and the demand for transportation and infrastructure improvements barely scratches the surface of needed state reform.
\
In the last 32 of 34 years, under a Democratically controlled House of Representatives, Connecticut has achieved the highest federal, state and local taxes per capita, one of only four states to fully tax pensions, third highest state in electricity rates and the highest gas tax in the nation.
\
I have a plan to halt the endless cycle of runaway spending and to ease the burden that high energy costs are placing on our families. My plan reduces the size and cost of state government through voluntary early retirement, prioritizes spending projects and creates energy and cost efficiencies.
\
Through sensible action we can bring begin bringing energy costs under control by: 1) Increasing funding for energy conservation in businesses and homes; 2) Continuing the ""Clean Slate"" Program for families struggling to keep up with electric bills; 3) Expanding Operation Fuel for the working and middle class; And 4) Repealing the Gross Receipts Tax increase to control gasoline prices.

Business: Connecticut must shed its reputation as an anti-business state. Unemployment here is now higher than the national average. During the first half of this year, approximately 3,000 businesses closed in our state.
\
This past year, I co-sponsored a bipartisan bill that would have required a business impact statement for proposed legislation. We ought to know whether new laws will spur job losses or otherwise affect business in our state. Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership would not allow this proposal to come to a vote. I will strongly support it again this coming year.
\
There are some simple things we can do to start improving the business climate. One is to eliminate the business entity tax that is paid by all employers, large or small for the right to exist every year. Another is to modify the rules that give tax credits to companies for creating jobs. Most new businesses are not traditional stock companies and are therefore not eligible for the tax credit no matter how many new people they hire. This puts Connecticut at a disadvantage compared with many other states in attracting new businesses.

Improving education and working for property tax relief: Improving education and fixing its funding problems is a major struggle that Connecticut families are facing.
\
One of the impediments to improving public education in Connecticut is the over reliance on property taxes. About 70 percent of Glastonbury's budget goes toward funding its schools, and the percentage is climbing each year.
\
For towns without Glastonbury's commercial tax base, the problem is even worse. The unintended consequence of the pressure to expand local grand lists is the development of open space - thus destroying the character of our towns. There must be a bigger commitment from the state to finance public education.
\
This term, I fought for a $2.8 million increase in state funding to Glastonbury, which can be used to directly lower property taxes.

Budget: When the income tax was adopted in 1991, the state budget was $7 billion. We were told that the income tax would provide stability in state financing. After 15 years of the Democratic juggernaut in the General Assembly, the budget is $17 billion, and I don't think we are getting two-and-half times the benefit.

Democrats voted to increase taxes by $1.6 billion when we had a $1 billion surplus two years in a row.

Unlike the incumbent, I would vote in favor of phasing out the income tax on pensions and the succession tax, both of which discourage retirees from remaining in Connecticut; support health insurance tax credits for small businesses and individuals; support the ""Learn Here, Live Here"" program that provides incentives for Connecticut college graduates to remain in the state; and support the early childhood reading program.
\
To pay for that, we need to operate state government more efficiently and cut costly pork barrel construction projects.

It is with honor that I represent the constituency of the 48th Assembly District. I respect each and every opinion on issues facing our state and encourage people to contact me with ideas and concerns. This past year I worked with a local resident to pass legislation offering a wider range of choices to automobile owners on where they can repair their vehicle after an accident. The insurance industry often steers claimants toward ""preferred"" shops, which in many cases cuts other small businesses out of the picture. This law now helps the consumer stay better informed. I have also advocated for regional fire training schools , for slowing the loss of our small farms and dairy producers, funding private providers and of course making sure the state gives back to our communities by funding LOCAL projects. The economic problems of our state and nation will cause a hit on state revenues during the next term. My main goal will be holding on to current programs that serve the public. Cutting ConnPACE or Husky would only cause further hardship for populations that are already venerable and in need of relief. My promise to my district is to continue striving to help my constituents and my communities. I will work hard to address any and all issues that I am confronted with. I live in Colchester with my husband and have resided here for 29 years. I have served on local boards and commissions and have held the position of state representative since 1997. Currently serving as deputy majority Leader.

Progress and Opportunity: The single greatest concern I have is for the ability of my 6- year-old granddaughter, Hanna, to inherit from her mom; from us, her grandparents, and from our respective generations (baby boomers) and generation X, a state and a country where she will have the opportunity to succeed beyond what we, as her mentors, have provided for her.

Taxes: Property tax fairness is overdue, but can only be accomplished by general tax reform featuring a truly progressive income tax which taxes the people of Connecticut on the basis of ability to pay. A creative legislative solution is necessary. On May 9, 2008, a New York Times editorial noted that since 1987, the incomes of Connecticut's wealthiest residents have risen by 44% while incomes of our poorest residents fell by 17%.
\
The rich are getting richer and the poor poorer faster in Connecticut than in any other state. We rely on the property tax to the great detriment of people on fixed incomes and lower income people and communities and our state income tax is one of the least progressive in the nation.
\
We must make our income tax more progressive by increasing the assessment on those who earn more than $500,000, a year and have a much greater ability to pay. A relatively small increase on those who earn the most income and the allocation of those additional funds to unfairly taxed communities like my Town of Windham would give currently disadvantaged communities the chance to provide better educational opportunities for students who need help the most.
\
A fair and equitable property tax policy will keep property taxes down, increase smart development in our cities, and diminish the annual internecine battles between taxpayers who support increases in the education budget and those who cannot afford to pay for it.

Connecticut's fiscal responsibility (spending) and jobs are top issues people talk to me most often about. I'm running for state representative of the 53rd District to give Tolland, Willington and Ashford a voice in Hartford. The first thing I would like to use that voice for is to tell the state and legislature to live within its means.
\
To be competitive with the other states for businesses and jobs, we must first get our own house in order starting with balancing Connecticut's budget, which is in deficit by over $300 million.
\
As state representative my top priorities would be the towns I seek to represent, voters and Connecticut, not party politics. Solving the challenges of today will require Legislators willing to set partisan politics aside to reduce state spending, and increase revenue by bringing businesses and jobs to Connecticut.

Health Care: The State and its citizens must address the high cost of health care immediately. It is the largest cost driver of both state and local budgets, increasing by double digits for the past few years. Hopefully, a comprehensive solution will be proposed at the national level, but there are a number of things we can and should do to improve our health care system.
\
I propose increasing funding for the existing health care clinic system. This would relieve the increasing reliance on emergency room care, be much more cost effective, accessible and bring additional federal dollars to the state.
\
I also support increased use of statewide pools to bring down the cost of health insurance and make it more accessible for employees of small businesses and non-profits. We should rely on the newly created Health Authority to develop stronger policies and purchasing practices, along with cost/benefit analyses of different insurance plans, including those for the Medicaid, Husky and state employee health plans.
\
The state is one of the largest purchasers of health insurance in the state, and should use its buying power to streamline the system. I will work to promote these and other policies with an eye toward increasing access to good and affordable health insurance for every citizen of the state while getting the cost of health care under control.

The State Budget: In a bad economy common sense dictates that no taxes should be raised, but rather spending cuts must be made to a the $17 billion budget and seek more federal dollars for highway funds to fix roads and bridges, for health care and family planning.
\
In today's uncertain times, government should finally get rid of unsuccessful programs. The legislature needs to get its own house in order, and that means cutting Connecticut's unwieldy state budget.
\
Here's an idea: Millions of dollars could be saved in our budget if many office employees were cross-trained to be able to fill in when needed in other jobs when there is a lull to work in a department where there is a crush of work.

Affordable and Accessible Health Care: Although the availability of health clinics, the state Husky Insurance Program for children and, hopefully, the State Charter Oak Plan will ease access somewhat, too many people are still going without health insurance because they simply cannot afford the premiums.
\
This is particularly prevalent for the unemployed, young adults and those who are self-employed. Although we are exploring a number of additional options to help our citizens, it is a problem nationwide and we, as a state, must continue to pursue greater funding at the federal level to help us in this effort.

The Budget: In recent years, the Connecticut General Assembly has made our beloved state unaffordable. The residents of Connecticut have reached a breaking point, and it is time for change in the state legislature. Legislators have allowed the state budget to balloon to epic proportions while seeing revenues decline at a steady pace.
\
We are now entering the realization that next year's budget will be faced with a deficit reaching into the hundreds of millions.
\
With this budgetary prospect, unless new members are elected to the legislature, we will see our taxes raised once again so the legislature can continue its spending spree at our expense.
\
We are all now facing tough personal budget decisions, so why should the legislature be any different? As your legislator, I will work tirelessly to make Connecticut more affordable by supporting legislation that lowers taxes while limiting spending in Hartford so real change can take place in our legislature.
\
The time for limitless spending and excessive tax increases has passed, and change is needed to steer Connecticut back in the direction of affordability and an efficient, balanced budget.

Taxes: With Connecticut's economy booming, the state government has had budget surpluses each of the past four years. This year, the governor and legislature voted to return more than $115 million in rebates to taxpayers. Do you support continued tax cuts in 1999? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Gary D. LeBeau
\
I have supported reducing the income tax, slashing the gas tax and decreasing the property tax burden on the taxpayer. Connecticut must have a balanced budget so we must be fiscally prudent in making decisions on cutting taxes. Relieving the tax burden is important but we must keep our fiscal house in order. I support careful monitoring of state spending including performance reviews of state agencies which may lead to further tax cuts.
\
Patrick Kennedy
\
Yes. Connecticut's taxpayers have been overburdened by taxes in general and the state income tax in particular. I support a four-year phase-out of the income tax, a program which will allow taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money, benefit the economy by fueling economic growth and preventing spending increases and the starting of new programs that would create pressure for tax increases if the economy were to slow.
\
Patients' rights: Government regulation of managed care has become a major issue in Connecticut and nationally. Democrats such as gubernatorial candidate Barbara Kennelly and U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd support a ""patients' bill of rights"" that they say would force managed care companies to put patient care ahead of profits. Do you support a patients bill of rights, including the right to sue a managed care company? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Gary D. LeBeau
\
I strongly support giving a patient the ability to sue HMOs for negligent decisions that cause injury. HMOs are consistently second- guessing physician diagnosis and treatment recommendations. If physicians can be sued for negligent decisions, so should HMOs. Patients should also have the right to keep their physician after an HMO drops the doctor from the network. There should be equal benefits for both men and women and for physical and mental illness.
\
Patrick Kennedy
\
HMOs should not be exempt from liability for the damage that their negligence may cause; if they allow low-level file clerks to second- guess the medical judgments of doctors, they should bear the consequences. The legislature should not mandate coverage of particular conditions or procedures that people may not want to pay for ---- but the ability of HMOs to deny payment on the basis of technicalities should be curbed.
\
Megan's Law: The state has a version of Megan's Law on the books, requiring that sex offenders register with police. A new version of the law, allowing state police to post the name of sex offenders on the Internet, goes into effect Jan. 1. Some lawmakers say the state needs to go further and require widespread community notification when a sex offender moves into a neighborhood. Others say the community's safety outweighs those concerns. Do you support further expansion of Megan's Law to require community notification? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Gary D. LeBeau
\
Dangerous sexual predators should be kept in prison or a secure facility. Although we made great strides in toughening Megan's Law, I support the enactment of local police guidelines for greater community notification of sexual offenders.
\
Patrick Kennedy
\
Yes. Since criminal convictions are a matter of public record, convicted criminals have no right to object to the dissemination of that public information. Community notification is of more practical value than the measures enacted up to this point. The law should only be applied, however, to persons whose behavior raises genuine concerns that they are dangerous to the community.
\
Environmental protection: Kennelly and some employees at the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have complained that, under Gov. John Rowland, the agency has not been enforcing environmental regulations stringently enough. Do you believe the DEP adequately enforces environmental regulations? If so, do you think criticism of the DEP is valid? If you do not think enforcement is satisfactory, do you think legislation is needed to ensure that it improves?
\
Gary D. LeBeau
\
DEP has not been vigorously enforcing our environmental laws. Referrals to the attorney general's office declined until recent Hartford Courant reports led to more referrals. I support the Program Review and Investigation Committee's review of DEP practices and would support legislation to ensure more aggressive protection of our environment. Our environment is the legacy which we leave our children. We need to continue to protect our dwindling open spaces from development.
\
Patrick Kennedy
\
There is no evidence that the state's environment is any worse than it was four years ago; the DEP is merely being criticized for being less litigious than it was four years ago, which is inconclusive as an indicator of environmental quality. Of greater significance than the question of whether DEP is adequately administering a system of `command and control' regulation is whether that is the best approach to regulating pollution; imposing taxes upon pollution generated and letting companies devise the most efficient and effective systems to avoid discharges would best harmonize environmental quality and economic growth.

132,"
When gasoline was $4.45 a gallon, we longed for the good old days of $2 gas. As gas peaked last summer, we cursed our gas-guzzlers and wished Detroit hadn't frittered away the chance to develop more efficient cars before gas went through the roof. And now we're getting a chance to catch our breath, even as Detroit is begging for a public bailout. Despite the recession, credit crunch and $1.79 gasoline, inspired thinkers and engineers are out there betting a lot on exciting alternatives to the status quo.
\
They know, and we know, that gas prices will return to painful heights before long.
\
On a rainy midday last week, Frank Kuchinski stood in front of a lecture hall of students and professors at the University of New Haven to talk about one of those plans.
\
His company's Poulsen Hybrid system can turn your Jetta, Corolla or other compact car into a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle in just four hours -- boosting your gas mileage by 50 percent.
\
Batteries in your compact car's trunk will power small electric motors at the rear wheels for up to 30 miles of travel. Then at night, you plug the system (it looks a little like a parking-violation ""boot"") into your garage's electric outlet to recharge.
\
""You don't have to have a fear of when your batteries will run out; when they do, it's a traditional gas car,"" Kuchinski said.
\
But don't beat down his door today; Poulsen Hybrid isn't selling its rear-axle add-on just yet. Operating within the 5-acre business home of transformer maker Bridgeport Magnetics Group in Shelton, Poulsen Hybrid is still in the testing phases; and like many of these ""green"" start-ups, it really could use some tax incentives to help pay for the $4,500-$9,000 cost of each consumer retrofit.
\
Despite all the hot air by politicians about alternative fuels, about cutting our dependence on foreign oil and about fighting global warming, there are no Connecticut tax breaks that apply to such hybrid electric vehicles for consumers.
\
""Consumer incentive programs in Connecticut to encourage consumers to purchase greener hybrid vehicles have all expired,"" Kuchinksi says. And yet, every gallon of gas saved means 19 pounds of carbon dioxide isn't released into the environment. And more than 40 percent of air pollution in New England is created by vehicles, studies show.
\
My green-minded daughter drives a Toyota Prius, a breakthrough hybrid vehicle that averages more than 44 miles per gallon. But she paid more than I've ever paid for a car to get it (and I averaged 44 mpg in my 1985 dirty-diesel Jetta).
\
Chevrolet, one of the brands that may not survive without federal money, will introduce a plug-in electric vehicle (with a small gas-engine backup) in 2010.
\
The Chevy Volt will be expensive (with a tax break written specially for it in the Wall Street bailout bill), but not as pricey as the all-electric cars out there now: the $109,000 Tesla (a ""rocket ship,"" says Kuchinski) and the $80,000 Fisker Karma.
\
The Poulsen system looks like a bargain compared to those, but it would be more affordable if mass production of lithium-ion batteries could bring costs down. The system also works with cheaper lead batteries, but they only last a year or so compared to lithium-ion variety's seven or eight years.
\
Kuchinksi says American battery companies are few, and one told him it couldn't sell him batteries because it had an exclusive deal with one of the Big 3 automakers. (There's a reason to let Detroit fail, right there.)
\
Other forces may be in the way, too. Consider that the gas tax in Connecticut funds (partly) road and bridge improvements. If, as Kuchinski hopes, Poulsen sells 10,000 units its first year, that's a lot of gas saved and a lot of tax money the state won't see.
\
Which is one reason the state needs to act now, urges Kuchinksi, while gas is relatively cheap. He suggests a nickel increase in the gas tax for green incentives such as new or converted plug-in hybrids. ""No one likes tax increases, but we need to do something to clean up our air, and the benefits to all Connecticut citizens would be cleaner air and a reduction in the demand for foreign oil.""
\
Kuchinski notes that while electric power has costs and pollution issues, too, the Poulsen system would likely be plugged in at night when the power companies have more capacity. He says a discount from power companies for plug-in owners would also help the cause.
\
There are federal tax credits in place for adding home insulation, storm doors and windows. But this day at UNH -- as officials announced a partnership with Poulsen for UNH students to get involved with the product's research, testing and design -- the talk was cars. The Poulsen design would add 7 horsepower (5kW) to the power of a car at medium speeds when it's engaged. Kuchinski says he's driven a prototype, and handling is not compromised. There may even be a benefit for traction because of the rear-wheel power.
\
Green start-ups like Poulsen's are hoping for a different kind of traction in a state known only for another kind of green: old money.

133,"WASHINGTON - Top Democratic congressional leaders cast aside a brewing showdown over presidential oversight Monday and pitched President Donald Trump on a ""big and bold"" infrastructure bill ahead of a White House meeting on the issue, insisting there are ""significant majorities in both the House and Senate"" ready to act.\House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are set to meet Trump on Tuesday, joined by other leading Democrats. In a letter sent Monday, the pair asked Trump to entertain infrastructure legislation with ""substantial, new and real revenue"" - as opposed to previous GOP plans that have focused on using smaller amounts of public money to leverage private investments. They did not specify a dollar figure for the package, though many have discussed $1 trillion as a bare minimum.\Paying for such an investment is the major challenge, and potential revenue sources all carry political risks. Lawmakers from both parties have discussed increasing the federal gas tax for the first time since 1993, but Democrats are eyeing a rollback of the Republican tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017.\A Democratic official close to Schumer said the Senate leader would not consider a gas tax hike - which would be a disproportionate burden on working-class voters - unless Republicans consider undoing some of their tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity.\""We look forward to hearing your ideas on how to pay for this package to ensure that it is big and bold enough to meet our country's needs,"" the leaders wrote to Trump on Monday.\Pelosi and Schumer also said any infrastructure bill must address ""clean energy and resiliency priorities"" and expand ""beyond transportation and into broadband, water, energy, schools, housing and other initiatives."" They also call for ""strong Buy America, labor, and women, veteran and minority-owned business protections.""\The Democratic leaders' emphasis on bipartisanship comes at a time when relations between the White House and congressional Democrats could hardly be worse, with Trump determined to resist virtually every effort on Capitol Hill to investigate and check his administration.

WHEN WILL SCHOOL PROMISE BE KEPT?
\
The Jan. 28 editorial ""Too Many Magnets? No"" misses the central point of Bruce Douglas' criticism of the steps the state has taken under the Sheff case to integrate Hartford's schoolchildren [Jan. 24, Page 1, ""Magnet School Creator: Stop""]. His central concern is that a plan has never been developed that describes when all of the city's minority children will attend integrated schools and how the state and municipalities will achieve that goal.
\
Although the substantial cost of expanding and maintaining the magnet school system and the use of a lottery system to determine who attends integrated schools and who is left behind are important concerns, the most important question is when will all of the children covered by the Sheff lawsuit actually attend integrated schools.
\
As the U.S. Supreme Court and the Connecticut Supreme Court have held, placing children in segregated schools results in education that is ""inherently unequal."" Our goal, therefore, must be to place all Sheff children in integrated schools with all deliberate speed.
\
As Mr. Douglas pointed out, public officials have clearly not moved with deliberate speed over the past 20 years to provide an integrated education or even develop a plan to provide an integrated education to the 55 percent of Sheff children who still attend segregated schools.

SURGERY CENTER TAX CRIPPLING
\
During this past legislative session, a 6 percent gross-receipts tax on ambulatory surgery centers was passed. This tax, the highest in the nation, was imposed without a public hearing and no understanding of its impact on Connecticut's health care system. Very few states tax such surgery centers, and Rhode Island just repealed its 2 percent tax.
\
I appreciated the opportunity to meet with state Rep. Jeffrey Berger to discuss the detrimental effects of this tax on our practice and patients. This tax, which will hurt patients in Connecticut, is applied before any expenses are deducted, creating a system of double taxation.
\
Ambulatory surgery centers are small businesses that pay taxes on income, sales and property. This new tax jeopardizes patient options by putting these surgery centers in our state at risk of closing. Connecticut should be supporting ambulatory surgery centers, especially when their services cost about 50 percent less than hospitals. Annually, ambulatory surgery centers save Medicare $2 billion and Connecticut patients more than $1 million in out-of-pocket expenses for colonoscopies alone.
\
As chairman of the finance committee, Rep. Berger's leadership on repealing the tax will be critical this session. I hope that he and his colleagues consider these issues carefully.

A REGIONAL APPROACH TO GAS TAX
\
Connecticut has a critical and growing budget problem, along with deteriorating roads and infrastructure, and limited options on how to dig out of this mess. This problem is not limited to Connecticut, but is shared by neighboring states. One bright spot is that we enjoy the lowest fuel prices we have seen in years.
\
I modestly propose regional cooperation in raising fuel taxes. I recommend doing it regionally simply because the benefit grows with regional cooperation, and I also believe that pushing for a regional agreement could add some needed impetus to this initiative at individual state houses.
\
I'm proposing something like this: Gov. Dannel P. Malloy could suggest to other governors that we cooperate on individually raising our fuel taxes (say, 60 cents per gallon incrementally over six years). We would take the lead on this and work toward having another state join us, such as Massachusetts, with an open agreement that others can join later. The tax would be applied as now at the state level with perhaps a small percentage set aside for regional transportation such as improved rail service.
\
The benefits of this approach include a path out of budget crises, regional cooperation, improved infrastructure, and a boost for conservation and the environment.

TOLLS ARE IDEAL USER FEES
\
I very much appreciated the Jan. 26 editorial ""No Raising CT Gas Tax Without A Lockbox"" [courant.com].
\
Fuel taxes and tolls are considered ""user fees,"" where drivers are paying a share of the cost of providing and preserving the roads they are using.
\
The first principle of a tolled facility is to return a benefit to the toll-payer in the form of a well-maintained and safe road that flows well. Even federal law recognizes that toll revenue should be applied first to the tolled facility before any other use is considered -- uses such as transit and other services that improve flow and increase carrying capacity in the same corridor.
\
I would contend that a toll is a more precise user fee than the fuel tax because it applies the money collected to the specific road the driver is using, but the basic principle of dedicating funds collected from users for the thing they use remains the same. Applying a legislative ""lockbox"" to ensure any funds collected are dedicated to transportation improvements is a powerful assurance to users being asked to pay more.

In their first head to head discussion in a year, the Democratic gubernatorial contenders had a civilized collegial exchange with most of the focus on their GOP rival, Gov. M. Jodi Rell. The two participated in a forum sponsored by the Democratic Women's Club of Westport and outlined how they were going to unseat the wildly popular Rell, who had an 81 percent approval rating in last month's Quinnipiac Poll.
\
""People in Connecticut are refusing to admit how unhappy and scared they are,"" said Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy, referring to the state's high costs and lack of growth. ""It's my job, quite frankly, to bring people screaming and kicking back to the issues.""
\
His Democratic rival, New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr., said ""who sits in these jobs in leadership makes a difference. This is up to us to build a positive vision of what we can do as a state.""
\
The event is the first of several encounters for the two planned over the next several weeks as the party picks delegates this week leading up to the May 20 convention and Aug. 8 primary.
\
Both support a higher investment to fix clogged highways and to improve rail service, while shifting some educational costs to the state and tax advantaging businesses that create jobs.
\
Malloy said Rell's lack of policies leaves us with ""a transportation system that serves none of our needs and spoils our environment, a job environment which does not allow jobs to grow"" and a state that is ""more reliant on property taxes than any other for the payment of educational expenses.""
\
DeStefano blasted Rell's proposal to end local car taxes as lacking in vision.
\
""A half a billion dollar car tax forgiveness program that doesn't create one job was the centerpiece, super weapon of the governor's budget. It will not stop property tax rates from going up,"" DeStefano said.
\
Malloy called for a review of the $4.4 billion in tax exemptions in the state's tax code as a source of lost revenue, while both were open to a potential gas tax, possibly road tolls and bonding to support a sustained program to fix Connecticut's transportation infrastructure.
\
The Stamford mayor also proposed using the $425 million in gaming revenues for education, as they were originally intended, but DeStefano said this just opens up a gap elsewhere. He said shifting more education costs to higher income sources was a more permanent solution.
\
As to who was the better candidate, DeStefano said he works by finding common ground, pointing to his ability to bring people together as he did on the state study on property tax reform.
\
As the candidate who has raised the most funds, he said he plans, with the help of labor, to reach out to those Democrats and independents who vote Republican for governor and Democratic for the rest of the ticket.
\
Malloy said in Stamford he streamlined bureaucracy to get projects moving, added 5,000 jobs in his decade in office and always works by consensus. And importantly, he said he can cut into Rell's votes in heavily Republican Fairfield County.
\
But the criticism was mainly about Rell.
\
""This is a governor who denies she knows what her predecessor did, denies she knows what her chief of staff does, denies she knows what her campaign manager does. Quite frankly, it is an indictment of her leadership style, if that is true,"" said Malloy.
\
He was referring to her tenure as disgraced Gov. John G. Rowland's lieutenant governor, Chief of Staff Lisa Moody's pushing fund-raising tickets on agency heads and Campaign Manager Kevin Deneen's insider discussion with election officials.

\
ISSUE 1: Get Washington working for Connecticut: Standing up to the special interests to fight for people.
\
There aren't enough people in Washington standing up to the special interests to make sure the interests of the people come first. In tough times like these, people in Connecticut need a fighter in Washington to make Washington work for them. As attorney general, I've taken on the biggest special interests and the toughest opponents - like big tobacco, big energy and insurance companies, big Internet providers - to stand up and make a difference for the people of Connecticut. That's what I'll do as a United States senator.
\
This means standing up for small businesses instead of big Wall Street banks, so that our small businesses can get loans, tax breaks and incentives to save and create jobs. I'll fight to close tax loopholes for big corporations shipping jobs overseas and end the sweetheart deals that allow big drug companies to set prices for drugs in Medicare. And that's where I'll start cutting the budget, because we must reduce spending, but we don't have to do it on the back of senior citizens.
\
ISSUE 2: Made in Connecticut: Strengthening manufacturing, creating jobs.
\
Our workers are among the most talented in the world, but too often corporate profits and global pressures overpower their interests and those of local industry and our manufacturers and small businesses are hurt.
\
My ""Made in Connecticut"" initiative is designed to create jobs and promote industry by making ""Made in Connecticut"" and ""Made in America"" matter more in Washington. It includes ending tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas, combating Chinese currency manipulation that unfairly undermines the value of our products abroad, promoting clean energy and clean energy manufacturing through loans and tax credits and creating partnerships for workforce training. I've also proposed measures to provide immediate, targeted assistance to small businesses, which are the engine of job creation in our state. These include expanded tax cuts and tax credits to promote small business hiring and growth, direct lending and credit-card reform to ensure stable access to funding, and export assistance.
\
Small businesses create jobs. People create jobs. And sometimes their interests are trampled by big corporations and forces they can't fight. I've stood up for them, and taken on those fights - for the workers at Alderman Motors, at Pratt & Whitney and at businesses around our state - to save their jobs. I will take on their fights in Washington, too, so that ""Made in Connecticut"" creates jobs and opportunity in Connecticut.

\
ISSUE 1: Reviving job creation and economic growth.
\
Connecticut's unemployment rate is 9.1 percent, just shy of the national rate of 9.6 percent. Some economists are talking about a ""new normal"" of permanently high unemployment. Home values have plunged and the stock market is lethargic. I reject the notion that a declining standard of living is inevitable. As someone who has created more than 500 jobs in the private sector, I know what will - and what won't - get our economy moving again.
\
Small businesses, which create 70 percent of new jobs, should be incentivized. We must stop impending tax hikes on wages, salaries, capital gains and dividends. We must permanently abolish the death tax. Job-killing regulations, such as card check and cap and trade, cannot be allowed to become law. Expanding energy production, maintaining sound money and repealing unfair regulations and mandates that inhibit growth are also essential. People create jobs, not governments. As we saw with the failed ""stimulus,"" job growth does not come from politicians distributing borrowed money. It comes from empowering men and woman with a vision for their business and a desire to serve customers and reward shareholders.
\
ISSUE 2: Balancing the federal budget.
\
With a $13.5 trillion national debt, restoration of the federal government's solvency will not happen quickly. But there are steps that can be taken immediately. Unspent stimulus funds can be returned. Non-Defense discretionary spending can be restored to the level of fiscal year 2008, before the era of trillion-dollar annual budget deficits. It's time to freeze government hiring and compensation. (USA Today has found that ""the typical federal worker is paid 20 percent more than a private-sector worker in the same occupation."") Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be reformed. Ultimately, we must work to pass a balanced-budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a measure that will permanently end the irresponsible expenditure of money the American people don't have.
\
Our children and grandchildren are burdened with debt for decades to come. Washington must never again be allowed to put career politicians' desire for re-election ahead of the nation's solvency.

ISSUE 1: Remove fiscal drag
\
We need to remove fiscal drag with a full payroll tax (FICA) holiday for employees and employers to allow the private sector to add the 20 million good jobs we desperately need back. This tax cut increases take-home pay by more than 8 percent for people working for a living (which is more than $300 a month if you make $50,000 a year). We lost 8 million jobs in the last two years because sales fell off.
\
Instead of funding the banks and insurance companies with trillions of dollars, we need to stop taking trillions of dollars away from people working for a living, so they can resume normal spending patterns and sales can go back up and create all the jobs we need. I also propose $500 per capita of federal revenue sharing for the state government with no strings attached. That would provide the state of Connecticut with approximately $1.75 billion to help it through its financial crisis.
\
ISSUE 2: Federally funded jobs.
\
I am proposing a federally funded $8-per-hour job for anyone willing and able to work to facilitate the transition from unemployment to private sector employment. Employers don't like to hire the unemployed and my proposal for this type of transition employment has proven successful in Argentina in 2001, where it transitioned more than 1 million people to private-sector employment, and currently in India, where more than 100 million people have participated in the program, and helped India sustain some of the world's highest growth rates.

\
ISSUE 2: Repairing our economy and protecting it in the long term. Stimulus through a payroll-tax holiday for working people and small businesses (Flip The FICA), and requiring banks with more than $1 billion in assets to own 30 percent of every loan they make, for the lifetime of the loan. (This will prevent future mortgage crises.)
\
More about ""Flip The FICA"": Eliminate FICA taxes for employees and employers for incomes less than $100,000, and institute the current FICA tax of 7.65 percent only on additional income exceeding $100,000. This will allow working families to keep 7.65 percent more of their paychecks, which will help them pay their mortgages and spend reasonably. And it will reduce small businesses' payroll expenses by 7.65 percent. These two things in combination will create a tremendous amount of jobs, greatly reduce the rate of foreclosures, greatly reduce the rate of small-business failures, reduce government unemployment payments and get our economy back on track very quickly. Flipping the FICA also will discourage corporations from giving huge bonuses to their top executives, because they would have to pay the same FICA taxes on the bonuses as they used to pay on their lower-income workers' paychecks. And, believe it or not, it's revenue-neutral.

\
ISSUE 1: Creating good-paying American jobs.
\
My top priority has been and will continue to be creating and keeping good, high-paid jobs in our state. To do that, I believe we need to revitalize our manufacturing base and make sure we are making things in America again. American factories need to start humming and American workers need to see the rewards of a hard day's work. We need to make it easier for Connecticut companies to make it here and sell it around the world. America has led the world in every major technological innovation of the last century and that has been a driving force behind our economic growth. We can't afford to cede that ground now to other countries like China and Brazil.
\
I believe this country and this community can continue to lead if we make the decisions now to invest in the industries of the future. That's why I'm working with manufacturing companies right here in East Hartford, Manchester, Barkhamsted and all around my district to ensure that they are able to compete in a global economy, making world-class goods and exporting their goods overseas.
\
ISSUE 2: Middle-class tax relief.
\
I will continue to work hard to pass much-needed tax relief for middle-class Americans who are struggling to make ends meet. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to hold those tax cuts hostage in a deficit-busting scheme to extend $700 billion in Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. We can't afford to borrow money from China to fund tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, tax breaks we've already seen do nothing to create jobs or boost the economy.
\
Here's how my tax cuts would work. Every American family would get a tax break on their income up to $250,000 per year. That means that more than 97 percent of Americans would get a tax break on all of their income. For income exceeding that amount, tax rates would be at or below the rates that existed when President Clinton was in office and when the economy created 23 million jobs. While I have been working with my colleagues to pass tax relief for the middle class, Republicans are once again siding with their billionaire, and big corporation, friends.

\
ISSUE 1: Economy / jobs.
\
Priority one is getting people back to work so they can provide for their families. Washington's solution was the multibillion dollar stimulus bill, which was supposed to create 41,000 jobs here in Connecticut. Instead, only 7,600 jobs were created or saved at a cost to taxpayers of $350,000 per job. The stimulus bill failed to put people back to work because it does not encourage businesses to invest and hire. Government spending is not the solution. It is part of the problem.
\
We need sensible, pro-growth policies that encourage small businesses and private enterprises to invest more and add jobs. I support putting an end to the tax increases and eliminating unnecessary regulations and bureaucratic red-tape that add to the cost of doing business and stifle growth. In addition, we must rein in out-of-control government spending and remove the job-stifling uncertainty caused by the constant threat of new taxes and new regulations and mandates, such as Cap & Trade, and the union card check. We also need to repeal the onerous reporting mandates imposed on small businesses by the new Obama health care law. I also support tort reform legislation to protect businesses from frivolous lawsuits.
\
ISSUE 2: Government accountability and spending.
\
Congress has lost touch with mainstream America. The agenda it has imposed does not reflect the reality of most Americans, and is failing to boost our economy and help grow our workforce. It seems that party loyalty and a desire to pass partisan bills has trumped the will of the people. Citizens are losing faith in a Congress of career politicians who have mastered backroom deals and tricky maneuvering to push bills through before they are even reviewed and read.
\
I've listened to many people who are fuming over Washington forcing them to subsidize the irresponsible behavior of those rescued in bailouts. Responsible individuals and businesses work to a budget, and it's time Washington did, too. We need to enact legislation and reforms that establish strict budget caps to limit federal spending, eliminate wasteful programs and reduce the size of government. We should cancel unspent stimulus funds that are putting us further into debt. I will work for more openness and transparency in the legislative process to ensure bills are posted and debated before coming up for a vote, and solutions address the problems. I will also fight for term limits and promise to limit my service to eight years.

\
ISSUE 1: Job growth, upward mobility.
\
With the worst gap between rich and poor since the Great Depression, we must focus on creating job growth and upward mobility. The economic bill of rights proposed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which guarantees a job to anyone who wants one, must rank as our top priority.
\
Government spending must prime the economic pump to create jobs. A massive green jobs program modeled after the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II will put us on the road to economic recovery. We can reverse the slide that sent millions into poverty during the past decade by dedicating billions to creating equal opportunity employment for those who seek work. To help those who have given up after long-term unemployment, $10 an hour government public-works jobs can provide an opportunity to re-enter the workforce. People can move gradually to the private sector. But if they choose to stay in the public arena, so be it. These jobs can help rebuild our decaying infrastructure and our civil society. We can fix roads, bridges, schools, universities and hospitals. Public employees can clean up riverfronts and parks, and, as in the Great Depression, explore careers in arts and culture.
\
ISSUE 2: De-fund the wars.
\
The only way to end the illegal wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan is to de-fund them. The vast military-industrial complex - from the Pentagon to the Central Intelligence Agency to the National Security Agency - must experience a 70 percent cut in defense spending. In the economics of guns and butter (military vs. human resources), more than 50 percent of federal domestic discretionary spending goes to buy missiles, drones, planes, tanks and ships. Less than 15 percent goes to butter: food, education, health care and transit. We need to refocus federal priorities on human needs, and not weapons of war. As the world's largest military, we spend 15 times more on military than our closest rivals, Russia and China. To maintain the manufacturing base, we can transition those industries like Pratt & Whitney and Electric Boat towards peacetime manufacturing like mass transit. Other companies like Blackwater/Xe must face the corporate death penalty. While scaling back the bloated war machine, we should institute a truth and reconciliation commission to shine a light on the various war crimes and illegal black operations that our tax dollars have paid for during the previous decades. Wars only stop when we stop funding them.

ISSUE 1: War.
\
Bring all troops home now from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Haiti, Yemen and everywhere else in the world. Close all military bases. Cut all aid and political ties to apartheid Israel. End all military and military-related spending. Use the money saved toward a massive public-works program designed to combat the climate crisis and make an environmentally healthy and sustainable economy. Billions to care for veterans returning from war.
\
We propose cutting the military budget by 100 percent. In Connecticut, that would equal 17 billion tax dollars. With the $17 billion that Connecticut contributes to the U.S. military budget, we could do all the following at the same time: Put every 4-year-old in a Head Start program; double the number of elementary- and high-school teachers; pay college tuition for every 18- through 22-year-old; power all Connecticut homes with renewable wind-power; raise the state public-transportation budget by 1,000 percent; provide health insurance to every Connecticut resident currently without insurance; give every Connecticut resident older than 65 $2,000 a year to supplement Social Security and retirement; provide a job to every person in Connecticut who is officially unemployed with a wage of $50,000 a year.

ISSUE 2: Jobs.
\
The U.S. government has given trillions of dollars of our money to failed banks and corporations. Still, the profiteers will not and cannot release funds to create a single job. In fact, since the bailouts, unemployment has grown. Non-financial companies now sit on $1.8 trillion in cash, roughly one-quarter more than at the beginning of the recession. Giving the wealthy and their institutions more money will not create a single job. Investors now make their profits by forcing the remaining employed to work longer and faster for less pay. Higher unemployment makes it easier to squeeze profits out of workers and smash unions.
\
Only the independent action of masses of working people will force the bosses to end unemployment. We must demand: establish a mass jobs program; create full employment by reducing the work week while increasing pay and spreading out the available work; triple the federal minimum wage.
\
Workers create all the wealth. We have every right to decide how that wealth is used. We say: Place the largest banks, financial institutions, and corporations under public ownership and workers control. Organize workers committees to direct investment and production towards human needs instead of profit.

ISSUE 1: Economy.
\
My No. 1 priority is to help our economy recover and grow. That is why I have worked to create jobs, support small businesses and revitalize our manufacturing sector.
\
I was sent to Washington four years ago during the most trying economic period in a generation, and my primary goal is continuing to repair that damage to our economy, neighborhood by neighborhood. In my two terms in Congress, I have fought to support the priorities of eastern Connecticut: getting critical dredging conducted at our shoreline harbors, increasing jobs at Electric Boat, working to unlock credit for small businesses and supporting tax relief for families. I also have made a priority of restoring our nation's manufacturing base by ensuring that our small- and mid-sized manufacturers have the tools they need to ""make it in America."" And when asked to approve a taxpayer-funded bailout for the same Wall Street firms that recklessly crashed our economy, I voted no because it did not do enough to support struggling families and small businesses.
\
ISSUE 2: ""Make it in America""
\
American innovation and work ethic have long been the backbone of our economy. But the success of American manufacturing should not be just a proud part of our history; it should be a foundation of our economic future. That is why I am fighting for a ""Make it in America"" agenda that supports our manufacturing industry, invests in training new workers in new energy production and other emerging fields, and promotes Connecticut-made goods around the world.
\
I am proud to have helped eastern Connecticut manufacturers reduce costs and preserve jobs by winning critical tariff reductions for companies as part of the Manufacturing Enhancement Act. In addition, I successfully boosted resources to support new manufacturing training programs, ensuring that new graduates will be prepared for manufacturing fields like green energy and medical device production. And, I led two trade missions to find new markets for Connecticut-made goods abroad, helping our manufacturers find new customers and increase the number of jobs here in eastern Connecticut.

\
ISSUE 1: Economy.
\
Getting people back to work in eastern Connecticut is as simple as cutting taxes. Adding burdensome new health-care mandates to our small businesses will only make the problem worse. I support continuing the Bush tax cuts for all income levels. It is wrong to increase taxes on any segment of our country right now. If taxes are increased to people making $200,000/250,000, that affects small business owners. The wealthiest income bracket is still the population most likely to spend in the marketplace and to give dollars to fund charities.
\
I believe we should suspend the federal unemployment tax, which would save all employers $52 per worker, allowing some to make new hires. This would cost roughly $7 billion dollars, which would be paid for from a reduction in improper government payments, which last year totaled $98 billion dollars. I also will push to reduce corporate income tax, particularly for manufacturing companies to encourage them to stay in eastern Connecticut. A manufacturing company grows businesses exponentially, employing powder coaters, sheet-metal fabricators, electricians and others to keep their business going. There are three free-trade agreements waiting for the president's signature. Signing those agreements will increase exports by 1 percent and create 250,000 news jobs.
\
ISSUE 2: Government spending.
\
This year, the government is taking in $2.4 trillion (revenue) and spending $3.7 trillion. How can you spend more than you make and expect to pay down our $13 trillion debt. We need competition: The private sector needs to compete against the public sector for jobs; that will greatly reduce costs. We need to get waste, fraud and abuse out of government before one more dollar of taxpayer money is spent.
\
As the 2nd District's congresswoman, I will vote to stop the runaway spending we have seen in Washington. This is more than just election-year rhetoric with me. It is very personal. As I have traveled around the 2nd District, family after family has told me they, not the government, know best how to spend their hard-earned money. Frequently I am asked what government programs I would cut. First, let me assure you that I will not cut military spending while our country is under threat. I will not vote to cut benefits to our elderly. We have made a social pact for their productive efforts to our society that we must uphold. I will not vote for a cut that hurts my 2nd District. That is my first priority. As to what I would cut, it must be a collective effort. There is plenty of money to be found in the waste that our federal government has created.
\
The political will to make the needed and necessary cuts does not exist with the current Washington insiders. We must first change the culture if we are to have meaningful spending controls. Finally, I support returning the unspent stimulus money to the treasury, immediately. That single step will have a huge impact.

\
ISSUE 1: Full employment.
\
In 2009 alone, the United States lost 10 million jobs, and 62,000 U.S. companies closed their doors. Including part-time workers and citizens who've given up looking for work, national unemployment is close to 19 percent. We are not only a debtor nation (a $120 trillion deficit, including future obligations), but Congress encourages individual debt ($14 trillion), enhancing consumer indices and suggesting economic growth no longer sustainable. Small businesses are engines of job growth (generating 70 percent of U.S. jobs) and the big projects once requiring big centralized government (e.g. the interstate highway system) are largely behind us. Long periods of frenetic growth fueled by cheap foreign oil (kept below market value by U.S. militarism) are infeasible as supplies of oil diminish.
\
To create jobs, we must regionalize our food and energy production, which will produce jobs, increase efficiency, reduce dependence on fossil fuels and break up six big banks that control 65 percent of our GDP, favoring instead smaller local banks. As in 2008, I again propose aggressive job creation via alternative/renewable energy production (a New Green Deal); ""Green Corps"" transitional jobs to inexpensively install solar, geothermal and wind power in homes; and sustainable local agriculture. As your congressman, regionalized energy/food and resulting job growth will produce sustainable, resilient economies around zero-waste manufacturing, independent-locally owned retail, multiple sources of community and municipal capital (for property-tax reduction), green building, mass transit and redesign/repair of our dilapidated infrastructure.
\
ISSUE 2: Get out of Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Pakistan now.
\
Cut the bloated military budget by 40 percent. Stop military corporate bailouts at taxpayers' expense.
\
Long after Washington warned that ""overgrown military establishments"" were antithetical to American liberties, another general-turned-president, Dwight Eisenhower, warned of ""the disastrous rise of misplaced power"" from expanding influences of the ""military-industrial complex."" With U.S. military budgets greater than the rest of the world's combined and with 800 U.S. military bases in 130 countries, costing $8,000 per taxpayer per year, those worst fears have been realized, crippling America on a rack of continuous war against oft-exaggerated foes. Over half of U.S. tax dollars and congressional spending since the end of WWII has been spent on militarism (arguably the largest socialist institution on Earth). Defense industries produce nothing useful for society or national trade accounts. Money so spent produces fewer jobs than equivalent spending in other branches of manufacturing, especially green tech. Labor agrees that sustainable jobs multiply when military industrial facilities transition, at least partially, to commercial production of materials which are useful to society (e.g. mass transit, commercial vessels, renewable energy technologies). Congressional military appropriations exceeding national defense needs are earmarks, thefts from single-payer health care, affordable education and renewable alternative energy. They're bailouts and acts of pollution, supporting profligate consumption of foreign oil, discounted below market value at gunpoint.

ISSUE 1: Economy
\
Rosa's highest priority in Congress is to help get our economy back on track and make opportunity real for Connecticut families. She knows that we need jobs, American jobs, that will help middle-class families to thrive. Rosa's path is tax cuts for the middle class, tax credits for small businesses to create jobs, access to affordable training and college for our workforce, bringing manufacturing jobs back to Connecticut and supporting the jobs for the future. She recognizes that true economic recovery requires addressing high unemployment and other immediate crises while investing in the infrastructure and green economy that will create jobs in the long term.
\
Rosa wants America to work again. She helped repeal tax breaks for exporting American jobs and changed it, so companies now get breaks to create jobs here. It's the same with small business. Rosa continues to fight to make sure we do not revert back to the practices that created the current economic situation, while ensuring that our government's economic policy benefits the families and businesses of the Third District.
\
ISSUE 2: Small businesses
\
Rosa knows that small businesses are the engine of our economy and a vital component of any meaningful economic recovery. She has worked hard to see they get the tax relief and access to credit they need to recover and thrive, bringing more jobs to our state, including voting for the Small Business Jobs Act, which includes $12 billion in tax cuts, which leverages up to $300 billion in private-sector lending, and which includes state grants.
\
She believes that if we are going to bring about a real, lasting economic recovery, we need to reestablish the conditions for our long-term prosperity and help to create the conditions that enable business to succeed. That is why she introduced the Manufacturing Reinvestment Account Act, which will allow businesses to create a manufacturing reinvestment account into which businesses can make annual contributions of up to $250,000 and hold the money there for five years. These funds could then be used to purchase equipment and facilities or for job training. With 27 million small businesses across the country and 329,618 in Connecticut, it is critical to make smart, targeted investments to help these companies get off the ground and to be successful. Rosa believes that we can we can keep Connecticut the thriving center of manufacturing and industry it has long been known to be.

ISSUE 1: Jobs
\
The government cannot create jobs, nor can it create wealth. The federal government must get out of the way of the entrepreneurs and risk takers that create businesses, hire employees and improve the economy. The federal government has created such a hostile and uncertain business climate in the United States that it is driving businesses and jobs overseas. We must get the federal government off the backs, and out of the pockets, of the small businesses that employ most of the citizens of this country.
\
ISSUE 2: Health care
\
We must repeal the disastrous health-care bill passed earlier this year. Government control of health care will only drive the cost of health care up and the quality down. The individual mandate is unconstitutional and the 1099 mandates for businesses is a job-killing bureaucratic morass that must be repealed.

ISSUE 1: Creating a future of job growth in Connecticut.
\
Connecticut's economy has been slow to come out of this recession and people want leaders who have a positive vision to move the state forward. First, we've got to support good-paying manufacturing jobs. For too long, we've allowed loopholes in our federal Buy American laws that send our tax dollars overseas. Based on ideas I got from manufacturers in the Fifth District, I've passed legislation that will make sure that when the federal government buys something, it looks to American manufacturers first. I've also been a strong supporter of keeping good-paying jobs at Pratt & Whitney's Cheshire plant, working with Governor Rell and the Congressional delegation to keep the plant open. And we need to capitalize on Connecticut's position as a leader in energy-efficient technologies and create green jobs with industry leaders like Fuel Cell Energy in Torrington and Danbury, and newer green energy firms like Arbor Fuel in Farmington.
\
We have the know-how and the workforce to take advantage of these jobs of the future, but the federal government needs to pass energy-reform legislation that will create a domestic demand for renewable energy in order to stimulate the country's small but growing renewable-energy economy.
\
ISSUE 2: Supporting the engine of Connecticut's economy: small businesses.
\
Connecticut's small businesses will drive our economic recovery. When I visit small businesses in the Fifth District, I hear their frustrations with getting access to capital and paying taxes while trying to stay in business. So I just helped pass in Congress a bill to give $12 billion in small business tax cuts and to create a new loan program to keep businesses hiring. These local businesses can't survive without paying customers, so to put money back in the pockets of consumers, the Recovery Act included billions in tax cuts.
\
Finally, the Bush tax cuts are set to expire at the end of this year, and I support extending those tax breaks for middle-class families, but not the wealthiest among us. We can afford to help only those who need it most.

\
ISSUE 1: Increasing jobs and fixing our economy,
\
Federal government policies either can make it easier or harder for the private sector to increase the number of jobs. I believe the current policies being advanced are making it much harder for businesses to grow and prosper. Our representatives in Washington must implement policies that allow businesses to grow, hire and reinvest, especially during tough economic times. Currently, Connecticut's Fifth District has municipalities facing nearly 15 percent unemployment. We need job growth and we need it now. The only time-tested way to ensure meaningful job growth is to rein in federal spending and reduce taxes on families and businesses.
\
ISSUE 2: Repeal or defund the federal takeover of health care.
\
This legislation did little to solve the underlying problems in our health-care system, and instead expanded the costly Medicaid entitlement program, cuts to Medicare and imposed a massive new tax on American families and businesses.
\
It seems that each week we read about more negative unintended consequences of the bill, such as insurance providers declining to offer certain policies for children and seniors and higher health-insurance premiums. I would support alternative solutions to reforming the health-care system that include using tax policy such as tax credits for small businesses to help make health care more affordable and accessible.
\
There is no doubt that we must make reforms to the health-care system, but we must do responsibly and without increasing the size and cost of the federal government.

ISSUE 1: Economy/jobs.
\
Recognizing the persistent poor economy in Connecticut and its high unemployment, the new governor and legislature must pass legislation that seeks to improve Connecticut's economic climate with the goal of attracting new businesses and achieving expansion of our existing businesses.
\
We will need to target our state economic development dollars to industries that are committed to staying in Connecticut and producing new jobs. The strength of Connecticut is an educated workforce and we need to target renewable energy industries and other cutting edge technological industries.
\
ISSUE 2: State budget.
\
Recognizing the $3 billion plus deficit in next year's budget, the challenge for the new governor and legislature will be to craft a budget that makes smart cuts that limit the negative impact on our less fortunate neighbors and maximize job preservation and creation.
\
For instance, I proposed a bill in the 2010 legislative session that sought significant cuts to the Transitional Film Tax Credit Program. This proposal was controversial and opposed at the Capitol by many legislators. Although I did not enjoy proposing this cut, this cut would have saved significant monies and would have had little impact on our struggling neighbors and on permanent jobs in Connecticut.
\
Next year's budget will require similar tough and unpopular cuts, but such cuts will be necessary to achieve an acceptable and reasonable state budget in 2011.

ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
My focus will be to stop the job losses and make Connecticut attractive to business so that our existing businesses will want to stay here and expand in our state and new businesses will want to come here. We need to stop bashing business. Business makes our economy work and we need an environment that allows businesses to prosper. In the last 20 years, Connecticut has had a net loss of jobs.
\
Just recently, United Technologies announced its intention to move certain jobs out of Connecticut because it is too expensive to do business in our state. Our current elected officials have done little to improve Connecticut's competitiveness when it comes to attracting business. CNBC rated Connecticut as 47th in attractiveness to new business development and business retention. Simply put, we are not considered a business-friendly state. Without a strong business base we cannot have a strong economy or job security for our citizens. What matters most to business is the cost of doing business. Business exists to make a profit. That premise is the foundation of our free market system and it is what propelled our country to be the economic envy of the world. If business is profitable, it will invest some of those profits in growth. That growth means new jobs and job security.
\
Total tax burden is a major cost factor to business. It affects bottom line profitability. Other factors such as the regulatory environment are important, too. To summarize, my focus over the next two years, if elected, will be to reduce the cost factors that affect our competitiveness and simplification of the regulatory environment of the state to make us more competitive and attractive to business development and growth.
\
ISSUE 2: The economy.
\
We need to stabilize our economy and then create an environment for recovery and growth. Economic stability, recovery and diversification are essential to job creation and job security. We all know that, but it seems the solution to creation of economic stability and recovery are elusive. Today we are competing in a world economy and Connecticut has failed to compete effectively. We cannot ignore this.
\
Unfortunately, there are too many special interest groups lobbying our elected officials to the detriment of our state. All our attention must be concentrated on fixing the economy and improving the climate for job creation and stability. That will be my focus until we have brought Connecticut back to economic prosperity and security. State regulation must be simplified to make it easier for our existing business to comply and for business startups to begin doing business here.
\
We need to reduce the cost of government and focus on creation of jobs in the private sector. That means reducing the total tax burden in our state so that we will be competitive with the most competitive states such as Texas and Virginia, and with other countries. Connecticut was recently rated as one of the worst states to retire in due to high property taxes and taxes on pensions. Being rated worst is not being competitive. We need to change our status from one of the worst to one of the best places to retire or start a business.

ISSUE 1: Jobs and the economy.
\
Connecticut has been in an economic recession for the last 20 years, and the new governor and legislature must commit to a plan of job growth through a combination of job marketing, a state loan fund, job training in emerging industries and the reduction of energy and health insurance costs. Personally, I have recently introduced to Connecticut a major Italian manufacturer, which is looking for an American headquarters.
\
ISSUE 2: The state budget.
\
The projected budget crisis provides a unique opportunity to downsize the state government and actually make it more efficient and effective. Downsizing will come from consolidation of state agencies, elimination of duplicate middle management positions and the termination of specific institutions and programs that have proven ineffective. Further, both savings and higher academic achievement will result from a much higher degree of accountability of our schools. The state should not be paying 75 percent of a school system's costs when the graduation rate is only about 40 percent and the proficiency rate is only about 25 percent. Although controversial, I also support the creation of a one-house state legislature with term limits.

ISSUE 1: Growing the economy and creating jobs.
\
We have lost tens of thousands of jobs in Connecticut during this recession, and yet we have done nothing to make our state a better place to do business. We need to improve our business climate by repealing the business entity tax, eliminating unnecessary business regulations and expanding tax credits to those businesses that are hiring. We need to get government out of the way of businesses and entrepreneurs. As a small business owner, I know the difficulties of making payroll, accessing quality health insurance and spending time filling out forms rather than doing business. I have the experience necessary to make Connecticut a place where companies want to stay and grow.
\
ISSUE 2: State spending.
\
Over the last six years, since my opponent has been a state senator, state spending has increased by more than $4.5 billion. That kind of spending is unsustainable even in good times. As a result, Connecticut is the most taxed state in the nation. Now we're facing a $3.5 billion deficit. Connecticut does not have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. We need a state senator who will stand up to special interests and reduce government spending by consolidating state agencies and eliminating waste.

\
ISSUE 1: There is no greater issue than the need to create jobs.
\
We need a proactive strategy to create jobs that includes the following prerequisites:
\
1) Lower energy cost by a minimum of 10 percent in two years and invest in green technologies as required by the energy reform legislation I voted for last session but was vetoed by Gov. Rell.
\
2) Provide small businesses with badly needed capital at an agency where small business is treated as a customer.
\
3) Prioritize state bond investments toward necessary infrastructure projects such as mass transit, roads and bridges, schools, flood control, prisons and state parks.
\
4) Invest in training and re-training at our vo-tech high schools and public colleges in order to maintain a highly skilled workforce to offer, retain and attract employers.
\
A recent study by UMass concluded that a focused, combined investment in infrastructure projects and education in training workers yields the most positive results for both short- and long-term job growth. Connecticut should heed that advice and develop a plan of implementation that includes reducing energy costs, capitalizing small business needs, streamlining regulatory permit processes and investing in workforce training to meet employer labor needs.
\
ISSUE 2: The current fiscal situation demands that state government become leaner and smarter in the delivery of services.
\
Every agency and their myriad of programs should be subjected to value stream mapping in order to discern effective programs and necessary functions from those that are ineffective or unnecessary. Agencies with similar missions should be consolidated and political appointments cut in half. Municipalities must also cut costs and concomitant state subsidies by regionalizing functions such as special education and transportation. Tax credits currently costing hundreds of millions in lost revenue must be subjected to cost/benefit analysis by objective experts like UConn's Center of Economic Analysis. Any current tax credit which yields little or no economic benefit to Connecticut in terms of net job creation should be repealed and the corresponding revenue returned to the state's coffers.
\
Similarly, tax exemptions must endure a similar test. Our state transportation needs should be augmented by establishing EZ Pass tolls, preferably nearest to our borders. A recent study found putting these tolls on Connecticut highways was both safe and feasible. Our roads suffer the wear and tear caused by out-of-state tractor trailers and other vehicles every day, yet we forego millions in revenue that our neighboring states collect.

\
ISSUE 1: Tax relief.
\
We should restructure Connecticut taxes to eliminate the sales and gas taxes and modify the income tax (and business tax) to compensate for the lost revenue. This will allow Connecticut taxpayers to deduct up to another $4 billion on their federal income taxes and save taxpayers as much as $1 billion a year while not impairing state revenues. This will also simplify Connecticut taxes and allow streamlining of the tax collection system because the income tax is the most efficient tax to collect. The result for Connecticut will be lower taxes, more transparent and fair taxes and a competitive advantage for Connecticut merchants who no longer will have to charge sales tax. Imagine no sales tax all year long! And with the hidden gas taxes gone, gas would cost 42 cents less per gallon!
\
ISSUE 2: Job creation.
\
Eliminating sales and gas taxes will stimulate the economy by giving Connecticut a competitive edge with surrounding states. No gas tax means lower gas prices (42 cents less per gallon) that should attract people from surrounding states. No sales tax means lower cost for merchandise that will give Connecticut merchants a competitive advantage with surrounding states. Just like when Massachusetts residents cross their border to purchase merchandise in sales-tax-free New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, residents will be attracted to Connecticut by cheaper gas and sales-tax-free purchases here in Connecticut. This should spark a retail boom here in Connecticut. The expanded retail activity will stimulate job creation.

Working people are the backbone of our state, but we also need to work on attracting more employers to do business in the state. The Jobs Bill that was passed this year does a lot to provide tax credits to small businesses. We need to make sure that when the state is contracting, local businesses have the opportunity to put in a low bid. This will allow us to keep jobs in Connecticut in addition to investing in local business.
\
ISSUE 2: Seniors are another priority of mine.

It is important that we maintain the programs that offer vital services that allow them to live independently. Home care not only saves our state millions in dollars, but it is also more comfortable for our seniors to live at home.

ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
Connecticut has been chasing jobs out of the state for years with high taxes, high costs and excessive regulations. We must reverse this trend. Start by spending less in Hartford. Eliminate unnecessary business mandates. Reduce health care costs on small business by reducing health insurance mandates. Reduce energy costs by increasing the generation of electricity. Foster green technologies, including new nuclear power.
\
We can make Connecticut competitive again, but it will take a change of mindset in Hartford. For too long we have been anti-business, prompting entrepreneurs and investors to go elsewhere. End the business entity tax. Repeal the corporate tax surcharge. Job creators are our friends, not our enemies.
\
ISSUE 2: Budget.
\
The Connecticut budget is a disaster. We are staring at an enormous budget deficit, roughly 20 percent! We spent the rainy day fund. We spent the stimulus money. We borrowed billions and spent that, too. And what did the legislature do since the recession began to ensure our long-term fiscal health? Nothing!
\
Our legislature failed our people. We must get our fiscal house in order immediately! If we fail, there will be no jobs created here, even when the national economy comes back. My prescription: consolidate state agencies, reduce oversight and management, lower benefits for new hires and increase support to non-profits for delivery of services. What not to do: more taxes. We are already No. 1 in per capita tax burden. No more! Higher taxes will only serve to accelerate the exodus of jobs.

\
ISSUE 1: Interventionism.
\
Government is best when it serves as an impartial referee, prosecuting fraud, upholding contracts, employing punitive force to those who have harmed others. But governments mostly act as interested participants, choosing winners and losers. Many individuals, voting blocs, organizations, and corporations have been eager to purchase from government all sorts of favorable legislation that gives them unfair advantage over others. These come in the form of regulations (which more so burden smaller outfits who have greater difficulty affording regulatory compliance and who may desist for fear of imprisonment and large fines for missteps), restrictions, subsidies, tariffs, land grabs, hand-outs and bailouts. This all harms market forces and leads to perverse incentives, moral hazards, increased prices, decreased quality and safety, and scarcity, which harms all of our qualities of life.
\
Free-marketers understand that an important goal is ending the interventionist policies that impoverish us, especially the least well-off of us. It is wealth that enables us to educate ourselves and our children, provide for our health care and safety, nourish ourselves with healthy foods, protect our environment, aid others, and engage in the activities in which we delight.
\
ISSUE 2: Property rights.
\
The Supreme Court ruled that in the public's interest of local economic improvement, it was legal for the government of New London to seize privately owned homes and deliver them to private developers. The court's ruling embraced a broad concept of what constitutes a public use and infringed on the property rights of these unfortunate citizens. People are free to interact with one another through voluntary trade, negotiation, and cooperation, not by infringing on property rights or liberties. In the absence of an incontestable public good, we should not support companies stripping people of their property through government force any more than we should support companies using thugs with axe-handles. Many people make good faith arguments for intervention by government for a perceived public good. They accept any loss of freedoms to the individual who is not harming anyone as an acceptable trade-off, believing that the means are justified by their expected positive ends. Libertarians believe positive ends are not justified nor are even achievable by aggressive means. If we choose not to stick with a narrow and firm definition of true public goods, our property and liberties are always at risk to the whim of the voting majority.

\
ISSUE 1: ""Stop the Spending.""
\
In pursuing dynamic job growth, I support a program to ""Stop the Spending."" Since 1972, according to the Yankee Institute 2010 report on state spending, the record shows that spending in inflation adjusted dollars has increased by almost 250 percent. As part of this effort, we must stop bonding deficits. Bonding must be used to provide financing for infrastructure. We must eliminate inefficient, ineffective and outdated programs. This latter task will require a top-down review focusing attention on all state government departments, agencies, functions and programs. There should be no exceptions for any function, office or past practice.
\
ISSUE 2: Stop government growth.
\
I support an initiative to stop the growth of state government by freezing all hiring except as may be required by retirement or resignation until the size of government is reduced by 15 percent. Employee reductions reduced by the top-down review process will not be replaced. The reduction of 15 percent should not be viewed as the end point, but rather the first step in creating a leaner and more efficient government working for our citizens.

\
ISSUE 1: Establish a business-friendly environment.
\
There is nothing more important to Connecticut families than getting the state's economy back on track by establishing a more business-friendly environment. Reclaiming Connecticut's prosperity can be achieved by public policy initiatives that support private sector job growth. Protecting jobs must be a priority. Repealing the business entity tax - one example of a mandate that stifles entrepreneurs and drives up business costs - would give needed relief to every business, but especially to small businesses. I recently hosted a Home-Based Business Networking Forum in collaboration with the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development to connect these micro-businesses with the tools and resources they need to grow. As the smallest of small businesses, they are engines of economic activity for our towns and region in challenging economic times.
\
I support requiring that every bill, amendment or resolution before the General Assembly be accompanied by a job impact statement. This job impact statement must disclose the effect of the proposed bill on employment in Connecticut, and include an estimate of the gain or loss of jobs anticipated.
\
ISSUE 2: Reduce size and cost of government.
\
When job losses and foreclosures signal a sharp downturn in many family and personal finances, increasing taxes to pay for an oversized and unaffordable government would hurt more than help our already weak economy. It is critical to reduce the size and cost of government. Government expenditures need to focus on the core functions of public health and safety, transportation and public education. Cuts in state spending should shrink the size and cost of government, not shrink government's commitment to its core functions. Towns should be relieved of excessive state mandates. Municipal mandate relief would save on property taxes and allow towns to find better, more cost effective local solutions.
\
In 1991, the personal income tax was enacted. At the time, the income tax was portrayed as the ""tax to end all taxes."" Since the inception of the personal income tax, however, the size of government has grown 135 percent. With this super-sizing of government comes super-sizing of government operating costs. With greatly diminished revenues, our deficit is a mirror of costs that Connecticut can no longer afford.

\
ISSUE 2: Reduce waste and inefficiency.
\
Reducing waste and inefficiency in state government is absolutely essential if we are to solve our state's budget problem.

This will free up funds to pay for programs and services that help people in our towns.

ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
Connecticut can emerge from this recession with more jobs and a much stronger economic base by aggressively embracing emerging green technologies. Global fossil fuel supplies are not expected to keep pace with rising global demand and prices for oil and natural gas will rise as a consequence. As a nation we need to begin a rapid deployment of clean renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Demand for these technologies is growing rapidly.
\
Connecticut should put in place a package of incentives and actively recruit green-tech manufacturers to our state. Our skilled workforce is capable of building nuclear submarines and advanced jet engines - we can build a windmill, solar panel or fuel cell just as well. This will reinvigorate manufacturing in our state and create thousands of good-paying jobs.
\
ISSUE 2: Lower energy costs.
\
I voted against deregulating our electric system 12 years ago because I knew it would only lead to higher prices for Connecticut consumers and businesses. As predicted, Connecticut now has the highest electric prices in the contiguous 48 states.
\
It's high time the General Assembly stands up to special interests and reins in these costs which strain household budgets and harm our business climate. Legislation I sponsored and worked for this past year would have accomplished this by turning the current Department of Public Utility Control in a real Department of Energy with a mission to reduce costs to consumers and businesses by 15 percent! The new Department of Energy, in addition to protecting consumers, would also be charged with deploying clean energy systems across Connecticut in order to protect our state from long-term electric price shocks, create jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our climate.

ISSUE 1: Jobs:
\
Our next state representative must be concerned with a single goal: Getting Connecticut back to work. The first step is electing leaders who will implement common sense solutions to the problems created by our current political class. Connecticut is ranked dead last in job growth and our legislature has been rated the ""least business-friendly"" in the country. Our state is hemorrhaging jobs. Furthermore, the Democratic supermajority has bungled the state budget so badly that we are staring at a $3.5 billion structural deficit in the next fiscal year - and that's after they levied the largest tax hike in Connecticut history just last year! Compounding the problem is the fact that to get through this election cycle without further raising taxes, the Democrats in Hartford are borrowing money on the state's credit card to cover operating expenses - essentially just to keep on the lights.
\
The cold, hard fact is that our state government is broke. I am asking the voters of Cromwell, Portland and Middletown to join me in sending a message to career politicians that it has to stop.
\
We can spend no more than we make, and we should borrow no more than we can afford to pay back. I promise to bring the citizens of Connecticut the common sense they deserve.

ISSUE 1: Health care.
\
As the chairman of the Select Committee on Aging, my health care priorities are to expand the state's home care program and to eliminate the 6 percent co-pay for the participants in order to help the elderly and disabled remain in their homes instead of nursing homes. This program expansion would translate into a better quality of life for our seniors and also provides a tremendous savings for the state, since home care is approximately one-fifth the cost of a senior residing in a nursing home.
\
Also I want to make sure that nursing homes are economically healthy so these facilities are available for our loved ones. One of my priorities is to expand the state's ConnPACE prescription drug program to help low-income elderly and disabled residents obtain their medication at a discount. This expansion would be accomplished by changing the income guidelines to increase the number of people eligible for the program.
\
ISSUE 2: Tax.
\
I will fight to institute a property tax freeze for seniors. The last property tax freeze program was eliminated in the early 1980s. The tax freeze program would be based on adjusted gross income in order to qualify. The basis for the program is to give seniors the choice to remain in their homes and not be forced to sell because they cannot afford to pay their property tax. The municipalities would be reimbursed by the state for any change in revenue related to the program.

\
ISSUE 1: Resolving the deficit and balancing the budget.
\
The next two years will be very difficult as our state confronts a substantial deficit due to the nationwide recession. As so many of our families have lost jobs or their homes, more are in need of government services like shelter, food and heating assistance. It will be my priority to streamline and consolidate government agencies to make our state more accountable and efficient while preserving the safety net that so many of our families rely on. As House Chair of the Appropriations Human Services subcommittee, I have learned how careful we must be when we make the requisite cuts - it must be carefully done.
\
ISSUE 2: Minimizing education cuts to towns.
\
Both East Hampton and Middletown rely on substantial state education aid because of the school funding formula - any loss to ECS will likely be passed on to local taxpayers in property tax increases or will result in teacher layoffs or increased class sizes. These are both unacceptable options. Our new governor must provide the vision and leadership, as well as the commitment to resources, to tackle education reform, formula funding reform and closing the achievement gap. Connecticut's strength has always been our skilled workforce, and too many of our children are dropping out of school or at risk of school failure. We must do better.

ISSUE 1: State spending - taxes.
\
Connecticut will have a structural deficit of roughly $4 billion in each of the next three fiscal years. It will be the duty of those we elect to office to reverse this deficit.
\
As an elected official, I will work to cut the level of state spending. We should be considering elimination, consolidation and privatization of state services where applicable to reduce our debt.
\
I want to review state unfunded mandates that burden local towns with excessive costs. Long-term liabilities are now more than $60 billion - which is more than 28 percent of the state budget. We must reduce and streamline our bonded debt with a fiscally conservative approach.
\
My ultimate goal is to cut state spending in order lower taxes for individuals and businesses. As a former common council member, I supported budgets that reduced spending and zero increases. I will also support term limits and downsizing the state legislature operating budget, plus binding arbitration laws.
\
ISSUE 2: Jobs.
\
We must bring down the costs of doing business in Connecticut by reducing spending and cutting taxes. We must competitively position our state as a pro-business pro-growth state for existing businesses to flourish and for new and relocating businesses to find us attractive.
\
We must streamline bureaucratic red tape and regulations and have fast tract policies that encourage the free enterprise system to flourish.
\
Regulations that stifle and hamper businesses and excessive taxes on equipment investments are areas that drive business out of Connecticut.

\
ISSUE 1: The need to reduce state spending.
\
In the last six years, the state budget has grown by 35 percent, and taxes have increased across the board to fund the spending spree. The result on all aspects of life in Connecticut has been predictable.
\
Businesses have left the state in droves; more than a hundred thousand good paying jobs have been lost. New initiatives to improve life in Connecticut have been scrapped, as state coffers swung from a surplus to unimaginable deficits. Connecticut's towns have had to raise property taxes to make up for lost state aid, and Hartford's cash-strapped legislature has fallen deaf to the call from every small town for badly needed property tax reform.
\
Connecticut's independent Office of Fiscal Analysis predicts that next year's state budget, which commences on July 1, 2011, is already more than $4 billion short. If we don't reduce spending by that same amount, Hartford will pass along $4 billion in new taxes to balance the budget.
\
Hartford must commit to spending less, not more. No new jobs program, no alternative energy initiative, no educational goal, no transportation plan; none of them can succeed until Connecticut balances its books.
\
ISSUE 2: The need to budget responsibly.
\
No Connecticut household would borrow money to buy groceries, yet for the last two years, Connecticut's legislature has borrowed money to fund basic operating costs. As a result, the state's debt service includes interest on money spent to pay the state's day-to-day bills. For two years in a row, Hartford has deferred contributions to the state pension fund, a fund recently ranked as being the second-largest underfunded state pension in the country. Pension funds require time for contributed funds to grow and mature; the entire actuarial calculation is based upon contributions from year to year. A delay in funding the pension today means it will cost much more to fund tomorrow.
\
These are only some of the examples of how the General Assembly has recklessly ignored economic realities. My view is simple: If we can't afford it, we shouldn't fund it. I'll never vote to borrow money to pay operating costs, defer a scheduled payment until next year, or resort to funding gimmicks that do no more than increase costs in the long run.
\
No budget plan will receive my support unless the money ""in real dollars"" is in hand. In the 2009-2010 budget year, only three of Connecticut's 12 revenue categories met projections. This was not a function of a failing economy; it was the use of inflated revenue projections to balance a budget on paper, only. This kind of sleight-of-hand budgeting must end.

ISSUE 1: State budget.
\
Connecticut faces large deficits in the next two fiscal years due to declining revenue brought on by the recent international financial crisis and recession. To address this, we need to reasonably balance necessary spending with needed cuts and, if necessary, responsible, fair changes to the tax code. Improvements to our tax code should begin with the property tax, which is divisive, regressive, outdated and drives sprawl. We also need to fully enact results-based budgeting in which we rigorously review programs and cut or change those that are not carrying out their missions.
\
Finally, we need to be more efficient and innovative in the way the state delivers services. It is vital that we harness modern technology to make government for accessible and responsive to our residents.
\
ISSUE 2: Economy and jobs.
\
Connecticut should aggressively invest in emerging green and clean energy technology. We must reform our energy policy with the goal of bringing down costs and increasing our use of renewable energy. Connecticut must modernize our transportation system to make the state more attractive to employers. The state should build on federal health care reform to help lower the cost of insurance for employers. We also need to invest in and improve education at all levels so that we have a skilled workforce and can provide opportunity for our children. Squarely addressing the budget problem will also increase confidence within the private sector and help repair the economy.

ISSUE 1: The budget.
\
This word is truly a joke in this state. We do not have a budget, what we have is a line of credit that the current administration seems to think is inexhaustible. If a supermajority cannot even begin to bring the runaway spending under control in four years, then it is clear that they are either incapable of doing so or else do not wish to.
\
Will the solution be easy or comfortable for the people of Connecticut? No, it will mean cutting back on services and projects that we just cannot afford at this time. We will have to establish a budget and then adhere to it until we can afford to do more. We must operate as families in our state have done or else we will bankrupt Connecticut.
\
ISSUE 2: Jobs.
\
Connecticut has become one of the least likely states to attract new business to. We have had an attorney general who, in his zeal to show us that he is for the working class, has overly prosecuted, and persecuted, businesses so much that they have left the state. The House and Senate have also done the same by over taxation and regulation of businesses. We have got to realize that there must be a balance between business and labor. Without business, there is nothing for labor to do and without labor there would be no businesses. Business owners and their investors will always make the lion's share while workers will make a fair wage and have reasonable working conditions. When one takes a job they agree to a compensation for their labor. If the job is not what one likes then remember that this is America, the land of opportunity, go find the job you like or start your own business.

\
ISSUE 2: Job creation and retention.
\
Connecticut has a reputation as one of the most business-unfriendly states and one with a business unfriendly legislature. Connecticut has lost more younger working people than almost any other state. We must do everything reasonably possible to turn this around - especially for small businesses. Burdensome regulations that make it difficult to start and run businesses and require a lot of state paperwork need to be eased up. Numerous nuisance filings and small taxes should be eliminated and the $250 business entity tax should be repealed. The large fee increases enacted during this past legislative term should be rolled back.

Creating and retaining jobs locally needs to be our highest priority. Over the past 22 years, Connecticut has been last in the nation for job creation and in my first two years I have been working to turn that around. I was proud to sponsor Connecticut's landmark 2010 jobs bill, which Gov. Rell signed into law in our district.

We also need to hold the line on property taxes and electricity rates. One of my proudest achievements was protecting funding for Middletown, Middlefield and Durham's schools. This funding helped keep local property taxes in check, and also prevented teacher layoffs. I also took on the hedge funds and speculators who have been driving the increase in our electricity rates. Bringing electric rates under control will help every senior, family and small business in the state. I am proud that electric rates are actually set to fall 5 percent in January - a small but important first step to rebuilding our middle class.

ISSUE 1: Jobs.
\
Connecticut is not a business friendly state and with the highest unemployment rate in decades, we are all paying for it.
\
We must stop the excessive taxation and overregulation that is forcing many businesses to lay off workers, close their doors or move out of state. Facing massive budget deficits, leadership in Hartford looked to businesses to bail them out, passing a 25 percent corporate surcharge last year. That's why it should not come as a surprise that an executive from UTC, Connecticut's largest private employer said ""Anywhere but Connecticut"" when asked where it's low-cost to do business. We must make it easier for business to come and thrive in our state. We should eliminate the business entity tax that discourages new business and continue to streamline the permitting process to make it easier for new business to open their doors.
\
If we continue to look at business to fix our budget deficit, we will continue to force them out of state. It is time to try a different approach by encouraging business to prosper and lead Connecticut out of this budget crisis by giving people jobs.
\
ISSUE 2: State budget.
\
For years state government has mismanaged our budget. Our state government continues to spend and then taxes the citizens to pay for it. During prosperous times when a budget surplus existed, numerous programs were created. During tough economic times, rather than scale back our spending to affordable levels, we borrow and raise taxes to fund an out-of-control budget. During the last two years, the legislature voted to raise taxes by $1.5 billion and borrowed another $2 billion. It is the hard working families and small businesses that end up paying.
\
Since 1988, Connecticut's population has increased a modest 6.8 percent. During that same period, our spending has increased an astonishing 270 percent. That defies common sense.
\
It is time to go back to basics and focus on the core functions of government: education, public safety, infrastructure. We need to identify programs that are not working and eliminate them, identify ways to consolidate government and eliminate fraud and waste.
\
The government we have is unsustainable. It is time to do more with less. We should reevaluate our budget and make sure the citizens of Connecticut finally get what they pay for.

137,"
Connecticut has a rough road ahead this spring as it tries to get enough state and federal money to maintain and expand its highway system.
\
Yet while the state struggles to obtain adequate funding for crumbling and crowded roads and bridges, its House members continue the practice of inserting dozens of pet projects into the highway funding bill -- projects like a train museum, river walks and bicycle paths.
\
Those are projects that lawmakers can trumpet in press releases and brag about as they travel around their districts. But as they do, they'll be traveling on roads that might not get enough money to handle the traffic. And the lawmakers may be frustrating state officials who would rather spend the money on more pressing needs.
\
The first hurdle will be in the U.S. Senate, which is expected to consider legislation in April that would boost federal aid to Connecticut highways by 10 percent over a six-year period, for a total of $2.75 billion.
\
State transportation officials see that as inadequate, and Gov. M. Jodi Rell is trying to help make up the difference with a $1.3 billion, 10-year package of state-funded transportation improvements. But to do that, she proposes to raise money with state bonding, gasoline-tax increases and a $1 surcharge on rides on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. No federal funds are involved in Rell's package.
\
If approved by the legislature in the coming months, the state's gasoline tax would increase by 6 cents a gallon over the next eight years, and the proceeds would be specifically used for Rell's projects.
\
Those projects include $187 million for specific improvements in congested stretches of I-95 from Greenwich to the Rhode Island border, along with $150 million more to help upgrade I-91 and I-84.
\
The biggest single item in the state's $1.3 billion package would be the purchase of 342 new railroad cars -- an effort to improve service and entice motorists out of their vehicles and off congested highways.
\
The federal budget outlook is troublesome enough that when the U.S. Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee considered the federal highway aid package earlier this month, the vote to send it to the full Senate was 17-1 -- with Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D- Conn., the lone dissenter.
\
""I cannot in good conscience support legislation that provides such inadequate funding for my state's transportation needs,"" he explained.
\
Lieberman said Senate Democratic leaders have assured him that Connecticut will fare better as the bill moves through the legislative process. But he will still have a tough time winning more money for Connecticut because of the state's waning political leverage.
\
Connecticut got $1.35 in federal highway money last year for every dollar it paid in federal gasoline taxes. Many Western states get far less than they pay, and it's those states that have been gaining legislative clout.
\
Connecticut officials have long argued that the $1.35 figure is misleading. The state's roads are older and more in need of repair than those in Western states, Lieberman said.
\
Plus, he argued, Connecticut ""is a frequent pass-through state, and we have some of the worst traffic congestion in the country.""
\
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., has said he wants every state to get at least 92 cents for every dollar of federal gas tax paid, a figure that would mean huge boosts in transportation money to some Western states. Under such a scenario, by the end of the six-year period Connecticut still would receive $1.21 in highway aid for every dollar of gas taxes paid.
\
The state does better in the House version of the bill, which passed that chamber overwhelmingly on March 10. If the Senate passes its bill, as expected, top lawmakers from each chamber will negotiate a compromise.
\
Under the House measure, Connecticut would see a 19.58 percent increase, and get a total of $2.98 billion over six years.
\
Included in that sum are dozens of specific Connecticut projects, called ""earmarks"" in political lexicon. They are routinely criticized by taxpayer watchdog groups -- and privately by government transportation officials.
\
The problem, those officials say, is that lawmakers are in essence telling the professionals which roads to pave and which bridges to build.
\
Connecticut, like other states, plans years in advance how it will use its federal highway money. It looks at wear and tear on roads, congestion, safety and a number of other factors and sets priorities.
\
The special projects list is a world unto itself. Members of Congress fight to get items on the list, and then can boast about the results back home.
\
Rep. Rob Simmons, R-2nd District, for instance, issued a press release earlier this month announcing that he had ""secured $45 million in federal transportation funds for ... projects throughout eastern Connecticut.""
\
Simmons, a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, then listed 17 such accomplishments.
\
Among them: $1 million for the Madison Shoreline Greenway Trail, $380,000 for bicycle and pedestrian trails and facilities in Groton, $50,000 to make curbs in Putnam comply with disability laws, $6.6 million for a transportation center and parking with streetscapes in Vernon, and his biggest single project, $16 million for Route 11 improvements.
\
What was not included were projects denied to Simmons last fall. Simmons was punished for his support of Amtrak by then- transportation appropriations subcommittee Chairman Ernest Istook, R- Okla.
\
Istook lost his position early this year, and Simmons has been assured by House Republican leaders that he probably will get those projects back. But the highway bill was written by a different committee, and the projects for which Simmons lost funding are likely to be restored by different means.
\
Discussing the 17 projects Simmons got into the current bill, his chief of staff, Todd Mitchell, said the congressman consults Connecticut transportation department officials before seeking the money.
\
The watchdog groups closely scrutinize these matters, ready to pounce on what they see as excessive and unnecessary. They left Simmons alone, but they have beefs with other members.
\
Taxpayers for Common Sense complained about a $1.5 million welcome center to serve visitors to Washington's Mount Rainier and about $7.2 million to build a new snowmobile trail in Vermont.
\
Citizens Against Government Waste cited $3 million to renovate and expand the National Packard Museum in Warren, Ohio, and $200 million for a bridge in Alaska to reach an island that has 50 residents.
\
Among its ""dirtiest dozen"" standouts was $1.7 million to rebuild Union Station in North Canaan, Conn., as a railroad museum.
\
Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-5th District, pushed for the money, and David Karvelas, her chief of staff, called it is a very proper addition to the bill.
\
""It's certainly not pork to the residents of North Canaan, who view this as an important economic and cultural project for the region,"" he said.
\
""The highway bill does not restrict funds to road construction, but allows members of Congress to designate assistance to projects like rebuilding the town's historic railroad depot, which was destroyed by fire in 2001,"" Karvelas said.
\
The $1.7 million earmark would cover much of the cost of the $2.5 million restoration of the station, much of which burned when it was set on fire Oct. 13, 2001. Another $700,000 will come from a federal small town grant.
\
The museum will be the building's centerpiece. Restaurants, retail and office space are also planned.
\
The project is important to the region's economy because North Canaan is a historic crossroads in the state's northwest corner, said Helen Higgins, executive director of the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation.
\
""It's in a critical spot,"" she said, where routes 7 and 44 cross. The town is renovating its theater, and sees tremendous potential in luring tourists.
\
In many ways, the debate over the project mirrors the debate going on in Washington -- whether such projects should be included in a bill.
\
The Senate does not include them. The House lists 4,128 earmarks worth $12.4 billion.
\
The museum is a classic example of why such lists are inappropriate, said Erich Zimmerman, policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense.
\
""This bill is supposed to be about increasing mobility and getting Americans moving. Museums don't play that role.""
\
Not so, countered Higgins.
\
""Transportation is not just about cars on highways,"" she said. ""Bike trails, museums and other projects should be encouraged. They attract people to visit places where they might spend money and help the economy.""

There is a beacon in the Capitol dome that shines when Congress is in session.
\
But in the past year, it is the light in the Oval Office that has drawn the youthful here like faithful to the Holy Land.
\
Studying in the shadow of the White House, or working in a senator's mail room, or managing an office in the State Department, they are the young believers, enduring low pay and low rank to serve their hero who, today, has been in office one year.
\
They came from Connecticut and California, Delaware and the Dakotas, after working to elect Bill Clinton or other Democrats, the taste of their Election Day kill still fresh.
\
""You read a lot about the 20-something generation being lost, but that was our moment,"" said Andrew Rittenberg, 23, who graduated from Yale University and works now in the Treasury Department, just a few hundred feet from the White House.
\
While Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon surely attracted their share of Republican followers to this city, the year-old influx has probably been the biggest wave of Democratic idealism to hit the capital since JFK announced that the torch had been passed to a new generation.
\
Now, a year later, that wave has crashed on the shore of reality. They have learned a lot. Some are now beset with misgivings, confronted with disillusionment. Others retain -- in the face of compromising, deal-making and disturbing revelations -- their faith in their hero and their government.
\
""This town was flooded by young people who thought there would be dramatic changes quickly,"" said Jim Griffin, 26, another Yale graduate now working as an analyst for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""But the government's not set up to work that way.""
\
The pulsing energy of the campaign has faded. No more early-morning meetings in the Little Rock War Room, no rapid responses to Republican attacks, no enveloping sense of camaraderie.
\
For these young Democrats, the reality of governing seems, at times, disappointing.
\
When Ted Freeman, 25, was stumping for Rep. Mike Kreidler, D-Wash., he distributed campaign literature for Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Clinton, too. That was the way it was supposed to be -- one for all and all for one.
\
""This was an unbelievably gratifying campaign for me. It was a really powerful experience to be working day and night for a political cause that is well-intentioned -- to be rooting for someone that the rest of the country decided to root for as well,"" said Freeman. ""That's why I came here -- I thought `... this is an opportunity of a lifetime.' ""
\
But things are different now. As a lobbyist for an environmental group, Freeman finds himself increasingly disappointed by the administration's policies.
\
""I didn't know how difficult things would be,"" said a chagrined Freeman, who has seen the Clinton administration compromise on the global warming issue despite Vice President Al Gore's activism in that area.
\
As the president and Congress toil to represent a menagerie of constituents, they cut deals and compromise in exchange for support. Old Washington hands know what must be going through the minds of the young.
\
""They're seeing a lot of sleazy stuff -- they're seeing lobbyists buying off people. They're seeing things being fixed,"" said syndicated columnist Art Buchwald, who has been chronicling Washington since 1962.
\
""But they believe in him,"" Buchwald said of Clinton. ""And they believe in Hillary. I didn't see that with Bush.""
\
Just as civil rights was the rallying cry of the 1960s and President Kennedy was the warrior, saving the environment, universal health care, taming the deficit and protecting the rights of special-interest groups such as women and homosexuals is the war cry of today.
\
""Obviously, everybody has to believe in something. We lost a lot of that virginity when Kennedy was killed. And with the Vietnam War and Watergate, wide-eyed people lost a lot of their inspiration,"" Buchwald said.
\
As were many young people, Freeman was invigorated by Clinton's move to approve homosexuals' serving in the military -- then disillusioned when Clinton backpedaled as the opposition's objections roared through the press.
\
""The president felt strongly and we felt strongly. I thought we had the power not to compromise,"" said Laura Hewitt, 25, a legislative correspondent in Sen. Murray's office, of Clinton's early -- but watered-down -- effort in favor of homosexuals' service in the military.
\
Freeman and Hewitt echoed the dismay of many other young people as they ticked off the causes they lost in the spirit of compromise. The gas tax -- aimed at encouraging the use of alternative forms of energy -- which died during the budget debate, is one example. Then there were the diluted provisions to protect the environment in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
\
Hewitt thought the changes would go beyond style, too. She thought she'd see women play a bigger role in policy-making than they have. And she thought her casual style of dressing, which worked well during the campaign, would fit right in with the Democrats' newly dominant culture in D.C.
\
Wrong.
\
A male superior in her office issued a directive for her to leave her Birkenstocks and pants home -- to dress sharper for the office. ""When I'm not meeting with constituents, I work better when I'm comfortable,"" she said. ""But I went out and spent $300. I felt kind of humiliated.""
\
Griffin said he felt particularly betrayed by Clinton's withdrawal of his nomination of Lani Guinier as head of the Justice Department's civil rights division. ""She was everything Bill Clinton knew and loved and stood for. In my gut, I was offended not just as a black, but as a liberal Democrat.""
\
Hewitt has found it difficult to reconcile the dealmaking.
\
""I thought since we were coming in with a new perspective and a new way of doing things, let's do it that way. I've found that you bring in some new rules, but you have to play by the old rules,"" Hewitt said.
\
Richard Ramsey, 26, of West Hartford, is happy as a legislative aide for Murray. And he was particularly pleased by Clinton's executive order aimed at ending a standoff between loggers and conservationists -- compromise though it was.
\
But Clinton's luster is beginning to wear off now. ""He's muddy with losses. He's got some successes but, for the most part, he's caught in the bureaucratic mire,"" Ramsey said. ""He's lost some of the knight-in-shining-armor that he was.""
\
The year-end hype about Clinton's alleged extramarital affairs and inappropriate use of his bodyguards to foster those affairs didn't shake the loyalty of at least some of the president's young believers.
\
Some don't even believe the accusations.
\
""I come from a small town and I know how stories get started,"" Griffin said. ""People like to make themselves feel more important."" He called some of the accounts ""preposterous.""
\
Even if the stories are true, so what? Griffin wants to know. ""Our generation never lived with the myth that you could look to the government to take care of all your needs ... I don't think we ever looked to our government leaders to be our moral leaders.""
\
Hewitt thinks there must be some truth to the stories of Clinton's affairs, but she dealt with her misgivings about the whole thing before the election.
\
""The whole affairs thing is something that disgusts me,"" Hewitt said. ""But one thing about that story is it's an old story that's run its course, and I didn't get caught up in it.""
\
Sipping a beer in a bar near the Capitol, Griffin says he is troubled by a certain superficiality in the government; he has become ""concerned about the wishy-washiness of the administration. Maybe it's the young people. It's beginning to scare me.""
\
Washington has always been a young town. The bosses are seasoned with age -- but it's no secret that young staff members have long played a significant role in crafting the bills that their bosses initial, and writing the speeches for them to deliver.
\
All that initialing and the many layers of staff levels is a little mystifying.
\
""In government, you push a lot of papers and wonder if you're doing anything,"" said Matt Oshinsky, 22, a Yale graduate now working as a special assistant to the administrator for the Agency for International Development in the State Department.
\
Oshinsky writes letters, he said, but his boss, J. Brian Atwood, often doesn't read them. He just signs them. And the senators who receive the letters often don't read them either, he said. That's a job for a lower-level staff person.
\
At the same time, there is a measure of satisfaction in playing some role in the action -- no matter how small -- and mingling with the power brokers, Oshinsky and other D.C. newcomers say.
\
With a degree from Yale, Rittenburg said he thought he'd have more responsibility making policy for the administration. ""But I'm working on office issues -- reassigning secretaries so we'll have the money for more economists.""
\
He does sit in on health care reform briefings, though, so he can keep Treasury Department officials abreast of developments. ""What a great experience to play a part in health care reform,"" he said.
\
For some of the recruits, working with the big shots is all in a day's work -- nothing extraordinary. David Leavy, 24, of Westport, is an assistant to Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary. He sees Clinton every day. Sometimes he travels with him.
\
""It's a tremendous honor to work here,"" said Leavy, who helps Myers prepare for her daily briefing sessions with reporters. ""But if every time you spoke to the president you got all googley-eyed, you wouldn't be effective,"" he said.
\
It can be dizzying sometimes trying to keep abreast of the whirlwind of policies at home and abroad that reporters ask about, Leavy said. ""I learn so much on so many different issues,"" he said.
\
Leavy's task is to condense information into a bullet format -- called ""talking points"" -- so Myers can find her answers quickly.
\
Nathan Tyler, 24, of New Haven, thinks ""talking points"" were part of his undoing when he worked for a congressman. Tyler was assigned to prepare a speech for his boss on how to help salmon swim upstream past dams. His task was to write ""talking points"" to refer to before an audience.
\
""But I wrote a whole speech and a lot of the points were in the middle,"" Tyler said. He works now as a lobbyist for the Glass Packaging Institute.
\
Offering the chance to be near history-making Democrats is paying off handsomely for some of Washington's colleges, too, even though young people just entering college now have no memory of a Democrat in office.
\
Frederic Siegel, director of admissions for George Washington University, said his school's admissions ""have soared in a way no others have.""
\
In fact, the freshman class at the university has 300 more students this year than last year -- a 30 percent increase. ""Bill Clinton playing the saxophone on MTV on election night {he actually played during the campaign} is certainly appealing to students. The culture has changed,"" Siegel said. ""When people see what a young town it is, they want to come here.""
\
Ditto for American University where Marcelle Heerschap, director of undergraduate admissions, said admissions are way up -- about 20 percent between graduate and undergraduate -- for the School of Public Affairs. She, too, attributes the increase, in part, to the new administration.
\
Buchwald watches it all with the air of a sage who knows that the slights and disappointments that come with an initiation to Washington will fade with time.
\
The glamour and excitement, he said, will survive.
\
""When it's over,"" he said, ""it's the best time in their lives.

Top Issues
\
Our Economy and Jobs: Rosa's highest priority is to rescue the economy, get it moving again, and make sure the middle class and small businesses get on their feet. Middle income families are financially pressed -- facing skyrocketing health care, education, and energy costs in the midst of a credit crunch. Millions of good jobs have disappeared, many outsourced overseas.
\
Rosa supports new tax incentives for companies creating jobs in America. Whether it is revitalizing our manufacturing base, ensuring we train workers and invest in K-12 math and science education or making college more affordable, Rosa understands the challenges we face and is working to support American families.
\
Affordable Health Care: Rosa is battling to lower health care costs and ensure all Americans have access to affordable insurance.
\
Having beaten cancer herself, Rosa understands the value of good health care, which is why she has led the fight to make prescription drugs more affordable and to make sure all children have health insurance. She has increased funding for cancer, autism, juvenile diabetes and other biomedical research.
\
Iraq: Rosa opposes our go-it-alone approach in Iraq that has cost us billions and too many U.S. lives while making us less safe. Our troops are doing a valiant job, but Iraqis must take more responsibility.
\
The Iraqi Government now accepts a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal so we can begin re-deploying our troops out of Iraq and fight terrorism more effectively.

Top Issues
\
The Economy: Our economy faces significant challenges not seen since the Great Depression and I am angry that for the last eight years an 'anything goes' policy has jeopardized middle-class homeowners, retirement plans, and college savings.
\
I voted against the recent Wall Street bailout twice because it fails to address the underlying causes of the economic crisis - falling home prices caused by record foreclosures.
\
The best economic recovery plan is one that creates good paying jobs. I secured nearly $700 million to increase submarine production at Electric Boat, which helped to create hundreds of new jobs and prevented thousands more employees from being laid off.
\
I voted for two economic stimulus packages to energize the national economy and make overdue investments in America's failing infrastructure, which will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
\
Finally, health care costs are strangling small business. That is why I joined a bipartisan effort in Congress to introduce the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Act, endorsed by labor and business organizations. The bill creates purchasing pools for small businesses and the self-employed, makes health insurance rating reforms; and offers tax credits to make healthcare more affordable for owners and employees.
\
Energy: We need short-term price relief for consumers and long-term solutions to our energy challenges.
\
In September, I voted for comprehensive energy reform that increases domestic oil exploration and production and voted for historic increases in funding for alternative energy, which will be the backbone of our future energy supply.
\
I joined my colleagues to increase fuel efficiency standards to an average 35 MPG for the first time in more than 30 years.
\
I voted multiple times to crack down on energy traders who artificially drive up the price of oil. The energy commodity market needs balanced regulation to prevent the free for all that has been the Bush Administration's policy for the last eight years.
\
I also secured tens of millions of dollars to help companies such as STR in Enfield to develop new and innovative solar and alternative energy technologies. These additional funds helped STR hire 50 additional employees.
\
We need more investments in alternative energy technologies, and I voted for an extension of the Investment Tax Credit to accomplish that goal.

Top Issues
\
Taxes: Connecticut families are paying too much already. Connecticut families pay two dollars to Washington for every one dollar returned in federal assistance.
\
Connecticut families can do a better job of spending our money than the government can. Paying more taxes will only widen the ""Connecticut family gap."" Joe Courtney voted for a budget that will raise the amount taken from Connecticut families by an additional one Billion dollars per year, $3,800 per family in Eastern Connecticut!
\
Tax laws need to change to protect our families and our economy. Standard deductions should be indexed for regional cost of living.
\
The AMT should be eliminated. The tax cuts of the past decade need to be made permanent.
\
Energy: Invest in alternative sources, including renewable energy, biofuels, fuel cells and nuclear power. Increase the tax incentives to help homeowners and businesses convert to more efficient and environmentally friendly systems. Standardize nuclear power plant design to speed regulatory approval of new plants.
\
The Economy: Small businesses need help to be more competitive. Allow businesses to join health care cooperatives across state lines.
\
Health savings accounts and tax credits for individually-purchased health plans will also relieve the costly burden of health care from small business.
\
Promote technical education and training to grow skill workers. Reduce taxes and regulations that discourage job growth.

\
Top Issues
\
The War: I will vote against continued funding for the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq and will take the floor of Congress to push for total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq within 10 months after being sworn into office. Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq not only will save American and Iraqi lives but also ameliorate an estimated 40% American casualty rate (including both physical and emotional wounds) for which our military provides excellent in-situ/field and short-term care, but notoriously inadequate long-term care.
\
If elected, I will remain a staunch supporter of our military personnel by correcting that latter deficiency.
\
If stopped tomorrow, whether the ""surge"" is succeeding or not, the war will cost American taxpayers 31/2 trillion dollars in ""indirect costs"" over the next several decades, money which is being borrowed from foreign sources and contributing to America's debtor-nation status, devaluing the dollar and contributing to our serious economic recession.
\
I will introduce legislation to reduce the military budget by 20%-25%, reducing the burden of our federal taxes and redirecting a portion of military spending to infrastructure repair, to affordable education (including a Green Corps community service program), and to jump start single-payer universal health care (which will pay for itself in reduced administrative costs).
\
The Environment: Once elected to Congress, I will introduce legislation to reverse ecological destruction in CT, the U.S. and around the world by introducing legislation to immediately increase U.S. fuel efficiency standards and to end corporate welfare and subsidies for industries that pollute, including the oil and fossil fuel industries, which continue to receive subsidies and taxpayer dollars while making record profits.
\
As a scientist, rather than a run-of-the-mill lawyer or career politician, I will bring to Congress the scientific knowledge and environmental experience necessary to solve the complex problems facing this nation and putting our planet in ecological peril. I am opposed to expanding off-shore oil drilling, as well as drilling in the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge, either as an alternative to development of alternative energy sources or as a false choice to conservation.
\
Just as John F. Kennedy promised the world that we would put a man on the moon in less than a decade, so too, we must make a concerted national commitment to fully developing alternative, clean, renewable sources of energy to replace our addictive dependency on fossil fuels. Expanding nuclear power, failing to exercise restraint in utilization of finite resources and blindly going after the last remaining petroleum deposits on earth as if climate change, finiteness of resources and energy inefficiency were not ecological facts will only make our paradigms shifts and ultimate changes in lifestyle more drastic and take us to the brink of the precipice.

\
The Economy/Jobs: The key to economic recovery is investing in the hard work and ingenuity of Americans. We face an array of economic challenges. Invention and innovation, production and efficiency are the engines that will allow us to overcome these challenges.
\
The federal government must invest heavily in rebuilding our infrastructure. Expanding mass transit and rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges are just two areas for increased investment. Green technology and high-tech industries are also critical. A continued commitment to education is our most important investment.
\
Community colleges have a unique roll to play in this economy because we must expand the number of Americans ready for high skill jobs. I sponsored important legislation that will increase funding for our community colleges so we can retrain our work force to compete for the technologically advance jobs of the future.
\
It will take all these efforts and more to restore our economy. I am committed to fighting for the investments we need.
\
Energy: This issue is critical to rebuilding our economy. Just as President Kennedy challenged America to land a man on the Moon in ten years, we must challenge the ingenuity of Americans to develop the technology we need to move beyond oil.
\
That means significant investments in alternative energy. Fuel cells, like those made right here in Connecticut, are a key and I have already helped pass legislation that provides grants and tax incentives to grow this technology.
\
My recent appointment to the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming will allow me to help lead the effort to develop alternative energy. An energy revolution is possible. It will help our economy in two critical ways. We will stop shipping billions to oil producing countries and we will create high pay high skill jobs.
\
I am also working to help control current energy costs. Working with local businessmen I developed legislation to stop oil speculators from driving up the cost of oil. We fought for two years to pass this legislation and this summer we won. The legislation is already making a difference.

\
The American Military: As economic globalization continues to increase, we see competition for resources turning into aggression with oil being the most sought after commodity.
\
With Russia poised to begin military maneuvers with Venezuela in the western hemisphere as well as its invasion into Georgia and terrorist acts in Pakistan next door to Iran which is developing nuclear capabilities while China aggressively grows her military, it becomes crystal clear that America needs to reinforce and retool our military to protect our citizens and our interests.
\
We cannot continue as a nation to fight among ourselves regarding the use of unilateral military force when threats loom from unseen enemies, once friendly Nations, rogue nations or extremists funded by shadow foreign governments.
\
Connecticut has always been a leader in defense and will continue to provide our military with the products and services it needs to wage a 24/7 vigilant effort against threats both at home and abroad.
\
Developing technologies will help our military do more with less and can provide our political leaders with real time accurate intelligence. If elected to Congress I will support reinforcing our military and providing greater resources and protection for our soldiers, veterans, citizens and our Nation.
\
Energy: Congress must act in a bipartisan manner to write a new comprehensive energy plan which will promote, regulate and oversee the energy industry without limiting or restricting growth.
\
The American small businessman should not be locked out of any new energy plans or development due to government over-regulation or big business monopolization. Big energy must not be allowed to take hold of our resources as it has in the past.
\
America has it all, on our land and off our shores, above our heads and under our feet and there is no reason that millions of new American jobs cannot be created from utilizing shale oil, coal to gas, renewable sources, retooling our auto industry, conservation, clean and safe nuclear, hydrogen, solar, wind or any other form of energy.
\
Connecticut has every resource needed to become a leader in new technologies and product development for the New Energy era beginning today -- especially in areas concerning the environmental impact of existing and emerging technologies.
\
If elected to Congress I promise to look out for the small businessman because I am one, watch out for big business and call out all those who would continue to make energy a political football for special interest.

\
Free Press Betrayed: Of all the forces that combined to involve our country in warfare, the mass media must be reckoned the most blameworthy. Print and broadcast reporters cheered loudly and almost unanimously with each wave of bombings and troop deployments.
\
They presented a parade of government shills, posing as experts, to convince Americans that killing people in foreign lands would be a sound policy. They suppressed all dissident opinion and allowed no moral reservations to be expressed.
\
Today, after almost seven years of daily bloodshed, the war policy is in catastrophic failure, and the mass media have imposed a news blackout. The activities of soldiers in the field are not reported. The mission is unstated. The cost is never discussed. Soldiers' deaths are not mentioned except in the towns where they get buried and, even then, they're on the back pages. Reporters on the scene in Iraq and Afghanistan pass on information from Army press releases, but they don't say what they are seeing or why they're not talking.
\
This is censorship, and it's an abuse of the rights conferred on the free press by our Constitution. I challenge this newspaper to act responsibly and professionally.
\
Corrupt Government: Among our leaders are people so thoroughly influenced by private interests that they are incapable of acting on behalf of the public. The corruption of government transcends political party and extends from local officials all the way up to governors and presidents.
\
Our electoral system, depending as it does so heavily on money, makes it easier for unethical people of both parties to hold public office.
\
Connecticut voters have seen corruption up close, and the federal government is even worse. Several former members of the House of Representatives are serving jail terms. Not a single one was exposed by his colleagues in Congress. Unfortunately, members' loyalty is to each other and not to ethics and the rule of law.
\
From the voter's standpoint, it appears that the point of serving in Congress is to generate lucrative government contracts for your district, to be performed by privileged, politically-connected patrons. There seems to be an agreement between the crooks and their facilitators to keep this system intact.
\
As a lawyer and a non-Democrat, non-Republican with a record of activism, I will bring honest people together to clean up this mess.

\
Economy: As our economy sputters into a recession, it's clear that years of stagnant wage growth and a skyrocketing cost of living have left Connecticut's middle class less secure and more vulnerable to the consequences of economic downturn.
\
We need to rebuild our economy so that it works for the middle class, not Wall Street. That means cutting costs for families and small businesses. We need tax policies that reward growth and innovation, helping businesses expand, while giving a leg up to families raising children here in Connecticut. And we need to pass health care reform to shift crisis care dollars to preventative care and to pool purchasing power for families and businesses.

It's also clear that our financial markets are in need of tough, sensible regulation that ensures that excess and greed on Wall Street never again endangers our pensions and retirements in Connecticut. By curbing irresponsible home lending practices and stabilizing the mortgage market, we can ensure that the American dream is available for future generations. And we need a federal government that is committed to fiscal responsibility and tackling deficits. Balanced budgets and responsible spending shouldn't be lofty goals - they should be the principle by which government operates.

\
Energy: I have proposed comprehensive energy reform that embraces both short and long-term solutions for our nation's needs. This plan includes expanded domestic drilling, nuclear energy, and reform or elimination of costly ethanol and boutique fuels mandates to lower costs in the near term.
\
My plan also calls for investment in sensible renewable energy technologies that are affordable and environmentally friendly for Americans consumers, as well as tax incentives for conservation, all of which will build a greener future for America.
\
Our nation has been forced into a false choice regarding energy policy by Washington politicians. The public has been led to believe that we must choose between meeting our energy demands today and building a better future free of costly, polluting fossil fuels. I reject this choice.
\
Today, our economy relies on fossil fuels such as oil and gas, and we must work to increase American production of these resources in order to secure our economy and protect our nation from hostile, oil producing countries. However, we must ALSO work to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels over time by investing in the development of renewable energy and conservation technologies that hold much promise for the future.
\
Earmark Reform: Each year, Congress mortgages our future by inserting billions of dollars in pet projects for politicians called ""earmarks"" into the federal budget. This practice not only wastes taxpayer dollars on bridges to nowhere or man-made rain forests in the middle of Iowa, it also squanders the public's trust in government as they watch their elected representatives reward political allies and powerful interests with federal funding for projects that have little or no public benefit.
\
My opponent promised earmark reform on the campaign trail two years ago, going so far as to say that he'd like to see earmarks eliminated altogether. Unfortunately he has changed his tune, now defending the practice and requesting nearly $500 million in these pet projects in the last two years. There has been no reform despite Congressman Murphy's promises, just more of the same systemic abuse of taxpayer dollars.
\
Meanwhile, the Federal Highway Trust Fund and other legitimate needs go unfunded. As a member of Congress, I will work to ban these wasteful projects, removing the temptation for politicians to spend money on things the taxpayers neither need nor want.

Revoke the Wall Street Bail Out: This was the greatest act of taxation without representation, the greatest socialization of private-public crime, in US history.
\
It will not stop the banking crisis, no more than Hoover's stop-gaps did in the Great Depression. Our crisis was caused by decades of Federal Reserve, Treasury, executive branch and congressional failure to enforce applicable laws and prudence. This criminal culture will not end unless the Federal Reserve System, a private bank syndicate that loans our government money, is abolished, and a new US national bank responsible only to Congress is created.
\
From it can flow loans for only US business and industry. It was this alignment of US finance and production by FDR's Lend Lease program that permitted America to supply itself and its allies for WW II and end the Great Depression. The bail-out simply created 50 ""colonies"" to be taxed at ""King George's"" pleasure, and enslaved future Americans with endless debt.
\
Create US Energy Independence: Many serious US problems, such as criminal foreign energy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, pollution, and unaffordable transportation and heating, can be traced to foreign oil dependency.
\
The Green Party has historically led actions to reduce this with solar, wind, biomass, geothermal and hydrogen energy, but it is not enough. America must think far ahead. I propose founding the US government-owned American Hydrogen Authority (AHA!) to design and implement a total hydrogen energy economy for the US, and then the world.
\
Everyone has hydrogen. It is the most common element in the universe. It burns clean. Energy wars would end. The technology for hydrogen heat, light, and transportation has existed for decades and just needs modernization and full implementation. Government ownership of this massive project would spawn millions of green jobs, create new technology and guarantee supplies at low prices. With a little analysis and imagination (AHA!) and considerable commitment by ""the people,"" America can chart a clean, peaceful energy future with hydrogen.

PROPERTY TAXES/STATE AIDFOR EDUCATION: During my campaigning and conversations with the citizens of the 9th District, I believe the citizens are most concerned about their rising property tax bills.
\
In order to fight the property tax burden on the families of the 9th District, I have to continue to work to maximize state aid to the towns of the 9th District to keep the property taxes down as low as possible and to adequately fund education.
\
I am proud to say that in my first term in the state Senate, state aid for the towns of the 9th District increased by over $10 million or 18 percent. Without this increased state aid, the property tax burden for the citizens of the 9th District would have been much greater.

TAXES: I support a 3 percent property tax cap. A property tax cap is a means, a financial device to force local and state governments to budget as carefully as you have to. We are all constantly looking for ways to stretch every dollar. Why can't we ask our government to do the same? Every business in the private sector is continually looking for ways to improve their efficiency or they are not likely to be in business for very long. Too many of our neighbors and too many businesses have had to vote with their feet and leave Connecticut because of the relentless increases in taxes. A 3 percent property tax cap draws a line and gives government a measurable goal on spending increases and much-needed relief for all of us.

Tax reform is a very high priority. Connecticut relies excessively on the local property tax, which is an agrarian concept reaching back to Colonial times. Taxes should be based upon our ability to pay, and that is an income (not property) standard which has served this country well in the last hundred years. I have supported the phasing out of the local property tax in favor of alternative local taxes, and at the state level I have supported a graduated income tax rather than the current flat tax.
\
As long as the local property tax continues, I urge a freeze of that tax on seniors with low and middle incomes.

Jobs:Job growth is dependent on both keeping companies in and attracting businesses to Connecticut. High taxes have been chasing both businesses and people from this state for the last dozen or so years. Lowering taxes and providing incentives, such as deductions for business, medical and education expenses, will help the job market now and attract growth. While chasing my career and education, I spent a great deal of time in New Jersey because that's where the jobs were. Now that I have come back home, I have heard people wondering why so many young people leave the state and do not come back. The answer is simple. Young people who want to start a life will go where there are jobs that will pay for that life.

Taxes:Connecticut's reputation for being a high tax state is known nationally. It is the primary reason that it is so expensive to live and work here.
\
Last year, my opponent, chairman of the budget and appropriations committee, proposed and voted for the single largest tax increase since the inception of the income tax.
\
This year, in an attempt to tax residents even further, my opponent proposed a tax on delivery services. Whenever you shipped a package to a relative or had medical services delivered to your home, the state would have taxed the delivery. In a state already burdened with high taxes, my opponent proposes more of the same.
\
As your state senator, I will reject calls to raise taxes at the state level. We need to move beyond the tired, old practices of taxing people first while proposing an expansion in the size and scope of government. With budget deficits now projected in the billions of dollars, I will work to ensure that we can close the budget gap without raising taxes on a population that is already taxed too much. To assist our towns in the 33rd District, I will also support legislation that places a cap on the growth of local property taxes.

Clean, renewable and affordable energyand green jobs: The long-term trend is for increasing energy prices and future scarcity for oil and the other fossil fuels on which our economy depends.

\
The economic opportunities are tremendous and the consequences of not acting are just as large. I introduced legislation last year and will again this year to create a state Department of Clean Energy, which will consolidate and expand current programs and work to bring manufacturers of clean Energy to Connecticut so that our citizens benefit from the new jobs that are being created in this rapidly expanding industry.

Transit as an economic engine: We have great cities with plenty of affordable housing, an educated work force, self-employed entrepreneurs, and lots of talent, but getting around is getting more and more expensive. I believe more people would return to Connecticut after college and more companies would locate here if we had transit options.
\
I am jealous of how people who live in towns in Fairfield County or near Boston or New York can get to work on the train. I believe transit could make a difference here in central Connecticut. Could you imagine a train from Middletown to Hartford or to New Haven and Meriden?
\
I believe transit is the economic engine we need to grow the economy. We have rail lines and rail rights of way already established along the Connecticut River. There is underutilized land in every town along the rail line. We could open this land up and build transit-oriented neighborhoods, which would be ideal locations for new businesses and jobs, affordable housing, and industry. It would grow the tax base in each of these cities.

As state representative, I have consistently supported measures that bolster our ties between our education system and the business community. Integrating the curriculum with the necessary job skills to compete in the global economy will help Connecticut compete for high paying jobs.
\
With an already strong public school system, Connecticut can capitalize on the worldwide economic trends just as we have in the past.

Budget and Economy: The next legislative session will likely be dominated by the budget deficit and the consequences of the national and global economic and credit crisis. We will need to balance the needs of residents, who may need more state services during hard times, the needs of local governments, the legal requirement to balance the budget and overall tax burden. This will be difficult.
\
I voted against the current budget because it did not appear sustainable when it was enacted. Going forward, we need to enact performance based budgeting and enact a fair, balanced tax system. Connecticut needs to move away from boom and bust budgets, and plan better for the future.
\
Fiscal stability will give the markets more confidence and help improve the economy. A better health care system, incentives for green industries, a reformed property tax structure, first rate transportation and an outstanding education system will attract companies and skilled workers to our state.

It is with honor that I represent the constituency of the 48th Assembly District. I respect each and every opinion on issues facing our state and encourage people to contact me with ideas and concerns. This past year I worked with a local resident to pass legislation offering a wider range of choices to automobile owners on where they can repair their vehicle after an accident. The insurance industry often steers claimants toward ""preferred"" shops, which in many cases cuts other small businesses out of the picture. This law now helps the consumer stay better informed. I have also advocated for regional fire training schools , for slowing the loss of our small farms and dairy producers, funding private providers and of course making sure the state gives back to our communities by funding LOCAL projects. The economic problems of our state and nation will cause a hit on state revenues during the next term. My main goal will be holding on to current programs that serve the public. Cutting ConnPACE or Husky would only cause further hardship for populations that are already venerable and in need of relief. My promise to my district is to continue striving to help my constituents and my communities. I will work hard to address any and all issues that I am confronted with. I live in Colchester with my husband and have resided here for 29 years. I have served on local boards and commissions and have held the position of state representative since 1997. Currently serving as deputy majority Leader.

The Budget Deficit:The State is facing a $300 million deficit this fiscal year if we continue the same track of spending. Similarly, FY 2010 and 2011 expect to be years approaching a $1.5 billion deficit. How will we manage to keep essential state services without raising taxes? I am against raising taxes and favor cuts in state spending - not tapping into our rainy day fund which stands at approximately $1.5 billion.
\
We must impose a hiring freeze, ban non-essential state travel, eliminate consulting fees, ban overtime where possible, and delay the expansion of state programs.
\
We must put our fiscal home in order, the same way a family household does when there is an income shortfall. Cut back on spending ! This concept should carry through until the economy recovers.

TaxesOver the last six years, our property taxes have gone through the roof. I know many young families who cannot afford to move in to our towns, and many seniors who can no longer afford to stay.
\
I will take on high property taxes by working to increase the percentage of taxes returned to our towns. In this climate of economic uncertainty and inevitable belt tightening, I will make sure that the Republican Administration does not balance the state's books on the backs of our towns and our middle class.
\
We had a chance to reduce the strain of healthcare costs on our towns and small businesses, a cost-effective measure aimed at reducing property taxes and encouraging business growth, but the Republicans worked to block it.
\
Connecticut is losing 1,000 jobs a month and we cannot afford this partisan blockade against good ideas. We need to get Connecticut moving again, and the way to do that is through real property tax reform and middle class tax relief.

Property Tax Reform: There is no question that our state is over-reliant on property taxes to fund education. This is particularly difficult for smaller towns where education budgets can claim 65-70% of the towns' budgeted expenses.
\
Pair this with other state grants that haven't been fully funded in over a decade and individual towns duplicating services and we can see the importance of property tax reform.
\
These past four years that I have served as state representative for Madison and North Guilford I have concentrated a great deal on property tax reform. We made tremendous progress in several areas such as historic increases in education and special education funding. We also implemented a package of tough accountability measures to ensure that these funds are used appropriately across the state.
\
Additionally, we created incentives for towns to share services regionally, adding an additional level of efficiency to town budgets. To build on this progress, I will work to significantly increase the level of special education funding that comes from the state and to fully fund the state grants promised to our towns.
\
I am proud of this progress and hope to have the opportunity to continue to fight for reform.

The Economy:Tough economic times are ahead and Connecticut is not immune.
\
Madison and Guilford receive 6 cents and 8 cents in state aid, respectively, for every $1 paid in state income tax.
\
There exists a problem with education funding in Connecticut. There is the issue that all towns and cities are rightfully upset about -- the overall amount of funding that the state contributes to education.Then, there is the issue of fairness in funding, which is to say that certain communities receive a disproportionately large amount of state funding, while other towns get only a small fraction of the local pool of money. Madison and Guilford fall into the latter category.
\
We don't get our fair share of state funds. Guilford annually receives $795 per student in ECS funding; Madison $407. Some city schools receive more than $7,000 per student. The ECS formula is still broken. It exaggerates differences in town wealth. It should reward high-performing school districts -- a component that would encourage accountability. Sometimes less is more. Less taxes mean more money in your pocket. But, when it comes to funding our children's education, less is never more!

Sitting side by side Wednesday in their first debate of the election season, state Sen. Biagio ""Billy"" Ciotto and challenger Patrick J. Hallisey seemed to present a clear choice to the voters of the 9th Senate District.
\
On the left was the Democrat Ciotto, 66, a 42-year state employee and first-term senator from Wethersfield, arguing the need for government to regulate health care and support education and boasting of the birth last weekend of twin grandchildren.
\
On the right was the Republican Hallisey, 39, a veterinarian, private businessman and former high school classmate of Ciotto's children, saying government has grown too intrusive on business and families and too soft on criminals.
\
Throughout their debate, broadcast live on public access cable television, Hallisey sought to play up the differences between them. Waving copies of Ciotto's voting record, Hallisey said he was the true conservative in the race.
\
""I'm a conservative, economically, taxwise and socially,"" said Hallisey, of Wethersfield. ""Mr. Ciotto will attempt to show himself otherwise, but his record shows he's a liberal.""
\
Ciotto, a former top official in the state Department of Motor Vehicles, resisted his opponent's attempts to label him a liberal and a bureaucrat, but generally declined to respond directly to Hallisey's comments.
\
""I'm not for bigger government,"" Ciotto said. ""I believe in only the government that we need, but I insist on all the government that we need.""
\
The candidates took questions from moderator Ralph Capenera on priorities, differences, crime, taxes and school desegregation.
\
Hallisey said job growth is the most important issue facing the state. He proposed making the state a better environment for job growth by establishing English as the official state language, imposing harsher conditions on prisoners and reducing taxes and regulations.
\
Ciotto said spending in government is the most important issue. He said the state must ""get the biggest bang for the tax dollar.""
\
The rest of Hallisey's platform included shortening the legislative session, establishing term limits for legislators, making prisoners work on highway road crews and fostering competition among public schools.
\
Ciotto spoke of establishing magnet and charter schools, eliminating drive-through mastectomies and reducing crime by supporting education.
\
Both men said they are opposed to busing as a solution to court- ordered school desegregation. Both agreed the state gas tax should be cut.
\
The 9th Senate District comprises Rocky Hill, Newington, Cromwell and parts of both Wethersfield and Middletown.

After decades of unquestioning allegiance to cars, trucks and highways, Connecticut must go back to its long-ignored railroads if it expects to prosper in this increasingly difficult new century, transit advocates said at a day-long conference Friday.
\
The message was hardly new, but the audience was.
\
Instead of a couple of dozen hard-core rail partisans, the session brought a standing-room-only crowd of 120 people, including a lineup of politically powerful speakers.
\
Legislators promised a new effort to break a ""highways first"" culture in state government, and former U.S. Rep. Rob Simmons described the Obama administration's stimulus plan as an extraordinary chance to expand rapid transit throughout Connecticut and New England.
\
""For sure, transit's moment has arrived,"" U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd told the crowd. ""We have entered a transformational moment, a once-in-a-generation opportunity. But these moments don't last long.""
\
Dodd, whose Banking Committee has major influence over federal transportation policy, described 2009 as a pivotal year for rebuilding half-abandoned rail routes and extending new ones. That will create good-paying construction jobs in the short term, and will transform the region in the long run, he said.
\
Dodd cited the long-overdue Springfield-to-Hartford-to-New Haven commuter rail project as an example of what New England needs to be economically competitive in the 21st century.
\
Sponsored by the Sierra Club and the National Corridors Initiative, the ""Need for Speed"" forum focused on ways to create better high-speed rail through the region, and substantially expand commuter rail, light rail and freight service. Rail advocates have run similar sessions for years, but are getting more attention because of the nation's economic crisis and the dizzying summertime spike in fuel prices.
\
State Senate President Pro Tem Donald Williams said highway congestion, fuel costs and the deep recession make rail transit a priority like never before.
\
""The irony is, now is when some folks who've opposed mass transit initiatives are starting to get religion,"" Williams said. ""Does anyone think they're going to see fuel prices this depressed when we come out of this [downturn]?""
\
Speakers agreed that building light rail and extending the Shoreline East commuter system will require regional cooperation, famously rare among New England towns where home rule is cherished. They also said Connecticut's governor will have to work closely with counterparts in other states to improve high-speed rail in the region.
\
""It's easy to do roads and bridges. Rail takes extra effort,"" Simmons said. ""Don't let anybody in Connecticut talk about 'shovel-ready' for roads and bridges without talking about 'shovel-ready' for rail. Don't let the governor or the legislature pass any stimulus without rail - it's good for the economy, it's good for transit, it's good for the environment.""
\
Dodd told the audience to press their congressmen to back his National Infrastructure Bank initiative for federal financing of big-ticket upgrades for major bridges, rail lines and seaports and similar projects.
\
Matt Nemerson of the Connecticut Technology Council suggested a stiff regional gas tax - enough to push the current cost to $3 a gallon - to create a regional transit fund.

APRNS, DOCTORS WILL REDEFINE PRIMARY CARE

Now that advanced practice registered nurses have been given the right to practice independently, it is time for APRNs and those physicians who opposed the bill to bury their differences and to dissolve the battle lines that separated them for the past two years [April 29, Page 1, ""Medical Leeway: APRNs Given More Freedom To Practice""].
\
With mutual respect, now is the time for both sides to consider how each in their own way can use their unique talents and skills to improve access to health care for Connecticut's residents. Giving the APRNs independence ushers in a whole new way of defining primary care.

MAYOR: BOOST PRE-K ACCESS
\
As a parent and mayor of the state's largest city, I've seen firsthand how tough it is for kids who don't have access to high-quality early childhood education.
\
And research is clear: If kids aren't reading at the level they should be by third grade, they're less likely to graduate from high school. We need to do more for our kids. That's why I'm urging Connecticut's House of Representatives to pass legislation that expands access to early childhood education. Senate Bill 25, unanimously approved by the Senate and backed by Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, helps provide kids with the tools they need to succeed. It expands access to school readiness programs for kids who need it most, creates a Smart Start program to help schools meet their pre-K needs, and establishes an Office of Early Childhood to better coordinate programs.
\
Right now, Bridgeport can accommodate 450 new pre-K slots next year. And the bill will create an additional 1,020 slots for kids across the state, and 4,010 new slots for kids over the next five years.
\
More kids in Bridgeport and more kids across Connecticut will be prepared to one day attend college and compete for 21st-century jobs if we pass this bill.

\
In response to the editorial ""Innovative Recycling Bill"" [April 29], let's help make Connecticut be one of the recycling leaders in the country.

\
More recycling and less burning seems like a great idea to me. I want to live in a state with clean air and a good environment. In addition, this bill should save Connecticut residents tax dollars over the long haul. Passage of Senate Bill 27 seems like a win-win to me.

147,"
Gov. M. Jodi Rell fired her first serious shot at legislative Democrats last week, threatening to veto any budget plan other than her own that would violate the state's spending cap. It's about time that the generally agreeable Mrs. Rell got tough. Democrats have been talking nothing but tax and spend since the session's opening gavel, and the state can't afford it.
\
If past is prologue, the Republican governor and the Democrats who run the General Assembly will agree to compromise on the budget sometime in the next six weeks. But right now they disagree on just about everything, starting with the size of the projected budget gap for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Mrs. Rell's office predicts that expenses will outstrip anticipated revenue by more than $1 billion; Democrats claim the gap will be less than half that, giving them more room to spend.
\
On balance, the governor has the better arguments when it comes to writing the next budget.
\
Mrs. Rell has proposed that she and the legislature override the spending cap for only one reason: so that Connecticut can collect some $120 million in federal matching funds to help pay for nursing home services. Democrats on the budget-writing committee threaten to bust through the cap for any number of reasons.
\
Mrs. Rell says she prefers a roughly even split between spending cuts and tax increases for the next biennium. Democrats haven't talked much, if at all, about spending reductions -- as if they believed state government operations and programs were as lean as they could possibly be.
\
The governor would raise revenue with huge increases in the taxes on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco products. That's not an ideal way to go -- those taxes are regressive in nature. But this year, Mrs. Rell's way is preferable to broad-based tax increases being considered, prematurely, by the Democrats. Any massive change in the personal income tax should await the conclusions of a study of the state's tax system being undertaken by a legislative committee, along with an in-depth review of the property tax, which finances much of local government.
\
Besides, increasing the gas tax to finance major transportation improvements makes some sense. It was shortsighted of the legislature and former Gov. John G. Rowland to lower the fuel levy several years ago while not attending to transportation needs.
\
Many Democrats also want to pile tax increases on business, a move that surely would make Connecticut less competitive and impede slow-going efforts here to create jobs. This is already a high-cost state in which to do business. One such bad idea is a proposal to require so-called unitary financial reporting, which could lead to much higher taxes on large Connecticut-based corporations by allowing this state to tax profits generated elsewhere.
\
Another burdensome bill calls for sunsetting corporate tax credits and deductions and requiring the legislature to reauthorize them every two years. This would play havoc with a corporation's long-term planning and contribute to an unstable business environment.
\
Mrs. Rell should make clear her intentions to veto these onerous tax proposals if the legislature sends them to her desk.
\
The Democrats increased their margins of control in both the House and Senate in last year's elections. They seem to be interpreting the results at the ballot box as a mandate to tax and spend, tax and spend. Are they certain that's what the voters were saying?

QUESTIONS CHENEY'S HEART TRANSPLANT
\
Regarding Dick Cheney's selection for a heart transplant at the age of 71 [March 25, news, ""Cheney, 71, Undergoes Heart Transplant""]: I question his selection over much younger, healthier potential recipients.
\
After at least four heart attacks, I can assume he has had other damage to his vital organs. I know that there are so many younger patients with end-stage heart disease who have young families and they cannot obtain a donor heart. Cheney did wait for 20 months, but many others die before a heart is available. Suitable heathy organs are hard to procure.
\
Why should Cheney receive preferential treatment? And has anyone thought about the cost? Are we as taxpayers paying for this procedure since he was an elected official? Private insurers would not be so willing to pay for this extreme procedure for a person of Cheney's age.
\
Perhaps his new heart will give him a sense of greater compassion and the understanding that wars are not the solution for spreading democracy. One can only hope he recovers and becomes a better version of himself.

KEEP CAMERAS OUT OF THE COURTROOM
\
Our current political environment is a media circus. Every comment, every picture, every tweet remotely related to a candidate or political figure is overanalyzed to the point that any truth or meaning is stolen from the original content. We have reached the point of no return on making a mockery of candidates; let us have the dignity to allow the judicial system to work without looking to make it into a media spectacle [March 27, editorial, ""Stuck In The 18th Century""].
\
The Supreme Court should have the authority to make decisions -- which they were selected to do -- without the blazing glare of the public eye. They are not actors hired to entertain us, but judges selected to make important decisions that affect the entire nation.
\
Asking for cameras in the court goes beyond transparency; it makes a vitally important act into yet another media circus. We are all allowed to read the transcripts, so let the judges work without making them into just another reality television moment.

SHOWBOATING ON GAS TAX
\
Once again, our legislators fall for phony showboating in place of real tax reform [March 29, Page 1, ""A Little Relief From High Gas Prices""]. With the nearly meaningless cap on gas taxes, they instantly discarded some $5 million in desperately needed revenue while lowering the average driver's fill-up by less than the quarter they dropped down the storm drain while doing so.
\
Far too much tax protest and tax ""reform"" focuses on trivial points like this, discarding meaningful and needed revenue based on almost inconsequential tax breaks. When are the Hartford showboats going to tackle tax reform that brings in the needed revenue for state operations and distributes the bills more equitably?
\
Probably not while they're basking in the glow of having ""accomplished something"" so pointless and counterproductive.

149,"Take Your Business Elsewhere\Another company with a substantial presence in Connecticut slips out of the state and takes 1,500 good paying jobs with it. [Feb. 8, ""MassMutual Will Close Enfield Offices, Sending 1,500 to Massachusetts, 'The Best Place for Us to Grow,' "" courant.com].\Meanwhile, Democrat political leaders seem more interested in finding new ways to tax already overburdened companies than creating an environment that will encourage job growth.\Among the array of new taxes, higher taxes and new fees proposed by Gov. Dannel P. Malloy: increasing the sales tax, raising the gas tax, continuing the corporate surcharge (which was due to sunset next year), increasing the real-estate conveyance tax and, the darling of every Democrat in state government, installing highway tolls.\The Democrats are so giddy about tolls that the chairman of the House Transportation Committee promised that if tolls are installed on state highways, ""Connecticut would thrive."" Really?\That's what the governor told us a few years ago when he pushed through two multibillion-dollar tax increases.\Talking up more taxes and fees sends a clear message to employers in the state and to companies outside of the state that are looking to expand their businesses: Connecticut is not very serious about fixing its huge financial mess. Better take your business elsewhere.\Kenneth L. Boudreau, Farmington\Don't Be Quick To Point\Consider this scenario: Mom and Dad are walking toward the beach at the state park with their two kids in tow, ages 5 and 8. When they pass the lifeguard sitting on the stand soaking in the sunshine on this beautiful July afternoon, Dad remarks that this lifeguard is being paid with his tax money to sit there getting a tan.\An hour later, this same lifeguard is performing CPR on his oldest child, until the ambulance medics take over and transport the child to a hospital to be checked out by a doctor.\Does this same father look at government assistance, unemployment insurance and food stamps in the same light as the lifeguard sitting in the sunshine?\Pointing fingers at people in need of help will only make sense to you right up until you are in a position where the fingers are pointing at you.\Some may say people take advantage of this kind of help. My advice is to get over it. If you look at any government or private program, someone will, without a doubt, find a way to scam the system. Just look at Congress.\That argument is not and should not be a reason to give up on the people who need a hand up in our society.\Michael Cashman, Wethersfield\Government In The Wrong\I will be the first to admit that I am totally confused how people can be in this country for many, many years illegally, have children and open a business and in some cases be better citizens than many natural citizens - and then be deported.\To me, it is the government who is in the wrong here, especially when so many of these people open businesses. If they are here illegally, how can they open a business?\Trump's plan to build his ridiculous wall is just that - ridiculous. He doesn't care about the families, and I don't believe he really cares about the wall. He just wants to win on one of his campaign promises.\One thing he probably hasn't given thought to is that the children who will be left here in the United States while their parents are forced to return to their home countries will be the voters of tomorrow.\Jill Price, Newington\Love A Parade\Parades.

State House Distric 80
\
Though he lost his bid for election to the 80th House District seat by more than 5,500 votes two years ago, John W. Obiden is giving it another shot.
\
Obiden, a member of the Concerned Citizens Party of Connecticut, the local branch of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, is running once again against State Rep. Dennis H. Cleary, the Republican incumbent who beat him so soundly in 1994.
\
When asked why he wants to be a state legislator, Obiden, 68, has a simple answer. ""There are things to be done that are not getting done,"" Obiden said. ""Nobody is making any effort to alleviate problems.""
\
Obiden, a retired painter, said that the main problems in Connecticut are that residents pay too much in taxes, and the state takes their money and spends it.
\
Obiden said that if elected, his top priority would be to reduce the tax burden by cutting the state income tax, gasoline tax, and giving tax relief to local property owners.
\
How would this be achieved?
\
By cutting state spending, Obiden said.
\
For instance, Obiden said welfare is intended to provide temporary relief to those who are down on their luck. It is not meant to become a lifestyle, which he says it has for some people.
\
""Welfare is driving taxes up,"" said Obiden.
\
Likewise, the gasoline tax is unfair, Obiden said, because out-of-state drivers get to use state highways and not pay for them.
\
Obiden has pledged to cut the gasoline tax by ""10 or 15 percent,"" and pay for it by putting toll booths on state highways.
\
The Concerned Citizens Party was started in 1975, by Joseph Zdonczyk, of Wolcott. Like other affiliates of the Taxpayers Party, it adopts the national platform.
\
This platform includes ending legal abortion, reducing powers of the federal government and cutting taxes.
\
Affiliates of the Taxpayer Party include Randall Terry's New York Right to Life Party, the Constitutional Party of Pennsylvania and the U.S. Taxpayers Party of Texas.
\
In 1992, Cleary fought a tough election campaign and defeated three opponents. The election this year is a repeat of the 1994 contest when he faced only Obiden.
\
There is no Democratic challenger for the seat, which represents all of Wolcott and part of Southington.
\
In 1994, Cleary won a landslide victory against Obiden, beating him by a vote of 6,223 to 520.
\
Despite the previous outcome, Cleary, who recently celebrated his 40th birthday, is actively campaigning for re-election.
\
""I'm attending functions throughout the district, I'm doing some cable TV,"" Cleary said. ""I am probably doing 75 to 80 percent of what I would be doing if the seat was hotly contested.""
\
Cleary said the complaint he hears most often from constituents is that the state gasoline tax is too high. He has pledged to cut the gas tax by two to four cents a gallon.
\
As a registered nurse and administrator of his family's Wolcott Manor Nursing Home, Cleary has a strong interest in health care issues. If re-elected, Cleary said he would work on legislation regulating the managed-health care industry.
\
""Managed care cannot become a program just to reduce the cost of health care,"" Cleary said. ""The state has the duty to monitor health care. We need to set up some sort of regulatory environment.""
\
In his past term, Cleary was criticized by some fellow legislators for voting on nursing home issues, an area where he makes a living.
\
The state's code of ethics permit a lawmaker to vote for a bill that would benefit a company he or she owns or works for, as long as the company does not benefit any more than others in the industry.
\
Cleary dismissed the criticism, saying he works on legislation in areas he is most familiar.
\
""If I have an expertise in an area, say accounting, nursing, childcare, then those are the areas I am going to be most vocal on,"" Cleary said.

151,"A state panel advising the General Assembly on how to reverse Connecticut's economic decline is considering a revamp of state taxes, including ending the estate tax, a business executive said Wednesday.\James Loree, the chief executive officer of Stanley Black & Decker Inc., is leading efforts by the Commission on Fiscal Stability and Economic Growth to advance pro-growth policies.\""We've just been stuck in a rut since the '08-09 recession,"" he said at a meeting of the commission\Loree called for policies that attract and retain high-income individuals.\""I know that won't sit well with some people,"" he said. ""Some people don't think that's a good idea, but fortunately or unfortunately that's what we need to do in this state.""\For example, Loree said Connecticut's estate tax is ""really kind of a poke in the eye for the wealthy here.""\""Most people I talk to who are leaving the state mention this as one of the key factors,"" he said. ""If you're trying to attract wealthy people, it's not a very good policy.""\""I personally would opt to eliminate (it) in total,"" he said. ""If you could keep those folks around, that would be a positive.""\""But at minimum, we would hope to align that with the new federal structure,"" Loree said.\States and the federal government tax transfers of property and assets of an estate that are bequeathed in a will or provided as a gift. The amount of taxation varies and typically is tied to the dollar value of the estate. For years critics have said that the state's ""death tax"" is driving wealthy residents to states such as Florida, which doesn't have an estate tax. In the process, Connecticut has lost billions of dollars in potential taxable income.\Congress and President Donald Trump enacted a federal tax overhaul in December that doubled the estate and gift tax exemption to $10 million, effective through 2025.\In Connecticut, the tax will be in line with the federal exclusion for estates of those who die in 2020 and later, said a spokesman for the state Department of Revenue Services.\In the budget law that Gov. Dannel P. Malloy signed last October, he said changes related to the state estate tax will make Connecticut more competitive with neighboring states ""and make us a more desirable place to work and live.""\Connecticut relies on high net worth taxpayers for a portion of revenue, which takes a hit when the super-rich move to states with no income tax such as Florida and Texas.\The estate and gift tax generated $218.7 million in revenue in the state's 2016-17 budget year, or about 1 percent of the annual state budget.\Other proposals being considered by the commission include phasing in reductions in the individual income tax and broadening the state sales tax to include items now exempt and possibly raising the tax by about 1 percent from the current 6.35 percent, Loree said.\In addition, to offset the lower income tax, a ""modest payroll tax"" of 1 percent or 2 percent could be considered, he said. Acknowledging the political headwinds for such a proposal, Loree said, ""There are challenges with that.""\In addition, members of the commission ""very well may recommend some form of a gas tax increase"" to generate revenue to upgrade transportation systems, he said.\The overall impact on revenue has to be neutral or slightly positive ""or it makes no sense here in this environment with all the other problems that we have,"" Loree said.\Loree said commission members look to Florida, North Carolina and Texas as states to emulate in changing the mix of state revenue.\The commission, which includes several company chief executives and others, has been meeting for several months to consider recommendations to the legislature to boost economic growth and end Connecticut's chronic budget deficits.\Credit: By STEPHEN SINGER - ssinger@courant.com"
152,"
If transportation is destiny, then perhaps the United States isn't destined to remain the leader of the global economy.
\
We built a system of canals, railroads and highways to move people, raw materials and finished goods, and it gave us the greatest economy in history. Today our transportation system is strained to the breaking point. Highways are badly congested, costing manufacturers an estimated $8 billion a year in delays. Bridges collapse, or are in danger of collapse. Trains run on ancient rail beds. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that congestion of the transportation system costs the U.S. economy as much as $200 billion a year.
\
National transportation policy, such as it is, has devolved into a congressional pork-fest, leading to moronic wastes such as the ""bridge to nowhere."" The U.S. drives more and uses more fuel than any other country, causing pollution, global warming and profound dependence on foreign oil.
\
Things aren't much better on the state level, where the Department of Transportation has been lurching along with scandal and ineptitude over the past couple of years.
\
Two recent reports can help us get back on track.
\
*
\
On the federal level, The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission recommended to Congress last week that the country develop a transportation plan that will restore the economy. The commission believes such a plan will require an investment of at least $225 billion a year (in public and private dollars) for the next 50 years. Spending today is less than 40 percent of that amount.
\
The federal commission lays out many important goals. We must keep the existing system in good repair. We need an efficient intermodal freight network. We need a cultural shift toward transit and intercity passenger rail, and must invest in highways as well.
\
Safety must become a high priority, to stop the incredible loss of 43,000 killed and 2.6 billion injured each year. Transportation must be planned in the context of environmentally sound, energy-saving policy.
\
To get there, we must have the money, the plan and a reasonable regulatory environment. Users will pay for the new system, as if it were a public utility.
\
This is a profoundly sensible report. In 1999, a consultant said Connecticut could become an economic cul-de-sac because of transportation gridlock. Since then, things have gotten worse.
\
The commission's report assumes that Washington can summon the backbone and discipline to enact a new policy and follow it through, as was done with the interstate highway system. Thus it is disappointing that U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters was one of three (of 12) commission members voting against the final report. She objects to raising the federal gas tax and a larger federal role in transportation, but agrees that something must be done.
\
*
\
Perhaps pressure must come from the states, and here Connecticut needs some work.
\
After the Department of Transportation massively bungled a $60 million construction project on I-84 in Cheshire, Gov. M. Jodi Rell appointed a commission headed by Pitney Bowes Chairman Michael Critelli to lead a ""top-to-bottom reorganization"" of the DOT. The group is charged with ""examining and redesigning the DOT, its mission, direction, business practices and organizational structure.""
\
A draft of the Critelli commission's report was released last week. Those who were looking for a big vision were disappointed. The report characterizes DOT as a large fiefdom, insular, unconnected and unaccountable. The recommendations go toward more public accountability and public involvement, adequate staffing, organization, establishing measures of accountability and improving funding mechanisms.
\
Mr. Critelli told a commission meeting Friday that these steps are ""foundational,"" aimed at getting the department up to a level of proficiency that will allow it to take on broader initiatives.
\
Though the commission's job was to look at the DOT, not at overall transportation policy, we'd like to see a clear statement that the next commissioner must be committed to a sensible synthesis of all modes of transportation.
\
The U.S. needs a major upgrade of its transportation infrastructure, lest the whole country become an economic cul-de-sac. To delay just makes things worse. These two reports will get us started, if we choose to move.

Autumn in New England! Ah, the explosion of glorious colors, a Joseph's jacket of electric hues, a last celebration before the humble surrender to winter's grainy, penitential, heads-down grays and monkish browns.
\
There, a splash of sundown red while, over here, cheery yellows rest with the gentle grace of a little lad's sleeping head. Those reds, volcano reds, call our attention to ""Callahan"" while the yellows, eye-poke yellows, commend ""Gilbert"" to our drive- by attention. Dole blues. Clinton in white. Lawn signs. As familiar as the otherwise drab foliage, which struggles to compete with this truer fingerprint of the season: electioneering.
\
I look out at autumn and see campaign signs. Heaven help me. Thirty-one more days 'til Election Day's done. Can I make it?

Hah! Look at that squirrel. A flash of flow, a blur of spirit on the bouncing prowl. Burying acorns with preposterous dignity when the entire world knows the dopey little scamp will have totally forgotten where X marks the spot before he's 2 feet gone. The squirrel is a grasshopper.
\
And, at that, possibly a perfect metaphor for the improvident, two-handed taxing by those who trifle with our sense of self- reliance with misplaced extravagance. Or, maybe in the squirrel we might see a seamless representation of the mock sense of purpose more cynically masking hidden- away advantage to the greedy, invested interests while those in greater need are coldly dismissed to find on their own what few acorns that trickle down, or bear the consequence when the equally heartless winter arrives. You could see that. Or maybe you could see it is just a squirrel.

Are they symbols of an open nature -- or of insufficient immigration controls where every foreign bird can just come by and sponge off our system as much as it wants! Is their contribution part of what made this country great or are they and their infernal refusal to honk in English a finger-snap under the nose of the rest of us who play by the rules?
\
Or are they just geese?

Where is he on the issues?
\
It appears he's in great debate with Mrs. Jones, layered and penetrating riposting of keen partisan energy. No soft-eyed moderator. Clearly, they argue over the Haitian policy, the gas tax. She is gesticulating energetically; he is nearly menacing with his intensity. Over the failed national drug policy, undoubtedly. Or maybe the complex challenges of free trade. Or the environment. Education policies.

154,"
At the start of every session of the legislature, state Rep. John E. Piscopo is there to introduce the same bills -- to repeal the state's income tax and to make English its official language.
\
The motions fail, and attention is turned to other business.
\
But Piscopo, a conservative fixture in the House, isn't backing down. If re-elected to his seventh term, he pledges to introduce the controversial measures again.
\
They'll almost certainly meet the same fate. But it's a matter of principle, one he's not about to abandon now.
\
""I see myself as a conservative. I believe in minimal government in people's lives,"" said the 45-year-old house painter who lives in Thomaston with his wife. ""I believe in as little taxation as possible, and as little government intrusion as possible.""
\
Those views have played well in a district that is frugal, solidly middle class and the opposite of multicultural.
\
Twice, the Democrats couldn't find anyone to run against him in the 76th District. Two years ago he won by a 3-1 ratio.
\
As an incumbent, he has the obvious advantage of pointing to accomplishments, real or attempted, during his long tenure.
\
He is a true believer is reducing taxes, and said he will continue trying to chip away at the income tax. He supported an increase in tax credits, a cut in the gas tax and a sales-tax-free week. With a budding surplus, he believes there is room for further cuts.
\
""A lot of people have resigned themselves that [the income tax] is here to stay. But repeal is my goal,"" said Piscopo.
\
He thinks there are enough gun laws on the books. If more people carried guns there would be less crime, he said. Those kinds of views have earned him an A-plus rating with the National Rifle Association.
\
But Piscopo is not in a lockstep with his party's conservative wing on every issue.
\
He supports abortion, saying he doesn't have the right to interfere with such an important and emotional issue.
\
Though he has voted in the past against gay issues, he said he might be open to gay unions.
\
""I will keep an open mind. I would have to see how the law read. I'm not knee-jerk-opposed to gay marriages,"" he said.
\
As he finished 12 years in the House, Piscopo admits he's considering a change. If Nancy Johnson ever vacates the 6th U.S. Congressional Dsitrict seat, Piscopo said he would try to position himself to carry the Republican banner. . ""Aggressively,"" he said with a grin.
\
""I would love to go to Congress. I have my eyes wide open,"" he said.
\
Piscopo has lived in the area for most of his life. He was born in Waterbury, and raised in Thomaston. He earned a bachelor's degree from Eastern Conneticut State University in Willimantic.
\
When he is not working, Piscopo is likely to be exploring the hiking trails that wind through western Connecticut. He loves the outdoors, but has mellowed a bit since his early adulthood, when he cycled through Europe, worked on a ranch in the bottom of the Grand Canyon and hiked all 2,160 miles of the Appalachian Trail.
\
It was a mental and physical endurance test that pushed him to his limits.
\
""It was a graduate school in the environment, survival and your own spiritual fortitude,"" he said.

155,"A winning plan \to reduce transportation emissions \While it is absolutely necessary to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, a multi-state gasoline tax cap-and-trade system [Oct. 25, Politics, ""Connecticut among states studying regional gas tax""] would be a complicated, ineffective approach. Not only are existing cap and trade programs ineffective at reducing emission, they are adversely impacting low-income people with more pollution and higher energy bills.\A winning plan to reduce transportation emissions will come from careful planning that emphasizes electrifying transportation, powered by renewable energy, increasing investment in public transportation, and making our communities more accessible for biking and walking.\We do not have time to waste on reworking failed market-based policies - we need to get off fossil fuels. Leaving that transition up to a convoluted tax is not going to do it.\Jim Walsh, Washington, D.C.\Going green isn't just\ for the future, it needs \to happen now\People depend on fossil fuels for almost every aspect of their day. Whether it be getting into their car and driving it to work or turning on electrical appliances in the house, the usage of nonrenewable energy resources is at an all-time high.\When burned, fossil fuels emit toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. According to USA Today, 2.57 million pounds of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere every second. Excessive amounts of these hazardous gases are detrimental to the climate, environment and human health. So what can we do before it's too late?\Switching to clean energy is the first step towards a clean planet. Solar and wind energy are among the most common alternatives, are in high demand and are often less expensive. Solar energy traps energy from the sun and converts it to electricity. Solar panels placed on rooftops are designed to produce enough electricity to support a house. Although wind energy is not common for a single house, many communities across the country are switching to wind energy to run entire towns.\Clean and renewable energy is the face of the future, but greater efforts to go green are needed.\Catherine Rowlins, Colchester\Connecticut doesn't \need more \natural gas plants\We don't need any more fossil fuel plants in this state. ISO-New England's approach has shown to favor natural gas power plants over green energy options, claiming this to be the most cost effective way to meet energy demands. And Katie Dykes, DEEP Commissioner and the Connecticut manager for the New England States Commission on Electricity, claims that the proposed plant in Killingly is ""necessary to the region's mission of providing power to residents and moving away from dirtier fuels like coal."" But this appears to fail to factor in the energy we'll have from the massive wind project that is in the works or the rapidly expanding solar industry.\The fossil fuel industry tries to squelch any concern about natural gas because it emits less carbon dioxide compared to coal plants. What they're leaving out is that the multitude of methane leaks from natural gas infrastructure - from extraction, processing, transport, storage and burning - are many times more dangerous to the climate than carbon. More methane going into the atmosphere will amplify the climate crisis we're in, not help solve it.\Governor Lamont should immediately stop the gas plant proposed in Killingly. No other state in New England is building gas plants, and Connecticut doesn't need to either.\We don't have time to wait a few more years to solve the massive problems we face from climate change. For a livable future, we must decarbonize. We must stop building natural gas plants now.\Sandy Henschel, Clinton"
156,"
Skyrocketing energy prices have left most Americans with pinched wallets and anxiety about how to make ends meet. To address this problem, Democrats and Republicans must work together to find real solutions to our energy problem.
\
We need a two-pronged approach that recognizes that this is a serious problem for consumers today, but also that our dependence on foreign oil represents a long-term vulnerability in our economy that has developed over several decades and will require decades to fix. We must implement long-term solutions that provide the energy we need while protecting our economy and our environment for future generations.
\
There are many steps that the government can and should take now to help Americans stretch their hard-earned dollars during this difficult time. I will support measures to investigate the record profits of oil companies, introduce added competition to the oil market, protect consumers from price-gouging, increase transparency in energy trading markets, support a temporary gas tax holiday and delay deposits to the strategic petroleum reserve.
\
While short-term policies can help to reduce the effect of high fuel prices on Americans, we must face the reality that oil is a nonrenewable resource, and the world's cheap and easily accessible supplies are being depleted. America's demand for oil will increasingly have to contend with the growing demand in the developing world, including China and India, as well as instability in many oil-producing regions.
\
Congress should take immediate steps to ease the short-term burden on consumers, but we fail the American public if we do not simultaneously move to a cleaner, less oil-dependent economy.
\
To do this, we must change the way we drive, fuel our vehicles and use energy. This requires a commitment to innovation and will take years of investments in clean technologies. The longer we wait, the more painful the process is likely to be.
\
Congress recently took a key step by passing an important energy independence and security bill. Signed into law by President Bush, the measure reduces America's reliance on foreign oil, increases fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, and requires an increase in the use of renewable fuel sources and technologies that reduce net greenhouse-gas emissions.
\
However, there is much more Congress must do to promote smart energy solutions and new green technologies.
\
That's why Sen. John Warner, R-Va., and I have introduced legislation that will sharply reduce America's output of greenhouse gases responsible for global climate change and drive the technologies that will make us energy-independent.
\
Known as the Climate Security Act, this bill uses the power of the marketplace to prompt companies to find innovative ways to cut energy use, increase efficiency and deploy cleaner technologies. The act puts the U.S. on a trajectory to help the world avert the catastrophic effects of unchecked global warming.
\
In the first two decades of the program, our climate security proposal directs investment in clean technologies on a scale larger than the Apollo Project and Manhattan Project combined, directed to the moon shot and the atomic bomb. These energy technology funds would put hundreds of billions of dollars into the development of cellulosic biofuels, clean coal, nuclear power, electric vehicles, hybrid and plug-in electric cars, fuel cell vehicles and advanced diesel.
\
These are the technologies we will need to make energy independence a reality. Our proposal would ensure that we start building them domestically as soon as possible.
\
The act also directs billions of dollars to mass transit, to give more consumers a choice of how they get to work and further reduce our use of foreign oil.
\
I am committed to working hard toward the technologies and policies that will offer us long-term freedom from the impact of rising oil prices. At the same time, I will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion with my colleagues to ensure that Congress does what it can right away to make this transition easier on the millions of people who are struggling right now to pay their fuel bills.

157,"Over many years, Hartford has made numerous poor policy choices that have caused our beloved state to fall from No. 1 to Nos. 49 and 50 in far too many important categories. Let’s not allow our representatives to make yet another decision that will surely exacerbate our already sub-par economy and business environment, let alone hurt those who can least afford another tax burden.\Unbelievably, House Leadership has literally called us “moronic” to even be looking at the issue of tolls and offering your opinion. Nothing could be further from the truth — you are well-read, intelligent people who are smart enough to know whether the concept of tolling is a good idea or not. It is a required element of a healthy democracy that voters let their representatives know their thoughts, and I highly encourage all of us to do just that without the threat of having state funding cut if you do not like the idea of tolls.\You have already paid for your roads and bridges through your income tax payments, gas tax, gross receipts tax and registration fees. Additional charges to use the highways can only be considered a new tax. If there is any doubt about this, I strongly urge you to take a look at the Pennsylvania experience (Google “PA Toll Disaster” and read any of many articles that pop up). In short, legislators there have turned the tolling system into a revenue generator for other parts of state government, have raised toll rates 11 times in as many years, have become nearly insolvent with $11.8 billion in debt and have done the bare minimum in terms of infrastructure investment.\It is very hard to believe that that any potential toll revenues would be reserved solely for transportation purposes. We have been led to believe that there is a “lockbox” in place. Hartford has fooled you again. I was in the room of the Government, Administration and Elections Committee when the majority party, against our strong protests, rewrote the language of the Constitutional amendment to allow for revenues to be diverted to General Fund accounts instead of the Special Transportation Fund. This was a huge disservice to the people of Connecticut, and the provision needs to be modified as soon as possible.\The proposed solution to our infrastructure challenge has been on the table for nearly three years now. Using existing bonding capacity and re-prioritizing our needs away from wasteful projects, we could begin to immediately fund major infrastructure projects. This is not “putting incremental expenses on the credit card” as those who don’t want to understand this approach continually state. This is well within our current bonding capacity and Gov. Ned Lamont’s “debt diet” proposal. Given the long lead times of many of the overdue projects, we need to get going now; not in five years.\Additionally, we should be very skeptical of proposals to enter into a private public partnership (P3) when it comes to tolls as opposed to, for example, a train station with retail, commercial and residential space. Private partners will always be looking for a return. Macquarie, one of the largest banks in the world involved in infrastructure plays, looks for at least a 7 percent return. Our cost of borrowing? It is currently half that. As a side note, there is no shortage of examples of P3 disasters prompting former Congressman Jim Oberstar, while Chair of the House Transportation Committee, to argue publicly and loudly that P3 deals simply trample the public’s interest.\Finally, House Bill 7280 is a legislative embarrassment in that it would allow a final tolling plan to lapse into law after 15 days if there is no vote in either the House or the Senate. This is the kind of poor legislative procedure that has driven our state to the bottom in every important ranking.\Let’s not make another public policy mistake that Connecticut simply can’t afford. We owe it to future generations to leave our infrastructure, as well as our balance sheet, in better shape than we found it.\\\Crédito: By L . Scott Frantz"

Gov. M. Jodi Rell offered her answer to rising energy costs Monday, proposing changes in the pricing of gasoline, the elimination of an electricity tax on businesses and more money for programs promoting efficiency and renewable energy.
\
The governor's plan sets long-range goals for cutting consumption and increasing the use of clean energy, but the plan's highest immediate interest is probably its focus on gasoline prices.
\
Rell proposed the elimination of so-called zone pricing, a wholesale practice that results in geographical differences in gas prices around the state.
\
She also called for a cap on a wholesale gas tax -- the gross receipts tax -- that could result in a few cents off the cost at the pump when prices hit high levels. The cap would go into effect when wholesale prices reach $1.75 a gallon.
\
As for efficiency measures, Rell's proposal includes state tax breaks on the purchase of EnergyStar air conditioners and hybrid cars, more than $100 million to restore funding to the Connecticut Energy Efficiency Fund and steps to make state vehicles, schools and government buildings more energy-efficient.
\
""My plan reaffirms Connecticut's position as a leader in renewable energy and solidifies the direction of state energy policy,"" the governor said during a morning press conference.
\
The governor's plan would cost an estimated $500 million over four years, including both government spending and decreased revenue from lower taxes. Her office estimated that residents would pay $153.5 million less in taxes during that period.
\
Shortly after Rell released her 21-page plan, Democrats characterized it as old policy initiatives that avoid the largest issue -- rising electric rates.
\
""This well-intentioned plan is incomplete,"" said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat.
\
Blumenthal has proposed a state energy authority and a windfall profits tax on energy producers, among other things.
\
John DeStefano, Rell's Democratic opponent in the November election, was blunter, accusing Rell of having no policy on electricity rates in a state where consumers face some of the highest prices in the country.
\
""Soaring energy costs are an increasing burden to our families and businesses, but incredibly, Gov. Rell still has no strategy to deal with this,"" DeStefano said in a prepared statement.
\
DeStefano has proposed a windfall profits tax on electricity generators that have profit margins of more than 20 percent, and an aggressive energy-efficiency program.
\
Democratic leaders in the General Assembly held several energy summits this summer, but have not called lawmakers back to Hartford to address the issue.
\
Rell said Monday she is open to a special session on energy, but did not say she would call for one. That means the issue probably won't be addressed until after the November election.
\
Outside of political circles, aspects of Rell's energy plan received praise, as well as questions about whether it could meet its long-term goals for fossil fuel use, energy demand and other benchmarks the governor set for 2020.
\
Robert Early, assistant counsel for the Connecticut Business & Industry Association, said the move to eliminate the tax on electricity for businesses would provide immediate relief and would be of special help to small businesses.
\
The administration estimated that eliminating the tax would save businesses $22.5 million next year.
\
Trade organizations for the oil industry had differing opinions about the issue of zone pricing.
\
Rell proposed a two-year prohibition on using geographic location to set wholesale prices for gasoline.
\
In zone pricing, oil wholesalers sell gasoline to retailers at different prices, depending on where the station is located, to address competition.
\
As long as wholesalers can pass on discounts in some form to stations that face stiff competition, the changes Rell is proposing should be fine, said Gene Guilford, executive director of the Independent Connecticut Petroleum Association.
\
But it would be impossible to address the issue of different prices at different locations without adversely affecting a gas station's ability to compete for customers, said Steven Guveyan, executive director of the Connecticut Petroleum Council, a trade association for major oil companies and refiners.
\
Rell's overall plan won praise from Jessie Stratton, director of government relations for Environment Northeast.
\
She agreed with the goals and applauded the governor's plan to return money that was taken in the past from the Connecticut Energy Efficiency Fund.
\
But Stratton questioned whether the short-term goals are aggressive enough to cut fossil fuel consumption, increase the use of renewable energy and meet other long-term goals.
\
""With goals like that, you need some major investments and changes in the system,"" Stratton said.

\
I've been wrong about Barbara Kennelly. I've blamed her miserable campaign for governor on a lack of ideas, on poor staff support, on her lack of exposure to real opponents in past elections. But I've been wrong.
\
Her problem is, she got lost on the way to the secretary of the state's office and registered with the wrong political party.
\
Last week, she finally emerged as a full-blown Republican, complaining that we still had a state income tax, and promising to fund her goofy property tax reduction plan with (are you ready for this?) economic growth and efficiencies in state government.
\
Go girl! The Republican Party needs more ideologues chanting their mantra of waste, fraud and abuse -- while expressing dismay about that awful state income tax.
\
Kennelly's schedulers must be in a tizzy. Who should hear her first major speech on the income tax, which, according to her, is ""still very much with us, despite many promises to the contrary."" Damn right, Barbara! That ultra-liberal Gov. Rowland has only whittled at the income tax; in a Kennelly administration, we'll see that income tax disappear -- washed away in the sea of blood from laid-off state employees.
\
Speaking of those state employees, how will they react to Kennelly's promise to find hundreds of millions of dollars in savings from ""efficiencies"" in state government? She's a payroll-reducing, privatizing, entitlement-slashing maniac!
\
No more of this namby-pamby stuff about the environment or the plight of ""working families"" or protecting our children. Nope, there was Barbara at her big anti-tax press conference, complaining about the income tax and the ""burdensome"" property taxes and the ""highest gas tax in the nation.""
\
Whew. This new Barbara Kennelly will step on Jesse Jackson's head as she races down Main Street to padlock a homeless shelter.
\
Don't believe it, do you? On a scale from John Rowland to the Socialist bureaucrats in Sweden, Kennelly's congressional record suggests she would be more comfortable in Stockholm, feasting on reindeer and voting for national health insurance and a 98 percent marginal tax rate.
\
What was responsible for Kennelly's tax-cutting fever?
\
It's that property-tax thing. The property tax makes Democrats crazy. Cuts in local property taxes are the only tax cuts that the Democrats can tolerate. Property-tax cuts look and sound and smell like tax cuts, but they aren't really tax cuts at all.
\
The cities and towns are solemnly directed to reduce property taxes (wink, wink), the state proudly raises its taxes to make up the difference, and in three years or so, the cities and towns raise property taxes back up again, while champagne corks pop in public-sector labor union offices across the state.
\
It's a great scam. In the morning, Kennelly can give a speech that says Rowland won't look so good when the economy slows down. In the afternoon, she can promise permanent state-subsidized property-tax relief because the economy is never going to slow down.
\
That's the reckless, dangerous, awful secret of the Kennelly ""tax reform."" Once installed, the promise to pay the towns 10 percent of their local tax revenues, forever, would be next to impossible to revoke. In an emergency, where would the money come from?
\
The answer can be found back a few years during the Time of Darkness (the Weicker administration). In 1994, the Democrats suffered another fit of madness, proposing 17 different versions of property-tax relief, one more silly than the next. How would they pay for it? The answer came from then-Rep. Richard Mulready of West Hartford: Raise the top income-tax rate to 6 percent.
\
Mulready was spirited off to a Socialist work farm in the gulag, but the secret was out. If state government is going to pretend to lower local property taxes, then other state taxes will be raised to make up the difference.
\
Across the country, different states choose their favorite poison. New Hampshire has sky-high local property taxes, in return for no personal income tax or sales tax. Tennessee has low property taxes, but stratospheric sales taxes. New Jersey has low sales taxes (better to steal retail business from New York), but sky-high local property taxes.
\
In the end, we can quibble about which taxes are more or less productive or destructive, but the key is the instincts of the state politicians about spending. On that issue, Rowland has proved his mettle. Kennelly is just pretending.
"
160,"If there's one thing that Connecticut residents can agree on, it's that no one likes sitting in traffic. Unfortunately, for many drivers, crawling through congestion has become part of our normal routine. \But it doesn't have to be that way. As the highway toll debate continues on, much of the focus is on potential revenue for the state and costs to motorists. But the debate has ignored the issue of how tolls can affect driver behavior.\When the government provides a valuable resource of limited capacity to the citizens for free, the demand will be far higher than the supply, and that resource will not be used in an economically efficient way. In our case, that valuable resource is our state's fast and high-capacity highway network. Since all roads in Connecticut are currently priced at the same rate ($0), there is no incentive to not use the highways, which makes choosing the highways over surface roads an easy choice. \And because most commuters think this way, our fastest highways turn into just the opposite during rush hour.\By tolling our state's most congested roadways, drivers would be faced with a choice: time or money. To save time, a driver can elect to take the tolled highway, effectively paying for a quicker ride, but also paying for their impact on the people around them. As the highways have limited capacity, a motorist taking up space on this scarce public resource should be paying for the additional congestion they cause. \On the other hand, if a driver wants to save money, they can take surface roads to their destination. Because origins and destinations of drivers are widely scattered throughout the state, and people value time and money differently, traffic will redistribute much more evenly on local roads that can handle the additional volume.\Although tolling as a means to reduce traffic will ultimately benefit residents, some are opposed to tolls because it would add a cost onto our currently free highways. This leads into the tax vs. user fee debate (it's a user fee - you are paying for access to a service and have the option to not drive on the highway). Ideally, highway tolls should have never been eliminated. In America, driving-related fees such as the gas tax and DMV charges only cover about 51% of roadway spending. The other 49% comes from general taxes, which is paid by all citizens, including those who don't drive at all. People who do not own cars are subsidizing drivers' abilities to create traffic. In the toll debate, it's not just about out-of-state drivers and truckers paying their fair share, it's about all motorists paying for their effect on society and the environment.\How else we can reduce traffic without tolls? Some say the best way to reduce congestion is to add lanes to highways - increasing their capacity. And sadly, many engineers and planners will agree. But widening or building new highways does not fix traffic. In fact, it makes it worse. \Because congestion itself is a deterrent to drivers who would want to use the highway but ultimately decide against it, adding capacity will free up space for more cars to enter, and this continues until a new equilibrium of traffic congestion is reached. Now the highway is just as jammed as before, but this time with an extra lane of bumper-to-bumper cars. This concept is called induced demand. It has been proven to occur in instances of widening or construction of new highways across the country, yet many state departments of transportation still do not believe the empirical data. This includes the Connecticut Department of Transportation, which is why projects such as those in Danbury and Norwalk are advancing.\The only guaranteed way to clear up the state's highways is to simply get cars off the road. Traffic congestion is not a linear function, but rather exponential. Just removing a small percentage of traffic volume can speed up vehicles greatly. By redistributing the demand for our most sought-after roadways through tolling and congestion pricing, we can finally start to chip away at chronic traffic jams and the economic and social costs they impose. \Adam Weber works at a civil engineering firm that specializes in transportation.

Taxes: With Connecticut's economy booming, the state government has had budget surpluses each of the past four years. This year, the governor and legislature voted to return more than $115 million in rebates to taxpayers. Do you support continued tax cuts in 1999? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Kevin Ryan
\
I would like to see increased property tax relief by increasing the property tax credit on the state income tax. The state was able to send rebate checks to taxpayers so I would like to see some mechanism developed for people who do not pay state income tax, such as senior citizens, so they can benefit from credit.
\
James M. Mullan
\
I do support tax cuts. The main tax cut should be the gas tax. We must invest our surplus to insure economic growth to prevent the slowdown.
\
Patients' rights: Government regulation of managed care has become a major issue in Connecticut and nationally. Democrats such as gubernatorial candidate Barbara Kennelly and U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd support a ""patients' bill of rights"" that they say would force managed care companies to put patient care ahead of profits. Do you support a patients bill of rights, including the right to sue a managed care company? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Kevin Ryan
\
I believe that managed care companies should be accountable for decisions they make concerning a person's health care the same as a physican would be. If a company's denial of care is detrimental to an individual's health resulting in harm to that individual, the patient should have recourse to hold the company responsible.
\
James M. Mullan
\
The state should regulate health care, but to an extent to where the state makes sure we all get the care we pay for.
\
Megan's Law: The state has a version of Megan's Law on the books, requiring that sex offenders register with police. A new version of the law, allowing state police to post the name of sex offenders on the Internet, goes into effect Jan. 1. Some lawmakers say the state needs to go further and require widespread community notification when a sex offender moves into a neighborhood. Do you support further expansion of Megan's Law to require community notification? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Kevin Ryan
\
Parents want to be able to protect their children and keep them safe. Megan's Law helps them to accomplish this. For this law to be effective, parents need to be notified when a sex offender moves into their neighborhood without having to monitor the Internet or visit the police station daily.
\
James M. Mullan
\
Yes, I support Megan's Law and its further expansion. The people deserve to know.
\
Environmental protection: Kennelly and some employees at the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have complained that, under Gov. John Rowland, the agency has not been enforcing environmental regulations stringently enough. Do you believe the DEP adequately enforces environmental regulations? If so, do you think criticism of the DEP is valid? If you do not think enforcement is satisfactory, do you think legislation is needed to ensure that it improves?
\
Kevin Ryan
\
The quality of our environment is very important for the quality of life and health of ourselves and our children. There is a need to stringently enforce our environmental regulations and improvements could be instituted by the commissioner to ensure this occurs.
\
James M. Mullan
\
I believe the DEP is doing its job to enforce regulations.

162,"Gov. Ned Lamont was sworn in just a few weeks ago, and already he has a full plate when it comes to transportation. More than half of Connecticut's roads are in poor condition; 338 of the state's bridges have been rated ""structurally deficient""; and the fastest trip time between New Haven and Grand Central on Metro North is 1 hour and 45 minutes.\US News & World Report recently ranked the state's infrastructure 41st in the nation. The Connecticut Department of Transportation estimates that congestion currently costs Connecticut residents and businesses $860 million per year in time lost sitting in traffic. That is without even factoring in the time spent waiting for or on a crowded, delayed train.\With a new administration in Hartford, we have a real opportunity to course-correct and re-position Connecticut as an economic stronghold on the east coast - a competitive, dynamic state that fosters innovation, welcomes collaboration and encourages the free flow of people and ideas.\As co-chair of Gov. Lamont's transition transportation policy committee and Connecticut director at Regional Plan Association, I feel strongly that we need new sources of funding to meet our most urgent infrastructure needs and make this vision a reality.\We simply can't get there without new tools to fund infrastructure and deliver large-scale projects. Our transportation infrastructure is the backbone of our state's economy. To fund the investments, we need to achieve a 21st century, integrated transportation system, we must diversify our revenue streams and financing tools and speed project delivery.\The good news is that meeting the need is possible, by supporting diverse proposals like the Connecticut Infrastructure Bank, public-private partnerships, design-build and tolling.\While conversations about ideas like these aren't easy, we need to have them. The long-term economic health of Connecticut relies on our ability to identify a clear path for funding the investments that we need to move our economy forward.\One thing we can do right away is enable a Connecticut Infrastructure Bank, owned and operated by the state, to unlock private capital to fund infrastructure investment.\Building on the success of the CT Green Bank and modeled on successful infrastructure banks in Europe and around the world, the CIB would be economically self-sustaining, creating a multiplier effect on state funds by leveraging state equity up to 10 times with private debt raised from institutional investors.\We can also allow for public-private partnerships to finance and build projects, tapping into private sector resources while retaining public ownership of public assets.\And we can reduce overall project costs and speed delivery of infrastructure by enabling design-build, which combines project design and construction into a single procurement process.\The design-build approach reduces the time it takes to get from design to construction and incentivizes contractors to complete projects on time and on budget. It also gives contractors greater flexibility in design and encourages the use of innovative construction techniques while ensuring greater responsibility and accountability throughout the process.\Finally, and certainly most contentiously, we need to implement tolling on our highways.\Connecticut is the only state in the region that doesn't charge user fees for wear and tear on its highways. Maintaining and upgrading these aging, highly traveled roads requires funding.\With electronic tolling, it is possible to charge drivers for their use of the state's highways in a way that is fair and safe, using new technologies.\Gas tax revenues have stagnated as vehicles have become more fuel-efficient and hybrid and electric vehicles have become more popular. While this is great news for our environment, it's bad news for our Special Transportation Fund.\We simply can't afford to ignore our transportation funding crisis.\The cost of sitting in traffic or being stuck on a train that's going nowhere fast is slowing all of us and crippling our state's economy. People and businesses in our state need a reliable transportation system that gets them where they need to be when they need to be there, or they're going to go somewhere else. The time to act is now.\ \Melissa Kaplan-Macey is vice president of state programs and Connecticut director at the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy organization in Stamford.\Credit: By Melissa Kaplan-Macey"

\
-- ""Asphalt Nation.""
\
Usually when authors come to town to make a speech, they drive or fly. Jane Holtz Kay took the bus, the Peter Pan from Boston, which pulled into Union Station terminal just a minute or two late on Thursday afternoon.
\
Kay takes the bus for the convenience, and the principle. The Peter Pan buses are quite clean and comfortable, and a rider can watch the movie or read. Also, if 55 people traveling from Boston to Hartford take one bus, instead of 55 cars, there's a significant saving of fuel, pollutants, money and stress. Kay hasn't owned a car since 1991.
\
""You can't call yourself an environmentalist, or an urbanist, if you don't deal with your own driving habits,"" she said over lunch.
\
Kay is the author of ""Asphalt Nation -- How the Automobile Took Over America and How We Can Take It Back."" She was in town to address the transit advocacy group All Aboard! at Trinity College.
\
""Asphalt Nation"" is an in-your- face polemic about how America became almost pathetically dependent on the car, and the damage it's doing.
\
Because the car culture is so pervasive, it's hard to step back and see what's happening, Kay allows. But do it, she argues, and you see ""a social tragedy.""
\
The interstate highways have eviscerated great cities, sucked the life out of them, actually created ghettos by walling off neighborhoods (some of this should sound familiar). The car culture increasingly isolates the poor, handicapped and elderly, the third of Americans who can't drive. They're left behind when the car is virtually the only means of mobility.
\
The desolate car culture spawns its own kinds of violence: drive- by shootings, carjackings, road rage.
\
The car wreaks havoc with the environment. Every second, Kay reports, America's 200 million vehicles travel 60,000 miles, use 3,000 gallons of petroleum products and add 60,000 pounds of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
\
Vehicles consume a third of all U.S. energy and also exhale two- thirds of carbon dioxide emissions, more than 50 percent of methanes, 40 percent of nitrogen oxides and most of the carbon monoxide. The car is the worst environmental health threat in many U.S. cities. Kids there are being diagnosed with high levels of asthma, something common in Hartford.
\
Illness? How about that other all- too-common byproduct of the car culture, which would be death. Each year, some 43,000 Americans die in auto accidents,and another 2 million suffer disabling injuries. ""Somehow, our theology of life and mortality by driving seems resigned to such statistics,"" Kay writes.
\
A train accident is all over the news. If 120 people died every day in a plane crash, there'd be an outcry. But that's how many people die on the highways daily, with barely a whimper. Sportswriter Jim Murray's comment about the Indianapolis 500, ""Gentlemen, start your coffins,"" could apply to driving in general.
\
The car culture demands an ungodly amount of space -- a parking place at home, another at the office and a third at the mall. Huge swaths of cities have been demolished for parking. The place is destroyed for the means to get there. It's insane.
\
Then there's the loss of time; Americans waste an estimated 8 billion hours a year in traffic.
\
Finally, there's the money. Kay says it costs an average of $6,000 a year to own and operate a 2-year- old vehicle. In addition, there's another $3,000 to $5,000 in external costs: roadways, police, parking, uncompensated accidents, etc. Unbudgeted costs pop up, such as that for the appropriately named Gulf War.
\
The gas tax covers only 60 percent of car costs. The rest comes from general taxes, which includes the taxes paid by the people being penalized by the car culture.
\
Kay, a trim and elegant woman who is the sister of Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman, said we need to change the mindset, as we've done with tobacco and are doing with handguns. Act personally, by driving less, sharing rides and combining trips.
\
Act politically by demanding the end of car welfare. The gubmint's got to stop spending seven times as much for highways as it does for mass transit. It's looney that major cities are choked to a standstill and Congress keeps trying to whack Amtrak's budget.
\
We need to live more compactly; people ought to get rewards for living in cities and be made to pay penalties for devouring more exurban open space.
\
She's right. Connecticut should not build another foot of highway without removing an equal amount of existing highway. If we're serious about saving our major cities, we should begin long- term planning to get the highways out of them. Enough.

It is important that we make wise budgetary decisions, given the state of the economy and our revenue projections. However, I feel that we need to emphasize property tax relief, and I plan to continue my work to bring down this unfair tax. We should also continue our efforts to reduce the gas tax to be in line with other states. We also have a responsibility to pass a balanced budget.
\
Paul Maxwell
\
At the beginning of the Rowland administration, many of the governor's critics said that it would be impossible to cut taxes in any meaningful way. However, Gov. Rowland has cut the income tax, the gasoline tax and provided rebates to the taxpayers. These tax cuts have totaled more than $1.2 billion. To combat the impact of a future potential economic slowdown, we need to help businesses in Connecticut maintain the competitive advantage that the Rowland tax reforms have helped give them.

\
Yes, I do, 100 percent. Somebody has to be held accountable. The doctors are being ruled by the insurance companies as far as length of stays, for example.

We should give the new laws passed by the General Assembly a chance to work. The General Assembly has passed patient's rights legislation with bipartisan support. If this legislation should prove to be ineffective in protecting patient's rights or inadequate to the task, then I would support additional legislation, including the right to sue.
\
Megan's Law: The state has a version of Megan's Law on the books, requiring that sex offenders register with police. A new version of the law, allowing state police to post the name of sex offenders on the Internet, goes into effect Jan. 1. Some lawmakers say the state needs to go further and require widespread community notification when a sex offender moves into a neighborhood. Do you support further expansion of Megan's Law to require community notification? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Linda A. Orange
\
Megan's Law is designed to protect children. The act authorizes the state and local police to notify government agencies, organizations or individuals when they believe the notification is necessary to protect the public or any individual from a registered person. The law also puts registration information on the Internet, and the commissioner of public safety must publicize its availability. The safety of every child is important to me. If these measures prove not to be sufficient, I am open to additional notification measures.
\
Paul Maxwell
\
Protecting the public and potential victims is the only issue here. I would support further expansion of the law and notification to the community. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
\
Environmental protection: Kennelly and some employees at the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have complained that, under Gov. John Rowland, the agency has not been enforcing environmental regulations stringently enough. Do you believe the DEP adequately enforces environmental regulations? If so, do you think criticism of the DEP is valid?
\
Linda A. Orange
\
I believe that there should be greater legislative oversight of DEP enforcement so that we, in the General Assembly, can be sure that the environment is being protected properly.
\
Paul Maxwell
\
If you pollute you should be punished. However, I think its the DEP's job to work with business and the public to prevent pollution. It is far less expensive to prevent pollution than it is to clean it up later.

\
It's apt that P.T. Barnum, the circus impresario who coined the phrase ""There's a sucker born every minute,"" lived for a time in Bridgeport, which is just down the road from Stamford, the scene of the biggest taxpayer heist in state history.
\
Hold on to your wallets. Every taxpayer in Connecticut has just been played for a sucker, compliments of our Republican governor, Democrat-controlled legislature and the largest bank (as measured by total assets) in the world.
\
The $191 million aid package approved last week for a Stamford bank -- a melange of loans, grants and tax credits as well as local property tax abatements -- is a corporate giveaway of monstrous proportions.
\
Want to know why campaign finance reform should matter to you? Because the slickest influence peddlers at the Capitol -- the lobbying firm of Gaffney, Bennett and Associates -- masterminded this deal for a corporation, Switzerland's UBS, whose profits soared 27 percent last year, contributing to $3.8 billion in net earnings.
\
Most corporations would be content with that level of profitability, but not UBS, a global behemoth that was created when Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland merged. These greedy financiers wanted more. And if their demands weren't met, they threatened to pack up their corporate offices and their $170,000-a- year jobs and go home. Auf Wiedersehen, Nutmeggers.
\
I suppose ordinary taxpayers (ordinary as defined as citizens who aren't represented by powerful lobbyists) shouldn't be too upset. After all, Gov. John G. Rowland and lawmakers agreed to $171 million in new tax cuts, of which two will actually put a few dollars in peoples' pockets.
\
The governor got his way on a 7-cent-a-gallon reduction in the gas tax, which is expected to save a family that drives 30,000 miles a year between $85 and $140. And the Democrats got their way on a measure that raises the sales tax exemption on clothing from $50 to $75.
\
Both of those are reasonable cuts and help make Connecticut's tax system more progressive. Such has been the tax metamorphosis of John Rowland, an erstwhile conservative who staked his 1994 candidacy on axing the income tax but has done more to reduce the tax burden on the poor and working class than many of his predecessors.
\
Some might see that as faint praise. But in raising the income tax threshold, supporting property-tax exemptions and rolling back the sales tax, Rowland has injected a degree of fairness into a revenue structure that had long been unreliable and regressive. Even though Rowland had to be dragged to the table by Democrats, he should be congratulated for doing what's right.
\
Now, if he -- along with the two Democratic leaders from Stamford, House Speaker Moira K. Lyons and Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen -- would only abandon their slavishness to big business, and particularly to Warburg Dillon Read, formerly known as Swiss Bank.
\
Consider these absurdities: The state is buying back $120 million in tax credits that it gave to Swiss Bank in the early '90s but that were never used. That's because Swiss Bank paid virtually no taxes. To qualify for the $120 million, Warburg Dillon Read has only to retain 2,000 workers in each of the first 10 years of the agreement, about 900 fewer workers than it now has on its payroll. In the 11th through the 15th year of the pact, Warburg Dillon Read will be entitled to a 25 percent tax credit if it employs 3,000 people, which is its current work force.
\
""This is horrendous public policy that will encourage every profitable company in Connecticut to come here with a similar proposal,"" said Rep. Robert Landino of Westbrook, who led the floor opposition.
\
Landino calls it horrendous; insane is more like it. Even if you buy the myth of job creation, is Stamford, the city with the lowest unemployment in Connecticut, the place to be putting additional workers? Should the state, through its tax policy, be promoting traffic congestion on I-95 and the Merritt Parkway?
\
And get this. Supporters say the investment bankers have helped stimulate the real estate market in lower Fairfield County, already a phenomenally expensive place to live. If the market is stimulated any more, the teachers, nurses, police officers, librarians and others who are integral to society but don't earn six-figure salaries will be homeless.
\
What's even more insane is that, while House members last week were putting the finishing touches on this obscene giveaway, the Senate defeated a measure, on an 18-18 vote, that would have required companies receiving state aid to obey the law. Businesses were aghast at this assault on their autonomy. One lobbyist blasted the bill as the handiwork of socialists. Advocates saw it differently.
\
""This is pretty basic stuff. If corporations get taxpayer money, they ought to treat employees well and not mess up the environment,"" argued Betty Gallo, who lobbied for the bill.
\
The other pretty basic stuff would have required corporations that receive more than $500,000 in state aid to maintain their work force (in other words, not cut jobs), pay standard wages and give part- time workers pro-rated wages and benefits.
\
Thirty-six states have adopted job-quality standards for businesses that accept taxpayer subsidies. In Connecticut, such requirements are considered socialism. Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell could have broken the tie vote in the Senate and struck a blow for a rational economic development policy. She took a pass.
\
The forces of evil were defeated.
"
166,"Gov. Ned Lamont on Monday signed on to a multistate effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to reinvest millions of dollars a year toward cleaner transportation, a deal that will likely mean higher gas prices in Connecticut.\Lamont joined Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia in joining the bipartisan Transportation and Climate Initiative Program (TCI-P), which guarantees that Connecticut will reduce carbon emissions by at least 26% in a 10-year period from 2022 to 2032.\""Engaging in this way with my fellow governors and Mayor Bowser accomplishes goals we have set for Connecticut for years,"" Lamont said. ""Participating in the TCI-P will help grow our economy through a fresh injection of capital to provide for jobs and new infrastructure. This collaboration will cut our greenhouse gas emissions, and it will make our urban centers healthier, after decades of being adversely impacted by the emissions being released by traffic every day. \""Connecticut has always taken pride in our leadership role when it comes to climate, and when we can combine that with a stronger economy, fast transit systems, and regional cooperation, that's a win for all of us.""\The initiative is a regional cap-and-trade plan to raise money to combat climate change by seeking wholesale reductions in motor vehicle pollution, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. It requires that large gasoline and diesel fuel suppliers purchase allowances for the pollution caused by combustion of the fuels they sell in Connecticut.\""Because fuel distributors operate in a competitive marketplace with a growing diversity of alternative fuels such as hydrogen and electricity, the price signal will spur innovation, including for regulated entities to reduce the carbon content of the fuels that they sell,"" said Katie Dykes, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\The program is expected to generate up to $89 million in annual revenue for Connecticut in 2023, which would increase to as much as $117 million by 2032.\The total number of emission allowances will decline each year, resulting in less transportation pollution. The proceeds - nearly $300 million for signatory jurisdictions netted in the first year - would be invested in low-carbon transportation projects designed to help both urban and rural residents. \Each participating jurisdiction would decide how to invest program proceeds independently in consultation with lawmakers and citizens.\But it's difficult, Dykes added, to say how much of the cost will passed along to fuel consumers.\""Should fuel suppliers pass along cost modeling estimates show a potential increase of around 5 cents per gallon,"" Dykes said. \""This is far less than the regular fluctuations that consumers see in retail fuel prices.""\Environmental advocates across the region applauded the move. Barry Kresch, president of the Electric Vehicle Club of Connecticut, said TCI is ""a real opportunity to substantially reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, improve the health of Connecticut residents, and generate investment in clean energy and clean transportation.""\But critics suggest the initiative amounts to little more than a new gas tax for Connecticut residents. Under Connecticut's current system, drivers already pay a flat tax rate of 25 cents per gallon at the pump, along with a gross receipts tax that fluctuates along with the wholesale price of gasoline.\The Yankee Institute for Public Policy, a right-leaning think tank, estimates it would result in $388.6 million per year in increased gasoline costs across the state.\""This new tax is regressive, opaque, and offensive to hardworking Connecticut residents and small business owners who deserve better from a state government that is supposed to care about them and represent their interests - not the interests of an activist group bent on making it too expensive for the average family to drive to work,"" said Yankee Institute President Carol Platt Liebau.\The Delaware-based Ceasar Rodney Institute's Center for Energy and Environment estimated the average Connecticut family will end up paying $258 more per year.\House Minority Leader-elect Vincent Candelora said any new taxes in the state of Connecticut would be ""wildly unpopular for taxpayers, especially given the state that we're in.""\ ""I think it's something that we need to we need to tread very lightly toward. There's going to be a lot of spirited conversation on this issue,"" Candelora said.\Candelora, a Republican from North Branford, said the issue would have to come before the legislature before Connecticut officially signs on.\""Given that our special transportation fund is heading toward insolvency, starting another initiative that is not going to help the solvency of our fund is probably not the way that we should be starting out a conversation on transportation and greenhouse gas,"" Candelora said.\Senate Minority Leader-elect Kevin Kelly called the pre-Christmas move a ""lump of coal to middle-class families.""\""This tax hike will burden middle class families' budgets at the absolute worst possible time without improving our aging transportation infrastructure,"" Kelly, R-Stratford, said. ""[Lamont's] holiday gift to Connecticut families is new and higher taxes.""\The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents thousands of small businesses in the state, said many who are struggling to make ends meet due to the coronavirus pandemic will face additional financial stress if gas were to go up in price.\""Restaurants require fuel to deliver food orders, plumbers and electricians drive to job sites, construction companies utilize fuel to operate their equipment,"" said NFIB State Director Andy Markowski. \""All of these small business jobs will now be more expensive because Connecticut joined TCI,"" he said.\Chris Herb, president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, an industry group, said TCI would ""put another tax, on top of another tax, on top of another tax, on top of another tax"" on gasoline, which he said is ""one of the already most taxed commodities in Connecticut.""\""We don't see this as an environmental initiative but rather a money grab,"" Herb said. \""We already have one of the highest gas taxes in Connecticut. This would be the breaking point for many people in Connecticut already struggling to make ends meet and quite frankly, just trying to survive.""\States that were initially on board with the program - but failed to commit this week to the agreement - include Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia.\Michael Hamad may be reached at mhamad@courant.com."
167,"Hartford - It was early in 2017 and Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy still had almost two years left in his term. But he already had his eye on his legacy.\His State of the State speech that year was a medley of what he considered some of his greatest hits: reducing the size of the state workforce, engineering a $220 million state aid package to keep Sikorsky Aircraft in Connecticut, improving the state's transportation infrastructure, respecting civil rights and welcoming immigrants turned away by other states.\Yet many Connecticut residents will remember Malloy as the governor who ushered in two large tax increases to deal with the deficits he inherited from past governors.\How will history judge Malloy, who leaves office on January 9? Here's a look at nine key ways that he left his mark on Connecticut:\1. Taxes and spending\Few issues created more headaches for Malloy than the state's perennial fiscal problems. He took office in January 2011, as the state and the nation were still reeling from the effects of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That year, he signed a budget that included almost $1.9 billion in new taxes. Four years later, he approved a spending plan that contained another large tax hike. Malloy has said repeatedly that the tax hikes were needed to stabilize the state's fiscal condition after decades of neglect by former governors. At the same time, he twice renegotiated contracts with the state's unionized workers and sought to shrink the size of government.\2. Economic development\From his first year in office, when he offered Jackson Laboratory, a Maine-based genetics research institute, close to $300 million to build a new facility in Farmington, incentives have always been a core part of Malloy's economic development philosophy. Under his stewardship, the state has handed out millions to companies. The Sikorsky deal in 2016 was widely hailed as a bold move to retain one of Connecticut's most prized manufacturers. But other moves, such as $22 million in grants and loans for the world's largest hedge fund, have drawn criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, who say they smack of corporate welfare.\3. LGBTQ rights\Malloy has been a steadfast supporter of gay rights, even when the cause was far outside the mainstream, twice flying the Rainbow Flag outside the governor's residence. But his support was more than symbolic: he lobbied for legislation adding gender identity and expression to the state's anti-discrimination statutes and, in 2015, he signed a bill permitting people to change the sex designation on their birth certificates even if they have not undergone gender reassignment surgery. He also supported a law banning gay ""conversion therapy.""\4. Gun control\Gun control wasn't a big part of the Malloy agenda until Dec. 14, 2012, when 26 children and staff were shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Within months, Malloy and state lawmakers negotiated a sweeping set of restrictions, including a ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, expanding the ban on assault weapons and new registration rules for high-capacity magazines. Earlier this year, Malloy signed a bill banning bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire more rapidly.\5. Criminal justice and death penalty\Malloy, a former prosecutor, has become one of the nation's strongest advocates for criminal justice reform. The overhaul, which he called the ""Second Chance Society,"" included several proposals, some of which passed the legislature and were signed into law. In 2015, lawmakers approved Malloy's bill to emphasize treatment and redemption over punishment and incarceration for low-level drug offenders, a retrenchment from the zero-tolerance philosophy that had dominated criminal justice policy since President Ronald Reagan declared a ""war on drugs"" in 1982. Two years later, lawmakers passed Malloy's bill to end the practice of requiring defendants to post cash-only bail. It also prevents judges from setting money bail for misdemeanor charges unless it is a family violence case or the judge deems the defendant a danger or a risk to flee. During Malloy's tenure, Connecticut also eliminated the death penalty and placed new restrictions on the use of solitary confinement in state prisons.\6. Immigration\In 2015, Malloy thrust himself into a national debate over immigration when he welcomed a refugee family from Syria to Connecticut after they had been turned away by the then-governor of Indiana, Mike Pence. For his stance, Malloy was honored by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation with a ""Profile in Courage"" award. Malloy also signed into law legislation that allows undocumented immigrants to receive institutional student aide at state colleges and universities and grants them in-state status for tuition.\7. Climate change \and environment\In 2014, Malloy announced a deal to preserve the last large tract of unprotected coastal forest between Boston and New York. The 1,000 acre property, which lies near the Connecticut River and Long Island Sound, was the subject of an $8 million deal by the state, several towns and a land trust. Just this month, Malloy released a set of recommendations to put the state on a path to achieve zero-carbon electricity generation, clean transportation and green buildings. And Malloy also recently committed the state to join a regional compact to reduce carbon emissions in transportation.\8. Minimum wage, \paid sick leave\Malloy won election in 2010 pledging to support paid sick leave and in his first term, he signed legislation making Connecticut the first state in the nation to mandate such a policy. In 2014, Connecticut became the first state to approve the $10.10 hourly wage, a move championed by Malloy, hailed by advocates for low-wage workers and drew praise from President Barack Obama.\9. Transportation\Malloy's predecessors laid the ground work for CTfastrak, a rapid-transit bus line from New Britain to Hartford, but he embraced it, Under Malloy, the state also invested in rail and road improvements. But Malloy has repeatedly warned that the state needs to seek options to replace the gas tax as a source of revenue to fund road repairs and his effort to establish electronic tolls has so far fallen short.\Credit: By Daniela Altimari\Caption: Outgoing Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy reacts during an interview at the state Capitol in Hartford on Wednesday. Two large tax increases, support for LGBTQ rights and a $220 million aid package to keep Sikorsky Aircraft in Connecticut are among the ways Malloy has had a lasting impact on the state.\Jessica Hill/AP"

Lawbreakers
\
In response to The Courant's May 28 editorial ""Pass Immigrant Tuition Bill"":
\
What part of the word ""illegal"" doesn't The Courant get? The state of Connecticut would be flouting federal law by aiding and abetting people who are breaking federal law.
\
The logic that 10 other states have passed such laws is the same as all kids have used on their parents: ""But Jimmy's parents let him do it.""
\
Would I have the same ability to access medical care and enter schools in the country of origin of these illegal aliens? No.

How ironic that The Courant chooses to endorse such a law on the day that we remember those who have sacrificed their lives to protect the integrity of this country.

Tax Relief
\
Boy, we were lucky this time [Connecticut section, May 24, ""GOP Foiled On Gas-Tax Cut""]. Those Republicans came pretty close to saddling us with a tax cut.
\
It wasn't very big and only temporary, but we have to keep a close watch. A small cut here and another there and we could lose our standing as a high-tax state. Next thing you know, people would stop moving away. Some might even decide to move their businesses back to Connecticut.
\
It's a good thing that we have all those Democratic watchdogs making sure that taxes never go down, only up.

Suspensions
\
I agree completely with the May 23 editorial ""Limit School Suspensions.""
\
I'll bet it is difficult to manage schools these days. However, administrators don't seem to comprehend the trauma of suspension to the individual child, isolating her or him from the classroom for a week or more when many incidents don't justify such severe action.
\
Yes, at times removing a student is correct. But the epidemic of banishment (77,000 in one year in Connecticut) needs to be seriously addressed. Are these kids being tried, convicted and sentenced quickly without a full review of the circumstances? Is an appeal process available? Is action taken appropriate to the situation or just knee-jerk, by-the-book punishment?
\
Take-home work is second rate at best. Some kids (and some adults) need human contact to learn and don't do well in correspondence-course situations. When isolated from live professional instruction, they feel impossibly behind and dispirited, and may give up and not return.
\
Society is judged by how we treat the most vulnerable: the young, the old and those in the confusing teenage years. How are we to be judged when, after making minor transgressions into major infractions, we take the easy way out and remove kids who need our help, possibly damaging their personalities permanently? We solidify their distrust of all authority.
\
When minds are yearning for an intelligent, fair, personalized system, we owe it to them to come up with a better solution.

We didn't see any celebration headlines or red, white and blue on Page 1. Has The Courant allowed its anti-Iraq war bias to overshadow the debt and respect we owe our veterans?

A Sad Day
\
Despite all the festive flag waving and excitement of the many Memorial Day parades, it was a very sad day.
\
In the May 29 article ""A Day Of Patriotism, Pageantry, Solemnity,"" there was the one crucial observation by lawyer Margaret Levy that hit home: ""It's adorable and touching to see flag-waving 6- year-olds, but we are in a war we should not be in.""
\
Are we all concerned about this tragedy that is taking place in Iraq, or do we just keep on shopping and leave it to the military families to carry this deadly burden?

Rell's Measures
\
Fall Short
\
In response to the Other Opinion article by Gov. M. Jodi Rell and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger [May 22, ""Feds Foul Clean Air""]:
\
I am glad that Gov. Rell has noticed her constituents' concerns about global warming and responded accordingly. However, it is one thing for her to publicly criticize the federal government for its blatant inaction and another for her to act on her own words. It is fantastic that the governor finally recognizes this crisis and wants the federal government to respond to it, but her efforts would be much more sincere if she was leading by example.
\
The measures she has taken so far lag behind those of what scientists have recommended. I believe that cutting global warming pollution 15 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 would satisfy this problem. Committing to this specific timetable would also allow Connecticut to become a leader in the fight against global warming. More important, it would demonstrate to every citizen that global warming is a manageable problem that, if taken care of now, will provide a cleaner, healthier environment for all.

Rescue On
\
Route 44
\
As I drove along Route 44, heading west about 4 p.m. Sunday, I spotted a turtle in the middle of that busy highway between Avon and Canton. At the very next street, I pulled over with the intent of going back to try to rescue the little guy.
\
I waited as eastbound cars, including two state troopers, drove by and other cars headed west.
\
Suspecting I would be too late, with the next break in traffic I began to pull out to go back. I then spotted the two police cruisers that had been heading east come back. The traffic was halted just long enough for one of the troopers to get out of his car, pick up the turtle and deliver him safely to the side of the road. The officer then drove to the next safe turnaround.
\
This was one of the neatest things to witness and so very caring.

\
2. Become a leader on important statewide issues that may not be at the top of opinion polls but are the keys to making our state stronger.
\
3. I want to be an active participant in solving local issues.
\
Taxes: With Connecticut's economy booming, the state government has had budget surpluses each of the past four years. This year, the governor and legislature voted to return more than $115 million in rebates to taxpayers. Do you support continued tax cuts in 1999? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Angelo Fusco
\
When I first proposed a 10- cents-a-gallon cut in the gas tax two years ago, the critics said it couldn't be done. They were wrong. We have cut the tax by seven cents a gallon, and I am already preparing legislation to cut it further.
\
Christopher Murphy
\
I would support further tax cuts, but only after the state has made a reasonable effort to reduce our state debt. And I believe tax reductions should be focused on the burdensome property tax. This may mean the legislature has to take a hard look at the entire way towns collect municipal property taxes.
\
Patients' rights: Government regulation of managed care has become a major issue in Connecticut and nationally. Democrats such as gubernatorial candidate Barbara Kennelly and U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd support a ""patients' bill of rights"" that they say would force managed care companies to put patient care ahead of profits. Do you support a patients bill of rights, including the right to sue a managed care company? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Angelo Fusco
\
I am proud of the bipartisan effort that produced the comprehensive law passed in 1997 to strengthen oversight of managed care, and I am committed to making this law work to protect patient rights. My concern is with the patient, not creating more business for lawyers or giving people a right that is meaningless if they do not receive the care they need when they need it.
\
Christopher Murphy
\
I strongly support a patient's bill of rights that keeps health care decisions in the hands of doctors and patients, not insurance companies. I believe that patients must have the right to sue their HMO if necessary medical services are mistakenly denied. There is no reason why HMOs should be above the law.
\
Megan's Law: The state has a version of Megan's Law on the books, requiring that sex offenders register with police. A new version of the law, allowing state police to post the name of sex offenders on the Internet, goes into effect Jan. 1. Do you support further expansion of Megan's Law to require community notification? If so, why? If not, why not?
\
Angelo Fusco
\
I remain committed to having the strongest laws possible to protect our children. I am currently preparing legislation to require that when a sex offender moves into a community, all residents within a half-mile radius of the offender's address are notified.
\
Christopher Murphy
\
I believe we must close loopholes in the current Megan's Law, such as the clause that allows sexual offenders convicted in one state to escape community notification when they enter another state.
\
Environmental protection: Kennelly and some employees at the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have complained that, under Gov. John Rowland, the agency has not been enforcing environmental regulations stringently enough. Rowland and DEP Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque deny that and say the criticism comes from a small group of disgruntled employees and political opponents of the governor. Do you believe the DEP adequately enforces environmental regulations? If so, do you think criticism of the DEP is valid? If you do not think enforcement is satisfactory, do you think legislation is needed to ensure that it improves?
\
Angelo Fusco
\
Fighting to protect the environment is not always the popular cause that it is today, but it has always been the right thing to do. I have recieved many endorsements over the years, but the endorsement I received from the Sierra Club this year is one that I will always be very proud of. I will continue to work with the DEP to see that we have strong environmental protection laws and that they are properly enforced.
\
Christopher Murphy
\
The capacity of the DEP to enforce its regulations may soon have a real effect in Southington. We are presently deciding whether or not to approve a new gas-fired power plant that would pose a potential threat to the area's waters and air. Like any Southington resident, I like the idea of a power plant adding to our tax base, but I don't want to see our rivers dumped in or our air contaminated. I need to have confidence that our DEP can keep this power plant in line.

The folks who make MTBE, desperately clinging to their market in the suspected carcinogen, are spreading word that in Chicago, Milwaukee and California, gasoline spiked by 30 cents a gallon or more as a direct result of the switch to ethanol in those places. A new report by the U.S. Department of Energy outlines possible price increases, at least in the transition.
\
It could happen here and threaten our way of life. Freedom fighters, man the gunboats! Defend cheap gasoline!
\
Well, first of all, there's plenty of evidence that pump-price spikes in those places were caused by other factors, chiefly the regional supplies of gasoline. A study by the pro-ethanol Renewable Energy Action Project shows that ethanol actually reduced prices in those markets.
\
More broadly, price swings, and there is no shortage of them, always manage to flatten back out in gasoline, arguably the world's most watched commodity. Despite all the newspaper ink and hand- wringing, the price of gasoline has remained boringly steady over the years. With taxes included, the stuff cost about 33 cents a gallon in 1967, and it costs about $1.75 now -- right in line with inflation.
\
Most important, it would be fine if the price of gasoline went up a little bit, especially in exchange for cleaner water. People would learn to drive less. They'd eventually tend to live closer to where they work. Maybe they'd even stop thinking they have some kind of a divine right to own and operate a vehicle the size of a milk truck.
\
A 20-cent-a-gallon increase would cost the average driver less than $100 a year, and could end up costing nothing if it forced motorists to share the ride and automakers to get serious about fuel efficiency.
\
I don't mean to suggest that higher prices would be pure good, just that lower prices shouldn't be the end of all ends. As we saw in the oil shocks of the 1970s, rising energy prices can act like a tax, dragging down economic growth and job creation.
\
And, of course, there are millions of families that don't waste fuel and would truly suffer if prices rose permanently. A long-term rise in prices would hurt the poor more than the rich. If you're a card-carrying liberal, do you favor a drop in the gas tax? It helps the poor, but encourages more SUVs.
\
Obviously, we need to find an energy policy that makes sense for the environment, and is viable, without raising prices by a lot. Ethanol might just fit that description.
\
But in the search for balance, the system we have now -- keep consumer energy prices low at all cost -- is just madness. To ward off even the threat of higher prices, all sorts of public good goes out the window.
\
It's playing out now, as the U.S. House and Senate work out the final details of an energy bill. The MTBE-ethanol debate is one of the last sticking points.
\
MTBE as an additive came into wide use after the Clean Air Act of 1990 required a certain percentage of gasoline, in certain places, to include agents that add oxygen to gasoline, and thereby make it burn cleaner. MTBE -- methyl tertiary butyl ether, for those who remember high school chemistry class fondly -- was a ready solution because it's partly a byproduct of petroleum, and it can be made and shipped with gasoline.
\
But it leaches into water, and it stays there. Unlike heavy metals, it clings right to the H2O molecules rather than falling to the bottom of the river.
\
House Republicans at first rebuffed a nationwide MTBE ban, and now want to shield makers of the stuff from liability lawsuits. Fear, or fear-mongering, about higher prices runs as an undercurrent in the federal debate, as it has in some states.
\
""California is still experiencing at least a 34-cent higher pricing"" as a result of the switch to ethanol this year, said John Kneiss, vice president of technical and regulatory affairs for the Oxygenated Fuels Association, which represents the MTBE makers.
\
The association also contends, in contrast to established studies, that MTBE is harmless -- indeed, that a lifetime of normal water consumption would amount to a tiny fraction of an ounce.
\
""If this lifetime quantity of MTBE were added all at once to a dry martini, an informed college student would probably drink it on a dare and suffer no harm,"" the association's website contends, in apparent contrast to established findings.
\
The health debate aside, pro-ethanol folks say those price spikes were not at all caused by ethanol, which is alcohol made mostly from corn.
\
""They make the claims, and then when you start to dissect it you find that it has nothing to do with the transition to ethanol,"" said William Coleman, associate director of the Renewable Energy Action Project.
\
""I also hope that the price debate does not overshadow both the undeniable need to get rid of MTBE and the very real cost of cleanup that taxpayers and water consumers will shoulder due to MTBE.""
\
The energy group's study appears to show that in California, as in the Midwest, the price spikes either would have happened, anyway, or were the result of gouging, not the cost of ethanol.
\
In this state, the Connecticut Petroleum Council, which represents the big oil companies, opposed the switch a few years ago chiefly because Connecticut would have been subject to higher costs as a jack rabbit out front of the pack on the issue.
\
""On this one, we really have swung around,"" executive director Steven Guveyan said.
\
There are problems with ethanol. The point here is not to push it as a panacea, but to set the priorities right and not let shortsighted, deceptive concerns about pennies a gallon rule the day.

Towing Stolen
\
Cars Is Prudent
\
In response to the May 21 editorial [""The City Hall Towing Co.""] pertaining to the Hartford Police Department and their towing of recovered stolen cars:
\
Although there are occasions when it would make sense to attempt to notify owners and have them respond to the location of the recovery and drive away with their vehicles, in most instances this is impractical.
\
In my 20-year career as a Hartford police officer, I probably recovered 200 stolen vehicles. I found that in most instances the car thief doesn't park it neatly at the curb in a well-lit, safe neighborhood in good operating condition. In most cases the vehicle is found in a run-down area (often behind an abandoned building) during the early morning hours. Many times the vehicle has been stripped or partially stripped, making it inoperable.
\
Considering the increased volume of calls for service that the Hartford Police Department must deal with (many of them emergencies), I don't think it's prudent to have an officer sitting next to a recovered stolen car for an extended period of time when he could be back on patrol.
\
It's much more efficient to have it towed immediately to a secure location. Once the vehicle has been recovered, it is incumbent on the police or the towing company to notify the owner in a timely manner to avoid excessive costs.

No Good Deed

Goes Unpunished
\
Laura Kirby should be congratulated instead of condemned for what she did for those high school kids on prom night [Connecticut section, May 16, ""Hosts Of Post-Prom Party Fined""]. Who knows how many of the teenagers might have caused death or injuries by drinking and driving if they hadn't been at Ms. Kirby's post-prom party?
\
It's a fact that prom night is a night of celebration, and many young people drink to mark the occasion. So confiscating car keys and making sure nobody left the property was a wonderful thing for this woman to do. She did not provide the liquor, and you know that those youngsters were going to drink and get drunk somewhere.
\
I'm sure the parents of those teenagers slept peacefully that night knowing that their children and others were safe. Shame on the person who reported her to the police.

Return To Sender?
\
The Courant is in favor of expanding the bottle bill to include a 5-cent deposit on noncarbonated beverage containers [editorial, May 22, ""Recycle Expanded Bottle Bill""]. If this is good for the beverage industry, then why not The Courant?
\
The Courant could charge an extra nickel per newspaper and hire someone (at a union wage, I hope) to stand by the front door of each of its offices and give back deposits as people recycled their newspapers. This would take more newspapers out of the waste stream, employ more people and, as a bonus, keep that 25-cent gas tax rolling in to the state (overtaxed as we are), because people will have to drive even more to return all those newspapers.
\
I am one of the people in this state who makes a real effort to put recyclable materials in my curbside container. I don't want to spend even more time and effort dragging that stuff back to the grocery store than I already do.
\
Leave the bottle bill alone, but here is a real suggestion. In parks, on city streets and at other public places where garbage bins are located, why not also place well-marked recycling containers and let the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority collect them on a regular basis? This would work better for everyone.

Income Should

Be Taxed
\
I understand that James Calvin Tillman was convicted of a crime he did not commit and spent 18 years in prison [Page 1, May 17, ""Payment For The Pain""]. He has indeed suffered and should be compensated for it. The state felt obligated and awarded him $5 million, which is a generous amount of money.
\
What I can't understand is: Why doesn't he have to pay Connecticut state income tax on this money?
\
I am happy that this man is going to be able to live comfortably for the rest of his life, but this money should be considered income and he should have to pay state taxes like everyone else.

Add Funds
\
For Mental Health
\
We can be proud of our state legislators for their unanimous decision to give $5 million to James Calvin Tillman to compensate for 18 stolen years.
\
A significant number of patients with organic brain disorders, living in locked units of our state's psychiatric hospitals, are experiencing stolen years as well. When admitted, these individuals had acute needs for treatment. Thanks to the skillful intervention of the clinical staffs, many have responded positively and are ready to move on to group homes and other appropriate placements.
\
Why, then, do these people remain in hospitals for years when they are ready and willing to live life more fully? The underlying reason is that needed funds for this have been sorely lacking in the state's budget for mental health.
\
Let's hope our legislators will remember the stolen years of these other citizens by increasing the budget figures for suitable, long-overdue discharges from state psychiatric hospitals. Connecticut can afford it this year.

Senate Must Act

On Sea Treaty
\
I could find no reference to it in The Courant, but a development of tremendous potential significance for both the environment and our national security has taken place in Washington.
\
On May 15, President Bush released a statement urging the Senate to act favorably on U.S. accession to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
\
For 25 years, the United States has refused to join virtually the entire rest of the world in recognizing the overriding value and importance of becoming party to this global treaty. It is high time for us to sign on to protect our interests in the international governance of the world's oceans, which belong to no one nation.
\
I was in the balcony at the United Nations on April 26, 1982, when the U.N. Conference on the Law of the Sea adopted the text by a vote of 130 in favor, 4 against (including the United States) and 17 abstentions. I was especially interested in one specific provision calling for nations to cooperate for the conservation, management and study of whales and other cetaceans.
\
The Senate should act promptly in support of this vital presidential initiative to advance U.S. interests in the oceans and their living resources.

HARTFORD >> Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's administration Thursday called for cuts to the Department of Children and Families, higher education and other agencies as part of $54.6 million in rescissions, designed to help close a $99.5 million budget deficit.
\
The 2015 budget's $99.5 million deficit is less than 1 percent of the general fund, which means Malloy has the authority to make decisions about where to make the cuts without input from the General Assembly. The governor can rescind up to 5 percent of any line item and 3 percent of any fund without seeking legislative approval.
\
The Malloy administration made $170 million in rescissions in 2012.
\
Malloy can cut from the executive branch without approval, but he's also asked the judicial branch to cut $6 million and the legislative branch to cut by nearly $1 million. His administration also has told agency heads to review spending and avoid non-critical expenditures, and has instituted a hiring freeze.
\
At a press conference before the rescissions were announced, Malloy said he had looked at a draft of the cuts earlier in the day. He downplayed the severity of the rescissions. On Wednesday, he called the deficit ""de minimis.""
\
""There's not a whole lot of major stuff. I mean, this is for a lot of budgets a 1 percent to 5 percent cut,"" he said. ""Again, I'll give my example, the total budget is twenty-thousand million and we're talking about a $100 million issue.""
\
Malloy said some things in the budget will remain untouched.
\
""Part of it also is going through and seeing where people are on their spending plan. So some of the easiest stuff to do is identify those departments that aren't on schedule to spend their money anyway,"" he said.
\
Of the executive agencies, one of the largest cuts outlined Thursday comes from the Department of Children and Families' board and care residential program. Its budget will be reduced by about $6.3 million. The total DCF budget will be reduced by $9.2 million.
\
The cuts also include $5.5 million to the Department of Developmental Services, including $2 million to its employment opportunities and day services programs. The Department of Social Services will have its personal services budget cut by $2 million.
\
Higher-education institutions also will see reductions. The plan includes a $2.3 million cut to the University of Connecticut's operating budget and a $1.3 million cut to the UConn Health Center. The Connecticut State University System's budget will be reduced by about $1.6 million. Transform CSCU, a program to invest in the system, will be cut by $1.2 million.
\
Board of Regents spokesman Michael W. Kozlowski said the reductions could have been worse.
\
""At first glance we are grateful for the restraint shown with respect to the Community Colleges,"" he said in an email. ""With respect to Transform and the BOR, any cut in this environment is painful, but we will do our part to help address the state's current fiscal crisis.""
\
Several community programs and regional tourism initiatives across the state supported by the Department of Economic and Community Development will receive less money. The New Haven Festival of Arts and Ideas's budget was cut by $37,381 and the New Haven Arts Council by $4,497.
\
State Sen. Beth Bye, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said the legislature has a cooperative relationship with the Malloy administration and would ""work together to solve this."" But Bye said parts of the plan concerned her.
\
""I definitely have concerns about the $6 million cut for board and care for children under DCF care. I need to better understand what that looks like exactly, because I don't want anything to negatively impact our care for adolescents who have mental health and behavioral challenges,"" she said.
\
Malloy's budget director, Ben Barnes, is expected to address the legislature's Appropriations and Finance committees today. Bye said she also is interested to hear whether any of the cuts will affect mental health services, especially services for children.
\
At the same time, Bye acknowledged the state's obligation to balance its budget.
\
""We have an obligation to maintain a balanced budget and that's what we're going to do,"" Bye said in a statement.
\
Republican lawmakers said the cuts will not be adequate to address the budget shortfall. Sen. Rob Kane, ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, said the state's fiscal problem eventually will require the involvement of the legislature.
\
""Democrats and Republicans worked well together in 2012 on the deficit mitigation plan, why not now?"" he said.
\
Kane noted the cuts represent only about half the total deficit and said the administration was hoping for high sales tax revenues during the holiday shopping season to correct the shortfall.
\
""We can't always work on a hope and a prayer of everything working out. You have to fix the structural problems with the budget,"" he said.
\
Incoming House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, R-Derby, released a statement accusing Malloy and Democrats of misleading the public during the election season.
\
""Clearly the governor failed to acknowledge what everyone else who was paying attention recognized: Connecticut has a lingering fiscal crisis that was never adequately addressed either because of politics or woeful disregard for the truth,"" she said. ""This is just the first step forward that all sides must take together.""
\
Sen. Len Fasano, R-North Haven, the incoming Senate minority leader, also criticized the budget strategy.
\
""Lawmakers and state leaders should be working together to address the current fiscal crisis, not meddling with state finances behind closed doors,"" Fasano said in a statement. ""I am again calling on our legislative leaders and governor to work together on a big picture approach. Tough decisions absolutely have to be made now, but so does a plan for long-term budget reform.""
\
Fasano said the state still faces a projected deficit of about $2.8 billion in the next biennium. Nonpartisan analysis shows the state facing a $1.2 billion deficit in 2016 and a $1.4 billion deficit in 2017.
\
""Today we face a significant deficit. And tomorrow that deficit will become staggering. Our budget crisis is also a borrowing crisis and these issues are compounding fast. The solution to these mounting problems does not lie in one time cuts,"" Fasano said in a statement. ""We need to identify a comprehensive solution by working across the aisle.""
\
In another statement, Barnes said the administration was managing the budget to prevent a deficit and not raise taxes.
\
""These rescissions are painful for some, but tough decisions are necessary to keep the state on firm fiscal footing. State government will live within its means, and we will not raise taxes,"" Barnes said. ""As difficult as some of these reductions are to make now, there are more, even tougher choices as we look ahead to next fiscal year.""
\
Last month, Barnes projected that the state would end the year with a $300,000 surplus. The figure was certified by state Comptroller Kevin Lembo on Nov. 1, but that was before the November consensus revenue estimates were released showing that federal grants, the gas tax, and gambling revenues were lagging behind the state's projections.

Cloth Improves
\
The Bottom Line
\
In response to the Feb. 9 article about proposed legislation that would set aside state money to subsidize the cost of disposable diapers for children living in poverty [""Measure's Bottom Line: Diapers For The Poor""]:
\
Cloth diapers are better for babies, period. Many of us raised children in the era of cloth diapers. I worked outside the home, raised two babies and washed my own diapers. My children never had a diaper rash.
\
Research on this issue shows that many chemicals, such as dioxin, can be in the disposable material. These are anything but good for a baby to absorb. There is also a large discrepancy in the cost of cloth vs. disposables. Disposables cost about 20 cents a diaper. After initial purchase, cloth diapers are about 3 cents.
\
The bottom line: Using cloth diapers is better for babies, and for the environment as our landfills overflow. It would also mean a big savings for taxpayers. Do the math.

Don't Hide History
\
I am astonished at Yale University's proposed removal of a painting of Elihu Yale and a black man with a silver collar around his neck -- presumably a slave [Page 1, Feb. 8, ""Yale Portrait Coming Down""].
\
This painting is a piece of art and, more important, history. Our history shapes who we are, and it is important to learn, understand and apply it. We must learn from the fallacies and successes of history, not suppress them.
\
Slavery was undoubtedly an ugly chapter of U.S. history, but putting it out of sight does not put it out of mind. Slavery was iniquitous, evil and morally wrong, but it's not fair to act like it never happened. I don't judge the people who took advantage of slavery.
\
It was a cultural norm to practice slavery. It shouldn't be insulting to see a painting created 250 years ago that references slavery. It is unfair to put modern-day values on events and people from the past. This portrait should not be judged for its distasteful reference to slavery, but rather as a piece of culture and as a luxury because of the scarcity of historical relics around today to be studied and respected.
\
Elihu Yale deserves reverence for creating such a privileged university, and this portrait should not be put into storage just because the values of some students and faculty are being used to judge history.

Nothing `Bold'
\
About Budget
\
The governor's budget proposal has been described as ""bold"" by many publications and individuals. That characterization implies that this proposal would signify a meaningful change in how our state government will operate. As an elected official of a small town that currently gets little state money, the thought of receiving more state aid is quite a temptation. But as I think about raising personal income taxes by 10 percent over the next two years to achieve the governor's goals, I question the wisdom of such an approach.
\
Connecticut has a revenue structure that is quite impressive including a sales tax, an income tax, a gas tax, corporate taxes, slot machine revenues, and other consumer- and business-related fees. There is even talk of bringing back highway tolls. This impressive array of payments to the state has yielded an ever- growing revenue stream, as evidenced by a robust surplus and a billion-dollar rainy-day fund. The state's problem is not one of revenue generation but of spending patterns and habits.
\
A thorough, disciplined review of overall state spending and spending practices should take place. We need to re-engage people, not discourage them with a relentless drive to take more of their hard-earned money.

Tax Increase Necessary
\
The Courant has published several letters citing Connecticut's large tax burden and opposing further tax increases. However, the brunt of many Connecticut residents' tax bills is the property tax, which would be significantly lower if the state kept its promise to fund half the cost of public education.
\
The increase in the income tax will provide an extra $1.5 billion for aid to towns. The state can mandate that towns must lower their property taxes in proportion to the increase in aid. An increase in the ""temporary"" income tax is needed because of the state's rising Medicaid and nursing home costs.
\
The income tax increase as currently proposed is unacceptable because it affects middle-income residents. However, by increasing the exemption, the state can and should reduce the impact on households earning less than $60,000 a year. Most people agree that Connecticut needs lower property taxes. While it would be nice if we could achieve that without raising other taxes, Gov. M. Jodi Rell understands that the money to lower property taxes can't come from cutting necessary human services such as nursing homes and Medicaid, and that the money doesn't grow on the Charter Oak, either.

Precede Courses
\
A letter writer [Feb. 12, ""AP Tests Lead To Success""] complained about a lack of Advanced Placement testing for minority and economically underprivileged students. Other articles in The Courant have related to high dropout rates for these groups. I agree with the writer that the AP courses are a major aid to success, but if you want a chance to win the race, you first have to show up at the starting gate.
\
I have two children taking AP courses in a public high school. We are constantly getting letters from the school informing us that financial aid is available if needed for testing fees. This would seem to eliminate the economic factor from the equation.
\
I have one child who was struggling in an AP course. Rather than encourage him to persevere and try (study) harder, his advisers suggested that he back off and take easier courses next year. He will not be taking that advice. This seems to indicate that the message being sent by some advisers is to pursue the path of least resistance.
\
The impression I am left with is that if the desire and need for these courses is there, then the school will offer them. But teachers, parents and advisers must first encourage students to strive for success if we hope for this picture to change.
\
Finally, students must be encouraged to show up for school and not drop out.

Thanks For Help
\
On `Work Day'
\
On behalf of the Connecticut State Police and as the commanding officer of Troop B, I wish to thank all those who participated in the Troop B ""Work Day"" on Sept. 28.
\
Approximately 100 people donated their time, energy and efforts to complete the extensive renovations to the troop's building and grounds. Troopers, dispatchers, clerical staff, their families and friends, private citizens, and the state police Explorer Post 488 enthusiastically planned, organized and completed this project.
\
Their efforts and the results they achieved epitomized the true spirit of teamwork, commitment and dedication. In addition to the extraordinary efforts put forth by those people, the following individuals and local businesses graciously provided donations, time and support to assure the success of this very ambitious project: Connecticut State Police Union, Jeffrey Ment, Peter Rich, Home Depot (New Hartford), Allyndale Limestone, state Department of Transportation-North Canaan Garage, Freund's Farm Market, Kathy's Farm Stand, Lindell's Hardware, Troop B Explorer Post 488, Stop & Shop (North Canaan), Carlson's Landscaping, Peerless Tree, North Canaan Beautification Committee, North Canaan Transfer Station, Canaan Market, Dr. Donald and Lynn Martin, Edward Schutt General Contractors, Jane Pinkney, Joe Bieluch, Lime Rock Race Park, and Department of Public Safety's plants and maintenance unit.

McCluskey Works

For Public Safety
\
I am proud to once again support David McCluskey for re-election as state representative for the 20th House District. David has been active on issues concerning public safety, using his seven years of experience as legislative director for the Connecticut state police union. Rep. McCluskey has fought to increase the number of state troopers and to improve the state police communications system. He has won state funding to purchase a van for the Greater Hartford police bomb squad that will also be used in bioterrorism incidents. David has made sure that those on the front lines of fighting crime and terrorism have the laws and the equipment they need to get the job done.
\
His efforts on behalf of the men and women in the law enforcement community have earned him the endorsements of the state police union, the Association of State Prosecutors, the prison guard union and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. I urge the voters of the 20th House District to re-elect David McCluskey.

Development Would Bring Big Problems
\
On Sept. 25 I attended a West Hartford Vision meeting on the proposed development of the Talcott Junior High school property in Elmwood. A spokesperson from the Ginsburg Development Corp., a New York-based company, spoke for approximately 30 minutes and then fielded questions from the attendees, composed mainly of Elmwood residents like myself. The Ginsburg Development Corp. proposes to build approximately 150 condominiums and townhouses on this rather small parcel of land, consisting of only a few acres. The condos would vary in size from one to four bedrooms.
\
One of the major concerns brought up by the residents was the traffic congestion that would be created if these units were to be built. South Quaker Lane already resembles a parking lot at certain times of the day. With most households having at least two cars, this equates to perhaps 300 cars entering and exiting onto South Quaker Lane everyday and at all different times of the day. Factor in visitors and delivery vehicles and this becomes a veritable traffic nightmare. The noise pollution and air pollution created from all these vehicles is something that has to be considered.
\
The spokesperson also stated that the tennis courts that are at the back of the property would be demolished as well as numerous trees, but every effort would be made to save as many trees as possible -- ""try"" being the operative word in that sentence. Ginsburg Development Corp. inferred that once the proposed condos are built and rented, there could possibly be a reduction in taxes in West Hartford. However, if these condos were to attract families with school-age children, then it is doubtful there would be any reduction in taxes, as education expenses are quite costly. If enough families with two or three children were to move in, there could quite possibly even be a tax increase to cover the education expenditures.
\
When looking at the big picture, one can only envision too many people living on too small a piece of land and all the inherent problems that go with that. The most livable and beautiful towns and cities have always been those that have large open tracts of land and numerous large parks. West Hartford is already vastly overdeveloped with new houses being built on every available postage stamp-sized piece of property. If the town planners, traffic planners and zoning officials have any foresight at all they will prevent this proposal from coming to fruition.
\
As mentioned, Ginsburg Development Corp. is an out-of-state company. Talcott Junior High and the land it is on mean nothing to them, it's merely an opportunity to make a large sum of money. They will not be the ones that have to deal with the traffic problems and noise and air pollution that will be created if these units are built. Residents of the Elmwood community have to ask themselves: what is in it for them? How will they benefit from these condos being built? How will this affect our quality of life? What will this do to the environment? The popular bumper sticker reads: Think globally, act locally. I think that is a fitting adage that can be applied here.

As a member of these significant committees, Demetrios has consistently voted to reduce our taxes to make our town a more affordable place to live. He has helped stimulate economic growth for business by voting for exemptions to the sales tax, by lowering the gas tax, the income tax and business taxes, and by decreasing many state license fees for individuals and businesses.
\
State grants have more than doubled and PILOT funds to Farmington have increased by 179 percent during his tenure as our legislator. The $152,000 open space grant to buy 23 acres of the Hein Farm is part of the Department of Environmental Protection's open space program that Demetrios supported in the legislature, bringing the total for Farmington to over $1 million. He voted for the passage of a $1.3 billion bonding package to continue the rebuilding of the University of Connecticut that has $305,400 earmarked for the UConn Health Center here in town. Demetrios also worked hard to secure $7.5 million in state funding for our new West Woods Upper Elementary School.
\
Demetrios is dedicated, intelligent, responsive, and always fighting for our best interests. He is not afraid to make difficult decisions. And he has experience!

175,"
This was supposed to be the year when Connecticut Democrats came roaring back. They took control of the state Senate in November, increased their already large margin in the House and declared they were ready to put their principles back into action.
\
But instead of celebrating, many Democrats are grumbling that, nearly three months through the five-month session, nothing has changed. What good, they ask, is Democratic control if Senate and House leaders can't agree on whether to take on Republican Gov. John G. Rowland?
\
Rank-and-file Democrats in the House are particularly frustrated that the Senate's top Democrat, President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan, has embraced Rowland's call to cut taxes and proclaimed that he wants to keep to Rowland's bottom- line budget of $10.16 billion.
\
By acceding to Rowland's bottom line, these Democrats say, Sullivan has fallen for a trap set by Rowland in which the governor proposed a budget with an unrealistically large income tax cut and no realistic way to pay for it.
\
Rowland's budget, which even critics concede is politically well- crafted, leaves Democrats with a dangerous choice: either roll back Rowland's proposed $365 million in income tax cuts or make unpopular cuts in services vital to many Democratic constituencies, including students and the poor.
\
The choice is made even more difficult by the knowledge that Democrats hold just a two-seat majority in the Senate. If even one of the 19 Democratic senators votes against a Democratic plan, it can be defeated.
\
Even in the House, where Democrats hold a 41-seat majority, grumbling is growing louder. At a recent meeting of its members, ""There was almost a weight in the air about what needs to get done, and how difficult some of it will be to do,"" said Rep. Terry Backer, D-Stratford, vice chairman of the legislature's budget committee.
\
The governor's tax cut proposal, coming on the heels of more than $600 million in tax cuts over the past two years, may be too much for the state to absorb -- and could lead to critical cuts in services for education, transportation and other programs, said Backer, a longtime Rowland critic.
\
Worst of all, the governor's proposal could lead to increases in local property taxes as municipalities struggle to meet new demands thrust on them by a cut in state aid, Backer said.
\
But for every Backer who wants to restore full funding for traditional Democratic programs for education, health care and the environment, there are other Democrats, such as Rep. Carl. J. Schiessl of Windsor Locks, the influential House chairman of the tax-writing finance committee, who say that even Rowland's proposal may be more than the state can afford.
\
""To people who want to increase the bottom line, I say fine, but show me the revenue,"" Schiessl said, citing a recent study by the legislature's nonpartisan fiscal office showing projected revenue just under $10.1 billion.
\
Those estimates are subject to change, Schiessl said, but even the possibility of a deficit shows there is pressure on the budget from both sides.
\
Schiessl calls the angst over the budget a rite of spring.
\
""This is the time of year when legislators come to grips with the collision of their legislative dreams with fiscal reality,"" he said. ""That leads to a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth.""
\
But the wailing this year from Democrats is especially strong.
\
Even House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, a moderate who has worked as a virtual partner with Rowland the past two years, now finds himself in the relatively new role of Rowland's chief critic.
\
Ritter, a Hartford Democrat, has branded Rowland's budget ""intellectually dishonest"" and said it needs to be rewritten virtually from top to bottom. Ritter is especially adamant about restoring funding for higher education, early childhood programs and environmental protection, and says the governor's tax proposal must include property tax cuts.
\
Instead of working with him and legislative leaders, Rowland chose to submit a political document whose main purpose seems to be to allow the governor to say Democrats prevented him from eliminating the income tax, Ritter said.
\
""He essentially spoiled two years of good will by wanting to make a political statement, and I was very disappointed at that and hurt,"" Ritter said. ""If we adopt his budget- and-tax package we're setting the state of Connecticut back by 20 years.""
\
For all his newfound criticism of Rowland, however, Ritter has been largely silent on how, exactly, he would change Rowland's bottom line. And for now, at least, he and House Majority Leader Moira K. Lyons, D-Stamford, have instructed their key budget deputies to try to keep to the $10.16 billion figure if possible.
\
Ritter calls that figure a goal that can be revised if necessary -- and probably will be -- but the mixed message from the House leadership has led to some unrest among rank- and-file Democrats, who want the party to be more aggressive in taking on Rowland.
\
Rep. Jefferson B. Davis, D-Pomfret, has even proposed raising taxes on single filers earning more than $55,000, or couples earning more than $110,000, to provide property tax relief to homeowners and boost aid to cities and towns.
\
Davis' proposal is widely considered unlikely to become law, but Davis said he raised it to make the point that Democrats are interested in targeted tax cuts and property tax relief.
\
State Rep. Robert D. Godfrey, D- Danbury, said concern over whether Democrats should raise the governor's bottom line is overwrought.
\
""The problem isn't raising the bottom line, it's finding it,"" Godfrey said, calling Rowland's budget filled with gimmicks and wildly optimistic projections such as an estimated $100 million in savings from a yet-to-be tested early retirement plan.
\
Many Democratic senators feel the same way, Sullivan said -- including him. But critics who say Democrats should tear up Rowland's budget and start over make a crucial mistake, Sullivan said.
\
Democrats may not like it, he said, but Rowland is the governor, and any budget the legislature passes must meet his approval.
\
""The governor is not about to sign a budget that breaks the bank, and if there is any thought that {approving a budget that Rowland will veto} serves our purpose, I would suggest we go back and take a look at the mood of the public,"" Sullivan said.
"
176,"
The state Senate voted Thursday night to raise the minimum wage -- after a huge clash between Republicans and Democrats.
\
The latest version calls for raising the wage by 75 cents per hour over two years, with no index for inflation. As such, the wage would increase to $9 per hour by January 2015, up from the current $8.25. Under the current wage, a person would make slightly more than $17,000 per year for a full-time job at 40 hours a week; that would increase to $18,720 at $9 an hour.
\
After a lengthy debate, the Senate voted at about 8:45 p.m. on a mostly party line vote of 21-15. Conservative Democrat Sen. Joan Hartley of Waterbury voted with 14 Republicans against the bill.
\
Sen. Cathy Osten, a freshman Democrat who chairs the labor committee, introduced the bill by saying her parents were small business owners who operated a restaurant in Norwich and sold English muffins in 1963 for 15 cents. She said the minimum wage should be $9.50 per hour if it had been adjusted equivalently for inflation back to the days when the English muffins were 15 cents.
\
But Deputy Senate Republican leader Len Fasano of North Haven said small businesses cannot act like state legislators who can raise taxes when spending gets too high.
\
""Someone has to pay for the largest tax increase in Connecticut history that we passed,"" Fasano said. ""So our answer is: We'll keep raising the taxes and keep raising the minimum wage to pay the taxes. ... If we're passing the largest tax increase in Connecticut history ... [businesses] can't afford the increase in expenses we put on them.""
\
Senate Majority Leader Martin Looney of New Haven said the minimum wage will have remained stagnant for four years by the time the next increase would start in January 2014. The wage was $6.15 per hour in January 2000 before being boosted several times, eventually reaching $7.10 by 2004 and the current level of $8.25 per hour in January 2010.
\
Looney said it is inaccurate to say minimum wage workers are teenagers trying to earn extra money. Instead, he said, they are often adults who are trying to raise a family.
\
""It is an extraordinarily painful struggle,"" Looney said, adding that a minimum wage job ""in most cases is not an enriching career.""
\
At a time when chief executive officers earn $1 million per year or $10,000 per hour, it is difficult to ask some employees to earn $8.25 per hour, Looney said.
\
But Senate Republican Leader John McKinney of Fairfield, who washed dishes for the minimum wage of about $3.17 per hour in 1980 at age 15, said 50 percent of those earning the minimum wage now are between the ages of 18 and 25. He said he has a 17-year-old son whose job prospects will be more difficult as the minimum wage increases. In addition, he said, small business owners, like those operating delis, would be forced to raise their prices.
\
""One of the reasons why they're struggling is because you raised their sales tax. You raised their gas tax,"" McKinney told Senate Democrats.
\
Some legislators predict the bill will be passed by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives before being sent to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who pledged Thursday night to sign it.
\
SUNDAY HUNTING
\
After years of discussion, the state House of Representatives Thursday approved a limited measure that will allow deer hunting with a bow and arrow on private land on Sundays.
\
The measure passed, 107-19 with 24 members absent, and all 19 negative votes came from Democrats.
\
State Rep. Craig Miner, a licensed bow hunter, said the controversy was reduced this year because the bill did not mention anything about guns. In addition, hikers in state forests should not be concerned because the bill covers only private land, and the hunting must take place during the normal bow-hunting season.
\
The hunting can only be done by licensed bow hunters, who are required to first take a course to learn how to properly use a bow and arrow.
\
State Rep. Linda Gentile, the co-chairwoman of the legislature's environment committee, said the bill makes sense because there has been growing concern about the spread of Lyme Disease from deer. Any hunter would need written permission that must be carried by the hunter at all times.
\
Republicans unanimously joined the bipartisan effort, which now goes to the state Senate.
\
""There is a severe, severe, severe over-management issue,"" said Rep. John Shaban, a Redding Republican, who added that an overpopulation of deer is prevalent in some areas of the state.
\
Miner believes that word could spread about the Sunday hunting and that Connecticut could improve its reputation for hunting and fishing among sportsmen.
\
""Connecticut may become the kind of destination that Vermont is,"" said Miner, a Litchfield Republican who represents four other small towns in Litchfield County.
\
RACIAL PROFILING
\
In other matters Thursday, the House granted final legislative approval to strengthen the state's racial profiling law. The bill, which was previously approved, 36-0, by the state Senate, passed the House unanimously, 130-0, with 20 members absent.
\
The profiling bill expands the current law to cover the police forces at the state Capitol, the University of Connecticut and the Connecticut State University system. If the update is signed into law by Malloy, those departments would be required to provide information on traffic stops and complaints so that officials could analyze the race, age, ethnicity and gender of the drivers being stopped over the course of the year.
\
There has been disagreement over whether police have been following the original profiling law, which was passed more than 10 years ago.
\
Senate Democrats said last year that only 27 of the 92 local police departments had complied with the law. Some small communities among the state's 169 cities and towns do not have a full police department and instead are patrolled by a resident state trooper.
\
The issue became hotly debated in the legislature in the mid-1990s after Sen. Alvin Penn, an African American from Bridgeport who died in 2003, said that he was racially profiled while driving his van on a dead-end street after getting lost in Trumbull. By 1999, the state had passed a profiling bill that later became known as the Alvin Penn Racial Profiling Law.
\
A TANNING BAN FOR MINORS
\
The House also granted final legislative approval for a bill that places new limits on the use of indoor tanning beds by teenagers. The bill, which was previously approved by the Senate, bans the use of tanning beds by anyone under age 17. That change represented a compromise, as an earlier version sought to ban the use by anyone under 18.
\
The bill was crafted after legislators cited various studies that have shown a link between tanning beds and various forms of skin cancer. The tanning industry had tried to block any government regulation by adopting voluntary regulations that would allow children under 16 to use a tanning bed only with a doctor's note.
\
The American Suntanning Association released a statement recently that said the latest bill ""acknowledges that 17-year-olds, who are nearing legal adulthood, can make the decision to tan in concert with their parents. We also understand the compromise's inclusion of 16-year-olds in the ban.""
\
CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH
\
Five months after the Newtown massacre, the state Senate unanimously approved a bipartisan bill designed to improve the emotional and mental health of children in an attempt to avoid another tragedy.
\
The measure is designed to detect behavioral problems at an early age and then begin early intervention to prevent the issues from worsening.
\
Some supporters of the bill said that finding the proper care for children can be difficult in a long-running battle that often involves clashes with insurance companies and sometimes-slow diagnoses by pediatricians.
\
The bill does not provide any substantial state funding to improve mental health for children. Sen. Dante Bartolomeo, the chief sponsor, said most sections of the bill have no state or municipal fiscal impact. A 10-member task force of volunteers would cost an estimated $1,000 to cover expenses.
\
Bartolomeo said on the Senate floor that parents are often the first ones to recognize that a child should be referred to the federal Birth to Three program. Early assessment, which the bill promotes, is critical.
\
""Parent intuition, I think, is sometimes taken for granted,"" said Bartolomeo, a Meriden Democrat.
\
""Our pediatricians are not specialists.""
\
The bipartisan bill states that the proposed Office of Early Childhood must coordinate a system of voluntary in-home-visitation programs that would be available to families with children who have severe depression, substance abuse challenges or special health care needs.
\
""In a way, this bill should have been in front of this General Assembly many, many years ago,"" said Sen. L. Scott Frantz, a Greenwich Republican.
\
""It's clearly a problem that needs to be dealt with as strongly as we possibly can. ... I am absolutely convinced we could have headed off many serious problems, including maybe what happened in December 2012.""

177,"Gov. Ned Lamont's extraordinary powers to combat COVID-19 will continue until at least May 20 after Democrats in the General Assembly agreed to a one-month extension of his authority. The extension comes as Connecticut is making progress on coronavirus vaccinations but seeing an increase in its test positivity rate and COVID-19 hospitalizations as now more younger people are contracting the virus.Want to get this in your inbox every Friday? Subscribe to Capitol Watch at courant.com/newsletters\The big story\Lamont's emergency COVID-19 powers extended until May 20:Democratic lawmakers have approved a one-month extension of Lamont's emergency powers to combat the coronavirus pandemic over objections from Republicans who say the legislature has become increasingly irrelevant as Lamont has governed via executive order for more than a year. The measure passed the state House of Representatives March 25 and the state Senate on Tuesday. Supporters of the extension said lawmakers and the Lamont administration need additional time to decide which executive orders should be continued, which should be changed and which should be suspended. The orders range from keeping bars closed to requiring mask-wearing to expanding the number of people eligible to give COVID-19 vaccinations. Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney said Lamont still needs broad authority to act because ""we do not have this pandemic in our rear-view mirror yet."" Lamont officials have warned that letting the emergency declaration expire could also impact federal funding related to the pandemic. But even Republicans who were complimentary of the job Lamont has done guiding the state through COVID-19 argued it was time for the legislature to be more involved. ""Let us get back to work,"" Sen. Paul Formica, R-East Lyme, said. ""We are a coequal branch of government, and it's time for us to start acting that way.""\Five things you may have missed\Connecticut gets first credit rating upgrade in two decades:For the first time in 20 years, a Wall Street credit rating agency has upgraded its rating of Connecticut's finances, an important signal that reflects confidence in the state's budgeting and could save money in the future through reduced borrowing costs. State Treasurer Shawn Wooden said the upgrade by Moody's Investors Service was ""a significant milestone for the state."" It comes as tax collections have exceeded expectations and the state is on track to end the fiscal year with a $180 million surplus as well as a reserve fund of more than $3 billion. Moody's said the upgraded bond rating ""reflects the state's continued commitment to numerous governance improvements that have already borne fruit."" Those measures include the so-called debt diet Lamont has pushed since being elected, saying Connecticut needed to scale back borrowing, as well as a measure that requires surplus funds to be saved or used to pay down pension debt.\Zoning reform bills advance, but not without changes: A pair of bills that would overhaul the state's zoning rules to promote the construction of more affordable housing and address racial segregation were advanced by the legislature's planning and development committee Wednesday, but even supporters of the measures said they are likely to undergo changes as they move through the General Assembly. One change already made is eliminating a provision that would have required communities to approve certain multifamily housing developments near train stations. Senate Bill 1024 would legalize construction of accessory apartments statewide and prohibit cities and towns from using vague terms such as ""character"" in zoning rules to block proposed projects. House Bill 6611 would set benchmarks and deadlines for cities and towns to develop affordable housing. Wednesday's votes moved the measures forward, but it is unclear if the House or Senate will take up the measures before lawmakers adjourn in early June.\Bipartisan agreement on designating pizza as official state food:A legislative committee that has had protracted debate on bills examining voting rights and other issues found bipartisan consensus to advance legislation that would make pizza Connecticut's official state food. The bill is being pushed by New Haven lawmakers, but before Wednesday's committee vote, several members opined about where the best pies can be found. ""I just want to say that we have good pizza in Meriden, too. Not just New Haven,"" said Rep. Hilda Santiago, D-Meriden. Rep. Stephanie Thomas of Norwalk said: ""I just want the record to reflect that as a Jersey girl I'm not admitting that Connecticut pizza is better than New Jersey pizza if I vote yes on this bill."" Connecticut has a state flower (mountain laurel), state animal (sperm whale), state bird (American robin) and state hero (Nathan Hale), but no food-related designations have made their way into statute.\Climate change bill that could raise gas prices moves forward:The legislature's environment committee voted Wednesday in favor of a significant climate change bill that would generate funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cut air pollution and promote electric cars but that could also raise Connecticut gasoline prices by 5 to 9 cents per gallon in 2023. Lamont is seeking the legislature's OK to join the multistate Transportation Climate Initiative, a regional cap-and-trade plan to raise money to combat climate change by seeking wholesale reductions in motor vehicle pollution, the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Opponents of the proposal say increased costs for wholesalers will be passed along to consumers through increased prices and have decried it as a new gas tax. The program is expected to raise $89 million in Connecticut in 2023 and as much as $117 million in 2032. Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia have also joined the effort.\Committee OKs legislation ending religious exemptions for vaccines: A bill to eliminate Connecticut's religious exemption for required vaccines for schoolchildren was pushed forward in the legislature's public health committee by a largely party-line vote Wednesday, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed, but members on both sides of the aisle expressed support for grandfathering in all children with existing religious exemptions currently in Connecticut schools. The bill was the subject of a 24-hour public hearing in February and has drawn strong opposition from some parents who see it as government infringing on their rights. Supporters say they are concerned about a recent increase in students claiming the exemptions and say that can put other students who cannot receive vaccines due to medical conditions at risk. ""You have a right to religious expression and affiliation as an American,"" said Rep. Henry Genga, D-East Hartford. ""Exposing those with life-threatening illnesses is not a result which we have a right to.""\Odds and ends\The Connecticut Supreme Court Monday dismissed a challenge from a Milford tavern owner and affirmed Gov. Ned Lamont's emergency powers that have kept bars shuttered since the pandemic took hold in Connecticut last March. The unanimous opinion said COVID-19 is a ""serious disaster"" under state law and Lamont's decision to act via executive order and suspend laws and regulations is within the authority of his office. The suit, field by Kristine Casey, owner of Casey's Irish Pub, had argued the state law authorizing gubernatorial emergency powers during disasters was vague and should not extend to the pandemic. ... Rep. Robyn Porter, D-New Haven, bristled on social media Tuesday at the concept of COVID-19 ""vaccine passports"" that would require people to show proof of vaccination to visit a business, take a trip or attend a sporting event. Lamont has no plans to develop the tool on a statewide basis, but recently suggested businesses in the private sector may take the lead on the issue. Porter, however, wrote on Facebook that the proposed passports were a ""backdoor way of mandating [vaccines] without technically making it a mandate."" ... Biagio 'Billy' Ciotto, the colorful ex-state senator from Wethersfield who died last month at the age of 91, was remembered at his funeral Monday by friends, colleagues and even President Joe Biden, who wrote a personal letter that was read at the service. ""Please accept Jill's and my heartfelt condolence on the passing of your beloved Billy,"" Biden wrote to Ciotto's wife of 66 years, Jeanne, and her family, in a letter read by U.S. Rep. John Larson, whose office Ciotto had worked in until recently. ... Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin received his first COVID-19 vaccine Thursday as the state expanded eligibility to all residents 16 and up. ""I just got my vaccine. I got the first shot just now. It's April 1, but I'm not fooling. It feels good to get that vaccine,"" the 41-year-old mayor said in a video posted to Twitter from a walk-up clinic in Hartford. ""Do it for yourself, for your loved ones, your colleagues, your classmates. Do it for your community. We've got to beat this virus, and the way we do it is by getting this vaccine."" ... Mary Ann Turner, the longtime Enfield Republican Town Committee chairwoman, has been named vice chairwoman of the Connecticut Republican Party. Turner will serve through June, when the party's central committee will elect a new slate of officers. She replaces Sue Hatfield of Pomfret, a state prosecutor and former GOP candidate for attorney general who has stepped in as chairwoman after J.R. Romano, the chair since 2015, resigned in January before his term ended.\Russell Blair can be reached at rblair@courant.com."
178,"
Here are The Courant's goals for Connecticut, Hartford and the region for the new year, compiled by the newspaper's editorial board.
\
STATE
\
Accomplishing goals is easier in flush times when adequate revenue gushes to government, people's jobs are secure and companies can make investments. That decidedly is not the case as this new year begins.
\
Connecticut barely caught the wind of the nation's mild economic recovery. Our ship is becalmed. State government faces a record budget deficit in the next fiscal year. Layoffs in the public and private sectors number in the thousands. Nearly everyone is feeling the pinch. In times of adversity, the highest priority -- the No. 1 item on the agenda -- is for leadership capable of making tough decisions.
\
Legislators, union chiefs and Gov. John G. Rowland need to climb out of their entrenched positions and negotiate an agreement for a balanced state budget in a spirit of compromise enlightened by vision. Advocates of special causes -- whether they be business organizations, human service providers or municipalities -- must understand that pain has to be shared and that there will have to be tax increases and spending cuts to make the budget work.
\
Mr. Rowland is demonstrably the most willing to deal; less so are Republican lawmakers hostile to tax increases and majority Democrats who would fall on their swords to protect favored programs from spending cuts. They must get real. This is a crisis. Their constituents expect better of them.
\
All parties talk of seeking lasting solutions to ensure balanced budgets at both state and local levels in the foreseeable future. This is the time for structural changes that would replace the Scotch-tape fixes state leaders are normally inclined to use to close the gaps between revenue and spending.
\
Let the legislature and Mr. Rowland begin, now, an earnest discussion of basic changes that could have substantial impact on budget-making in the future. The discussion would include permitting regional revenue-sharing among municipalities; permitting municipalities to levy taxes other than the property tax; a state takeover of all public education funding; an end to binding arbitration; repeal of business tax breaks that no longer serve the purpose for which they were intended; further downsizing of the state government workforce; and more.
\
That would be leadership worthy of the times.
\
Price Of Power
\
Homeowners' electricity bills could skyrocket a year from now unless the legislature acts this session to protect them.
\
Deregulation of the power industry has not worked as advertised in Connecticut. The idea was to encourage energy retailers to stampede into the state, thereby keeping prices competitive. Meanwhile, customers were given the option of buying their electricity at a bargain price called the standard offer, which expires Dec. 31.
\
But competition has not materialized. Retail prices could shoot through the roof when the cap comes off at the end of the year. Remember California in 2001 and 2002?
\
Electric power prices can't continue for much longer to be unrealistically low, nor should they be unreasonably high. An extension of the standard offer may be necessary if the legislature and governor can't agree on a better way to stimulate competition while buffering consumers against the ravages of a volatile energy market.
\
Transportation
\
This week, the Transportation Strategy Board is expected to make its long-awaited recommendations on billions of dollars of mass transit, highway, airport and harbor improvements over the next decade -- and hopefully suggest ways to pay for them. Increases in the gas tax or sales tax, a bump in mass-transit fares and higher registration fees all have to be considered if Connecticut is to have the kind of transportation system that attracts new investment. But lawmakers should stay away from reimposing tolls, which contribute to traffic delays, accidents and air pollution.
\
State officials must not let the budget crisis cause them to lose momentum in the push to improve public transportation. New routes, more frequent runs and more stops are needed for rail and bus lines.
\
State resources that are allocated to mass transit are insufficient.
\
Moreover, Bradley International Airport is a wasted asset. The legislature must give the Bradley board of directors power so it no longer is just an appendage of the highway-oriented state Department of Transportation. Bradley also needs a long-range strategic plan and a larger marketing effort.
\
Coltsville
\
Mr. Rowland's clout is needed to make the case for Hartford's Coltsville. Republicans should join Democrats in Connecticut's congressional delegation in resubmitting legislation authorizing a study of Coltsville's suitability as a national park. The bill passed the Senate but was not taken up by the House as the 2002 session expired. The governor has important friends in Washington. He should contact them on Coltsville.
\
One way the state can help is to make Coltsville the official Seventh Pillar of Progress in the capital city's state-sponsored redevelopment program.
\
Now that new would-be owners have come forward to restore and develop the Colt Armory and other buildings, it is important to link the historic manufacturing site to Adriaen's Landing and other downtown attractions. The state should make a high priority out of building the proposed walkway over the Conland-Whitehead Highway.
\
Other Items
\
There should be no expansion of gambling in Connecticut. Some sort of a casino firewall should be built to protect the state's quality of life, whether it is repealing Las Vegas nights or some other way to block the proliferation of gambling palaces. The two existing casinos help the state with slot machine revenue and provide a large employment base. But the development of several more casinos -- depending upon federal recognition of Indian tribes -- is sure to alter Connecticut's social fabric for the worse. This small state is already saturated.
\
State's attorneys should be given investigative subpoena powers. The state's prosecutors have had to take a back seat to the U.S. attorney's office on many criminal matters because they lack this crucial crime-fighting tool.
\
The investigation into scandals surrounding former state Treasurer Paul Silvester should be brought to a conclusion. Pending trials should get underway and Mr. Silvester, who is in jail, should be sentenced.
\
Federal and state criminal investigators must get to the bottom of the CRRA-Enron scandal this year. The legislature should quit shirking its duty and hold more hearings on the loss of $220 million in public funds when the state's trash-to-energy agency was flimflammed by the now-bankrupt energy trading company. Why did it happen? Who was responsible? The public has a right to know.
\
When the governor traveled to Willimantic with the nation's drug czar last fall to discuss the town's unusually severe heroin problem, he pledged $100,000 to the city for extra enforcement. He can go further by urging the legislature to revamp the formula by which the state approves grants to communities for drug prevention and treatment. Willimantic is a small city with big city problems, yet because of its small size, it gets only minimal support. That should change.
\
Hartford, in the heart of women's basketball country, is the ideal location for a WNBA franchise. Now's the time for the governor and the MetroHartford Alliance to embark on a full-court press to bring professional women's basketball to the city. It's hard to think of a more appropriate place for a new franchise.
\
Two years have passed since the governor's blue ribbon task force on mental health made recommendations to ease the crisis in psychiatric care, especially for children. Yet there are still too few beds for young patients in crisis. The state would save money and help children by keeping them out of hospitals and detention centers and in their own communities. Expand the KidCare initiative to create more options. As child advocates have been warning, it's either pay now or pay more later.
\
The state Department of Education should establish a database where municipalities could register their experience with general contractors on school projects. Do the contractors meet deadlines? Do they pay subcontractors in a timely way? Do they submit additional work orders to increase costs? Often, towns go with the lowest bidder even though state law gives them latitude to pick the lowest ""responsible"" bidder. But local building committees don't always have a very good grasp of a contractor's track record.
\
Passing direct-primary legislation that would allow candidates to petition their way onto the ballot should be a top priority for the General Assembly. Connecticut is under pressure to comply with U.S. District Judge Peter Dorsey's likely decision soon invalidating the state's convention system of nominating candidates for office -- one of the most restrictive in the entire country.
\
The secretary of the state should upgrade the computerized reporting of campaign finance reports. The system has crashed too many times and the reports are often impossible to access. What good is an online system if it seldom works? Plus, candidates who filed online weren't required to file paper reports. So the unacceptable result was that the information was unavailable in any form.
\
With the moratorium expiring this year, answers are needed on how many cables and pipelines can be laid across Long Island Sound without harming the Sound's fragile environment. There also must be an upgrading of transmission lines to serve increasing demands for power in southwest Connecticut. Residents who oppose new towers there will have to face reality.
\
During the recent campaign for governor, Mr. Rowland offered a corporate responsibility plan, including proposals to stiffen corporate fraud laws, making it a crime to destroy corporate audit records and whistle-blower protections for those who assist with investigations of corporate misconduct. He should follow through on his promise.
\
Mr. Rowland is right in saying that candidates for commissioner of the Department of Children and Families should think of taking the job for just two years because of the high burnout rate. The new commissioner, when named, should make it his or her first priority to set things right at the Connecticut Juvenile Training Center in Middletown.
\
One sure way to save public money is to repeal the prevailing wage law, which requires the payment of union-scale wages even to employees of non-union contractors. This typically adds 30 percent to the cost of state and town public works construction projects.
\
The legislature should defeat any proposal to create mental stress or cancer benefits for public safety workers who claim their jobs gave them the conditions. Moreover, towns are still being bled dry by payments to grandfathered beneficiaries under the old ""heart and hypertension"" law, although the benefit was repealed in 1996. Since then, public safety employees who claim their jobs give them high blood pressure or heart trouble have sought relief under the worker's compensation system. So can police officers and firefighters who claim the job has given them stress or cancer.
\
The state should ban the use of hand-held cellphones by drivers, who ought to use hands-free devices or pull off the road if they need to place a call. Lives are at stake.
\
A graduated licensing program for teenage drivers should be adopted. Three elements are crucial: Bar 16- and 17-year-olds from nighttime driving unless an adult is in the car, with exceptions for jobs or school activities; allow only one teen passenger for the first six months; and increase on-road training time.
\
The General Assembly needs to pass additional legal protections for same-sex couples, including the right to a civil union.
\
Private giving -- at least as measured by the United Way Community Campaign -- broke records in 2002, a time of economic turmoil. Let that spirit of generosity continue to thrive, even if the economy in Connecticut is slow to recover. Human service organizations, arts and cultural organizations and other providers need help all the more when the going is tough.

179,"
This article has a sidebar/box titled ``Joseph Lieberman'' which ran on page A12.
\
The most telling moment of Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman's six years in the Senate probably came late on a gray afternoon in October 1991.
\
The Senate was preparing to vote on Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court. Lieberman, D- Conn., had announced early that he would back the conservative Thomas, but things had changed. The pressure was on.
\
Because Thomas had been accused of sexually harassing a former colleague, his bid for the seat was in jeopardy.
\
It was 90 minutes before the vote. Lieberman sat alone in his office, as calm as a man in his living room.
\
He had been on the phone all afternoon with advisers. He had been pressured by Thomas' supporters, including President Bush. But he invited a reporter in. He swung a baseball bat to relax. He spoke matter-of-factly about the decision.
\
Later, well before the vote, he would decide to oppose Thomas. But the public would not learn of his decision until he actually voted, when it was clear Thomas had enough votes to be confirmed. That led to speculation he really wanted Thomas and only voted against him when it looked safe.
\
It was vintage Lieberman. He was trying hard to make every visitor -- even the media at the most inconvenient of times -- feel like a friend. He was sticking with the conservative, but indicating he was weighing the issues. He was getting saturation coverage. And he was voting as a loyal Democrat in the end.
\
How one views Lieberman's behavior and his vote that day, and on other days like it, holds the answer to the key question voters will ask Nov. 8 as they decide whether to give him a second term: Has he been a good senator for Connecticut?
\
There is no universal definition of a good senator. Some say he should fight for state projects; others say he must represent state views on a national stage. Former Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff, another Connecticut Democrat, once said, ""You have to figure out a way to use your vote for the good of your state and your country at the same time.""
\
Lieberman has won praise from surprising quarters.
\
""He's fair-minded and tough. I admire him,"" said Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., known more for burying Democrats than praising them. ""I kept telling him he was in the wrong party,"" said former Sen. Warren G. Rudman, R-N.H.
\
But like anyone with a different kind of political approach, Lieberman inspires equally strong reactions from those who see him as someone out for votes, not change.
\
""He wound up giving the impression that he was doing what was politically expedient,"" said Theresa Weiner, president of the Connecticut chapter of the National Organization for Women, of the Thomas vote.
\
Thomas Swann, director of Connecticut Citizen Action Group, took a broader view. ""He used us and stabbed us in the back,"" he said of the senator's positions on several issues, notably health care.
\
Is there a political soul inside the man, or is he doing what sells politically? Does he win support because of his charm, or has he cobbled together a new political coalition based on what works?
\
Balancing act
\
Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at Washington's Brookings Institution, believes a good senator has to keep four questions in mind. They are:
\
* Is he as concerned about general benefits -- helping the poor -- as specific benefits, such as a Seawolf project?
\
* Is he serious about notching accomplishments, or more concerned about appearances?
\
* Is he looking out for the unorganized as much as the organized?
\
* Does he have a clear concept of his role in the Senate?
\
Or, Mann said, ""Does he know what he's about?""
\
Lieberman said he sure does.
\
""The balance we've tried to strike is to appreciate the limits of what government can do,"" but still make government a force for public good, he said. Exhibit A would be programs to ""create incentives for the private sector to do more,"" such as lowering capital gains tax rates, he said.
\
At the same time, Lieberman believes people can win personal and economic security only when institutions like the family or religion remain strong. ""While we can pass a crime bill,"" he said, ""ultimately there's only so much we can do.""
\
What government can do, he believes, is ""try to establish standards itself that express values."" In welfare reform, for example, it should make clear that it disapproves of unwed parents and that there will be no financial gain for having more children out of wedlock, he said.
\
To his backers, such talk is the mantra of the New Democrat, someone who has pulled the party back to the center. ""New Democrats like Joe Lieberman know how to overcome that distrust and make things work,"" said Alvin I. From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, the moderate group that Lieberman has embraced.
\
But others find such talk rhetorical sugarcoating. ""He's figured out a formula to win,"" said David Bositis, senior policy analyst at the Joint Center on Political and Economic Studies, which analyzes black voter trends. ""That has nothing to do with whether he's been a good senator.""
\
Political roots
\
Lieberman's political roots go back to John M. Bailey, the longtime Democratic National Committee and state party chairman -- Lieberman wrote a biography of Bailey -- and the party's '60s-era Kennedy wing.
\
The 52-year-old Stamford native was a Yale University student when President Kennedy became a political hero. ""Democrats believed in a government that was active and doing the things government has to do,"" Lieberman said. At the same time, he admired the way Bailey made the system work.
\
Early in his career, Lieberman's practical side was overshadowed. He gained notice by attaching himself to the Democrats' liberal wing, heading the 1968 Connecticut campaign for Robert F. Kennedy and becoming a top official of the liberal Caucus of Connecticut Democrats.
\
He was against the Vietnam War in 1968, and was against the death penalty. He won a state Senate seat from a New Haven-area district in 1970 as the candidate of change.
\
""He was a young man in a hurry to get somewhere, and he did what it took. Joe needed a constituency,"" recalled Edward L. Marcus. Now the state Democratic chairman and a Lieberman backer, Marcus lost that election to Lieberman.
\
Even then, though, there were signs Lieberman was drifting away from the left. In 1974, for instance, Lieberman said in an interview that his voting record was not that different from that of conservative Democrats.
\
A year later, he said he was ""favorably impressed"" with little- known presidential candidate Jimmy Carter, hardly a liberal favorite, and, in 1980, Connecticut Magazine said Lieberman had ""weathered attacks from liberals over his apparently faded concern for labor and social issues.""
\
Lieberman served in the state Senate for 10 years, the final six as majority leader, and it is hard today to find his views on national affairs. But there were signs of movement to the middle, notably in his push to have school nurses, psychologists and buses used to help parochial school students.
\
He ran for Congress in the New Haven-based 3rd District in 1980 and lost, largely because Carter dragged him down. From 1983 to 1988, Lieberman served as attorney general, a job some call the best in Connecticut politics -- little controversy and cordial media contacts. Lieberman also increased his name recognition with public service messages on radio.
\
Foreign policy was not a concern. For instance, James E. Kennedy, his press secretary, said recently that Lieberman supported the Reagan administration's 1983 Grenada invasion. But Kennedy had no speech or newspaper clipping as evidence.
\
Lieberman himself conceded he has changed. ""I was a young man out of law school, ready to join a reform movement,"" he recalled. ""We were inclined to change things.""
\
In the late 1960s, he was more sympathetic to the rights of the accused, but, as he matured, he found, ""The system was beginning to give more protection to criminals."" He had been against the death penalty; now, in the 1970s, he was for it.
\
What all this meant was that when Lieberman ran for the Senate in 1988, he could comfortably position himself in the center. Conservative Republicans were eager to find someone who could challenge incumbent Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., their liberal-to-moderate nemesis. Lieberman was willing.
\
He won support from members of the traditional Democratic constituencies. And, he won many GOP votes by talking tough on foreign policy and crime.
\
What may have helped most, though, was his personality. Lieberman is one of those politicians who has a way of not only listening intently, but making the speaker believe thathis words are quite important.
\
It's both a strength and a problem. ""It wins him friends,"" said Michael Lewan, Lieberman's former Senate chief of staff, ""but it also makes you more disappointed when you're not on his side."" It's a trait that would help win the election, but cause him problems later.
\
`Wonderful'
\
One of a senator's easiest tasks is to champion noncontroversial causes. Lieberman sits on three major Senate committees -- Armed Services, Environment and Public Works and Governmental Affairs -- as well as the Small Business Committee. He has used those seats to push for tougher environmental protection laws, help the state's defense industry and small businesses and protect consumers.
\
Brock Evans, vice president for national issues at the National Audubon Society, called him ""wonderful,"" while James Leahy, former executive director of the Connecticut Public Interest Research Group and now a Hartford lobbyist, termed him ""fabulous.""
\
Leahy recalled how Lieberman stood up to Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and fought amendments that would have weakened the Clean Air Act in 1990. ""That was gutsy,"" Leahy said. ""He did what he said he would do in the 1988 campaign.""
\
On defense, too, Lieberman got accolades.
\
William Paul, senior vice president/government affairs at United Technologies Corp., found Lieberman crucial to maintaining support for the embattled C-17 transport plane, whose engines are made by Pratt & Whitney, and the Comanche helicopter program. Both are fighting for their government lives, and, so far, have survived.
\
Lieberman used his Governmental Affairs seat as a platform for consumer issues, which were his springboard to higher office when he was attorney general. In the Senate, he led an effort to pressure video game makers to label violent games, kept an eye on how the Nuclear Regulatory Commission handled whistle-blowers' accusations and briefly questioned whether invention marketing companies were helping consumers or simply taking their money.
\
In his public servant role, he has become a hero to some. Karen Forschner of Tolland recalled the day in 1989 when she nervously approached Lieberman in the Senate Dining Room to talk about Lyme disease, then little-known.
\
Forschner, now chairman of the board of directors of the Lyme Disease Foundation in Hartford, had an infected son. She asked Lieberman for help. He gave it.
\
At the time, there was no federal money to fight the disease; in the ensuing years, millions has been approved. ""I represented no political group,"" Firschner said, ""and he didn't say, `Give me some money,' or `Give me a vote.' He just said, `How can I help?' ""
\
No endorsement
\
But on such flash point issues as abortion, higher taxes and gay rights, Lieberman gets something less than raves.
\
The Caucus of Connecticut Democrats, where he was once a top official, is not endorsing him this year. Women's groups are unenthusiastic. Liberals and gay and women's rights groups view him as timid about using his Washington good will and political capital to help push difficult issues.
\
""Connecticut is a very pro-choice state, and for him not to show extraordinary leadership on the floor of the Senate is really unfortunate,"" said Tracey McDougall, executive director of the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund.
\
Abortion rights groups are particularly upset that Lieberman, who has been consistently pro-choice, has backed requiring parental consent before a minor can have an abortion at a clinic getting federal family planning money. In exceptional situations, such as a child with abusive parents, he would waive consent.
\
The senator grows as animated as he gets in response to the complaints.
\
""Some of this was because I followed Lowell Weicker and he was outspoken on those issues,"" Lieberman said. ""You can't lead on everything.""
\
The groups are more puzzled by Lieberman's 1994 vote on a proposal sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to deny federal funds to any school allowing the presentation of material that could be construed as ""supportive of homosexuality.""
\
Gay activists protested outside his office and said the bill would ""threaten the lives of young people across America."" Many were more disappointed in Lieberman than angry.
\
""I've never thought of him as a lost cause,"" said Robin Passariello, a member of the state coalition against the amendment. ""It just doesn't seem he based his vote on any strong political philosophy.""
\
But Lieberman has pleased community members in one respect. Timothy McFeeley, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, one of Washington's leading gay rights groups, said that Lieberman passed its key litmus test when he agreed to co-sponsor legislation prohibiting employment discrimination against gays.
\
""He can be counted on if we set up the vote in a way that makes it seem like it isn't a real test,"" said McFeeley. ""He needs cover.""
\
Lieberman denied needing cover, saying gay rights issues bring two beliefs into conflict -- his desire for tolerance and the idea that ""society should not be promoting the homosexual lifestyle."" The Helms amendment addressed a plan that Lieberman thought ""went over the line.""
\
McFeeley's fund gave Lieberman $2,500. Still, McFeeley, like other gay activists, is not sure he has a friend. ""There's a schizophrenia there,"" he said. ""He's too easily scared by Jesse Helms.""
\
Indecisive?
\
Critics say that schizophrenia is too often present, that Lieberman takes too long to decide and tries to be all things to all people.
\
They point to two incidents, one of them the Thomas matter.
\
When Lieberman initially announced his support of Bush's nomination of Thomas, Anita Hill's accusations of harassment had not yet surfaced publicly. Controversy then concerned matters like Thomas' embrace of natural law principles as a way of justifying a pro-life abortion view.
\
Lieberman, though, said he found ""no hint of natural law as a way of justifying a pro-life abortion view.""
\
As the Hill accusations became public, Lieberman began to rethink his view. Pressure grew. The pro- Hill calls seemed more passionate than the pro-Thomas calls. Bush got Lieberman on his car phone and personally urged him to stick with Thomas.
\
By the afternoon of the vote, more than 1,000 people had called Lieberman's Hartford office and the tally was 70-30 against Thomas. Lieberman spoke to Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., Thomas' most ardent backer, and to the state's Democratic chairman, John F. Droney Jr. Droney had been a Thomas backer; now he was against him.
\
""Women need someone to go into the face of the old-boy network,"" Droney said.
\
By late afternoon, Lieberman was swinging the bat; by evening, he cast his vote against the nominee.
\
Even then, there was controversy. Though he had said he would change his mind, he arrived late for the vote, and, to the public, it looked like he was switching only after Thomas' confirmation was assured.
\
The other series of incidents critics cite when describing Lieberman as indecisive involve a 2 1/2-week period last summer -- which may have shown Lieberman at his most personable and studious, or his most political.
\
It began July 21, when he showed up at a Washington reception for Connecticut Republicans.
\
Later, former Republican U.S. Rep. John G. Rowland, who donated money to Lieberman's campaign and voted for him in 1988, suggested the senator could be the Republican and Democratic choice for the Senate this year. ""There's no way we're going to beat him,"" said Rowland, the GOP gubernatorial nominee.
\
Lieberman said his visit to enemy territory was more innocent than it appeared.
\
""Mike Lewan called and said {state GOP Chairman John} Mastropietro's in town. He said it would be fun,"" Lieberman said. Lewan has raised money for Lieberman and Rowland. The visit was the political talk of Connecticut.
\
""I really didn't think of the media impact,"" Lieberman said.
\
There was impact. At the time, President Clinton was fighting in the Senate to pass his $496 billion deficit reduction package, the cornerstone of his economic recovery package. He needed every Senate vote.
\
Lieberman, the man for all parties, was wavering. He went on Cable News Network and the ""Today"" show to express his agony, but Mastropietro predicted Lieberman would vote with Clinton.
\
Lieberman said he was weighing the bill carefully and trying until the last minute to get Clinton to agree to more enterprise zones and business tax incentives.
\
He got some of it and finally did side with Clinton, who won only because Vice President Al Gore broke a tie vote. Even after the vote, Lieberman had second thoughts, immediately suggesting that one of the measure's most controversial features, applying the higher income tax to the rich retroactively, should be scrapped. Republicans groaned.
\
""He likes to give you the impression he's for you, but he's voting the other way reluctantly,"" said Roger Eddy of Newington, the state's 1986 GOP Senate candidate.
\
In and out of favor
\
Lieberman was an early Clinton supporter in 1992, and his staff quietly fueled speculation Lieberman was a possible choice for vice president. After the election, the senator helped convince Clinton that Hartford lawyer Zoe E. Baird would make a good attorney general.
\
But soon after taking office, said Lewan, Lieberman found ""Clinton blew it.""
\
Baird withdrew her nomination after controversy over her use of household help. Clinton became entangled in a dispute over whether to allow gays in the military, a subject that made Lieberman uncomfortable. Clinton was clearly not a popular president.
\
Lieberman's staff told reporters to watch how the boss would distance himself, and, sure enough, in the spring he made a passionate Senate floor speech to say how disappointed he was over the administration's stance on enterprise zones in distressed cities.
\
The senator was also highly critical of Clinton's $16.3 billion ""economic stimulus"" plan, saying it was too reminiscent of old-style, pork barrel politics.
\
He also broke with Clinton on health care. Instead of favoring universal coverage and employer mandates, Lieberman sided first with a conservative plan favored by insurance interests -- who have given heavily to his campaign. The plan would cover fewer people and require less government involvement.
\
He also joined a ""mainstream"" bipartisan group of senators that tried to find a compromise proposal.
\
The views on health, the stimulus and enterprise zones seemed to continue a pattern of using government to prod, not tax and spend. Lieberman had criticized Weicker in 1988 for backing a big gasoline tax increase, and, in 1991, he sent a letter to the crowd gathered for an anti-state income tax rally at the state Capitol.
\
""You the people have spoken,"" he said, ""and you are right."" Lieberman had voted for the state income tax in 1971, tried to make it more progressive and then joined a group of lawmakers to repeal it.
\
Despite the talk, Lieberman came through for Clinton. On the key 1993 Senate vote to raise income taxes for the wealthy and increase the gasoline tax by 4.3 cents a gallon, Lieberman voted aye.
\
There is no inconsistency to all this, he insisted. ""I believe in a progressive income tax,"" Lieberman said. ""The 1991 state income tax was too rough on the middle class. The 1993 {Clinton} bill made the income tax more progressive.
\
""I don't like to increase the gas tax, and I did work to get it out,"" he said. Overall, though, he thought the taxes helped pay for a much- needed deficit reduction.
\
Lieberman has been with Clinton on other big votes, notably the North American Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 crime bill. In fact, he voted with Clinton 95 percent of the time on key votes last year, says Congressional Quarterly -- a figure topped by only eight other senators.
\
Savvy
\
The ultimate test of a good senator is whether voters endorse him at the polls, and Lieberman has made sure to mold his political fate. Among the steps:
\
* Just days after the 1993 deficit reduction vote, Lieberman moved quickly and deftly to put it behind him. He toured Connecticut and stressed the need for stronger anti- crime legislation.
\
* He raised money early; by the start of the election year he had $2.2 million to spend.
\
* He has remained unusually friendly with reporters. For this story, Kennedy offered the names and telephone numbers of 47 people eager to talk about Lieberman.
\
* Although he did not get the GOP nomination, when the endorsement of A Connecticut Party was offered, he took it, even when many Democrats thought that putting his name on the ballot alongside ACP gubernatorial candidate Eunice S. Groark would hurt the Democratic nominee.
\
Although U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, also D-Conn., who had taken the ACP line in 1992, advised Lieberman to take it, ""He's angered a lot of Democrats,"" said state Sen. Richard J. Balducci, D-Newington.
\
But Marcus -- who predicted a record vote for Lieberman -- and others said the senator is hardly the first Democrat to take the ACP line.
\
Still, the fact is that Lieberman has lots of money, support and friends in the Senate and Connecticut and did not seem to need another boost. If the ultimate test of being a good senator is whether one can coast to victory, Lieberman appears close to passing.
\
But if that test is, as the scholars say, being comfortable enough with yourself and your views to not just represent, but to lead on the issues and for the causes you care deeply about, Lieberman's place in Connecticut and U.S. history is still pending.
\
""For whatever reason, he tries to move like the American people, and the people in Connecticut, move,"" said Lewan. ""He really doesn't want to be beloved, but he does want everyone to vote for him.""

1 Gone Fishing
\
Storm clouds are caucusing in the Litchfield Hills, and the black water of Bantam Lake has begun to spew whitecaps, but the governor of the state of Connecticut could care less.
\
He is being a bonehead today.
\
""Hon, we're drifting,"" Patty says, after he has guided the Nitro bass boat into a secluded corner of the lake, where it bobs in choppy water about 4 feet deep. He nods in agreement -- then hands her a pole and turns up the volume on Country 92.5.
\
Translation: They're going fishing.
\
""Oh man, these worms are really gunked up,"" he says, opening a container he bought this morning at the local grocery store. He is the reason the bait is baked -- he left the worms out in the sun while he mowed the lawn -- but now he will not own up to the offense.
\
""These are shitty worms"" is his gubernatorial assessment. ""Old, shitty worms.""
\
He has been irrepressible since they pulled away from the dock of their log-cabin cottage a half-hour ago and he forgot to re-secure the rope to the buoy, so carried away was he with humming the ""Gilligan's Island"" theme song.
\
""Hon, isn't that little buoy thing supposed to be tied?"" Patty had asked when they were 30 feet out, and she had spotted the buoy drifting free. Sheepishly, he had swung the boat back around.
\
He had proceeded to gun the outboard to 45 mph, which had his wife clinging to the bow to avoid levitation, blond ponytail snapping in the wind, her smile slipping with every bounce. When he slowed down, it was only because he had something to say.
\
""Wanna see the house I want?"" he said, gesturing toward a big Victorian with a wraparound porch, perched on the water. ""You know who owns it? Al Solnit, my commissioner of mental health . . .
\
""I'd guess it would go for -- maybe -- $300,000. Not bad for that location. Bantam Lake hasn't been discovered yet.""
\
Now, fortified by a Diet Coke and blind optimism, he hooks a sliver of bacon to his line, casts, and settles onto a stool rigged to the stern. This is his favorite fishing spot, away from the other boaters, far enough from the nearest house to turn Connecticut's most recognizable public figure into a generic silhouette. He has just begun to detach from Western civilization when Patty repeats:
\
""Hon, we're drifting.""
\
She's right. With the wind picking up, the boat is being swept into a tangle of reeds and lily pads, near the shore. He drops the anchor a few times, but it's puny and won't grip. He squints into the murky water, then up at the slow-moving clouds. The day is still salvageable, he decides. He starts the motor and grins.
\
""We can go out and drift back in,"" he announces, moving the boat out 20 feet and stopping again. ""Drifting's good. There's nothing wrong with drifting, if we drift where we want to be.""
\
It works.
\
For John G. Rowland, it always has.
\
2 Uncharted Course
\
He is in the middle of the Big Drift now.
\
It is not exactly where everyone expected he would be 13 years ago, when the then-30-year-old Republican congressman was pegged by the Wall Street Journal as one of the nation's 10 most promising political stars for the year 2000.
\
Back then, John Rowland was all unbridled youth, smashing Toshiba tape players at the nation's Capitol to protest the Japanese company's sale of submarine technology to the Soviets, and traveling to Vietnam to track down MIAs from a war that had ended before he could vote. He had been the youngest person ever elected to Congress, a two-term state rep who rode into Washington on Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election landslide.
\
Even in his first, unsuccessful run for governor in 1990, he was the upstart who had the moxie to call his opponent, Lowell Weicker, ""the biggest hypocrite in the entire United States Senate,"" and to sell himself to voters as the only candidate ""who's not bullshitting anybody.""
\
But today, at 43, Rowland is no longer hurtling ahead on the full- throttle ambition of youth. Middle age has found him confronting his own limits -- including a recognition that he is not, in fact, one of the top 10 political stars of this year.
\
He's had a good ride, sure. Welfare reform, tax cuts, budget surpluses, rising employment -- Connecticut's economy has been cruising, and he's the guy navigating. The economic surge has had residents quick to forgive his administration's blunders, including a corruption scheme in the treasurer's office that rates as the state's worst financial scandal in 60 years. Also largely forgotten are his own trespasses -- namely, a 1994 domestic dispute between him and his ex-wife.
\
But nationally, much as Rowland enjoyed the early mention of his name as a possible running mate for presidential candidate George W. Bush, he was realistic. Pataki, Engler, Whitman, Ridge -- his fellow moderate Republican governors had bigger ideas, more juice, less baggage.
\
By the time his buddy ""W"" sought his advice at a June fund-raiser at Stamford's Westin Hotel, Rowland knew he wasn't in the mix.
\
""What do you think about VP?"" Bush had asked Rowland in a corridor in the bowels of the hotel, after the two governors were hustled from a $20,000-a-head gathering in one banquet room to a $1,000-a-head event that was about to start.
\
""Ridge is the guy,"" Rowland had said, referring to Tom Ridge, the moderate, pro-choice governor of Pennsylvania, with whom Rowland had struck up a friendship in Congress.
\
""Yeah, I trust Tommy,"" Bush had nodded, listening to the applause building inside. Then, ""What about you?""
\
Rowland smiled. ""Tommy's from a bigger state.""
\
That was that. End of discussion.
\
So now that he knows his place on the national roster, how to proceed? This is Rowland's Y2K dilemma. His close advisors say he's not particularly interested in a third term, which holds the risk that the economy could sour, and isn't driven to run by any compelling agenda. Nor does he want to return to Washington as a legislator, should Joe Lieberman's U.S. Senate seat become available.
\
""You've got to be out of your mind to go from being governor to the Senate,"" he says. ""The rules are so arcane. It's easier to stop something from happening than to make something happen.""
\
Although he doesn't have to decide on a third term until next year, he's already started asking his political friends what they think. Party leaders, concerned about a ""weak bench,"" have been pushing him to seek re-election. They worry that Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell or U.S. Rep. Christopher Shays, the two most likely Republican successors, would have a tough time beating Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim, already emerging as the Democratic front runner.
\
In recent appearances around the state, Rowland has hinted he's leaning against another term. In a speech to the Danbury Chamber of Commerce, he ended with: ""It's been a great run. Two-and-a-half more years to go.""
\
On a visit to the ACMAT Corp. in New Britain, when company chairman and Republican booster Henry Nozko Sr. whispered to him, ""I don't want you to go,"" Rowland answered, ""I'm not going anywhere -- not for two more years.""
\
The nation's youngest governor has begun grappling with his own political mortality, at an age when many people are just getting started in public life.
\
""This is a guy who's never had a game plan,"" said Mary Ann Hanley, a childhood friend of Rowland's and his former legal counsel. ""Right now, I don't think John knows what he wants to do. He's struggling.""
\
She said Rowland had joked with her recently that the two should go into a consulting business together. ""I said, `Forget it. I'll end up doing all the work.'""
\
But the private sector holds one appeal that another term doesn't: Big money. Even with the governor's salary set to rise from $78,000 to $150,000 in 2003, Rowland could make at least twice that as a lobbyist or consultant -- enough to put his three kids through college, and maybe even buy Al Solnit's lakefront house.
\
Rowland suggested he'd be interested in a job in a Bush White House, but insisted he wasn't counting on it.
\
""I haven't been lobbying for anything,"" he said in an interview at the Republican convention in Philadelphia this summer. ""Of course, lobbying isn't the way to do it -- there's a way to do it if you want to have a lock on it. It's not about selling yourself.""
\
He conceded he has a hard decision ahead, but said he's not obsessing over it.
\
""When I was in the (state) Legislature, I never said to myself, `Next, I'm going to run for Congress.' When the opportunity arose to run, that's when I decided. You create your own opportunities . . .
\
""I kind of look at the whole landscape: If Bush wins, does going to Washington make sense? Or does it make sense to stay and do a third term?... This kind of decision ends up 98 percent personal.""
\
Translation: He'll run again if nothing better comes along.
\
3 Finding Religion
\
The irony is, he's wondering if he's done, just when he's gotten started.
\
Since his days in Congress, the rap on Rowland has been that he lacks heartfelt political convictions, a core ideology that guides the way he governs. His critics paint him as a chameleon-like opportunist who morphed from a hard-line Reagan conservative in the 1980s into a Clintonesque moderate in the '90s. His most often-cited about-face was five days before the 1990 gubernatorial election, when the congressman who had voted for years against abortion-rights measures suddenly became pro-choice, voting in favor of federal funding for abortions for poor women.
\
The shimmying to the middle, which Rowland says is simply growing with the times, has continued. After years of refusing to sign a proclamation recognizing ""Gay Pride Month,"" he readily signed a same- sex adoption bill this summer.
\
Rowland has heard the ""chameleon"" rap 1,000 times, from his Democratic challengers in '94 and '98, from the media -- even from his own kids.
\
This is how his 13-year-old son R.J., a self-proclaimed Rush Limbaugh fan, rated his father's political talents over dinner in the governor's residence:
\
""He's boring. He's too politically correct. He says what people want to hear,"" R.J. said, dead serious. Rowland, who was half- listening while he cooked, just rolled his eyes.
\
This year, Rowland proved his kid wrong. For perhaps the first time, the pragmatist displayed a politics of passion that impressed even his rivals. After years of saying he cared about the state's forsaken cities, he finally used his political capital to help them. In the last legislative session, he almost single-handedly drove through $455 million for Adriaen's Landing in Hartford, the downtown development project that many legislators were ready to junk after the New England Patriots pulled out.
\
Hartford is not the only beneficiary of what Rowland has taken to calling his ""command focus"" on the cities. His hometown of Waterbury has received $267 million in bond money, excluding education and transportation, during his 5 1/2 years, while Bridgeport has received $198 million. New Haven has lagged behind with $113 million.
\
All told, the state's six largest cities have received more than $1.4 billion in development aid. That's twice the $705 million funneled to the cities in four years under Weicker, an independent who took office in 1991, and quadruple the $315 million spent under Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Democrat who served for 11 years before that.
\
That Rowland has a ""command focus"" at all is, well, remarkable to some who have followed his meandering. But the energy with which he has embraced the new role of urban champion is startling. He talks about the cities everywhere. Even where he gets no mileage. It's as if, overnight, the agnostic found a religion that works.
\
""I don't know the difference between a Picasso and a paint-by- number, but what I do understand is what makes communities work,"" Rowland preached to a gathering of 70 Fairfield County elite at a private home in Ridgefield. The group -- old money and dot-com millionaires, including the owner of the $3.2 million home -- was celebrating a new performing arts center in town and wasn't particularly interested in urban angst.
\
""If you really want to make people outside Hartford, New Britain or New London care about the cities, you have to bring back life to the cities,"" Rowland said. ""Bridgeport used to have, what, 60 theaters in its heyday. It's a quality of life issue.""
\
After an assembly at a Guilford elementary school at which he had warmly congratulated students on their participation in the ""Do Something"" community-service program, Rowland motioned one of the program's organizers aside on the way to the parking lot.
\
""This place is a lay-up,"" he said. ""You really wanna make a difference? Go to Hartford.""
\
He has taken to telling crowds that they should care about the Hartford schools because ""more young girls become pregnant every year in Hartford than graduate high school."" With suburban audiences, he has even learned to pause while they gasp.
\
Publicly, Rowland has complained about having to get involved in overseeing Hartford's schools and economic development. But the complaints are mostly for show.
\
He is in his glory when Robert Patricelli, chairman of Women's Health USA Inc., brings up the subject of Hartford's ""dysfunctional"" government during a meeting of the state's business leaders. Without a breath, Rowland launches into a diatribe in which he calls local politics ""a minefield"" and the Hartford legislative delegation, with whom he had tussled on Adriaen's Landing, a mess.
\
""The neighborhood groups were easier to work with than the legislative delegation. The Hartford delegation was a disaster, a disaster . . .
\
""We're in deeper than we ever wanted to be. . . . They fight us on everything. . . . The politics in the city are gross. They're gross.""
\
He is so protective of Adriaen's Landing that he convenes weekly meetings on the project in his office. At his desk, reading glasses perched on his nose, he hears out the developers and his team of advisors, then makes the final calls.
\
""I'll make the contacts with ESPN and Lego,"" he says at one such private meeting, at which the project's as-yet-undecided ""attraction"" is discussed. ""I don't want to do just an ESPN Zone, or the beer-and- burgers thing. I want something no one's ever heard of.""
\
At the same meeting, when the developers propose a public relations campaign promoting Hartford, he jumps on the idea. ""It's good, it's good,"" he says, scanning the room of blue suits. ""We make sure there's no expectation -- we just come out of the block . . . It can be quick and dirty.""
\
Although he delegates much of the legwork, he is the strategist. When he learns that only two proposals were received from companies interested in handling the retail-entertainment portion of the project, he tells the developers to set up an interview with the better-known group.
\
""But tell 'em we got so much interest, we can barely squeeze 'em in,"" he says. ""Tell 'em there's 15 companies interested.""
\
Rowland's advisors say his work on Adriaen's Landing has both energized and drained him. The cities were the missing piece of his original agenda, one of the main reasons he sought a second term.
\
""It was a monkey on his back,"" said Craig LeRoy, a former aide to Rowland.
\
""The cities will be his legacy,"" predicted Rell, the lieutenant governor.
\
But just when he's starting to boogie, he's talking as if the dance is done. His advisors concede he has no impassioned agenda for a third term, even in a state with overstuffed prisons, underfed kids and a lousy track record policing the environment.
\
""If I was to go for a third term, the fun thing is, I could spend time looking around at all the buildings we've done at UConn, in Hartford, in New London,"" Rowland said. ""There'll be so much construction going on, you could wander around the state, from one ribbon-cutting to the next.""
\
Into history -- but out of ideas?
\
4 The Game
\
There's a perception that Rowland is skating through the business of governing, that at the end of the average day, he drifts off with a smirk on his face.
\
It's a perception of his own making -- a reluctance to take the job, or himself, too seriously. That the impish Eddie Haskell of ""Leave it to Beaver"" is one of his favorite TV characters is no coincidence; there's a part of Rowland that sees political life as a game, an opportunity to make mischief.
\
Witness his recent appointment of Jeanne Milstein to the high- profile job of child advocate, responsible for policing the state agency that polices child abuse. Some past advocates had been thorns in the administration's side, but now here was Rowland, tapping a feisty crusader for the post. At a press conference announcing his choice, he had praised Milstein's ""independent voice"" and abilities.
\
But five hours later, away from the media herd, he was getting a kick out of himself.
\
""You know Jeanne at all? She's, like, a left-wing communist liberal,"" he said. ""It's great.""
\
Similarly, he had a few good yuks over his appointment of Arthur Spada, a no-nonsense, law-and-order judge, as public safety commissioner. Spada, who is 68, happened to be dressed like a Florida retiree when he and Rowland had a pre-appointment dinner.
\
""I told him, `Art, I can't help you with those troopers if you wear the white bucks and the white belt,' "" a smiling Rowland recounted. ""I know I should be careful, because he's a judge, but I had to warn him.""
\
The irreverent part of Rowland can manage a remarkable degree of detachment, even in a jam. It's as if, while one part of him governs, the other part is sitting back with a cigar, enjoying the show.
\
""They're trying an override of that ban on drinking in state parks,"" Rowland's co-chief of staff, Sid Holbrook, reports to him during the final hours of the legislative session. They are relaxing outside Rowland's office, where legislators and state managers flow in with updates on the action, including word that some House lawmakers are trying to undo the ban by Rowland's environmental protection commissioner.
\
""Good,"" Rowland says of the attempt. ""He shouldn't have done that. This isn't a Gestapo state. It's blue-collar rights.""
\
Rowland has always liked stirring things up, ""throwing people off balance,"" says Hanley, his longtime friend and a staunch Democrat. She should know -- as his legal counsel for his first three years, she was the one getting thrown.
\
He'd rarely stick to his schedule, follow a prepared speech or even run decisions by his top staff. Hanley remembers his calls from the road, checking after-the-fact about something he'd done.
\
""He'd say, `I said this today -- is that all right?' "" she recalled. ""Or he'd be halfway into something and then change his mind. Sometimes he'd just make this sound -- neow, neow, neow -- like he was backpedaling on a bike. It got to where, I'd just pick up the phone and say, `OK, so what did you do now?' ""
\
Attempts to change his ""free-flowing"" style were futile, she said. She remembers asking him whether he wanted her to draw up job descriptions for his appointees. He told her sure, go ahead.
\
""But if I do them, are you going to use them?"" she asked.
\
She knew him well enough to know the answer.
\
""I used to say to him, `You love the chaos,' "" she said.
\
His friends and advisors say Rowland trusts his own political instincts above anyone else's -- a trait that can be hazardous. Three years ago, after state prosecutors cleared a white cop in the shooting death of a black New Haven man, Rowland's aides tried to talk him out of calling for a grand jury probe. One aide recalls reminding Rowland that the victim had a criminal record.
\
""Just because he did something wrong doesn't give the police the right to assassinate him,"" Rowland had shot back. He had gone ahead and called for the probe -- drawing the wrath of police across the state, who accused him of pandering to the minority community.
\
Rowland's favorite part of the game is the end game -- lining up votes for his initiatives, figuring out who's with him, and how to move those who aren't. He prides himself on his ""political read,"" his ability to size someone up, be it a Democratic legislator, a mayor or a member of the public.
\
""It's the challenge,"" he acknowledges. ""My staff will say, `You'll never get this one,' just to goad me. I call my office the `yes' room, because nobody leaves until they say `yes.' ""
\
But if the game still excites him, it's also started to wear. The quips still fly, but at times, they're edged with cynicism. That combination shows up in the book he started writing -- humorous political anecdotes, he says -- which pokes fun at the profession he entered two decades ago. Under the heading, ""what to do in a parade,"" he advises: ""If you hear spontaneous clapping, immediately wave in that direction and assume it's for you.""
\
The cynicism is more pronounced when he talks about the meat-and- potatoes of governing, as he did while waiting in his office for the last legislative session to wrap up.
\
""You know what happens around here? Nothing dramatic really takes place around the legislative cycle,"" he said, characteristically shrugging his shoulders as if his perfectly fitted suit was too tight. ""There's a tendency for everything to move back towards the center. It's still better than not doing anything.""
\
Even with the Adriaen's victory, he ranked the last session behind his first one, in 1995, when he won passage of welfare reform and several crime bills.
\
""I felt best about that one,"" he said, ""because the expectations were low.""
\
Some of the creeping cynicism is a byproduct of a tough 18 months. In April of last year, Patriots' owner Robert Kraft dealt Rowland the most humiliating defeat of his tenure by backing out of the richest football stadium deal in history. To this day, when the subject of why he had trusted Kraft is raised, Rowland's tone turns acerbic.
\
""I always had part of my brain telling me he wasn't committed,"" he says. ""He couched everything he said.""
\
But worse has been the ongoing criminal case involving Rowland's former treasurer, Paul Silvester, who has pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy in connection with investments he made on behalf of the state employee pension fund. Last October, Rowland was dragged into the scandal when The Courant reported that Silvester had told prosecutors he was pressured by several people claiming to be Rowland's intermediaries to invest money with fund managers who promised cash for Rowland's campaign. Rowland has denied any link to the scandal, saying those claiming to be intermediaries had no authority to speak for him.
\
""That (story) took the wind out of his sails all the way until February,"" said one associate, who described Rowland as sullen during that time. ""There was nothing he could do, no way to counter what Silvester was saying . . . We were basically paralyzed, waiting for the other shoe to drop.""
\
In fact, several associates said, getting Adriaen's passed was as much about Rowland's rebounding as it was about Hartford's rebuilding.
\
""Just recovering from Silvester was bigger than Adriaen's Landing,"" one associate said. ""He needed a victory, to restore his credibility.""
\
5 The Lightness of Being
\
It's not just the economy that has allowed Rowland to ride out the rough times with barely a dip in his popularity in public polls.
\
It's his personality.
\
He may lack the dazzling policy know-how of some of his predecessors, but his ability to charm an audience, work a room, put people at ease is uncanny.
\
""He has an effortless public presence,"" says William Curry, a Democrat who ran against Rowland in 1994 and who says he is thinking seriously about running again. ""His strengths are his humor, his instinct and good fortune.""
\
Part of Rowland's charm comes from an ordinary-guy likeability. He worries about his weight. He berates himself for telling the same ""beat-to-death"" stories at functions. He's never bothered to get a gap in his teeth (left front) fixed. He even has an ordinary guy's chip on his shoulder from Patty, his second wife, who might have been his first wife if she had not jilted him in college for an old boyfriend who would become her first husband.
\
""She dumped him for me, then me for him, then him again,"" Rowland says, with Patty nearby. ""How do I know she's done?""
\
Before major speeches, Rowland will insist, ""I need a quote,"" then go rifling through the pages of Mark Twain or Graham Greene. Within his belief that someone else can say it better is the echo of a fourth-grade boy who used to slip out of school during lunch to Mrs. Sexton's house, where he received tutoring for a reading disability.
\
""I had to hide my lunchbox so no one would know,"" he recalled matter-of-factly.
\
Reading troubles aside, he had an ordinary, middle-class upbringing in Waterbury, the oldest of four boys and a girl born to a Yankee father and an Irish mother. Public service was a family tradition: his father and grandfather had served terms as Waterbury's comptroller. In fact, it was his grandfather, Sherwood Rowland, who helped to expose a corruption scheme in the late-1930s that was considered the state's worst financial scandal ever -- a conspiracy by two-dozen Waterbury officials to steal millions in public money.
\
Rowland says his mother, Cerie, still gregarious at 68, had pushed the kids into sports and clubs; his father, Sherwood, who died in January at age 70, was more reserved, a steadying presence. Today, brother Skip runs the family's insurance business in Waterbury; Henry runs an ROTC high-school program in Waterbury; Ned is in the Boston area, setting up computer systems for restaurants; and Marnie is a wine wholesaler outside Providence. Their mother still lives in the same tidy yellow Colonial where Rowland grew up.
\
By his own admission, Rowland wasn't a stellar student, but he managed passing grades through Holy Cross High School, where he was captain of the wrestling team and class president his senior year, and at Villanova, where he ran a fraternity and managed a local campaign. Summers and weekends, he painted houses, mowed lawns, plowed driveways -- an entrepreneur, honing his powers of persuasion.
\
""In college, he used to get all his old teachers to hire him to house paint over the summer. He was a hustler,"" Hanley said. ""He always had a million balls in the air.""
\
Rowland still prides himself on having been the first kid on his block with a snowblower, and later, at 17, a Jeep with a plow. At the first sign of snow, he'd drive out to Watertown and knock on doors in the well-to-do Nova Scotia Hill area. If a family was used to paying $25 for plowing, he'd charge $20. If the car in the driveway looked expensive, he'd go for $25.
\
Today, given a choice, he'd rather be out schmoozing with regular folks than sitting in his office, tangled in a policy debate. He is known for zoning-out during long meetings, drawing airplanes on the back of important documents or simply disappearing into his office bathroom when his boredom meter expires. He will signal his inability to muster enthusiasm for an issue by saying, ""I'm not engaged"" -- the gubernatorial equivalent of ""Whatever.""
\
But invite him to a school awards ceremony, and he will linger an extra hour in the cafeteria, chatting up fifth-graders.
\
""He's an addict for public life,"" says LeRoy, his former aide. ""He genuinely enjoys the everyday give-and-take.""
\
Rowland has a Gumby-like ability to mold his persona to a particular audience without coming off phony, an emollient energy that reassures. When he stops at Western Connecticut State University to work out in the gym after a speech in Danbury, he slips right into frat-boy mode with members of the college's Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter.
\
""Don't let studying get in the way of your education,"" he advises them. ""Hey, am I a great role model or what?""
\
In times of crisis, he has been dignified, mature. He seemed to age a generation when he consoled families of the victims of the shooting at state lottery headquarters -- a shooting in which he lost a friend, Linda Blogoslawski Mlynarczyk.
\
His best quotes have come not from books, but from his gut. Asked once how important approval of Adriaen's Landing was, he replied, ""Windowsill importance. If I didn't get it, I'd jump."" Asked why he had staked his reputation on the risky Patriots deal, he said, ""I didn't run for office to watch the world go by.""
\
For all his years in public office, Rowland has a small circle of very close friends to whom he says he turns for personal advice: John Zick, his high school theology teacher, now a human resources director in Pennsylvania; Joseph Mengacci, a Waterbury lawyer; and Michael Cicchetti, a lawyer who handled Rowland's divorce and other personal matters. He has a wider circle of Waterbury friends, some college buddies that he sees a few times a year, and assorted political pals like lobbyist Jay Malcynsky, a fixture in his office.
\
Rowland relates more to the working-class O'Neill, with whom he gets along, than the uppercrust Weicker, with whom he doesn't. He relishes telling how Weicker's arrogance repelled a host of state troopers who had been assigned to security at the governor's mansion. Rowland has an easy rapport with his troopers, many of them his Waterbury homies.
\
His likeability has helped to shield him from sustained criticism, even for egregious offenses such as the retaliatory firing of Curry's sister in 1995 -- which ended up costing taxpayers $585,000 in damages. He's managed to escape unscathed for failing to carry out his key campaign pledge -- to eliminate the income tax. Democratic lawmakers barely squawked this summer when the treasury-scandal governor vetoed campaign-finance reform.
\
""He's had an easy politics,"" says Curry. ""A burgeoning economy and a compliant legislature have been the keys to his good fortune.""
\
Rowland himself enjoys recounting how Democratic leaders had proclaimed his gas-tax cuts, tax-rebate checks and other proposals ""dead on arrival,"" then caved in and backed them.
\
As Rowland's critics are quick to point out, personality isn't the same as character. They say what's hurt his reputation most are things like patronage hirings and attempts to cover up potential scandals.
\
Rowland pulled out the stops to block release of a Middlebury police report detailing a domestic dispute between him and his former wife, Deborah, a few days after their April 1994 divorce became final and about two years after a breakup that friends describe as contentious. Police have said only that the dispute was nonviolent; Rowland has called it a private matter. Some of those who supported Rowland's efforts to keep the report concealed -- the judge, the Middlebury town attorney and others -- have since benefited from state jobs or promotions.
\
More recently, in 1997, Rowland was linked to a controversy involving military surplus equipment that was given out improperly to his children and members of his staff. He denied knowing anything about the distributions.
\
He's had a string of hiring decisions go bad, from Silvester on down to Vito Santarsiero, a campaign supporter who was forced to quit an environmental-protection job after accusations that he was helping polluters. So far, more than a dozen of his appointees or allies have left their jobs amid controversy.
\
Some Democratic leaders say Rowland has been less accommodating and more clandestine since his 1998 landslide victory over Barbara Kennelly.
\
""This administration can be tough on people who disagree. There's an inability to talk through the pain,"" said Kevin Sullivan, the Democratic president pro tempore of the Senate.
\
While he credited Rowland with picking big-ticket policy issues well, Sullivan said, ""At times, when it comes to sweating the little parts, he doesn't have the patience for it."" Some legislators and administrators say Rowland can be short-tempered and demeaning in private, when things aren't going his way.
\
But in public, Rowland's appealing persona has helped him to distance himself from the misdeeds of his appointees. In an interview at the Philadelphia convention, Rowland, who previously had said he felt betrayed by Silvester, went even further, insisting he never really liked the treasurer with whom he had fund-raised and campaigned.
\
""We had a nickname for him -- `man-boy,' "" he confided, a name he said was meant to convey that Silvester sometimes acted like an investment hotshot, and other times like an 11-year-old boy. ""He was kind of a jerk.""
\
Outside of government, some political experts are astonished by Rowland's resilience.
\
""The amazing thing is how he's almost a Teflon governor,"" said Morton Tenzer, a professor emeritus of political science at UConn. ""He's been connected to the kinds of scandals that could have ruined other governors.""
\
Rowland acknowledges that he has a ""lightness"" of personality -- a trait he says he shares with other politicians of his era, including Bush -- but insists he's not immune to anxiety, struggle, doubt.
\
""The people who think lighthearted means lightheaded,"" he says, frowning, ""they're wrong.""
\
6 Just John
\
There are moments when he is just John, when the veil of the governorship lifts, revealing some semblance of a normal life.
\
It happens when he cracks open a door in the basement of the 19- room Executive Residence on Prospect Avenue and peers in at a heap of cardboard boxes, mattresses and chairs. That's their real life, his and Patty's, the books and beds and dishes they brought with them in the summer of 1995, when they moved into the fully furnished mansion from the house in Woodbury they had shared in the first months after their November marriage.
\
It happens in Domar's restaurant in Waterbury, a local-yokel hangout, where Rowland and Patty have stopped for lunch after a loop through town that had them sentimental for the home-owning, family- business world they once knew. Domar's was the site of their ""second first date,"" after their rekindled high-school romance ended their respective marriages in 1992. Now, in a booth in the back room, away from the bar patrons nursing foamy Buds, they nit-pick and tease and cajole like some normal married couple.
\
"" `Patty Oemcke, we know you're in there. Get out of the car,' "" Rowland is grunting into his open fist. He is imitating the Middlebury cop who had once caught the teenage couple necking in some off-limits spot.
\
""God, John, don't tell that story!"" Patty says, batting his arm. Then, scanning the plates that have been delivered to their table: ""All you want is meat?""
\
""I've got to get my cholesterol down,"" Rowland says.
\
""You didn't tell me that,"" Patty says, eyeing him with concern.
\
""I forgot,"" he says, eyeing her potato salad with longing.
\
It happens when Rowland makes pizza for his two youngest kids, R.J. and Julianne, in the spacious kitchen of the Executive Residence. The kids, both in braces, are perched on stools, eating slices of plain cheese pizza while their father arranges sausage on a thin saucer of dough. He is in jeans, a workshirt and an apron, and he's made enough of a mess that it's a blessing Patty's not around.
\
""Whassup?"" Rowland says, wiggling his hips to get their attention.
\
""I saw you doing that last night, Dad, in the back of the room,"" Julianne, 12 and a violin player, says of her father's antics during a music recital at her school. ""I was trying to ignore you the whole time.""
\
""How's the pizza, boyfriend?"" Rowland turns to his son.
\
""Garbage,"" Robert John says between bites.
\
""Are you taking me to CVS later?"" Julianne wants to know. She wants candy for a field trip her class is taking tomorrow to New Jersey -- a trip Rowland is chaperoning.
\
""Is there candy allowed on the bus?"" he asks.
\
Julianne, an angel-faced pixie, shrugs.
\
""I got caught with gum today,"" she says.
\
""That's an automatic detention,"" R.J. announces.
\
""I didn't let my dough rise long enough,"" Rowland complains.
\
In snippets, in tableaus, at moments, it's a normal, mundane life. Who has a recital tonight, a field trip tomorrow, a field hockey game? Who's here this weekend, and who goes to the ex? Those are the everyday mechanics of the Rowlands' blended family: R.J., Julianne and their older sister, Kirsten, 16, and Patty's two sons, Ryan, 15, and Scott, 13. Her boys, who attend the private Mooreland Hill School in Berlin, spend one night a week and every other weekend with their father; Rowland's kids, who attend public schools in Middlebury and Southbury, have a similar arrangement with him.
\
The perks of the governor's job can make normalcy hard. The kids are usually shuttled between school and the mansion by state troopers; the one time Rowland attempted his own school pickup remains a sore spot with R.J., who says his father blundered by actually getting out of the car to look for him, instead of waiting invisibly like other parents.
\
Even when Rowland goes dirt bike riding with the three boys on trails behind the residence, or takes the kids tubing on Bantam Lake, or spends time at his parents' summer house on Block Island, the troopers usually go with him.
\
Rowland's friends say he has always been part-homebody, part- partyer, but that the tug of family has grown stronger. He'll still hang out for hours over dinner in downtown Hartford with groups that include Chris DePino, a train-conductor-turned-Republican-party- chair, or Mayor Mike Peters, who makes him laugh. His friendships with George W. Bush and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld were forged over late-night card games at governors' association meetings.
\
But the poker table on the third floor of the residence -- his own purchase -- has seen less and less use. He's cut back on weekend appearances, saying he wants that time for his kids and himself. He almost blew off Bush's visit to Stamford because of Julianne's class field trip.
\
Rowland's friends say Patty, who grew up in an upper-middle-class family, has helped to give her husband more ""class"" -- an observation Patty doesn't dispute. She and ""Mama"" Jo McKenzie, a prominent Republican who has been Rowland's chief protector and a key political mentor, have worked on furnishing the mansion with antiques, organizing elegant dinner parties -- and ""polishing John's rough edges,"" in the words of one close friend. Patty, who says she grew up in a ""controlled atmosphere,"" admits she's a perfectionist who sweats the details more than her husband.
\
Those who know Patty say she also has less patience for the grind of public life, and wouldn't mind her husband returning to the private sector, where he had earned $360,000 in 1993 as a consultant to Connecticut defense firms and other companies.
\
But a return would mean the loss of some of the perks that the couple has come to enjoy: the house, the transportation, the mingling with the rich and famous. The trappings are everywhere -- an invitation this summer to a Greenwich millionaire-banker's 40th birthday party that featured Jimmy Buffett, live; freebie trips on private planes to Final Four championships; even the Bantam Lake cottage Rowland bought in 1997, which he found with the help of his economic development advisor, who happened to head the foundation that owned it.
\
For Rowland, there are other people's fates to consider, too -- people whom he has elevated to positions of power. Mengacci is head of the Judicial Selection Commission; Cicchetti is a UConn trustee; Mama Jo pulls down $77,000 a year as director of the Executive Residence. The list -- heavy on Waterbury natives -- is extensive.
\
Even Patty needles the governor about it: When he is asked to list his close friends, she interjects, ""He has half of them working for him.""
\
Rowland says his wife takes the knocks harder than he does -- which is why he came up with what he calls the ""3.2 rule."" He reminds Patty of it when she is bothered by something that someone has said or done.
\
""OK, that's one,"" he'll tell her. ""There are 3.2 million other people in Connecticut who you might want to be friends with.""
\
7 The Drill
\
""Wheels up.""
\
With that, Rowland leads his entourage out of the Republican national convention, just as Dick Cheney's acceptance speech is about to begin. He's had enough hot air in 48 hours; now he wants to head over to the Italian street festival with a few members of his staff, Mama Jo, and his friend John Zick, whom he invited as his guest for the night.
\
It's been an OK convention -- nothing like the nice ride he got four years ago, when he gave a prime-time address and was courted by the national press -- but still, in all, OK. Just tonight, during drinks at the Four Seasons, he'd gotten a call on his cell phone from former President Bush, summoning him to sit with Barbara and the family. He did -- for a few minutes. He's been at this long enough not to kid himself.
\
""They'll be rotating people in and out of there all night.""
\
Now, as his black Cadillac pulls up to a police blockade near the street festival, Rowland smiles as his driver tells the Philly cops who's in the car. He knows the drill: the cops will move aside, the car will be allowed to pass, and there'll be a parking spot marked off for him, right near the main gate.
\
Something makes him laugh out loud. Something Bill O'Neill once confided to him about what he missed most, out of office:
\
""The cones, John. The orange cones.""
\
The one thing a governor can count on.
\
""We're gonna miss this, aren't we, Zick?"" Rowland says as the car glides into a space, and the door is opened. The night sky is starless, threatening rain.
\
""We'll be shlepping,"" Rowland says, hopping onto the sidewalk. ""We'll be shlepping.""

181,"WEST HARTFORD - The mayors of West Hartford and Hartford received recognition last week from the U.S. Conference of Mayors for local work geared toward reducing environmental impact with an eye toward climate protection\West Hartford was honored with the top Mayor's Climate Protection Award in its small towns category for a solar program that offset electricity usage at eight town buildings and schools, officials said.\The program collects solar energy 50 miles away in Thompson and meters virtually against the usage of the buildings. Virtual metering is when subscribers to a community solar energy system, typically off site, receive credit toward their electric bills. For West Hartford, this system is located in Thompson.\Last fiscal year, the project generated 2.8 million kilowatt hours of electricity, reducing carbon emissions by about 2,000 metric tons, officials said.\""In West Hartford, we strive to employ forward thinking and best practices to improve the quality of life for our residents; this includes accelerating the development of locally-based renewable energy,"" said West Hartford Mayor Shari Cantor. ""When we started, 'Virtual Net Metering' was a new concept to us, but we learned quickly about its many benefits and we embraced it. We are saving money, cutting carbon emissions, and hopefully providing a 'best practice' for others in supporting their local climate action.""\The award comes with a $15,000 donation from Walmart to a local sustainability-focused nonprofit. This donation will be presented in January, according to town officials.\Hartford received an honorable mention in the large cities category for work done in the city to address energy justice.\The award recognized the city's development of an office of sustainability in 2017 and further initiatives, including a project to replace street lights with high-efficiency bulbs, creating an energy equity challenge and participating in a solar-for-all campaign meant to increase access to solar energy in the city, officials said.\""We're proud of our work to make Hartford a cleaner, greener, more equitable community, and we know there's a lot more work to do,"" said Mayor Luke Bronin in a statement. ""This recognition is a tribute to our Office of Sustainability and the work they've done to directly involve residents in our climate stewardship work, and to make city government more energy efficient.""\Nicholas Rondinone can be reached at nrondinone@courant.com."
182,"During a summer of heat domes and high temperatures, it's easy to let the sun just get on your nerves. But year-round, the sun can benefit you by pumping energy into your house courtesy of solar panels.\A solar energy array will be one of the costliest projects you can add to your home. However, it has gotten less expensive in recent years, thanks to systems getting more efficient and effective.\On average, a new solar system costs about $25,000, with most falling between $17,000 and $32,000. But it also adds value to your home, makes you more energy-independent, and lowers the need for fossil fuels.\However, solar power isn't just a good idea for the environment - it's also good news for your utility bills. Experts estimate that you can expect to save about $20,000 over the lifetime of the average solar system, and it could be much higher. The exact amount you save depends on your region, how much sun you get, and the cost of energy where you live.\In many cases, your energy system can be tied into the local grid. ""Net metering"" means that any energy you generate beyond what you need for your home is delivered into the system, and you receive an energy credit on your bill. During these periods, your power meter might literally run backwards. This is particularly helpful to very hot and sunny areas. When heat is way up and air conditioners are running high, it eases the load on the grid to have some houses delivering energy back.\Take great care when hiring your solar energy contractor. This job requires balancing many factors, including your home's energy needs, the placement of the panels, how much sunlight hits your region and your local grid.\Solar panels are extremely durable. In most cases, they carry a 25-year warranty. Various types of panels have their own benefits and drawbacks. Your solar pro will be able to explain the different options available to you.\Tax benefits\In addition to lowering energy bills, solar power can make a serious dent in your taxes. The federal government offers a generous Investment Tax Credit to homeowners who install residential solar. You can deduct 26% of the cost of a home solar system from your taxes, provided the unit was installed in 2021 or 2022. The deduction drops to 22% in 2023 and expire in 2024.\Many states, localities and even utility companies offer benefits to install solar power. Ask your solar pro what benefits are available in your area.\Caption: South-facing rooftops are ideal places for residential solar panels. Dreamstime"
183,"The fight over net metering is back.\Anyone who thought legislation passed last year would extinguish controversy over the transition away from that widely used method of compensating solar energy customers for their excess power would have been wrong.\Very wrong.\No fewer than four pieces of legislation — half from Republicans, half from Democrats — have been filed to at least slow down, if not repeal, the process started through Public Act 18-50. That legislation was designed to implement an update to the state’s comprehensive energy strategy and was arguably the most consequential energy legislation since the formation of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) in 2011.\But the part of it that deals with solar programs has had the solar industry, environmental advocates, legislators, business owners, homeowners and others incensed since changes were first proposed in the summer of 2017 as part of the energy strategy. Those changes, while modified from DEEP’s original proposals, very nearly derailed the entire bill and divided environmental advocates last year, some of whom believed the solar provisions were so objectionable, the full legislation should be rejected despite its many other worthy components.\Vowing to re-examine it, opponents have been organizing for months with informational sessions and outreach to the new leadership of the Energy and Technology Committee, many of whom are first-time legislators. Advocates are emboldened by the aggressive energy policies Gov. Ned Lamont laid out during his campaign and inaugural address, and his avowed laser focus on job creation and improving the state’s economy.\The enacted changes in the solar program are being cast as a counter to all of those. Solar adoption would slow and jobs would be lost, advocates say. And an unusual conglomeration of strange bedfellows that includes solar advocates and the utilities agree that — policy differences aside — the time frame set in the legislation to make all the changes really can’t be met.\“It’s worth taking another stab,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, who filed one of the repeal bills. After 10 years as a representative he is now in the Senate and back on the energy committee after a break of several years.\‘I’m particularly unhappy with provisions I saw moving us backward with support for residential solar,” said Lesser, who noted as did others that Connecticut had at one time been a leader in solar policy and had fallen behind neighboring states including Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York.\“The most important thing,” said Rep. Tim Ackert, R-Coventry, “We don’t want to hurt the solar industry.”\But he added, Connecticut shouldn’t overpay to do that. He said part of the reason he supported last year’s legislation was the uncertainty of who the next governor would be. He wanted to get something on the books. Now, he said: “I have no problem with a time out. Let’s reassess this; let’s have a real numbers crunching plan.\“I’m for as much solar as we can do,” Ackert said.\“I’d be willing to listen and look at it,” said Sen. Paul Formica, R-East Lyme, now a ranking member on the committee.\But Rep. David Arconti, D- Danbury, now co-chair of the Energy Committee and in his second term in the legislature, had a caveat.\“I don’t think we can think about a repeal without having something to put in its place,” Arconti said.\Double trouble: policy and timing\Net metering, while nettlesome to some, is a longstanding and widely used energy compensation system that Connecticut has employed for years. Solar customers are paid the retail electric rate for power they sell back to the grid during certain times of the day when they make more than they need. It’s subtracted from the power they buy from the grid when there’s no sunshine - at night or during bad weather.\Nationally, net metering has been fought by utilities for years because they consider it a threat to their business model and bottom line. Most efforts to change it have been beaten back. The most notorious among them - Nevada. That state’s legislature ended net metering retroactively about four years ago, causing major solar companies to pull out of the state and Nevada to lose about one-third of its solar-based jobs before the legislation was reversed two years later.\DEEP in the past has argued, along with the Office of Consumer Counsel, that net metering will push electric rates up and hurt non-solar customers - something often referred to as “cost shift.” Utilities have made that argument as well.\Public Act 18-50 effectively gets rid of net-metering, making Connecticut one of the first blue states to do so, though it would continue for the remainder of the ongoing residential solar incentive program and all existing customers would keep it until 2039.\In place of net-metering consumers would be given two choices, both of which are opposed by environmental advocates. One would be rates - known as tariffs - that would be paid to solar owners for their excess power. The rates, presumably lower than retail rates, and formulas for applying them would be determined by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) — a process that is already underway.\Solar owners could also choose what’s known as a “buy-all/sell-all” system, in which a solar owner would have to sell all of his or her power to the grid at a to-be-determined rate set by PURA, and buy back what he or she needs at the retail rate. Solar owners would wind up paying more in fees than they would have under net metering and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to install battery storage or home-based smart energy systems that help reduce demand.\Complicating all of this is timing.\The Residential Solar Incentive Program (RSIP), developed and run by the Connecticut Green Bank, was designed to run until it produced 300 megawatts of solar power or reached the end of 2022, whichever came first. The program has already installed or approved about 250 megawatts and Bryan Garcia, the Green Bank’s president, estimates it will reach 300 by the end of this October.\But there is basically no way to have new metering approved, let alone implemented by then - even if the various parties weren’t fighting over the program parameters.\The utilities agree.\Because of the complex upgrades needed to physically implement some of the changes PURA is considering, Eversource, which services most of the state, has told PURA it would take “at least 24 months” to complete them. United Illuminating, which is already making changes to its systems, estimates it would take them six to nine months.\The original mandate for RSIP was to lower incentives as it progressed and ensure the sustained orderly development of a local solar industry. Garcia, like others, worries that the RSIP will end in October without a fully fleshed out plan in place and the solar industry, with its 2,000 jobs, could head for the exits.\“If the local industry changes for the worse, then we haven’t effectively implemented the policy,” he said. “The transition from net metering to tariffs needs to ensure local jobs.”\Garcia is not opposed to a tariff, as long as it provides enough of a financial return to make solar systems affordable - especially after the 30 percent federal tax credit on solar projects disappears in 2022. But he said the simplicity of net metering has played a key role in getting people to invest in solar.\“The economic message of what is marketed to homeowners relies on net metering,” he said.\An effort to institute an interim tariff - which would be allowed under the existing legislation - was rejected by PURA in January. Since then, PURA’s chair, Katie Dykes, has left to become DEEP commissioner, leaving only two commissioners and the net metering work incomplete.\Garcia has offered alternatives - supported by both utilities - to PURA. One is to, in essence, continue RSIP after it hits 300 megawatts, but set the incentive level at zero as it only provides about 10 percent of a system’s cost now. But existing net metering would continue until a new plan is in place. The other alternative is to slow down the program by making incentives available only to low income applicants.\“There are too many open questions,” said Ed Davis, director of rates for Eversource. “There are so many moving parts in this legislation.”\But Davis is less keen on starting over since he believes progress has been made.\The legislation also affects the wildly popular commercial solar program, which is run through the utilities. That program is now in its second one-year extension after it was due to run out, which it will now do for a third time later this year.\“Any time you create uncertainty the investment capital goes elsewhere,” said Noel Lafayette, a solar developer who has done several projects in Connecticut, but is beginning to focus more on Massachusetts and New York. “The ongoing issue with Connecticut is we keep doing things for now, keep reacting to whatever politically. There’s no real game plan.”\Now what?\Mary Sotos, DEEP’s deputy commissioner for energy, seemed to back off the department’s earlier insistence in its filings that existing timelines be met and that there was little wiggle room in the goals of the policies passed last year.\She indicated the Lamont administration has been clear about its focus on business opportunity in the sate and wanted to learn more about the issues around the solar compensation dispute. She said that Commissioner-designate Dykes, who once held Sotos’ position, was looking forward to meeting with stakeholders.\“The door’s open,” Sotos said. “We want to understand more specifically their concerns and their visions.”\She did not indicate which, if any, of the various plans to delay or reconsider net metering DEEP would prefer. “We want to make sure we have a sustainable pathway for the solar industry,” she said. “The core framework is still an important starting point to work from.”\And that core - whether net metering should stay or go - still hangs over the question of how the state should proceed. All of which gets back to the issue of cost shifting and whether those without solar actually do subsidize those with it.\A 2017 study by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab that looked at the potential for cost shifting from rooftop solar said if the penetration of such systems is low, any cost shift would be negligible. Penetration of solar in Connecticut is low - about 2 percent.\For regulators, said Galen Barbose, the research scientist who conducted the study, “This is just not going be the most impactful thing to spend their time on if their objective is to keep rates low. There are often other things that are bigger levers to pull.”\Utility capital expenditures, he said, probably have the biggest impact on rates.\He also said that the focus on net metering is “a little bit misplaced. The more fundamental issue in many cases is just the underlying retail rate structure,” he said. “My general sense is that’s a more productive place to focus instead of net metering.\“Thinking about these more fundamental rate design issues is ultimately a more robust way of dealing with cost shifting concerns.”\It’s not clear what, if any, legislative fix will be offered, let alone approved, this session. The Energy Committee meets Tuesday to begin figuring that out.\Solar advocates would like to take the opportunity to start over and craft a policy that takes into account the potential that storage, electrical vehicle charging, and other energy advances will become common and part of any solar configuration.\They would also like to see caps on deployment of other solar programs - such as shared solar - removed. And to put to rest the notion of a cost shift that will raise electric rates, they have long argued that Connecticut needs to conduct what’s called a value of solar study, or at least collect the findings of many studies that have already been done. Those studies assess the benefits of rooftop solar for everyone on the grid: lower greenhouse gas emissions, combating climate change, less wear and tear on the grid’s infrastructure and more.\“Even more clear in the last nine months is that the policy (approved last year) is fatally flawed and this rushed process that it set in motion is also badly flawed. And it’s headed towards badly flawed outcomes,” said Chris Phelps of Environment Connecticut. “Let’s pause that process and urge legislators to come up with a thoughtful policy. There’s no stakeholder who likes this.”\The direction from the Lamont administration has been clear, said Acadia Center Connecticut Director Amy McLean Salls.\“I don’t understand why, in my opinion, we’re regressing back to a place where we are not paying attention to Lamont administration goals,” she said. “We need to be moving forward here and fixing the problem.”\\Credit: By Jan Ellen Spiegel, CTMirror.org"
184,"
Bruce Becker has tried to do the right thing. That may have been his mistake.
\
Becker is the developer of nearly completed 360 State Street, a 32-story, 500-unit apartment building in New Haven. The building, which will contain retail space and enclosed parking for 500 cars, is one of the largest residential buildings ever built in the state.
\
I have been following this project, in part to see if Becker is able to attain his goal of making it one of the state's greenest buildings as well. He's trying to make his the state's first residential building to achieve LEED Platinum Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.
\
The state isn't making it easy.
\
In addition to numerous other energy-saving technologies, Becker hopes to power the building with a 400-kilowatt fuel cell made by UTC Power of South Windsor. He has been promised a $900,000 grant from the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund to cover slightly more than half the cost of the power-generating device.
\
To pay for the rest, and to maintain the fuel cell, Becker in 2007 proposed an arrangement called ""sub-metering,"" meaning the building would have one ""master meter"" for United Illuminating, the local utility, and all the tenants would have individual ""sub meters."" UI would support the project by buying excess power and providing additional power at times of peak demand. Or so the theory went.
\
This is done in New York and other some other states, but has only been allowed in Connecticut in limited areas, such as marinas and campgrounds. Without recounting a complex legal argument, the state Department of Public Utility Control turned him down in late 2008, saying current law didn't allow it.
\
Early last year, Becker met with members of the Clean Energy Fund, who suggested another approach: State law does allow electric co-ops. The statute says in part that ""cooperative, nonprofit, membership corporations may be organized . . . for the purpose of generating electric energy by means of . . . renewable energy resources.""
\
So Becker formed a co-op, the Elm Electrical Cooperative Inc., and went to UI with the hope that they could do business. The utility said, in effect, not unless the DPUC orders us to. So he filed another petition with department, asking that UI be ordered to provide direct retail service to the co-op, that it be eligible for conservation and energy incentive programs, and be able to use ""net metering,"" in which the utility would purchase excess electricity generated by the fuel cell at market rates.
\
Though a DPUC draft report in December favored Becker's position, the final vote of the commission this month was a 2-2 deadlock (the commission is down a member), and so Becker lost again.
\
He plans to appeal the decision, and I hope he does. The plain language of the law seems to be on his side. But what comes through both the draft decision and the hearing is that this is ""novel,"" ""precedential,"" new territory for the DPUC - an area where the agency could use some legislative guidance.
\
In the hearing on the matter, Commissioner Anthony Palermino argued forcefully that the existing laws are too vague and ambiguous; DPUC Chairman Kevin DelGobo argued eloquently that the statutes are clear enough.
\
There are a number of other legal issues involved, but the result is a major and self-defeating contradiction. On the one hand, the state awards subsidies to the fuel cell industry and grants from the clean energy fund to buy fuel cells. But when someone steps forward to actually embrace this technology, state utility regulators run for the hills.
\
Fuel cells are still a new and developing technology, but one that appears to make sense in certain situations such as large food markets or residential buildings. Since a cell generates power by catalysis rather than combustion, it is a clean, nonpolluting power source. On-site power, known as ""distributed generation,"" reduces transmission costs and congestion, and help make the grid more secure.
\
But let's make up our minds. If we believe in fuel cells, let's create a regulatory environment in which it is possible to actually use one. If we don't, it's hard to imagine another developer following Becker's tortured path.

185,"
Judi and Lou Friedman, like other New Englanders, grew weary of
\
this winter's persistently gray skies.
\
But this time around, they had another reason to yearn for the arrival of spring and the brilliant sunshine that comes with it: a $40,000 investment in solar-energy technology.
\
Now when the sun beats down on their ranch house and horse barn off Lawton Road, the photovoltaic panels they planted in part of their vegetable garden last November produce enough electricity to power their 3,200-square-foot house. And sometimes, when few lights and appliances are on, there is power to spare.
\
The excess electricity gets sold to Connecticut Light & Power Co., the power-distribution company, cutting their monthly electric bill considerably.
\
The Friedmans' solar-electricity system, which can make up to 4,400 watts at any given moment on a sunny day, is a far cry from the leaky solar hot-water heaters that back-to-the-land types affixed to their roofs during the energy crunch of the 1970s. These days, as a result of utility deregulation and the specter of California-style power shortages, ultra-advanced photovoltaic electricity is gaining nationwide attention from homeowners and businesses -- including some energy companies.
\
The system in their house is programmed to tap the power from their 40 solar panels first. When the sun is not shining brightly enough to power the entire house, the needed electricity comes from the traditional power lines out at the street.
\
During the winter, the Friedmans bought most of the power they used from their chosen supplier, the Connecticut Energy Cooperative, which offers ""green power"" from water, landfill gas and wind sources. From the end of February through most of March, the Friedmans bought 645 kilowatt hours and sold 206 kilowatt hours, for a net purchase of 439 kilowatt hours. Instead of paying $41.93 for electricity, they paid $28.54.
\
But when the meter was read last week, at the end of a billing period that included stretches of bright, sunny days, CL&P's figures showed a dramatic reduction in the amount of electricity the Friedmans purchased. The couple bought 406 kilowatt hours and sold 201, for a net purchase of 205 kilowatt hours.
\
On average over a year, according to the Friedmans' and CL&P's estimates, the solar-energy system will make just over half the electricity the household uses each day -- about 14 kilowatt hours of the roughly 25 kilowatt hours required for the house, which includes two home offices with personal computers, a TV, radio, refrigerator, dishwasher, and washer and dryer.
\
The time it will take for the system to pay for itself will depend on the price of electricity, which by all accounts is expected to rise when full deregulation arrives in Connecticut and price controls are removed in 2004.
\
The Friedmans, ardent environmentalists and longtime clean-energy advocates, are the first to admit that such a costly investment is not for everyone. A smaller-scale solar-power system, however, might appeal to many homeowners or businesses.
\
As CL&P account executive John Scanlon sees it, the Canton couple's photovoltaic system, the largest such residential setup in the state, ""is a very important project, a leading-edge project,"" which could point the way to someday helping to meet New England's growing demand for electricity. Such systems would not eliminate but could reduce the need for new, traditional power plants that burn fossil fuels.
\
""I relate with them,"" Scanlon said of the Friedmans, ""because I have young daughters 8 and 10 years old, and you want them to have the benefit of having natural beauty. I think to the extent that we can use natural energy, it's going to help preserve the planet.""
\
As prices for electricity rise, as they've already done dramatically in California, solar-electricity systems will ""look better and better,"" said Scanlon, who works out of CL&P's Simsbury office.
\
Commercial buildings, he said, could consider installing such systems to produce a certain portion of the electricity businesses need. ""Maybe 10 percent, for example, then you start purchasing your electricity on top of that,"" Scanlon said. ""This isn't a panacea. But it should be seen as part of the overall solution.""
\
The Friedmans saved for years for the solar-energy system. And while they were saving to buy the photovoltaic panels, which cost about $1,000 apiece (including the wiring to send the electricity to the house), they gradually lowered the amount of electricity they needed in their house.
\
The simplest way they lowered their power demand was to replace traditional lightbulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs. These bulbs cost more up front, but they last longer and use much less electricity than incandescent bulbs. The Friedmans also replaced old appliances, including a washer and dryer, with high-end models that are rated among the most energy-efficient on the market.
\
""We've been saving and planning for years and years to do this. This wasn't easy to afford,"" said Judi Friedman. ""I don't want people to think they can buy an energy cell and all their problems are solved.""
\
The Friedmans, who are in their 60s, view the array of solar panels behind their house as an ""heirloom"" they will leave to their three children and two grandchildren.
\
""You can take a cruise, or buy fancy cars,"" Judi said. ""But this is our legacy.""
\
The system can be dismantled easily and the panels installed elsewhere, either on stanchions, as in the Friedmans' yard, or on a roof.
\
The 40 panels in their yard are mounted eight apiece on five stanchions. Three of the sets move automatically to track the direction of incoming sunlight to maximize the amount of power produced. Two electrical boxes in their barn convert the electricity made by the solar panels from direct current to alternating current - - the kind used in a house.
\
The system, installed by Solar Works of Montpelier, Vt., never could have been set up without help from CL&P and Scanlon, said Lou Friedman. It took months to work out the metering and billing.
\
On the side of the garage are two meters. One meter, purchased by the Friedmans along with the solar-energy system, tallies the electricity produced by the solar panels. The other meter, owned and monitored by CL&P, keeps track of the amount of electricity being purchased by the Friedmans from the power grid and the amount of electricity the Friedmans are selling to the distribution company.
\
Not every state allows this ""net metering,"" but it is allowed in Connecticut. Scanlon said most of the CL&P meters installed at houses in Connecticut can be programmed for this purpose. But if a homeowner wanted to install a solar-electricity system and still had an older- style meter on the house, CL&P would replace it with a new, programmable version, Scanlon said.
\
Zoning was not an issue for the Friedmans, though some solar- energy experts say that homeowners who wanted to install panels in historic districts could face problems.
\
Some states offer tax incentives to spur the use of solar- generated electricity. But Connecticut, which used to offer such tax advantages, does not.
\
""I think it's coming along,"" Scanlon said of solar energy. ""But because we haven't been that concerned about our electric bills, it doesn't get our attention. If we had a big spike up, like they had on the West Coast, it would get attention very fast.""
\
CL&P and People's Action for Clean Energy, a conservation group that Judi Friedman heads, will hold workshops for the public on solar- electricity systems from noon to 4 p.m. May 19 at the Friedmans' house. Those interested can call 860-633-9566 or 860-693-4813.

186,"Connecticut's solar industry and environmental advocates are fiercely lobbying state lawmakers to reverse or at least delay action they took last year changing how consumers are compensated for solar energy generated from rooftop panels.\About three dozen workers in the industry that installs solar panels gathered Wednesday at the Capitol, urging legislation they say will save industry jobs in Connecticut, estimated at more than 2,000. The legislature's clean energy caucus said the state's solar industry faces an ""existential crisis.""\Tim Schneider, co-owner of Earthlight Technologies, an Ellington installer of solar panels that employs 69 workers, said if changes are not made to last year's law, ""I'll be laying off half my crew.""\The 2018 law schedules the termination later this year of net metering, a way residential users are credited for solar energy for electricity they add to the grid.\Ending net metering ""takes the financial incentive off the table,"" said Michael Trahan, executive director of Solar Connecticut Inc., the industry trade group.\In its place would be a system of tariffs, or charges applied by energy providers to customers for electricity use. Connecticut's solar industry, environmental advocates and others say tariffs work in states where solar energy accounts for 10 percent or more of electricity.\In Connecticut, it's about 2 percent, Trahan said.\Stephen Lewis of South Windsor told state lawmakers in written testimony for a recent public hearing that he would not have installed home rooftop solar panels in 2017 without net metering. ""I use my home solar to pay for my already efficient home electric use, to charge my EV for a daily commute and have now charged 17,000 all electric miles, and to help pay for my home heat pump so I do not need to use as much home heating oil,"" he said.\Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport and a member of the legislature's energy and technology committee, said a pause for a couple of years would help policymakers gather more information.\The 2018 law was a ""radical departure, making a rather precipitous lurch,"" he said.\Environment Connecticut State Director Chris Phelps told lawmakers they have the opportunity to change the 2018 law and ""restore policies supporting continued growth of solar power"" in Connecticut.\""Over the past eight years, hundreds of megawatts of solar power have been built statewide,"" he said. ""Solar power, ranging from large grid-connected systems to single homes with rooftop panels, is helping move our state towards a renewable energy future.""\Katie Dykes, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, told lawmakers in written testimony at a recent public hearing that the 2018 law began a transition of Connecticut's on-site energy generation, such as rooftop solar panels, ""to a more market-driven, competitive, cost-effective and transparent framework.""\She said more time may be needed for project developers and financiers to adapt business models to new policies and compensation structures ""and for the electric distribution utilities to adjust and modernize their metering and billing systems.""\""An extension of time should not, however, halt or reverse the progress to date on new tariff development,"" Dykes said.\Patrick McDonnell, vice president of regulatory affairs at UIL Holdings Corp., the parent company of United Illuminating, said the 2018 law is an example of a ""deliberate strategy"" to promote zero-carbon energy.\""While these changes are critical adjustments to the incentive policies that are important to transition renewable energy from a subsidy based offering to one that competes in the competitive energy, there needs to be a smooth transition to accomplish these goals,"" he told lawmakers.\ \Stephen Singer can be reached at ssinger@courant.com.\Credit: By Stephen Singer\Caption: Panels are placed on a solar array installed on the roof of a Bristol church in April 2018.

I've really been trying to do whatever I can to maintain our proud history of farming and agriculture.""\""It's not easy to be a farmer in Connecticut,"" he said.\Kennedy's bill, S.B.999, ""An act establishing a pilot program for the harnessing of cow power in the state of Connecticut,"" has been approved by the Joint Committee on the Environment and is moving to the Senate floor for consideration. It requires the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to create a pilot program for using cow dung to make gas that could feed into gas lines or be burned to make electricity. This process is called anaerobic digestion.\Anaerobic digesters are large metal tanks that use bacteria to convert manure and food waste into fuel, according to Kennedy's office.\The pilot program would place three anaerobic digesters -- think of them as giant composters that turn waste into energy -- on-site at three dairy farms in the state that would be required to use manure as no less than 85 percent of total waste product used by the digester, according to the revised version of the bill. The energy created by the digesters can be sold by participating farmers in the program to the power grid through virtual net metering, according to Kennedy's office.\The bill addresses needs to help farmers deal with waste and generate more revenue, while also addressing pollution problems caused by cow manure, Kennedy said Wednesday. Cow manure can also contribute to green house gasses, he said.\""Anaerobic digestion is such an elegant solution for all of these problems,"" Kennedy said. ""I don't know why we haven't been doing this for years.""\During an interview, Kennedy responded to a question about speculation that he will run for governor.\""I love my job,"" he said, and that he's proud of what he's been able to accomplish so far in the Senate.\He added he didn't know what the future would hold.\The original cow power bill called for anaerobic digesters anywhere in the state -- there is only one in the state, in Southington, and it is not located on a farm -- to use at least 30 percent cow manure in their total operations.\That 30 percent clause could have been problematic because working with green waste can be more economically profitable, said George Krivda, chief of staff and legislative program manager at the state Department of Agriculture.\But the new version of the bill provides a way for dairy farmers to help eliminate, or at least reduce, waste generated on their farms to offset the amount of potential contaminants that may end up in groundwater or flowing into watersheds, Krivda said.\""I don't think farmers look at this as a negative thing at all,"" Krivda said, adding that farmers can choose whether or not to participate in the pilot program and use this method as a way for managing waste on their farms. ""No one is forced to do this.""\While the 30 percent clause has been removed from the bill in its most recent form, Dennis Schain, spokesman for the state Department of Energy and Environment Protection, said the agency still believes there are ways the language of the bill could be improved to make it more beneficial to farmers and state regulators.\""We're hoping to work with legislators to fine tune the language,"" Schain said. ""We support the goal to help increase the number of anaerobic digesters in the state.""\Kennedy also said Wednesday that the bill has received bipartisan support.\Kennedy said in a release this week, ""In addition to becoming a valuable and diversified source of electricity, anaerobic digesters solve many other problems, such as eliminating farm odor, reducing manure-based water pollution, and creating a by-product that is non-toxic and pathogen-free that can be used or sold as animal bedding or fertilizer.\""We need to cut through the red tape, streamlining and simplifying Connecticut's permitting process to accelerate this technology and save our farms,"" he said.\The bill, which passed unanimously through the Joint Committee on the Environment calls for the pilot program to be created no later than July 1, 2018.\Credit: By Anna Bisaro, New Haven Register"
188,"
The thing about solar power is -- it just kind of happens. Nothing moves or whirrs or pings or clinks into place. The panels just sit there. They don't do anything you can really see. And so the biggest problem for the folks whose job it is here in Connecticut to get more people to put solar power in their homes is to figure out a way to dispel the widespread perception that solar doesn't work.
\
""I don't know where it comes from,"" says Kimberly Peterson, project manager for the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund's solar rebate program. ""A lot of people recognize the need to move our energy economy toward something other than what it is, but not a lot of people believe that solar really works. And it does. It's a proven technology. It's very safe. It does produce electricity.""
\
Not only that, the Clean Energy Fund has a lot of money to give away for solar power.
\
Let's make that clear: free money.
\
Which may make this the best time ever to purchase a solar electric system for your home. For most homeowners, the Clean Energy Fund's rebate program -- which has been in place for about 2 1/2 years and is generally considered one of the most generous in the country -- will pick up about half the cost.
\
The funny thing is that -- while the funding program is definitely giving folks that final push to go solar, and on top of that there is the prospect of saving money on electric bills -- money isn't the underlying reason why most folks who have put in solar did so.
\
""You can't look at just saving money,"" says Janice Knudsen of Lebanon, who readily admits she couldn't have afforded to put in a solar system without the rebate. ""It's an investment in a system, but it's also an investment in the health of the planet as well.""
\
That's it in a nutshell, and it's a widespread sentiment. People who have taken the solar plunge also say that it has pushed them to become more energy-efficient across the board.
\
""It has kind of become a game for me, to reduce consumption,"" says Knudsen, who has purchased Energy Star appliances, tries to hang the laundry outside, and switched the light bulbs to compact fluorescents. ""If we can reduce our consumption by a certain amount, I feel like we're doing our part.""
\
Installers -- who, granted, have an economic interest in all this -- also generally go for the philosophical. ""If people are putting solar in, and if the only intention is to save money, they should find an investment vehicle,"" says Bob Chew of SolarWrights, which has been in the solar energy business since 1977. ""It's about a lot more than whether there's a five-year payback or a 15-year payback.""
\
The truth is, it's closer to 15, even with the state picking up half the tab. Ron French of Solar Works, which has been installing solar systems since 1980, says people shouldn't even think in terms of payback. ""It's a fallacy in my mind to try to do that,"" he says.
\
French says that while the technology is more efficient, it is not changing that quickly -- nor is the price. ""A lot of people think it's going to be like a large-screen TV or a computer and it's going to come down in price,"" French says. ""They are down in price because the state pays for half the system.""
\
That said, understanding the solar options available and getting them installed under the state program is still a little daunting. This ought to get you started.
\
Solar Systems
\
The main system we're talking about is solar electricity, also called a photovoltaic system, or PV. The panels capture sunlight and turn it into electricity. It's direct current, so you need a contraption called an inverter to convert the DC to alternating current or AC, which is what you use in your house.
\
There are also thermal solar systems, which use a different kind of solar panel. They use sunlight to power hot water heaters and radiant heating systems -- typically done through the floor on new construction -- but also through existing boilers for old-style steam and hot water radiators.
\
Up On The Roof
\
There are the classic PV panels attached to your roof, but panels can also be on the ground, connected to your home by a cable. They also may be raised on stanchions, which gives them potential to be ""trackers."" Trackers actually move and track the sun all day for greater efficacy, and many can be adjusted manually during the year to better catch the seasonal angle of the sun. Panels range from about 60 watts to 300. A typical system tends to use 220-watt panels.
\
There are also nearly invisible technologies that integrate the panel into the roof. One is a laminate than adheres to a flat surface such as a metal roof panel. It produces about half as much electricity per square foot as a classic panel, but is also about half the cost. Another is roof shingles that are actually solar panels. This technology is more expensive and labor intensive to install.
\
Panels are thought to last 25 to 30 years.
\
The Basics
\
For the most effective system, you need an unobstructed southern exposure that gets good sun from about 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. If it's a roof system, the pitch should be about 35 degrees.
\
Your system, even if it is designed to handle all your electric needs, must be connected to the grid.
\
Free Money
\
The state rebate program is for solar electric only. It uses a complex formula based on the ideal system at your location and then pays up to $5 a watt for the first 5 kilowatts of a system and up to $4.30 for the next 5 kilowatts, with the total rebate capped at $46,500. It tends to work out to about half the cost of a 10- kilowatt or smaller system. The average system so far in Connecticut has been 4.6 kilowatts, the total cost of which is about $40,000; it can handle about half the electrical needs of an average home.
\
The best way to figure out what a system might cost based on your history of electrical usage, how much the Clean Energy Fund rebate is likely to be, how much you are likely to save and how long payback on the system will take is to access the solar estimator at http://findsolar.com/.
\
Costs will vary based on the type of panels and the contractor. To qualify for the rebate, you must use an installer approved by the fund. It is best to get several estimates. The good news is, the fund has done nearly all the legwork in terms of checking out installers. The installers also do the bulk of the paperwork, and the fund pays them directly so you only need to come up with your portion.
\
The feds also have a little bit of free money for your system -- a one-time tax credit, which is capped at $2,000. Legislation to increase the credit is pending, but be warned -- if the credit goes up, Connecticut is likely to shrink the rebate program.
\
Not everyone in Connecticut is eligible for the rebate. The Clean Energy Fund is financed by a surcharge on all Connecticut Light and Power and United Illuminating bills. There are a few communities with municipal power companies and their customers do not pay the surcharge, and therefore are not eligible for the solar program. Those ineligible communities are Norwich, Bozrah and Wallingford plus parts of Groton, Lebanon, North Branford and Norwalk.
\
Sorting Out The Savings
\
When the sun is shining, the odds are your solar system will make more electricity than you need. During that time you will actually feed electricity into the grid, and your electric meter will run backward. At night and during cloudy weather you take electricity from the grid.
\
You pay for the difference between what you take and what you give -- this is called net-metering.

The Knudsen Family
\
Janice and John Knudsen; four family members. Janice Knudsen says the house was built with energy efficiency in mind, including passive solar and all the plumbing for solar hot water, which they couldn't afford at the time. While researching solar hot water last year, she stumbled across the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund rebate program. Until then, she never realized solar power could be used in a home.
\
Location: Lebanon
\
House size: 2,600 square feet
\
Built: 1996 (garage/barn built 1997)
\
Solar system: Electric
\
Installed: 2007
\
Size: 5.16 kilowatts, 24 panels
\
Portion of electricity use: Estimated at 42 percent
\
Cost: $47,500
\
Rebate: Just under 50%
\
Savings: Unknown
\
Motivation: ""Solar is something I've had an interest in since the last energy crisis,"" Janice Knudsen says, but the rebate program was the incentive. ""If we had to come up with the entire money ourselves, I'm not sure we would have done it."" Now, it's a little bit of both saving money and saving the planet.
\
Aha! moment: Discovering that the system still generated 1 kilowatt hour during a snow storm and even during the April 15 nor'easter. ""Somehow we've always made 1 kilowatt hour - not zero - even on a cloudy day. I just figured if the sun doesn't shine, you're not making electricity. When it was first hooked up I must have run downstairs 10 times a day. 'Here comes a big cloud, what's going to happen now?'.""
\
Why did I do this? moment: None
\
Take a tip: For people who are considering solar: ""Don't just rule it out if the numbers scare them initially. My understanding is you don't need to have a huge system - even half a system could still be affordable and worth it. The way I look at it, it's an investment - the way you invest in mutual funds, except you pre-pay your power bill for 12 to 14 years.""
\
The Johnson Family
\
Architect Kate Briggs Johnson and Martin Johnson; four family members. Briggs Johnson designed the home not only with solar power, heat and hot water, but also with a number of other environmentally friendly building materials and considerations. The goal was to be ""reasonably solar and reasonably green,"" not a fanatic. ""I felt it was really important to cast my vote for an esthetically pleasing system. I'd like to see solar on roofs - the same way you'd expect to see a solar cell on calculators.""
\
Location: Norfolk

\
Portion of electricity use: Estimated at approximately 50 percent Cost: Not available
\
Rebate: About 50 percent
\
Savings: Unknown
\
Motivation: ""The very act of being in the building industry is something that has a substantial impact on the environment. If you're going to make an impact on the environment, you should make as responsible an impact as possible.""
\
Aha! moment: ""The thing that is really important is to first understand the whole. You've got to look at all your systems - mechanical and electrical as a whole system, not individual systems. Look at siting, energy needs, function - as a holistic assessment. And look at how to work solar and energy efficiency strategies into your life.""
\
Why did I do this? moment: ""I've been in the construction world long enough to know that stuff always goes wrong, so I'm sort of immune from it. If you focus on what's wrong, you'll get paralyzed.""
\
Take a tip: For new construction, contact a solar installer first to help set up an optimal system as you design the house. ""Put your seatbelt on - it's a bumpy ride. In terms of embarking on any construction project, be very realistic about what it is you're going into.""
\
The Friedman Family
\
Judi and Lou Friedman. Judi chairs People's Action for Clean Energy and has been involved with the group since its founding in 1974 when a factory near her home got her interested in air pollution. As for solar energy, ""Connecticut really is a very solar- friendly state with a lot of sunshine. People don't think about that. ..... I'm very excited about being eco-chic. When something becomes chic that's really important, it's kind of fun.""
\
Location: Canton
\
House size: 3,000 square feet including office
\
Built: 1961
\
Solar systems: Solar hot water installed 1976, the second system in the state - still working. Solar irrigation installed 25 years ago. Solar circulating pump in ornamental pond installed 15 years ago. Solar electric fencing for garden installed 20 years ago. Solar electric tracker array on four stanchions (three 8-panel arrays move, one 16-panel array is stationary).
\
Installed: 2000
\
Size: 4.4 kilowatts
\
Portion of electricity use: 80 percent
\
Cost: $40,000
\
Rebate: Installed before program
\
Savings: Haven't calculated it.
\
Motivation: Even though the Friedmans knew it would be a financial sacrifice, they thought it would be a legacy to their children. ""We felt very strongly that this was something we needed to do, needed to say from a moral point of view. If you're concerned about the environment, you must do something positive.""
\
Aha! moment: ""Any fool, any technological idiot such as I am can do it. You don't have to think, it just happens.""
\
Why did I do this? moment: They had a problem with one of their inverters - which meant extra cost. Inverters had tended to be the weakest link in the system, but they are much less problematic now. In any event, Judi Friedman says, ""Be ready for problems.""
\
Take a tip: It's really important that people don't think this is a panacea. The first thing the need to do is reduce demand. They need to look at usage. It's the cheapest, fastest, least polluting, best thing to do. People forget this; they just want the easy answers.""

He's purchased two Toyota Prius hybrid cars for his family. ""There's a lot of those more outrageous things you can do, but you have to change your life to do them,"" he says, referring to people doing things like making their own bio-diesel fuels. ""Solar or driving a Prius - you don't have to change your life, you just put them on your roof. It's such a low key intrusion into your life."" Location: Chester

Savings: In 2005, purchased 8,058 kilowatt-hours for a total bill of $1,157.31. In 2006, first full year using solar energy, purchased 4,271 kilowatt-hours and sold 3,397 kilowatt-hours for a total bill of $366.95. Motivation: ""Part of it was for our children, part of it was for us because we try to practice conservation, the kids because they're into the environment. It's helping to push technology along a little bit. It's fun to be on the leading edge. Would we have done it if there was no rebate? Probably not.""
\
Aha! moment: Seeing what a reach his solar panels have had in his town. ""One is the interest that people in town have - there's a whole sustainable mentality going on now in Chester ..... because of what we had done.
\
""Part of the 'aha' is seeing how people perceive it, how positively it's perceived, how many people have looked at it: 'you have solar panels; is it cool?' It's cool, and they sit and listen to your whole story."" Why did I do this? moment: When one of the installers almost fell off a third-floor roof (he didn't).
\
Take a tip: ""I would say, just do it - if it's worth it. There are a lot of different things you can do - solar panels aren't the only thing. If you have a shady lot, maybe you can't do anything with solar, but you can do something.""

189,"At the Climate Change Forum hosted by the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club held at Trinity College this month, only one candidate displayed the depth of the understanding of the issues and the passion for the future of our state that I can support; Ned Lamont.\Interestingly, none of the Republican gubernatorial candidates even showed up. The three other candidates who did participate, clearly lacked a solid background in the issues of energy, conservation, and economics. Ned, by contrast, laid out a vision for our state that combines revitalized “livable” cities, clean energy, green jobs, with the preservation of our state’s beautiful historic sites and natural landscapes, from its forests and farmlands to the salt marshes along Long Island Sound.\With respect to energy, Connecticut is already ahead of the curve, and has done a great job in shifting from the dirtiest fossil fuels (i.e. coal, fuel oil) to a greater dependency on natural gas. While natural gas is cheaper, more efficient, and cleaner to burn, a good portion now comes from fracking operations. Ned pitched his idea of speeding up our transition to renewable fuels (wind, solar, hydroelectric), supporting local micro-grids, installing fairer net metering, and undertaking these efforts and more in a way that drives down customer costs. Home energy conservation, a regional confederation for renewable energy, lower utility rates based on performance instead of capital outlays, are all examples of how he proposes to do this.\Ned Lamont, unlike any other candidate, also made a point of professing his love for the historical sites and beautiful natural landscapes that characterize our state. Under his watch, he pledges to ensure that the funds the state has long dedicated to historic site restorations, open space purchases, and protecting our environment will be restored. Our state parks would remain open and their maintenance funded, and the state’s Department of Energy & Environment would be fully funded to the level necessary to do its job; regulating the cleanliness and safety of our air, water and soils, and protecting our state’s greatest assets; its people and natural resources.\Finally, and most compellingly, Ned has talked of the idea of “livable cities,” an outgrowth of decades of work by the Brookings Institute, Bloomberg Foundation and others. His idea is to focus on Connecticut’s urban areas — from New London to Stamford and up to Hartford — and modeled on best practices elsewhere, build partnerships and wisely invest in them so as to make them cleaner, more attractive, and even more vibrant. In strengthening their resiliency, adding mass transit, urban parks, renewable energy, and supporting their neighborhoods and cultural vibrancy; these cities will be competitive with San Antonio, Seattle, Pittsburgh and others, to which millennials and others now flock.\Ned painted a picture of retaining services, re-imagining government, energy, mass-transit, and growing our way out of the state’s current debt crisis. He also embraced the beauty and history of our state like no other candidate, while staying focused on the critical need of bringing more jobs to the state. Ned articulated the idea of leveraging the strength of the state’s people and natural assets, combined with a drive toward innovation and partnerships, to not only get Connecticut back on track, but to firmly put it on a better path to the future. He has my vote on Aug. 14.\\\Credit: By Alexander Brash"
190,"When Chris Lenda began putting solar panels on people's roofs in the early 1990s to make electricity, he had the Connecticut market - such as it was - all to himself. Photovoltaic systems were extremely expensive and there were no state or federal incentives. Lenda is an electrical contractor who, decades ago, did the occasional solar job for well-heeled homeowners.\Times sure have changed. Today, his Branford firm, Aegis Solar Energy, employs 15 people and does about 200 solar jobs a year. He has lots of competition, too. Among the 94 contractors eligible to offer financial incentives through the Connecticut Green Bank is SolarCity, whose CEO is Elon Musk. It recently merged with Tesla, the billionaire's electric car company, and operates in 20 states.\The Green Bank's list of statewide solar projects dating to March 2012 includes 6,876 installed by SolarCity, which employs more than 300 people here and some 14,000 nationwide, according to a company spokesperson. It entered the Connecticut market in 2012 and has opened two offices, as well as a warehouse in Rocky Hill and a training facility in Hartford.\Chris Lenda estimated that SolarCity has captured more than half of the state's residential solar market - which is decidedly bullish of late. More than 50 percent of the 22,742 Connecticut homes sporting solar panels - a total obtained from Eversource and United Illuminating - have come online in the past two years.\""It started really ramping up after 2013,"" said David Ferrante, a spokesman for Eversource. ""There were about 3,000 [solar homes] added in 2014 to our customer base, and 6,000 or so in 2015 and another 6,000 in 2016. We expect that same level to continue for the next few years."" What accounts for this solar power surge is a growing market nationwide: more companies installing more systems have brought prices down-while Connecticut electric rates are among the highest in the country, making solar even more attractive here.\""The cost of solar systems has come down 70 percent in the past decade,"" Lenda said. ""Regardless if your monthly electric bill is $100 or $300, the economics of doing solar here are going to be exactly the same. What we are typically seeing is anywhere from a six- to nine-year payback on your investment.""\After that, it's all gravy, since solar systems have a 30- to 40-year lifespan. A typical 5.7 KW photovoltaic system installed by Aegis on a three- bedroom, solar-suitable home would cost $21,790, with the homeowner paying only $13,487 after state and federal incentives are factored in ($2,523 and $5,780 respectively). The proposal estimates a nine-year payback and cumulative savings over 25 years of $50,520 (based on an anticipated 3.8 percent annual utility rate inflation).\This plan was predicated on increased household energy use to accommodate air conditioning and to charge an electric car that would travel 10,000 miles a year (the payback didn't factor in savings on gasoline). A smaller proposal simply to meet current electrical usage (3,850 kWh a year) would cost $8,747 after incentives. Studies also have documented that houses with solar panels are worth more and sell faster than comparable properties.\Homeowners also can lease a system or enter into a ""power purchase agreement"" with a third party (often the installer) and still save on their monthly electric bill (when homeowners don't own the systems, they don't benefit from state and federal incentives). In recent years, nearly three-quarters of Connecticut residents going solar have opted for these ""no-money- up-front"" approaches, according to statistics compiled by the Green Bank. A lease has a fixed monthly payment, while under a power purchase agreement the homeowner pays the system owner based on monthly energy usage.\Because of the convergence of declining costs, installation options and ongoing incentives, the next few years are prime for Connecticut residents who want to go solar. The state subsidy has dropped in recent years and will decline further, but the larger 30 percent federal tax credit is available through 2019. It then will go down and disappear altogether for residential systems after 2021.\Residential solar users still pay a monthly fee, currently $19.25, to the power company, which tracks generation and usage through ""net metering."" System owners who produce more electricity than they use receive a credit on their utility bill, and after a year can request reimbursement for any excess at the going wholesale rate.\Solar panels clearly are hot in Connecticut and nationwide (the industry now employs more than twice as many people as coal mining), and its potential is vast, according to David Desiderato, who is the Share the Sun Campaign Manager for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. ""About a quarter to a third of the electricity we use in Connecticut could come from small rooftop solar systems alone,"" he said. ""If you include the potential from large commercial roofs and government and utility-scale projects, we could generate as much as half of our power from the sun.""\Desiderato said about 200,000 of the state's roughly 800,000 residential housing units are candidates for solar power: They are occupant- owned and suitably situated. So far, roughly one in 10 of these eligible houses have panels. He added that all the photovoltaic systems in the state combined currently generate only about 1 percent of Connecticut's electrical usage.\Asked what he would say to a homeowner considering solar panels, Desiderato said, ""Do it, absolutely do it. Solar is great for the environment. Your electric bill goes down. The value of your house goes up. Your property taxes don't go up because there is an exemption on that. And you're creating jobs in Connecticut.""\Credit: By DAVID HOLAHAN"
191,"Connecticut's faltering solar industry took another hit this month with the imposition of new tariffs on solar panels made outside of the United States.\The new 30 percent duties on most foreign-made panels were announced by President Donald Trump a couple of weeks ago, over the objections of the national solar trade group, in an attempt to help American manufacturers compete with cheaper imports.\While solar businesses and advocates say the tariffs will cost jobs and renewable energy projects across the country, they may also dampen a market already shaken by a proposed update to Connecticut's Comprehensive Energy Strategy.\""The need is to grow the solar market in Connecticut and deploy solar at a faster rate,"" said William Dornbos, advocacy director and senior attorney of the Acadia Center. ""The draft energy strategy in combination with the federal solar tariff are almost exactly the wrong set of things for doing that. Certainly, they're going to throw up barriers.""\The Acadia Center, Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Clean Water Action and other groups oppose portions of the state's update, which they say will weaken efforts to reduce emissions and kill solar jobs.\The draft plan, which is being finalized over the next few weeks, would limit the combined power generated by rooftop home solar installations and eliminate net metering, the process homeowners use to sell excess solar power to utilities, says Dornbos.\Now, as local solar businesses await the final update, they're also raising their prices and scaling back plans for growth to survive the new tariffs on foreign-made parts, which account for about 80 percent of solar panels used by American companies, according to The Solar Energy Industries Association.\The research firm Wood Mackenzie, formerly Green Tech Media Research, now estimates that Connecticut will install just 749 megawatts of solar energy between 2018 and 2022, down from 857 megawatts without the tariffs - a 13 percent reduction.\Rebecca Waldo, who co-owns Waldo Renewable Electric in Old Saybrook with her husband, says she expects to lose potential customers in the coming months.\""As much as I want it to be about saving the planet and lowering emissions, it's really about the price and what financial benefits there are by going solar,"" she said. ""Increasing the bottom line is going to make it financially less attractive to customers.""\The tariffs will raise project costs by about $0.10 per watt, or $100,000 per megawatt, a hike that could quash efforts to put solar panels on large commercial properties or build new solar farms.\Business leaders like Vivint Solar CEO David Bywater, whose company has a location in North Haven, tried to fight the tariffs by testifying last month before the U.S. Trade Representative. Bywater called the duties ""a direct attack on American workers"" and would ""hold the country's energy future hostage.""\Now that the tariffs have been enforced, Vivint Solar and Connecticut's other 186 solar companies are trying to move forward.\""It's a phenomenon that will impact everybody across the United States,"" said Stanley Chin, president and CEO of Greenskies, a Middletown renewable energy company sold in December to California-based Clean Focus. ""When you're talking even one or two cents more per watt per panel, it can make or break the project.""\Connecticut's solar boom is relatively recent, and the state's industry ranks 18th nationally, an improvement from 21st in 2016, according to SEIA. The trade group credits that success to the Connecticut Green Bank, which helps finance renewable energy projects for homes, businesses and municipalities. The state also boasts nearly $1.2 billion in solar investment and 2,100 solar jobs, most of them in installation, development, distribution and other non-manufacturing work, like financing, engineering and legal support.\But the new tariffs are forcing executives like Chin to hold off on growth. Hiring is off the table for his 40-person team in Middletown, he said.\""It definitely has an impact on our bottom line,"" Chin said.\Still, he and other business leaders said the industry should be able to absorb the blow of higher panel costs, particularly in the Northeast, where people are motivated by concern for the environment and high electricity costs.\In 2015, Connecticut had the second highest average electric costs in the country, after Hawaii, at about 17 cents per watt, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\Those factors will still exist when the tariffs expire in four years, said Mike Perna, marketing vice president of Con Edison Solutions, which owns Ross Solar in Danbury. That's why the company isn't changing its plans to grow in 2018.\""It may slow us down but we'll recover quickly,"" Perna said. ""I think the industry will survive this. It should be more of a bump in the road than hitting a wall.""\An increase in cost by a cent per watt won't offset the huge price reductions that have occurred over the last few years, said Anne Hoskins, chief policy officer of California-based SunRun, a residential solar company that opened its Hartford location in 2015. \In Connecticut, solar costs have fallen 55 percent since 2013, according to SEIA.\But Hoskins argues that the market should decide prices, not a government agency or the president.\""Why shouldn't [customers] get the benefit of the lower cost of technology and efficiency we've all been working on?"" she said. The tariff is ""just an artificial constraint that we don't think will increase manufacturing jobs but will have an impact on the access to solar across the country.""\If anything, the new tax has some solar local companies soured on domestic-made products from companies like First Solar, a Tempe, Ariz.-based manufacturer that supported the tariff.\Mickey Toro, owner of C-Tec Solar of Bloomfield, said he isn't sure he'll continue offering First Solar's panels, which - like all American-made panels - are too expensive for most customers. And even First Solar produces the vast majority of its parts in Malaysia, though it makes a type of panel that's exempt from the new tariffs.\Toro raised his prices for installation a few months ago in anticipation of the new tariffs. He said it's caused a small slowdown in business, and, like others in the industry, he's disappointed in the Trump administration's decision, which he called a ""misguided"" attempt to save a few hundred manufacturing positions at the expense of hundreds of thousands of other jobs.\""I don't think they understood it or cared to. The tariffs, they're not good for anybody,"" Toro said. ""But overall, we'll survive.""\Credit: By REBECCA LURYE - rlurye@courant.com"

Residents joined clean-energy advocates and environmentalists in criticizing a proposal to lease a portion of the town's undeveloped business park to Pentagon Energy LLC for use as an infusion station, where trucks carrying compressed natural gas would discharge into the Algonquin pipeline.
\
""This proposal feels like a lump of coal in Rocky Hill's Christmas stocking,"" said resident Christa Mariner, who like other residents Monday night questioned the impact the additional truck traffic would have on the roadway network connecting I-91 with the industrial park located off Old Forge Road. ""My advice: Find a new location ... how about New Jersey?""
\
Pentagon Energy is seeking to lease 3.7 acres in the southeastern corner of the 61-acre park, located along the Cromwell town line.
\
When operational, the facility would generate $250,000 a year in lease payments, property taxes and tipping facilities. Perhaps more importantly, Pentagon Energy would construct a 2,700-foot paved access road into the property. Such an asset would allow further development of the park.
\
But the potential traffic impact, and the threat of a gas explosion or traffic accident worried several residents who spoke during the second night of a town council public hearing on the proposal.
\
""If someone falls asleep at the wheel, you've spent your $250,000,"" said Antonia Palazzolo of George Road.
\
""I ask you not to sell our ... quality of life to get that access road,"" said Jaclyn Farnham, who lives near the truck route.
\
Pentagon Energy proposes constructing four bays to service trucks transporting from the Marcellus shale fields in Pennsylvania. Two to four trucks per hour would discharge into the pipeline.
\
Deliveries would run continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week from November through March, when the facility would be in operation.
\
The additional truck traffic ""will not have an adverse impact operating through the corridor,"" said Kevin M Solli, of Solli Engineering of Monroe, which did the traffic study for the proposal.
\
The proposal also drew criticism from a handful of representatives of the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club, 350CT.org and other environmental groups who briefly picketed outside town hall prior to the hearing. Their main beef was that the fracking boom has allowed Spectra Energy -- the owner of the Algonquin pipeline -- to expand the use of fossil fuels, to the detriment of the environment and the consumer.
\
Ben Martin, a Wallingford resident representing 350Ct.org, told council members that the Pentagon Energy plan goes against sound public policy to increase clean-energy sources. ""This is a bad idea and I would urge you to look to expand renewable energy in this area,"" he said.
\
The council previously had agreed to lease 16 acres to SolarCity Corp. to develop a solar farm, where the power generated would be sold to the town at a discounted rate.
\
The farm, which could be serviced by the Pentagon Energy access road, awaits approval into the state's net metering program.
\
The council took no action on the ordnance but postponed the lease proposal for further study.

193,"The July 8 New Haven Register article about the Millstone nuclear power plant threatening to shut down once again shows the short-sighted energy policies of the state of Connecticut and particularly of Gov. Dannel Malloy.\Isn’t it bad enough that millions of rate-payer dollars are being used to subsidize expansion of natural gas lines with no guarantees those companies will sell that gas in Connecticut or that their prices won’t be drastically hiked. You can’t whine about the budget while you blow millions.\This is happening while the state budget is a catastrophe and legislators in their “wisdom” ripped off further millions from the clean energy and efficiency funds specifically set aside to help rate payers save energy and lower costs, a questionable move that is being challenged in court.\It looks like Millstone and its owner Dominion are trying to blackmail the state with threats of closure, crying economic hardship and demanding subsidies. They have engineered a farce with the help of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, state Rep. Lonnie Reed and other legislators and the governor that would allow them to pretend they produce clean energy and therefore apply for zero carbon electric contracts (though DEEP is trying to delay the contracts until after 2023).\DEEP has a mandate to protect the environment and consumer costs. To ignore the tons of highly dangerous spent fuel rods that must be stored for hundreds of years as a potential environmental disaster and enormous cost to rate payers is delusional. Who else will end up paying for this cost? Rate payers have been paying costs for years for the same kind of past boondoggles here in Connecticut.\Malloy has talked the talk about clean energy and lower rates but still to date there has not been one really large-scale investment in true renewable energy whether it be wind or solar. In fact, a critical community solar bill was sideswiped by the last legislative session, replaced by a mediocre bill promoted by the governor which will actually heavily damage the growing solar industry in Connecticut by killing net metering and thousands of jobs. All we can say is shame on the governor , shame on DEEP and shame on Lonnie Reed for being an enabler in the Energy and Technology Committee of this policy farce.\Once again, it is up to rate payers to demand an end to the Dominion shakedown: No subsidies for a company that won’t even open its books to the state. We must demand return of our energy and efficiency funds.\Lastly, we must demand that our state stop spending millions on polluting nuclear power plants and from buying natural gas from companies in other states that use dangerous fracking technologies that threaten the Algonquin Aquifer, the most important water supply of the Northeast.\Instead, Connecticut should take the lead and spend those millions on large-scale solar and wind projects. How about having the guts to create 1000 megawatts of true clean energy projects, passing a real community solar bill so clean energy can actually reach the thousands of urban and rural residents longing for a brighter and less polluted future. These are the issues to set before all the aspiring candidates for our next governor.\Who will take up this challenge?\\\Credit: By Frank Panzarella"

The state's energy department released a final version of its study recommending changes to how Connecticut supports clean energy Friday after weeks of public debate on the plan that initially blazed a wide path for large-scale hydropower to be included in the state's portfolio of renewables.
\
In the final version of the study -- and pending legislation that mirrors it -- big hydropower, like Hydro-Quebec, is relegated to being a contingency source of power rather than a primary one.
\
The state could count the large, cost-competitive source of energy toward its clean energy goals if developers of renewable energy fail to build enough wind, solar and other projects to keep up with Connecticut's goals.
\
""This study proposes a strategic and thoughtful approach that allows us to reap many benefits from increasing the availability of renewable power,"" energy commissioner Daniel C. Esty said in a written statement.
\
Many expressed deep concerns about how state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection officials seemed to rush passage of a bill that was based on the draft study, trying to pass it before a monthlong comment period finished. In response, legislators slowed the process, and the department's commissioner said the legislation would not be voted on before the study is completed.
\
The energy department received more than 75 comments on the study, which ""led to some key changes from the draft to the final version,"" Esty said. ""These refinements help guarantee the integrity of our commitment to clean energy under the RPS and would set us on a path toward meeting Connecticut's clean energy goals in the most effective and cost-efficient manner,"" he said.
\
The initial concerns about process were echoed, though, on Friday as the final study practically mirrored points outlined in an amended clean energy bill that legislators released earlier this week. Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, said the timeline makes him wonder exactly how the energy department processed public input on the study.
\
""It leads me to question what type of study and review was given to this,"" he said.
\
Dolan said the approach to large hydropower -- his association's main problem with the study and legislation -- hadn't changed enough. ""It doesn't solve the issue we had with [the bill]. It just dressed it up a little bit.""
\
The final study and pending bill also change tack on landfill gas and biomass as a source of clean energy. Instead of ratcheting down emissions standards, the plan calls for a phase-out in subsidies for those energy sources
\
The last major change relates to the initial study's extension of goals -- from 20 percent of the state's energy from certain clean sources by 2020 -- to 25 percent by 2025. The final study keeps the 2020 recommendation.
\
Other key recommendations: include anaerobic digesters, biologically-derived methane and small hydropower projects to Class I renewables; allow the state to enter into long-term clean energy contracts; end subsidies to utility-run conservation projects that are already ratepayer funded; and refund payments to ratepayers that energy companies pay when they fall short on energy goals.

\
The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is proposing broad changes for the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard.
\
DEEP Commissioner Dan Esty said restructuring the portfolio will give the state more flexibility to make renewable power a larger share of the energy mix while helping reduce electricity costs.
\
It will also ensure that the state's energy policy is focused ""on new and innovative renewable technology, not legacy projects that no longer make sense.""
\
Esty said the current renewable portfolio strategy, which is 15 years old, focuses on what he called ""outdated"" technologies like bio-mass facilities and using landfill gas to produce power. And most of the projects were outside Connecticut as well, he said.
\
""Our new RPS strategy focuses on innovative approaches that minimize costs for electric ratepayers, while bringing us the benefits of cleaner air, a more diverse and reliable power supply and support for in-state projects that grow our economy and create jobs right here in our state,"" Esty said.
\
""Renewable energy needs to begin to be able to compete in the marketplace with fewer subsidies. We're looking to spend our money wisely in such a way that will create new jobs in Connecticut while at the same time lowering the cost of electricity.""
\
Esty said only 11 percent of Connecticut's renewable energy portfolio came from in-state projects in 2010. That amount is now 15 percent, he said.
\
The president of Environment Northeast, a Maine-based regional organization with offices in Connecticut, said the restructuring is a bad idea.
\
ENE's Daniel Sosland said the legislation in which the restructuring is included -- Proposed Substitute Bill 1138 -- would eliminate support for existing energy efficiency programs.
\
""While we continue to analyze this legislation, we are concerned by what appears to be a weakening of the RPS that allows fully commercialized, large-scale hydropower to receive special treatment through a new 'contracted tier' preference,"" Sosland said in a prepared statement.
\
""Large scale hydropower is already commercially viable and does not need additional market and ratepayer support,"" he said.
\
Esty said Sosalnd's comments ""miss the mark"" and show a misunderstanding of how Connecticut's portfolio works. Esty said what would be eliminated is an interim revenue source that was needed to replenish money for energy efficiency projects after two previous GOP administrations raided those funds.
\
DEEP officials say a key change being proposed is to increase targets for state use of solar, wind and other types of renewable energy, including some kinds of hydropower.
\
DEEP is recommending the portfolio's share of so-called Class I renewable energy types go from the current 20 percent required by 2020 to 25 percent by 2025.
\
The changes DEEP is proposing also would allow the state to run a competitive bid process to buy a portion of the renewable portfolio -- 7.5 percent by 2025 -- to meet this target.
\
The aim is to bring down the overall ratepayer cost of meeting the portfolio's goals while preserving support for renewable development in Connecticut and across the region, Esty said.
\
William Dombros, ENE's Connecticut director, said that element of DEEP's proposal allows large-scale hydro projects in the portfolio through the purchasing mechanism.
\
Esty said Canadian hydropower providers would be free to compete in the process, but there is no guarantee they would be the winning bidders.

197,"Connecticut's future is in clean, renewable energy. Building a lower-cost, consumer-friendly energy system to confront climate change will require replacing coal, oil and natural gas with clean energy.\Existing nuclear plants like Millstone Power Station may play a role in that transition, but Connecticut needs a realistic, long-term plan to replace the plant -- which will retire eventually -- with clean energy. We also need real clarity on the full cost of any special deal, which would not be Millstone's first.\Over the past two decades, Connecticut consumers have provided hundreds of millions of dollars to keep Millstone running.\Joining nuclear plant owners in other states, Millstone's owners now seek more support from Connecticut ratepayers as wholesale energy prices have fallen, putting pressure on nuclear's competitiveness.\The debate around Millstone's alleged financial difficulties -- notably unproven at this time -- has obscured the real question that the General Assembly should be addressing: how should Connecticut best prepare for the plant's replacement?\In this context, it is important to recognize that wind, solar, and other clean energy resources are increasingly competitive.\Costs for solar have dropped by over 60 percent in the last seven years alone, and solar now supports more jobs than coal, oil and natural gas combined.\Solar is competitive locally, evidenced by the results of a recent clean energy procurement, where for the first time solar edged out other resources to win two-thirds of contracts awarded by Connecticut, providing capacity equivalent to a medium-sized power plant.\Offshore wind also holds great promise for Connecticut. Designated federal lease areas off New England and New York's coasts provide steady winds, shallow water, and proximity to major demand centers.\Rhode Island just built the nation's first offshore wind farm, and Massachusetts and New York are racing to compete for a share of the tens of thousands of jobs and billions of investment dollars that the offshore wind industry promises.\Major players are responding to these signals.\This summer, Eversource, one of the region's largest utilities, will partner with a major Danish company to bid for contracts to develop areas off Massachusetts' south coast.\And the developer of Rhode Island's project, Deepwater Wind, just won a head-to-head bidding process with natural gas to meet energy needs on Long Island with offshore wind and energy storage.\With the right plan, Connecticut can secure its portion of offshore wind's future, breathing new economic life into struggling shoreline communities and giving local manufacturers a shot at producing the diverse components of massive new offshore wind turbines.\The Millstone replacement plan should center on increasing the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to require 50 percent electricity supply from clean sources by 2030. Under current law, the RPS plateaus at 20 percent in 2020, and an increase to 50 percent makes progress toward replacing the electricity supply Millstone currently provides, with five years to spare before the plant's first operating license expires in 2035.\Legislation should also enable construction over several years of at least 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind (similar to the amount that Massachusetts committed to in legislation last year) and set targets for enabling energy storage, which can help balance intermittent renewables to provide around-the-clock ""baseload"" capacity.\The bill released recently, Senate Bill 106, tries for a transition, but it does not offer sufficient competition for Millstone's special bid (the region's other nuclear power plant, Seabrook Station, is written out of eligibility, for instance), includes renewable energy targets that are too low, does not support offshore wind, and would not take full advantage of energy storage technologies.\Energy efficiency has also been left out.\Every other state confronting the viability of nuclear plants has developed long-term clean energy replacement plans that rely on diverse, modern resources.\California will replace the state's last nuclear reactors with energy efficiency, renewables, and energy storage.\In Illinois, nuclear support mechanisms are paired with significant commitments to energy efficiency, wind and solar.\Closer to home, New York agreed to support upstate nuclear power plants, but only as part of a broader plan to source 50 percent of electricity supply from renewables by 2030.\Planning for Connecticut's energy future makes sense, but favoring one uncompetitive technology at the expense of clean energy does not.\A clean energy replacement strategy for Millstone Power Station is the best way forward for Connecticut's consumers and environment.\Bill Dornbos is the Connecticut director and senior attorney of the Acadia Center.\Credit: By Bill Dornbos"
198,"
If your New Year's resolutions included turning off the lights more often, that's good. Contrary to what you might have expected, electric rates for Eversource customers have jumped.
\
An average household will pay almost 14 percent more than it paid in the second half of 2015, for a total of just under $150 a month -- up from $132.
\
How can this be? Aren't oil and gas prices collapsing? Didn't Eversource just announce a few weeks ago that electric generation rates were going down?
\
""Eversource is delivering welcome savings to its customers,"" a press release said, touting newly approved prices ""that are 24 percent lower than last winter's historic highs.""
\
Ah, but that was for only the generation portion of the bill, not the entire bill, and it compared generation rates from one year ago, not the last six months. That information was on your bill, if you read it carefully.
\
Rates are, in fact, lower than they were in the first half of last year. But they're higher than what we've been paying since July 1, and that's what we're going to feel when the bills come due.
\
Generation rates, the biggest portion of the bill, are at $9.60 per 100 kilowatt hours, up from $8.20. They were at a whopping $12.63 one year ago, before oil prices slid dramatically.
\
That generation increase accounts for more than half the price jump for the start of 2016. The rest of the increases, buried in your bill, all allowed after a close review by state regulators, include: a delayed recuperation of taxes by Eversource, a new formula for regulating Eversource revenues and, lest we forget, all those system improvements we've been hearing about since the storms of 2011 and 2012.
\
So you're now paying $17.99 for every 100 kilowatt hours, up from $15.52 in the second half of 2015. That's down from $19.37 between Jan. 1 and June 30 of last year, when the rate was higher than it had been in years.
\
All those juice charges are on top of a monthly charge of $19.25 per residential customer; average usage is 725 kilowatt hours.
\
The bad news is that we're still one of the most expensive metro areas in the country for electricity. But Eversource's Connecticut electricity business, formerly the Connecticut Light & Power unit of Northeast Utilities, doesn't make more money as a result of higher or lower prices.
\
For generation, the company buys power contracts on the open market and passes those costs to customers who use Eversource as a supplier. And the same is true for most of the charges on the electric bill -- Eversource is basically passing along costs that have been deemed allowable or required, including charges for conservation and renewable energy.
\
""We don't like that any more than our customers do,"" Edward Davis, director of rates for Eversource Energy, said of the overall increase. ""We try to manage every one of those elements of service.""
\
For customers who use a separate generation supplier, these generation rates don't apply. They might be higher or lower, depending on the deals customers reach. Over the past year, we've seen many that were higher because of fees and because declines from lower oil and gas prices didn't reach customers.
\
The state tightened the rules on those so-called market-rate suppliers, requiring, for example, that variable rates remain in effect for at least four months.
\
But the Eversource rate for default customers -- about half of all households -- is a gauge of how much most of Connecticut pays.
\
Eversource and state regulators want us to think about year-over-year prices, not the changes every six months. On that score, the average customer is seeing a decrease of about 6.5 percent compared with one year ago.
\
""What you've got to look at is January to January and July to July because it goes go up a lot in the wintertime,"" said Art House, chairman of the state Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. In general, he added, ""the trend has been going down.""
\
Looking at the generation rate, the obvious question is why it isn't declining further at a time when global oil prices are at dangerously low levels. Two reasons: long-term contracts and a shortage of pipeline capacity for natural gas.
\
The long-term contracts that Eversource signs with power producers ensure supply, but tend to flatten out any short-term changes, up or down. That's in contrast to the way we buy gasoline.
\
""When you and I go to the pump, it's the daily price,"" Davis said.
\
The pipeline issue, a matter of controversy as New England governors work to increase capacity, basically means this part of the country can't participate in price declines, because we can't push enough natural gas through the funnel. And natural gas is the main fuel for electricity plants.
\
The good news is that generation rates are likely to drop again in July if the pattern of recent years holds true. ""Obviously I don't have a crystal ball,"" Davis said, but he added, ""I would expect the same kind of cycle there.""
\
The $19.25 monthly charge, which rose from $16 at the end of 2014, removes some of the benefits from households that use very little electricity. As the flat charge goes up, the less juice you use, the more you pay per kilowatt hour.
\
Looking at the details of the bill, transmission charges, the cost of wheeling power over long distances, are now $2.58 per 100 kilowatt hours, slightly lower than the second half of 2015 -- but much higher than the average of the last five years. That reflects recent improvements.
\
A ""system benefit charge"" is up slightly in the new year, to 58 cents, from 34 cents, reflecting post-storm work. And something called the ""federally mandated congestion charge,"" which fluctuates widely, is up by 71 cents in the new year, to 88 cents.
\
The basic charge for distribution of electricity, $3.47 per 100 KwH, isn't changing much but that portion of the bill includes two new surcharges totaling 12 cents of your 100 kilowatt hour charge. One of them, so-called revenue decoupling, was triggered when Eversource revenues fell below a set dollar amount.
\
Add it up and there you have it: an upward spike in what we hope is a long-term, downward trend. Not a great New Year's gift, but better than what we've seen in earlier eras.
