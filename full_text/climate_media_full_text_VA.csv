0,"One of the things that made the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970, stand out is that it cut across political lines. On that day Republicans and Democrats both spoke out on the need to confront major environmental problems.\In today's political environment that may seem foreign.\But remember that the Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act and the legislation that dealt with acid rain were signed into law by Republican presidents and enjoyed widespread support in both parties.\The fact that this should not be forgotten underscores an important point ---- no meaningful environmental legislation will get passed unless it has the support of both political parties.\Right now we see this playing out in the battle to enact meaningful climate-change legislation. Once an issue confined to the Democratic left, climate change is now in the mainstream of American politics. This change has been driven by rising extremes in weather including prolonged heat waves, record droughts, rising sea levels and the threat of stronger storms.\But now that climate change is on magazine covers and being debated by presidential candidates the question is: What kind of policy both Republicans and Democrats will support?\A cap-and-trade system is the answer. The policy both cuts the carbon pollution that causes climate change and creates new opportunities for workers and businesses.\The cap-and-trade system has a history of bipartisan support. The first President Bush used this system to combat acid rain by reducing sulfur-dioxide emissions, which are a primary cause of acid rain. Although there was initial skepticism, the program met its pollution level goals quicker than expected and for a quarter of the original estimated cost.\Fortunately bipartisan leaders are coming forward to combat climate change. A coalition lead by Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., are co-sponsoring America's Climate Security Act, which would create a national cap-and-trade system. If Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., supports the measure, it will truly show bipartisan support from our Virginia leaders in Washington.\In addition to combating global warming, the cap-and-trade program can create new economic opportunities. The cap would create demand for new sources of energy that don't give off large amounts of carbon pollution. Companies here in Virginia would respond to this demand, and the profits that come with it, by producing clean energy sources like biodiesel, ethanol and solar power. This would create high-tech, high-wage jobs for Virginia's workers.\Looking at the cap-and-trade system you get a cleaner environment and new jobs, without increasing taxes or more government spending and bureaucracy. That sounds like something that we can all support.\Coady is the field director for the Virginia Climate Initiative ( www.vaclimate.org), a coalition of Virginia citizens and businesses working to protect the state's natural heritage."
1,"The Democratic Party, particularly its liberal wing, is doing a lot of talking these days. What isn't clear is that they're listening. They seem to have missed what the nation has been saying.\Before the new Congress convened, you didn't see people rallying at the Capitol calling for cap-and-trade legislation. You didn't see marchers in front of the White House demanding wholesale health-care reform.\If Democratic leaders had inclined their ear to the conversations Americans are having around their kitchen tables and break rooms, if they could tune in to the worries that gnaw at people in the middle of the night, what they'd hear, to paraphrase Bill Clinton's mantra, is ""It's the jobs, stupid."" Which isn't actually to impugn anybody's intelligence, only to observe that the drums the Democratic congressional majority is beating are out of sync with Americans' concerns. And will actually make them worse.\Americans are worried about hanging on to their jobs. With good reason: About 6.7 million jobs have disappeared in this recession, and economists expect that employment will be the laggard in this recovery.\But the signature initiatives of the Democrats' agenda will further undermine the jobs situation.\Those initiatives include the continued bailout of financial firms begun under the Bush administration, plus rescue plans for automakers - the latter swelled by ""cash for clunkers."" They poured $787 billion into economic stimulus spending, much of it going to federal, state and local governments, protecting these jobs, even adding to their numbers.\But the trillions of dollars to pay for this will come from taxpayers, present and future. And more money going to taxes means less money for discretionary spending. That means less to buy the goods and services produced by the companies that employ the Americans who are worried about their jobs.\By protecting the jobs of government, financial and automotive workers, the Democrats' rescue plan is undermining jobs in other corners of the economy.\The public is figuring that out. According to a new USA Today/Gallup poll, most Americans worry that stimulus money is being wasted, and they're more likely to think the stimulus will make their own financial situation worse than that it will make it better.\The drivers behind health-care reform seem not to have picked up on the fact that most Americans are pretty satisfied with their coverage. Their worries tend to be about specific problems with our system, such as coverage of pre-existing conditions, sick people losing insurance and the cost of insurance and care. But instead of targeting those problems, the Democrats would clear the health-care landscape and replace it with an approach that will increase the cost to taxpayers, businesses and those who pay for insurance.\There are other things on Americans' minds, of course. They're worried about our continued involvement in war, but you can watch a lot of CSPAN without seeing evidence that it's much on Congress' mind. They're concerned about the environment, but the only aspect of that to capture Congress' attention is the cap-and-trade approach to reducing global warming.\And they are definitely worried about deficit spending and the national debt. But the policies of the administration and Congress will only make those worse.\When a majority of American voters chose ""Change we can believe in,"" they weren't believing in wholesale and expensive overhauls of systems they don't think are broken, or in a rising tide of debt that will put a chokehold on their future and that of their children."
2,"WASHINGTON -- John McCain heads to the Pacific Northwest today to propose a climate-change plan, addressing an issue integral to his presidential bid in a region that could be crucial. \The Arizona senator, who often cites climate change as a policy difference with President Bush, plans to renew support for a ""cap-and-trade"" system that ""sets clear limits on all greenhouse gases, while also allowing the sale of rights to excess emissions,"" according to excerpts of his speech released Sunday. \McCain is scheduled to speak at a wind power facility in Portland, Ore. ""The facts of global warming demand our urgent attention, especially in Washington,"" McCain says in the prepared remarks. \McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate, plans to propose a series of goals for reduction of carbon emissions, ending at 60% below 1990 levels by the year 2050. \A cap-and-trade system would ""change the dynamic of our energy economy,"" McCain says in the prepared remarks. It would encourage industry to adopt or develop cleaner forms of energy, such as wind, solar, nuclear and ""clean coal."" \After a day in Oregon, McCain also is scheduled to discuss the environment Tuesday in Washington state. Those states are among those ""being discussed as target states"" for the fall campaign, said Tucker Bounds, a McCain campaign spokesman. \A native of Oregon, Bounds said voters there like politicians who work with members of the other party. ""They tend to be more independent, much more in the framework of John McCain,"" he said. \The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, is challenging McCain's credentials as an environmentalist. It developed a list of McCain supporters who have lobbied for oil companies or run companies that have been cited for pollution. DNC Chairman Howard Dean said in a statement that McCain would ""appoint right-wing judges bent on gutting environmental regulations."" \As a senator, McCain has long backed cap-and-trade legislation. The idea is that companies that exceed emissions caps could buy credits from those that pollute less, giving them time to develop cleaner technologies without cutting production. \Bush has warned that government-imposed restrictions would hurt the U.S. economy. The administration has sponsored meetings among the world's major polluters to work out voluntary plans to reduce heat-trapping emissions. \During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, McCain talked about his differences with the Bush administration, citing climate change along with increases in federal spending and ""the failed strategy that was employed in the war in Iraq."" Democrats have repeatedly tried to link McCain to the unpopular Republican president. \Bush and McCain do agree on some environmental and energy items. Both support the increased use of nuclear power. Both also say any global climate-change agreement should include China and India, major polluters as well as international economic competitors. \In the prepared remarks, McCain says that if China and India refuse to participate in an international solution to global warming, he would work with other governments to impose some sort of ""cost equalization mechanism"" on those nations. \Environmental organizations said McCain deserves credit for his cap-and-trade proposals, but some called them inadequate in face of the threats posed by global warming. One group, the League of Conservation Voters, said McCain has a congressional career score of 24% on environmental issues. In a statement, Gene Karpinski, the group's president, said it appears that McCain ""hopes to use global warming and the environment to distance himself from the Bush administration,"" but given McCain's record, ""that distance can be measured in inches."""
3,"Reasonable people can disagree about how bad global warming will eventually be if nothing is done, and some of the doomsday scenarios might well be overblown. But virtually all climate scientists concur that it's a dire enough threat that the wise course of action is to sharply curb use of carbon-based fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. \Ideally, that would happen without raising costs to consumers or causing some job loss, but that's a little like saying it would be nice to go to heaven without doing what's necessary to get there. Solar, wind, nuclear and virtually all lower-emission energy alternatives will cost more, at least initially. The only sure way to move from traditional fuels to a greener mix anytime soon is to begin making it more expensive to continue on the current path and let the market work out the most effective way to do it. \The simplest solution would be a gradually rising tax on carbon-based fuels. In the real world, however, that is a political non-starter, and any tax would inevitably become complex after Congress got done writing in exemptions and discounts for various groups. Further, a tax wouldn't set a hard limit on greenhouse gas emissions. \That leaves the ""cap-and-trade"" approach pending on Capitol Hill. \There are plenty of reasons to dislike cap-and-trade. It's complex, intrusive and would cost money and jobs. But if the threat of human-induced global warming is real, and the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence suggests that it is, this plan or something like it is probably the best tool the political system can produce to begin to counter it. \Cap-and-trade gets its name from the way it would work: Cap greenhouse gas emissions; sell or give away permits for emissions that are allowed; and have utilities, factories and other emitters trade those permits in a special market. A utility, for example, could either fix its plant to emit less greenhouse gases or buy permits from some other business to keep emitting a higher amount. Over time, the cap would get tighter and the permits more expensive. \It's complicated, but it works. Europe's cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases, in place since 2005, has helped cut emissions 5% below 1990 levels, and reductions are on track to more than double by 2012. Closer to home, the U.S. began battling acid rain in 1990 with a cap-and-trade regime for sulfur dioxide, which combines with water vapor in the atmosphere to produce sulfuric acid. That plan worked better than even its supporters hoped, slashing emissions at far less cost than projected. \To combat climate change and promote clean energy, the House passed a cap-and-trade bill in June on a 219-212 vote that demonstrated how controversial the measure is. The Senate is waiting to take it up sometime after health care, and it won't be easy. Every Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee boycotted the session when the panel approved a bill this month. \The House plan certainly needs improvement. It is stuffed with favors for well-connected lobbies, a distasteful reminder of Congress' inability to focus sharply on the national interest. And critics claim consumer costs would be in the range of $3,000 or $4,000 a year per household. But the neutral, non-partisan Congressional Budget Office paints a more manageable picture. \CBO's analysis of the House bill forecasts an average net cost per household of $175 a year, with the lowest-income households receiving $40 a year in benefits and the highest-income households paying $245. CBO projects that job loss could be ""significant"" in industries tied to traditional fuels but would be offset by new jobs elsewhere. That all seems an acceptable price compared with the potential consequences of global warming -- melting ice caps, rising sea levels, droughts and wildfires, shifting agricultural patterns and political instability. \Perhaps the most potent arguments against cap-and-trade are that unilateral U.S. action wouldn't be enough to reverse global warming, and that it would be self-destructive for the U.S. to act without ensuring that rapidly growing greenhouse gas polluters, such as China and India, also limit emissions. \Taken together, though, these criticisms amount to an argument for doing nothing, which is simply not an option after years of official U.S. indifference. When world leaders gather next month in Copenhagen to try to set a framework for international action, they'll be looking to the U.S. for direction. \It's true that if the U.S. acts, there's no guarantee others will go along. But it's a virtual certainty that if the U.S. doesn't lead, then no one else is likely to follow."

Cap-and-trade system will give us energy to keep us safe and growing
\
To the Editor:
\
Everyone knows that our economy has hit a rough patch. But it is important to remember that over the years our economy has weathered many storms and been able to grow and diversify at an astonishing rate. This growth has created new products and raised the standard of living for millions of people around the world.
\
But for our economy to grow over the long term we need a steady and stable supply of energy. The progress we have worked so hard to achieve could be permanently lost if we do not develop a solid plan for our nation's energy security.
\
Generally, when someone refers to energy, there is a good chance they are talking about oil. The cars we drive to work, the trucks that transport goods across the country and other big pieces of our economy depend on oil. As we have seen in recent months, these are all costing more as gas prices sky rocket. If OPEC raises oil prices even more, our economy will be hit by even worse inflation and energy shortages.
\
In addition to its rising costs, oil carries serious national security risks. We depend on unstable regions and regimes, like Venezuela and the Middle East, to continue selling us oil which complicates diplomatic efforts
\
Using too much oil also threatens the environment. Burning oil releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. CO2 is the most abundant of the primary greenhouse gases, and because of its profusion, it has the greatest environmental impact. Scientists warn that if we allow this to continue, extreme weather conditions like long droughts, rising sea levels, and stronger hurricanes will become more common.
\
The current energy situation may seem dire, but there are ways to ensure future energy and economic stability while taking steps to protect the earth against climate change.
\
If Congress wants to address these problems, the best thing they can do is pass legislation that cuts the carbon pollution that comes from burning oil and frees the market to pick the best way to do it.
\
This system would encourage businesses to innovate and create economic opportunities, while making us less dependent on foreign oil.
\
Under this new cap, companies would be rewarded for shifting away from fuels like oil, which give off high levels of greenhouse gases, to cleaner energy sources including wind power, biodiesel, and ethanol. Power producers will be encouraged to run more efficient facilities, which will lower electricity prices.
\
An increased demand for energy efficiency would spur businesses to cater to the new market by developing new, energy efficient products, creating new manufacturing jobs in Virginia and across the country.
\
When businesses use less oil, because of a combination of using energy efficient technology and cleaner fuels, we will no longer have to send billions of dollars over to the Middle East and other unstable oil producing areas. This would keep resources here, where they could further fuel our economy.
\
But if we want these new economic opportunities to open up, we need leaders in Washington, D.C. like Congressman J. Randy Forbes. Rep. Forbes, R-Va., is sponsoring the New Manhattan Project for Energy Independence. The plan calls for the U.S. to achieve 50 percent energy independence in 10 years and 100 percent energy independence in 20 years.
\
We support what Rep. Forbes is trying to do, but the question of how to fund such a program must be addressed.
\
Senators John Warner and John McCain also recognize the need for action to gain energy independence which is why they support cap-and-trade as the means to get there. This system utilizes the market to find the best way to limit overall carbon emissions. A cap-and-trade system would not only result in a cleaner environment, but it would also help spur new economic opportunities here in Virginia by encouraging innovation in clean energy technologies. Cap-and-Trade can help fund the New Manhattan Project and we encourage Congressman Forbes to make it a part of his program.
\
We know we need to protect and strengthen our country, environment, and economy from growing threats. Making America energy independent will allow us to do all three. The only question is how long will Congress wait to give us the chance to get there?

5,"In scouting for big differences between the two candidates for governor, Virginia voters can look to the environment as one issue offering a stark contrast.\Based on voting records, position papers, campaign platforms and interviews with friends and foes, two images become clear: State Sen. Creigh Deeds, the Democrat, is the choice of environmentalists and progressives who want more attention and action on protecting things green, and who favor a faster shift away from fossil fuels.\Former Attorney General Bob McDonnell, the Republican, is the clear champion of business and industry interests, who want fewer environmental rules, which they say often complicates economic development with higher costs and hassles, and who favor a slower, more deliberate transition to alternative energy.\Deeds, a lawyer from Bath County west of Charlottesville, has been endorsed by the Virginia League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club. He has sponsored land-conservation initiatives, authored a law to punish ""bad-actor"" farmers caught polluting and helped to create a state fund for cleaning up abandoned landfills that leak toxic wastes.\McDonnell, too, has backed tax incentives that promote land conservation. And he's pledged to increase those incentives as part of a larger promise to protect 400,000 acres of undeveloped property.\During his time as a state delegate from Virginia Beach, McDonnell was perhaps best known for his anti-environmental positions, including efforts to limit, and terminate, a state wetlands-protection program approved over his no vote in 2000.\In speeches, McDonnell can sound like former Gov. George Allen in appealing for a ""business-first"" approach to state government that keeps taxes and regulation ""at a minimum.""\McDonnell, a military veteran and attorney, has been endorsed by several business groups, including the Virginia Association of Realtors.\He receives generous contributions from developers and oil, gas and electric companies, as well as Smithfield Foods, the meat-packing giant, and its director Joe Luter.\Speaking in Norfolk last week, McDonnell described a cap-and-trade proposal pending in Congress to tackle climate change as ""a horrible new energy tax."" He urged Congress to defeat the measure, which President Barack Obama and Gov. Timothy M. Kaine endorse.\Deeds served on Kaine's Climate Change Commission last year. He said in a recent debate that he believes global warming is a serious problem but does not favor the cap-and-trade plan.\McDonnell supports drilling for oil and natural gas at least 50 miles off the Virginia Beach coast, expanding nuclear power by ""getting more of those reactors on line"" and exploiting the state's ""incredible natural resources"" such as coal and natural gas.\Deeds is more measured when discussing fossil fuels. He says he ""remains open"" to offshore drilling if done safely and without interruption of military training and commercial fishing.\He could support more nuclear energy, he says, ""provided we first address all issues critical to safety, including national security, disposal and the safe operation of any plant.""\Deeds says Virginia's energy portfolio must be balanced and include coal and gas extraction as well as coal-fired power plants, such as the one under construction in Wise County by Virginia Dominion Power, the state's largest electric utility. Environmentalists are challenging the project in court.\McDonnell says he fully supports a larger coal-fired plant proposed in Surry County by Old Dominion Electric Cooperative. Deeds is less committal, saying ""all options should be on the table.""\Both candidates say they would encourage alternative energy and seek to create more green jobs, though Deeds offers more specifics on how he would accomplish both.\The gap between Democratic and Republican candidates has long been wide in Virginia politics, especially in gubernatorial elections, but the difference this year ""is about as clear as you can get,"" said Lisa Guthrie, executive director of the state League of Conservation Voters."
6,"A good first step\The House of Representatives recently passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Although it includes a variety of items, most importantly it establishes a ""cap-and-trade"" system for carbon emissions. The bill sets a national limit on carbon emissions and creates a market for trading the right to pollute. This is the critical first step to weaning our economy off fossil fuel - a must for slowing global climate change and the acidification of the oceans. But it awaits passage by the Senate.\Historically, the economics of fossil fuel consumption stemmed from the costs of finding, extracting, processing, transporting and burning it. Consumer demand and supply set the price (and sometimes taxes, such as those on gasoline, add to the cost). Missing in this chain is the link to the very real cost of pollution created by the fossil fuel industry. As it stands, Dominion Power pays for the coal it burns, but not for carbon dioxide pollution it produces. While no one receives a bill for the pollution, we all pay for it with a degraded environment, the consequences of which will fall most heavily on our descendants.\The cap-and-trade system will include the cost of carbon dioxide pollution in the price of energy production from fossil fuels. This will make fossil fuels more expensive to consume, spurring the development of sustainable and nonpolluting sources of energy such as wind and solar. Detractors complain that cap and trade is essentially a tax on fossil fuel consumption. They fail to understand that fossil fuel consumption already taxes the environment, which is clearly buckling from the burden.\Cap and trade really does work to significantly reduce pollution. In the 1990s the Environmental Protection Agency showed great success with such a system to reduce coal plant emissions that cause acid rain. This proven system can do the same for carbon pollution. Voters should contact Sens. Mark Warner and Jim Webb and Reps. Glenn Nye and Rob Wittman to let them know that now is the time to support a cap-and-trade system\Benjamin Cuker\Hampton\Cleaning it up\I commend Newport News City Councilwoman Tina Vick's efforts in appropriating funds to revitalize the ast end of Jefferson Avenue.\My business dealings take me through the area several times a week. It seems to me that the efforts could start today. If the residents of the area would stop using the streets as a trash can and properly dispose of their waste paper, it would go a long way in showing that they are concerned about the neighborhood's appearance. The city could then pursue additional efforts toward revitalization.\Charlie Tiedeken\Newport News"
7,"Those who are unwilling to look at reducing carbon emissions despite the record increases in tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, droughts and polar ice cap melting should ask themselves how it is possible to dump ""tens of millions of tons a day"" of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere without long-term negative effects like heat trapping (""What's going down? Not temperatures, or your AC bill,"" Our view, Heat wave debate, Thursday)? \Climate change skeptic Rep. Max Thornberry, R-Texas, warns against ""jumping to conclusions."" He argues that if we invest in reducing carbon emissions, China will not follow suit, and that a ""cap and trade"" or similar proposal will cost the taxpayer money; however, the cost of not doing anything is incalculable. He also argues that the solution should not come from Washington, which might make the problem worse. Maybe the writer is implying that the solution should come from China; he apparently believes that country should take the lead. \He asks that we should ""pray for rain."" While we're at it, we could also pray that our congressional leaders have the skills to develop programs that focus on jobs and the economy, as well as crafting regulations that lead to a healthier environment, and that we the people have the wisdom to choose representatives who do. \Susan A. MacDermaid \Ann Arbor, Mich. \Bring troops home \I can't believe that I agree with Medea Benjamin, co-founder of that despicable group Code Pink! However, she hit the nail on the head in the opposing view ""'It's time to get out'"" (Afghanistan debate, Wednesday). \Afghanistan is not worth one more drop of American blood nor one red cent. We need to declare victory and bring all our armed forces home. Now, not in six months.

Sure you can lose your phone, you can stop it remotely and you will notice it is gone. \However, you may not know your phone and all that nice private stuff has been hacked, even though one uses the latest and greatest security tools available to consumers, until financial damage has occurred. \Russ Larkin \North Augusta, S.C."
8,"With Republicans set to control the U.S. House of Representatives, many environmental advocates view the next six weeks as their best chance to pass climate and energy legislation.\Gone is the idea of a cap-and-trade program on carbon emissions, which was shelved months ago after U.S. Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., withdrew his support for the bill.\Still, federal lawmakers in the coming weeks may consider a handful of less controversial bills that will have implications in Virginia. Among them is the renewable electricity standard, which would require utilities to generate 15 percent of their power from alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar, and biomass, by 2021.\""We think that that might come through this year,"" said J.R. Tolbert, assistant director for the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club.\Introduced by U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingham, D-N.M., who is chairman of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the bill has 34 co-sponsors. Virginia's Democratic Sens. Jim Webb and Mark Warner are not co-sponsors.\The bill could push states, such as Virginia, without mandated renewable energy goals away from fossil fuels. Reliant on coal, nuclear and natural gas, roughly 3 percent of Virginia's power comes from renewable energy.\It also would help develop industries, such as offshore wind power, which could lead to manufacturing jobs in Hampton Roads or other East Coast ports.\Aviv Goldsmith, managing director of development for New Jersey-based wind power company Fishermen's Energy, said required alternative energy goals will help spur the nascent industry forward.\""We are a firm believer in state-by-state mandated renewable energy portfolios,"" he said Wednesday at an environment forum Wednesday in Hampton.\Gov. Bob McDonnell's administration rejects the idea because renewable energy is typically more expensive than fossil fuels. With the economy slumping, it's not the right time for policy that could cause energy prices to spike, state Secretary of Natural Resources Doug Domenech said.\""We don't feel like we should be forcing people into that,"" he said.\The House passed an oil-spill response bill earlier this summer, but the Senate is mired in debate because of an unlimited liability clause that Republicans and some Democrats say could put small oil companies out of business.\If approved, the legislation could help the industry move forward after the disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil spill that prompted federal regulators to close Virginia's coast to offshore drilling. McDonnell last month reiterated his support for offshore drilling, saying it will create jobs and help secure the nation's energy needs.\Also under consideration is a $100 billion tax package that could include credits for energy efficiency and biofuels development.\Virginia leaders in these industries have said additional investment is needed because money from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, also known as the federal stimulus package, is running out."
9,"C.J. Wheeler feels like he has been picking up trash everywhere at the 2010 National Scout Jamboree.\Though he is a little disappointed in other Scouts, the 16-year-old from Henrico County was encouraged by how many people joined him at the Conservation Environment Area yesterday.\""It's really good to see that everyone is looking at it and trying to keep things clean for the future,"" Wheeler said.\As he made his way through the 25 exhibits at Fort A.P. Hill with Jason Bamford, 17, of Midlothian, the two expressed frustration with the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\""It's just sad that big oil companies don't take seriously the regulations,"" Wheeler said. ""They just kind of glaze over stuff to just continue to do what they want.""\Bamford grew more optimistic as he learned how his generation can help protect the environment.\""I just think we need to step up,"" Bamford said.\Bamford and Wheeler are among more than 40,000 Scouts, leaders and staff members at Fort A.P. Hill for the 10-day Jamboree, which concludes tomorrow.\Enabling Scouts with the knowledge to ""step up"" is a goal of the Conservation Environment Area.\Each exhibit stressed the growth potential of jobs in environmental industries. National Wildlife law enforcement officers spoke with Scouts, as did civil engineers and attorneys in environmental law.\Older Scouts discussed national regulations and international treaties concerning energy use. A representative from the Air and Waste Management Association engaged Scouts on air-quality issues. Another instructor encouraged Scouts to talk to their parents about electricity use and how cap-and-trade laws would affect energy costs.\""I think they're picking it up,"" said Henry Graham, an instructor from the Water Environment Federation. ""But we try not to overwhelm them.""\Graham and Scout leaders who work in the water-treatment field taught Scouts about the importance of wastewater treatment. Scouts were reminded to avoid putting household cleaning products, grease and prescription medicine down drains. Graham explained that such products should not go through septic tanks and wastewater treatment facilities. Chemicals in household cleaning products kill the bacteria needed for breaking down natural waste.\Scouts also got to crawl through clean sewer pipes set up between exhibits. ""The only thing that's been through these sewers is Scouts,"" Graham joked.\Another set of instructors waited at the other end of the sewer lines to show Scouts how pH tests work.\Wheeler said he's proud of his troop's awareness of the environment and plans to share what he learned in the Conservation Environment Area.\""Our troop, we're pretty good about it,"" Wheeler said. ""We make sure we clean after every meal and before every meal. Our camp is really clean."""
10,"To thunderous applause, Mitt Romney told the recent Republican Convention, ""President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.""\In response, President Obama said in his own acceptance speech, ""And yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet -- because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They're a threat to our children's future."" \The polarization of the two main U.S. political parties is evident, particularly around environmental issues. \Gone are the days when Republican politicians took actions to support the health of the environment. The current tea party-controlled GOP rejects any legacy of conservation and now decries environmental measures as anti-business. \Republican Theodore Roosevelt created the National Parks System, and is responsible for preserving more land than any other president. Republican Richard Nixon signed the legislation to create the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and appointed its first administrator, the well-respected Republican William Ruckelshaus. \George H. Bush wanted to be the ""environmental president"" and in 1990 signed legislation to implement a cap-and-trade policy that was wildly successful in reducing acid precipitation. \As recently as 2008 Republicans Newt Gingrich and John McCain gave speeches on the need to curtail greenhouse gases and slow the resulting climate change. \Not all that long ago a fair number of Republicans in Congress had better environmental records than some Democrats. Not anymore. \The rise of the tea party in 2010 solidified the Republican anti-environmental stance, but its origins extend back much further. \Ronald Regan famously removed Jimmy Carter's solar panels from the roof of the White House as one of his first acts in office. He also appointed Anne Gorsuch to head and partially dismantle the USEPA - she cut the budget by 23 percent, fired many employees and relaxed enforcement against polluters, eventually earning her a censure by Congress and an early ticket out of her job. \The environment is an important issue in this election. \Not surprisingly the fossil fuel industry backs the Republicans who call for reversal of laws that protect the environment in order to protect the profits of the polluters. \President Obama's administration recently required autos (including SUVs) to have an average of 54.5 mpg by 2025 (I get 51.3 mpg in my 2010 Prius so this is doable). Interestingly the U.S. auto industry approves of the new rule, while Gov. Romney opposes it. \Obama calls for extending subsidies to promote the wind-to-electricity industry in the U.S., and opposes continuing subsidies to the oil companies. Romney takes the opposite position on each. \The environment also figures in our local congressional races. The non-partisan League of Conservation Voters (LCV) scores voting records of representatives on a scale of 0 - 100 percent. When George Allen served in Congress he earned an incredibly dismal record of 1 percent. After losing his Senate seat in 2006, Allen went to work promoting the oil industry agenda. The LCV named him to their ""Dirty Dozen"" list of the most anti-environmental politicians this year. \The LCV scores of the local Virginia Congressional delegation follow party lines. \For 2011 Democrat Bobby Scott scored 100 percent. And for Republicans the grades were; Eric Cantor 11 percent, Randy Forbes 14 percent, Scott Rigell 17 percent, and Rob Whitman 34 percent. For the Commonwealth overall, all three Democrats earned perfect A grades with 100 percent scores. All eight Republicans failed, with the highest score among them being Frank Wolf's 40 percent. \Dirty energy industries and other polluters certainly do provide employment and plenty of cash for Republicans running for office. \Clean energy industries (wind and solar) will provide the jobs without harming the environment and human health. \Yes, this election is very much about jobs, and it's much smarter to choose a path that provides both employment and protects the health of the environment and our children. \Keep this in mind when you vote. \Cuker is a professor of marine and environmental science at Hampton University"

PETERSBURG - A push for green renewable energy, the rebuilding of infrastructure and investing in education would be a key factor in job creation, said Dr. Wynne LeGrow, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Congress in the 4th District. ""We need to rebuild the infrastructure and we need to concentrate on wind and solar power,"" LeGrow said in an interview with The Progress-Index on Thursday.
\
LeGrow also said that he supports President Barack Obama's plan to let the Bush tax cuts expire for Americans with an income above $200,000. He blasted his Republican opponent, Congressman J. Randy Forbes, for claiming fiscal conservatism and his refusal to debate before the Nov. 2 election. ""He doesn't have the courage of his convictions, he's afraid to sit down beside me and have me pin him down on all the money he has wasted,"" LeGrow said. ""So he is coming up with these laughable excuses,"" he said.
\
But right now, things aren't looking too promising for LeGrow. A recent poll by The New York Times suggests that 64 percent of Virginians would cast their vote for Forbes if the election was today, while only 33.4 percent would vote for the challenger. The newspaper calculated that LeGrow has a 1 percent chance of unseating Forbes, who has served in Congress since 2001.
\
LeGrow does not allow these poll numbers to discourage him. ""President Obama won this district two years ago,"" he said. ""Last year was not a good year for Democrats [in Virginia], but things are changing. When President Obama was elected, it was the first time since 1964 that a Democrat won the state. If we can get our base out, then we can do it again,"" he said.
\
LeGrow's liberal ideas are in strong contrast to Forbes' staunch conservatism. But fiscally, Forbes' voting record is far from being conservative, LeGrow said. ""Congressman Forbes voted against health care reform but for the medicare prescription drug plan, which cost about $1 trillion over the next ten years, and that was not paid for,"" LeGrow said. ""Many Republicans try to present themselves as fiscal conservatives. Mr. Forbes voted for the war in Iraq, that I never would have voted for, that's another $1 trillion. And the Bush tax breaks - For the first time in our history, people got a tax break at the same time we were going to war,"" he said.
\
""It makes no sense,"" LeGrow continued. ""That was trillions of dollars that went into debt, which Congressman Forbes voted for. And suddenly, he is the fiscal conservative. That's just not the case. I think I'm the fiscal conservative between the two of us, even though on other issues I'm certainly more liberal than he is,"" he said.
\
If enacted, the proposal to let the Bush tax cuts expire for families making more than $250,000 and individuals making more than $200,000 would cause the tax income to increase by $800 billion over the next ten years, LeGrow said. The money could be used to rebuild the infrastructure, like roads, bridges, airports and high speed rail. ""This would create jobs and it would also provide the income that you need,"" he said.
\
LeGrow criticized what he called the Republican denial of global warming. ""One of the main reasons I ran was that I didn't feel that Congress was adequately addressing global climate change,"" he said. ""I'm convinced that that's real and we are causing it by burning fossil fuels.""
\
LeGrow's solution to the problem: ""Converting to green renewable energy sources is something that we need to do,"" he said. ""There is a proposal that power plants produce a certain percentage of their energy by renewable energy sources and gradually increase that percentage over the years. I would certainly be in favor of something like that being initiated.""
\
LeGrow added in the scientific community, global warming is not a point of contention. ""It's real, it's happening,"" he said. ""Generally, people who don't believe it are people who almost go out of their way not to learn about it. It's a matter of educating the public,"" he said.
\
And without education, new jobs created in the green energy field will not be filled, LeGrow said. ""You have to invest in education. If you're going to produce jobs, you have to have educated young people to fill the jobs,"" he said. ""We have to make sure that the young people are educated. It has been shown that the educational level has dropped. We used to be tops in science and math, and now this country is ranked 11 among developed countries. That has to be turned around,"" he said.
\
To address the problem of energy production and independence, Forbes in 2008 proposed a bill he named The New Manhattan Project. The proposed bill included $14 billion in prizes and $10 billion in grants to be awarded to private entities, which completed one of seven tasks related to achieving energy independence.
\
LeGrow considers this plan unrealistic. ""If someone is going to develop a nuclear fusion generator in their garage, Congressman Forbes wants to give him a price,"" LeGrow said. ""But that's not going to happen. It showed me that his understanding of global climate changing and the energy problem is just very superficial. He was going to put some prices up for accomplishing certain things and not do what needs to be done right now, what we have the technology to do.""
\
Instead, LeGrow proposes Cap and Trade or a carbon tax, which would motivate consumers to use less fossil fuel. ""Mr. Forbes' whole approach with that was what he called scientific breakthroughs that would solve the problem,"" LeGrow said. ""We know what to do now, it's just a matter of having the political will to do it. Clearly, he doesn't.""
\
LeGrow also disagrees with Forbes on health care reform. In an interview with The Progress-Index last week, Forbes said that his team had contacted more than 1,000 doctors and nurses in Virginia to ask them about their views on the Democrats' idea of health care reform. Forbes said that all of them opposed the bill.
\
LeGrow, a retired nephrologist, said that Forbes did not give him the chance to participate in his survey. ""I got a notice that there was going to be a telephone conference on a certain day, and that conference was on the day before I got the notice,"" LeGrow said. ""My wife, who is a nurse, got a notice that there was going to be another phone conference on medical issues, and she got the notice a day or two after the conference was held. You're not going to get much negative feedback if you contact anyone who might be against [health care reform] after the meeting,"" he said.
\
LeGrow said that he would have voted for the Democrats health care bill, but added that it doesn't go far enough. ""I have called doctors, trying to raise money, and some of them are in favor for it, some are against it,"" he said. ""But if you bring up the specific things that are done already - you can no longer deny health insurance to children with pre-existing conditions - that's good. Young adults under the age of 26 can stay under their parents insurance. That's good. There is no lifetime limit on health insurance, if you have some chronic problem, you don't reach a point where the insurance company can just cut you off. No doctors that I talked to ever said that there is anything wrong with any of that.""
\
LeGrow said that the doctors' main concern with the bill was the cost. ""Their complaint is that it is too expensive,"" he said. ""But it's paid for. The day the bill passed, it was paid for.""
\
But it wasn't their different opinions on health care reform that has brought this race to the attention of the national media. When LeGrow, a self-proclaimed atheist, criticized Forbes in various web blogs for his push to designate the United States as a Judeo-Christian nation and to let Congress declare religion a prerequisite for freedom and reject ""the notion that the laws and Constitution of the United States require the exclusion of God from matters of government,"" Forbes quickly responded, accusing LeGrow of attacking his religious beliefs.
\
""That's a blatant lie,"" LeGrow said. ""I have never attacked him or anyone else for their religion. I'm in favor of religious freedom, but I'm also in favor of separation of church and state,"" he said. ""I don't care what his or anybody's religion is,"" LeGrow added. ""In this country, if it was run by people like me, religious freedom would be much safer than if it were run by people like Forbes, because the people who came to this country for religious freedom weren't escaping countries that were run by atheists. They were getting away from countries where church and state was combined.""
\
The most recent topic dominating media coverage of the race is Forbes' refusal to face LeGrow in a public debate. ""The reason why he is not going to debate me is that he is afraid to,"" LeGrow said. ""So far, he has come up with at least five reasons why he won't debate me.""
\
And without a debate, it might be difficult for LeGrow to communicate his message to voters - especially in a climate of populism as promoted by the Tea Party. ""It's frustrating,"" LeGrow admits. ""You got the Tea Party out there who thinks that we are paying the highest taxes we've ever paid when in fact taxes are lower than they have been in 60 years,"" he said. ""Some people, no matter how many facts you put before them, they are going to ignore it. They are going to vote the way they want, even if it's hurting them individually.""
\
LeGrow said that he, too, is concerned with the country's $13 trillion debt. ""I agree with [the Tea Party],"" he said. ""The problem is, they have nothing after that, other than being angry.""
\
And just like the Tea Party movement, LeGrow said, the Republican party as a whole has few concrete ideas for fixing the problems the country currently faces. ""Their Pledge to America, that's not a plan that I can see,"" he said. ""What I have seen is some vague generalities with no specifics behind them. It's a superficial plan, but not a real plan. The whole thing is vague, there is no meat there.""

"
12," Global warming's demands on human ingenuity, and pocketbooks, will take center stage Friday in the latest international report on climate change.\ Whether humans bury greenhouse gases, blunt them with new technology or buy them off with tax incentives, banishing the emissions responsible for global warming will take quick action, experts conclude in advance of the report.\ The latest International Panel on Climate Change report, ""Mitigation of Climate Change,"" examines fixes -- or ""mitigation"" in climate lingo -- to global warming, both technological and economic. The report will underline the environmental and financial benefits of quick action to cut emissions, says report co-author John Drexhage of Canada's International Institute for Sustainable Development.\ But fixes also come with costs explored in the report. If governments, for example, impose fees on carbon dioxide emissions, it would raise the price of electricity for businesses and homeowners alike. For that reason, the USA and China, major users of coal, have objected to calls in the panel's draft report for quick action on just such a move, says Tony Kreindler of Environmental Defense, an environmental research and advocacy organization.\ Problematic visions of the future\ In the first of two reports earlier this year, the World Meteorological Organization-sponsored panel, which features thousands of climate scientists reviewing studies, included a best estimate that average surface temperatures will rise roughly 3 to 7 degrees this century. In the second report, the panel concluded that environmental impacts of warming were already apparent in migrating species, earlier springtimes and sea-level rise. The summary warned of a future of increased droughts, floods and species extinctions.\ ""We have three choices: mitigation, adaptation or suffering,"" says Harvard's John Holdren, co-chair of the National Commission on Energy Policy. ""And we are already starting to do a little of each one.""\ A summary of the third and latest report's scientific chapters will be released in Bangkok after review by political representatives of more than 100 nations, including the United States.\ The key debate in Bangkok, Drexhage says, will center on a simple chart. The chart shows ways that fast economic moves worldwide, both in technology and in imposing taxes or fees on emissions, would limit global warming. The key goals are keeping this century's average surface temperature rise roughly below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, he adds. That's the point where many dangerous impacts, such as declining grain yields in Africa and the spread of tropical diseases toward the poles, almost certainly loom.\ The report evaluates mitigation from a number of angles:\ *Technologies ranging from better building design to nuclear power to carbon sequestration, which shunts greenhouse gases from smokestacks into underground rock formations.\ *Future emission ""scenarios,"" ranging from a ""business as usual"" world in which fossil fuel use continues unabated to ones with strict limits on greenhouse gases.\ *Economic estimates from combinations of technologies, policies and scenarios.\ A 'monumental' task\ ""The truth is we are facing a monumental challenge in climate change"" tied to humanity's widespread reliance on fossil fuels for energy, says Vicki Arroyo of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Combined with cement production, which requires heating immense amounts of limestone in a process that releases carbon dioxide, that dependence adds more than 6 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere annually. The next climate report, Arroyo says, ""will make clear there are costs of not acting, and there are costs of acting, to deal with it.""\ Money, not science, becomes the point of debate over climate change with the release of the mitigation report, says report co- author Anthony Patt of Boston University.\ On one side, Patt suggests, some will take the position outlined in February by Newsweek pundit Robert Samuelson that significantly changing emissions ""would be costly, uncertain and no doubt unpopular."" Others will agree with last year's Stern Review, an economic review of global warming's implications headed by the United Kingdom's chief economist, which argued that reducing carbon dioxide emissions would lower economic growth modestly this century, while inaction would trigger global recession by 2050 because of the environmental effects of runaway climate change.\ ""In my view, I think the report will make plain that a lot of avenues exist"" for addressing climate change, Patt says.\ No one technology or policy will address climate change by itself, Holdren says. The energy commission he co-chairs, for example, released an April report calling for charging businesses a steadily rising price per ton on carbon emissions, combined with government incentives and technology developments to lower emissions. ""People are starting to notice climates changing, see it in their real lives,"" he adds. ""It's too late to stop global warming. The real question is whether we can prevent catastrophic (man-made) interference with climate.""\ TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE\ 'Mitigation' glossary\ *Adaptation. Spending money to live with the consequences of climate change. For example, building higher sea walls.\ *Biofuels. Energy sources, such as ethanol, made from farming byproducts or crops.\ *Cap-and-trade.

Underground storage of smokestack carbon dioxide releases.\ *Carbon sink. Anything that naturally reduces the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere, such as a growing forest, is a sink.\ *Carbon tax.

13,"Congress has the opportunity to promote cleaner, affordable, homegrown American energy that will result in lower carbon emissions. Unfortunately, many remain preoccupied with energy tax-raising and job-killing cap-and-trade bills to address climate change. Until we can come together to push solutions where we agree, both the American people and the environment will suffer. \Many are calling on the U.S. to cap its carbon emissions. I support cutting carbon emissions; I just want to do it without killing jobs and raising energy costs. The Congressional Budget Office, Washington's official money scorekeeper, says that cap-and-trade climate change legislation would hurt the economy and cost U.S. jobs. Even CBO is probably underestimating the costs because CBO looked at only the cheapest first 10 years of the 40-year legislation. In later years, the legislation and its costs become even greater. \Many Americans might not know much about CBO, but they do know about job losses, high energy bills, the pain at the pump and the troubles of providing for a family during these tough economic times. Missouri families and workers are struggling to make ends meet and fighting to keep their jobs. They cannot understand why we will make their lives more expensive with higher energy costs and policies that would send their manufacturing jobs to countries that produce energy at a cheaper cost, such as China. They also do not understand why we might sign an international treaty letting China and India off the hook of emissions cuts, especially when scientists tell us that the U.S. acting alone would have no impact on world temperatures. \More than 30,000 Missourians recently sent cards to my office decrying cap-and-trade legislation that would raise their retail electricity rates up to 26% by 2012, 42% by 2020, and as much as 77% under worst case scenarios. The University of Missouri's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute found that cap-and-trade would raise production costs at a representative Missouri grain farm by $11,650 in 2020 and $30,150 in 2050. These are costs my Missouri constituents do not want to pay, especially when U.S. unemployment tops 10%. Yet, that is exactly the environmental policy of cap-and-trade advocates: Make energy more expensive so people use less of it. \I think there is a better way than inflicting pain on the American people. I say cut carbon emissions without raising energy prices and killing jobs with zero-carbon nuclear energy, low-carbon biofuels, low-carbon technology to clean coal emissions, low-carbon hybrid and plug-in vehicle technology, energy efficiency and conservation where it makes economic sense, and opening U.S. reserves of clean natural gas. These are carbon-cutting strategies where we can come together, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to do so as soon as possible. \Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., is a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee."
14,"Many controversial issues lend themselves to split-the-difference compromises, but the Keystone XL pipeline isn't one of them. That puts President Obama in a tough spot as his administration nears a decision on the proposed $7 billion project, which would carry tar-sand oil from Canada to Gulf Coast refineries. \For the environmentalists who strongly supported Obama's re-election, Keystone has become a crucial test of his promises to take climate change seriously. Thousands demonstrated in Washington on Sunday against the project, asserting that the pipeline would unlock so much dirty oil that it would be ""game over"" for the globe if the project proceeds. \For Canada, whose government badly wants the pipeline to go forward, the decision is an equally crucial test of the two neighbors' relationship. And for the United States, the project offers a rare opportunity to create jobs and lessen the nation's decades-long dependence on oil from unstable or unfriendly suppliers. \Both sides make strong arguments, but after more than four years of exhaustive study, the right answer on Keystone remains: Build it. \At a time of rising global competition for energy resources, the pipeline would bring reliable new oil supplies to a U.S. that still imports 40% of its crude, 7.6 million barrels a day last year. And 40% of those imports come from OPEC nations such as Venezuela, Iraq and Nigeria. Keystone is expected to supply 830,000 million barrels a day, a key step toward the long-sought goal of North American energy independence, which suddenly seems attainable. \Much of the opposition to Keystone has come from critics who say running a big pipeline through the heart of the USA is too risky. Haven't they noticed that tens of thousands of miles of oil pipelines already crisscross the United States? As long as the nation's quarter-billion vehicles rely almost exclusively on gasoline and diesel, pipelines are the safest and most efficient way to move it. \Obama delayed a final decision on Keystone last year, in part to allow a rerouting around environmentally sensitive areas in Nebraska. That has been accomplished, and Nebraska's governor signed off on the new map last month. \Nor would blocking Keystone keep the tar-sands oil in the ground. In a world starving for oil, it's overwhelmingly likely the oil would find another way to market -- through a pipeline to West Coast ports to carry it to China, to East Coast ports to carry it to other nations, or by barge, rail and existing pipelines into the USA. \The goal of locking down tar-sands oil and stopping other forms of fossil fuel production such as fracking -- as many protesters demanded in Sunday's demonstration -- would be more compelling if the U.S. were ready to shift to renewable fuels such as solar, wind and biomass to power vehicles, heat homes and run factories. Last year, though, renewables supplied just 9.4% of all U.S. energy needs, despite robust tax incentives for wind power and electric cars. Shutting down conventional sources of energy at this point is naive and economically destructive. \Demand might be further reduced by making vehicles and buildings more efficient. A carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system could do the same by making the price of conventional fuels better reflect their cost to the environment. \Until that day, though, the best choice for the economy and the planet is to ensure ample, secure supplies of energy. The Keystone pipeline is an essential part of that strategy."
15,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce began airing a new ad attacking Democrat Tim Kaine Thursday, one day after it endorsed Republican George Allen in Virginia's Senate race.\Democrats estimated that the organization put about $620,000 behind the statewide television ad purchase, not counting production costs. \The new ad is as notable for what it doesn't say as for what it says: It accurately notes that as governor from 2006 to 2010, Kaine sought new taxes. He twice proposed tax increases for transportation and prescribed an income tax increase along with his final budget in December 2009. Lawmakers unanimously rejected it. \But the Chamber ad neglects Kaine's role in eliminating Virginia's estate tax and increasing the earning threshold for low-income residents that removed more than 100,000 households from the state tax rolls. \It alleges Kaine supports ""higher energy costs."" That is based on Kaine's testimony about sea level increases and climate change in September 2007 before the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in which Kaine said he supported ""cap-and-trade"" legislation to control carbon gas emissions from power plants that burn fossil fuels, chiefly coal. \The legislation never passed, and the ad doesn't note Kaine's support for authorizing oil and gas exploration off the Virginia coast, contrary to President Barack Obama's policy. \It's not the first time the big-business advocacy group has aided Allen. It aired a pro-Allen spot in February that never mentioned Kaine. At the time, Allen was vying for the GOP nomination against three conservatives. \The ad, titled ""Wrong Track,"" uses a railroad allegory throughout. The viewer glides down tracks as one billboard after another zips by, each making a new claim. As the ad closes, the track dead-ends off a deep cliff. \The allegations are broad enough that they convey some truth. However, like most of the acidic political advertising by independent outside groups in Virginia and other battleground states with pivotal Senate races, the context is so lacking that a full, balanced understanding of the issue is impossible. \For example, it notes Kaine's enthusiastic and well-documented support as Democratic National Committee chairman of Obama's health coverage reforms, the Affordable Care Act. It doesn't note Kaine's opposition to the White House's directive that required religious employers to provide coverage for contraceptives despite their beliefs. Kaine was Virginia's first Roman Catholic governor."
16,"Not too long ago, President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress proudly announced that America would lead the fight against global warming by passing a cap-and-trade bill. But despite overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress in 2009, Democrats barely found the votes to get the proposal through the House, and Senate Democrats never even brought it up for a vote. \The reason is simple. Cap-and-trade is designed to make the energy we use more expensive. Consider President Obama's Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who said in 2008, ""Somehow, we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe."" That's about $7 to $8 a gallon. \What the Democrats have since learned is that the American public is more skeptical of the science of global warming than at anytime over the past decade. Frank Newport of Gallup stated earlier this year, ""Americans' attitudes toward the environment show a public that over the last two years has become less worried about the threat of global warming, less convinced that its effects are already happening, and more likely to believe that scientists themselves are uncertain about its occurrence."" \While skepticism abounds, Americans are fully aware of the impact on their wallets. The Obama cap-and-trade agenda would cost our economy $300 billion to $400 billion annually: It would hurt families, business and farmers basically anyone who drives a car and flips a light switch. \What would be gained from higher gas prices and staggering taxes? Virtually nothing. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson, appointed by President Obama, admitted before the Senate that the U.S. action on global warming would have no impact on global carbon emissions. In fact, as jobs went to places like India, China and Mexico, where they don't have any emissions requirements, cap-and-trade would actually increase worldwide emissions. \For the past 10 years, I have led the fight against the Democrats' attack on affordable energy. This year, 64 senators voted to rein in the Obama administration as it attempts to push its cap-and-trade agenda through EPA regulations. In the end, as the hysteria of global warming continues to fade, so too will the cap-and-trade regime. \Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., is the senior Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee."
17,"I appreciate the services of FedEx and UPS, but I'd hate to not have the U.S. Postal Service, a government-run public option, especially if I just want to mail one letter for less than 50 cents (""White House ramps up push to shape health bill,"" News, Tuesday). \I know many parents who love the private schools their children attend, but I'm glad to have the option of public school for my own son and daughter. Amusement parks are fun, but I like the public option of having Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and the rest of our amazing national parks. \I don't see any of those public options as a waste of money or effort. In fact, I can't see America without them. I shudder to think what educational, recreational and natural resources we'd have if we only had private companies to provide them, according to their profit motives. With something as fundamental as health care, we should also have a public option. We must. \The thought of continuing without one makes me ill. \Ted White \Amherst, Mass. \Too much government \The entire Constitution of the United States of America can be printed on six pages. In contrast, the bloated Senate health care bill has a ridiculous 1,502 pages. \But let's be realistic. What's going on in Washington is not about health care; it is about control by bureaucratic and power-hungry politicians. \House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the other Democratic lawmakers, supported by the White House, are doing the same thing they did with the stimulus bill, the budget bill and the cap-and-trade bill: flooding people with thousands of pages of rules, regulations, restrictions and, above all, colossal spending. \Evidently, they believe that if they bamboozle the American people with mind-boggling and incomprehensible legalese, we will simply take their word for it that this poison pill is in our interests. Only those who like more government and less freedom are buying it! \John M. Clegg \Ponte Vedra, Fla. \In U.S., not living solar lessons \When I stumbled upon the article ""German team shines in Solar Decathlon,"" I was not surprised to learn that a European team had beat the U.S. (USATODAY.com, Oct. 16). \The competition, for college students in the U.S., Canada and Europe, challenged teams to design the best solar house. As a 10th-grade student, I realize how important this competition is, and how significant Germany's win is. \We are hearing so much about the environment and energy in the media and school, but we have not seen it played out in reality. I have heard countless things about solar energy, but if I were asked to list anybody I know who actually uses it, I wouldn't be able to name one person other than celebrities. \I don't see the lessons we learn in school translated into use in everyday life. If students could see more practical applications of solar energy, then perhaps it would become more common and more accepted. \Andee Bartholomew \Ballston Lake, N.Y. \'Save a plastic tree' \Bravo to Target, CVS and other stores for efforts to reduce the use of plastic bags (""Target puts plastic bags in bull's-eye,"" Money, Monday). \Too many times I have purchased items, especially small, easy-to-carry items, only to have them immediately placed in a plastic bag. I politely say, ""No, thanks, I don't need a bag."" The response from the person manning the checkout, trained to place every item in a bag, is usually, ""Are you sure?"" I usually reply (in an attempt at humor), ""Yeah, I'm sure. Save a plastic tree."" Here's hoping many more of those ""plastic trees,"" along with critical parts of our environment, will be saved through programs that reward people for reusing bags or not requesting them. \Randy Cizek \Canton, Ohio \Not by numbers \USA TODAY reader Dennis Vest writes: ""(Rush) Limbaugh has millions of listeners. This should serve as proof that he is not just some fringe talk show host"" (""Don't mix NFL with politics,"" Letters, Oct. 15). \The reader appears to have forgotten about people such as Adolf Hitler, who also had millions of followers who listened to and believed everything he said. History has proved that these people were wrong and, in some cases, just plain stupid. \As a pastor, I will say Hitler and Limbaugh have probably had more followers during their lives than Jesus Christ had during his lifetime. So does that make them better than Jesus Christ? My answer is no way. \The Rev. James E. Fleming \Rochester Hills, Mich. \Show senior photo \Veronica Rodriguez describes her daughter, Ceara Sturgis, as a ""perfect child"" (""Girl in tuxedo denied a place in school yearbook,"" News, Monday). \By all accounts, here is a young woman who is a credit to her family and her school, and she can't have her senior picture in the yearbook? I would think that the Copiah County school district would have bigger things to concern themselves with than this young student.

18,"Which fish?\What irresponsible comments from the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center related to responsible seafood consumption (""Seafood dinner, hold the guilt,"" Jan. 2). Consumers must sift through a range of opinions and one would hope for more informed commentary.\A call to avoid local flounder? This is completely contrary to the scientific assessments and consumers should feel great about supporting flounder from local watermen. While I appreciate the thought of trying to ""convince counterparts"" that this should perhaps be changed, this example reveals how dubious many of these groups are with their information, even if well intentioned.\However, as one involved firsthand in global seafood production, I was particularly appalled reading ""a lot of imported fishery products simply aren't managed well"" and the example of Asian tilapia as something to be avoided with pollution concerns. This is not accurate, and there is plenty of easily researched information on these subjects.\While it is fair to have a reasonable debate about the range of policy issues related to global seafood trade, it is shameful to make sweeping inaccurate statements related to imported product quality with no factual basis. This is especially true when such statements are made by those who should know better and only serves to discourage consumption of healthy and sustainable products.\Matthew Fass\Williamsburg\Sensible seafood\I would like to respond to the article ""A seafood dinner, please, and hold the guilt"" (Jan. 1). Cory Nealon attempted to characterize the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center's sustainable seafood program, Sensible Seafood. While getting some of the information correct, there were also some inconsistencies that I feel should be mentioned.\First, the Sensible Seafood program's mission is to ""promote seafood choices that make sense for a healthy marine environment."" The word ""promote"" was specifically chosen because it connotes the spirit of a program that directly relates to the aquarium's conservation and education mission. By providing both consumers and commercial entities with information about what makes seafood sustainable, they can ask the right questions and make informed decisions. In other words, the Sensible Seafood program is not about convincing people to stop doing things, it is about educating them to start doing things.\The program's seafood guidelines offer some assistance, but cannot provide every bit of information needed to make sustainable choices. For example, summer flounder is a species that is a regional favorite. Its stock is in good condition and effectively managed and, if harvested in a sustainable manner, it is a good local seafood choice. ""Promoting"" the understanding of what makes seafood sustainable is what the Sensible Seafood program is all about. It is that spirit that will lead to sustainable practices and provide the seafood we love from a healthy marine environment.\Lynn Clements\Director, Virginia Aquarium\& Marine Science Center\Virginia Beach\Not Indians\Regarding inaccurate school textbooks, I have a comment: Referring to the Native Americans as Indians is absolutely not accurate, and ridiculous. Indians live in India or choose to live in the United States or other countries. The males and females living in the U.S. since way before the 1600s are Native Americans, not Indians.\And those big black animals they lived off and which still roam freely are bison, not buffalo. Buffalo live in Asia and Africa and the only buffalo in the United States are in zoos. There is a big difference between a bison and a buffalo. Why are schools and people still continuing to make this huge error?\S.J. Forrest\Hampton\The 'Nos' won\Lou Seyler's Dec. 9 letter ""Turned off"" demanded that Republicans be expunged from Congress for saying ""No"" and opposing Democratic legislation. Many Democrats see the GOP as the party of ""No"" because it won't blindly follow the ultra-left wing agenda set forth by President Barack Obama. Republicans' resolute negativity to such ruinous legislation as Obamacare, federal government bailouts, cap and trade, excessive unemployment benefits, etc., is crucial in keeping the nation from falling to its socialistic and indigent knees. Obama along with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's governance from the extreme left, without approval of the American people, induced wholesale changes to our political landscape the last election.\In essence it was the voting, taxpaying citizen who said ""No."" Given Democrats are the minority in the House of Representatives, and Republicans have more senatorial muscle, you can count on the recusant shoe being on the left foot, for at least the next two years. I am glad our government was set up to allow for opposition, as its checks and balances keep the country from veering ideologically too far one way or the other. Now that the brakes have been put on the runaway Obama express, it's time for all parties to remember who's paying the bills in this country.\Jai Wynne\Yorktown"
19," A Senate panel gave a cordial but cautious reception Wednesday to legislation pushed by Virginia Sen. John Warner to curb global warming.\ The proposal by Warner and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., which aims to cut U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases by 70 percent by 2050, would mark the first substantive attempt by Congress to address global warming after years of inaction.\ The bill would establish caps on greenhouse gas emissions and create a market-based system for companies to buy and sell emission allowances. A new federal Climate Change Credit Corp. would auction the allowances to industry and use the proceeds to promote new environmental technologies.\ But at its debut hearing before a key Senate Environment subcommittee Wednesday, the measure received more critical questions than endorsements.\ While senators of both parties applauded the effort as well- intentioned, they expressed a variety of concerns that pointed to a long and contentious political battle to come.\ Republicans warned the bill could increase energy prices and drive businesses overseas, while some Democrats said the bill does not go far enough.\ ""Families will face pain at the pump,"" said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., a critic of the bill. ""Hardest hit will be the poor and vulnerable with no extra money in their budget for higher energy costs.""\ But Lieberman, the subcommittee chairman, and Warner, the ranking Republican, defended their proposal as a necessary first step to address a global problem.\ ""Just take a look at the dramatic satellite pictures of the melting polar ice caps and you will see with your own eyes ... why we must move with a real sense of purpose to get something substantial done to avert the worst possible consequences of global warming,"" Lieberman said.\ Warner, who is walking with a cane as he recovers from surgery to repair an artery in his leg, said Congress must act now to regain U.S. leadership on an issue of global importance.\ ""I just don't think the United States of America can continue to stay on the sidelines,"" Warner said. ""It's football season. We need to get on the field. This is our opportunity.""\ The Bush administration has opposed mandatory caps on carbon dioxide emissions. But Warner pointed to the success of former President George H. W. Bush, who supported a similar ""cap-and- trade"" system on emissions to reduce so-called acid rain - a program widely considered a success.\ The Lieberman-Warner bill, which has seven co-sponsors, picked up a key endorsement Wednesday when Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, announced his intention to support the measure.\ ""While I have some outstanding concerns with the bill, I believe we can work through them,"" Baucus said.\ Lieberman called the endorsement ""a tremendous boost to our efforts to get a real solution passed in this Congress.""\ He said his subcommittee will vote on the measure next week, after which the full Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will hold additional hearings on it.\ At Wednesday's session, the bill won praise from an environmental lobby, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and from the president of Alcoa Materials Management, one of the world's largest producers of aluminum.\ ""We believe an economy-wide cap-and-trade program has to be at the core of a comprehensive U.S. climate program,"" said Alcoa President Kevin Anton.\ But Paul Cicio, president of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America, said the bill would drive up the price of natural gas and send production facilities offshore.\ Lieberman, taking stock of the initial reception to his measure, said, ""People are grappling with this. And generally speaking, people are acknowledging there's a problem. This is not going to be a pitched partisan battle. This is going to be people wrestling with a problem and trying to fix it."""

\
This week, I pulled up to a gas station pump to fill up my car. As I held the hose and watched the numbers on the pump tick higher and higher, I couldn't help but think of a column I had written several years ago. ""In the last couple of weeks it has become less and less surprising that $20 is hardly sufficient to fill your tank at the gas station,"" I wrote.
\
At that time, the national average at the gas pump was $1.81. My thoughts went to another column I wrote in 2006 where I said ""there is no silver bullet when it comes to energy prices. The common-sense American understands that we cannot drill our way out of the problem, we cannot conserve our way out of the problem, and we cannot alter our lifestyles enough to fix the problem.""
\
This week as I stood at the pump and considered the time that has passed since I wrote those columns, I watched the numbers continue to tick higher and higher and I grew more frustrated.
\
No wonder Americans are so fed up with Congress, I thought to myself. The issue of gas prices alone has been with us for over seven years and we are still here, staring at the pump, wondering why gas prices are still this high.
\
Last month I reintroduced my New Manhattan Project for Energy Independence, which calls for 50 percent energy independence in 10 years and 100 percent energy independence in 20 years. I first introduced the legislation back in 2008, where it was hailed by sources such as CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and the Virginian-Pilot as one of the most innovative energy solutions before Congress. In 2009, the New Manhattan Project was offered as the alternative to the controversial cap-and-trade energy legislation as a solution that relied on innovation, rather than taxation, to pursue alternative energy and achieve a cleaner environment. Ultimately, the New Manhattan Project was voted down on party lines by the then-Democrat controlled Congress.
\
People often ask me why I continue to reintroduce legislation over and over again when it has yet to be signed into law. In fact, I had a reporter ask me just this year why I think the New Manhattan Project should be introduced again in this Congress. ""What will be different?"" she probed. For me, I tell those people, the reason is simple - I do it because it is right. In fact, now more than ever, I believe the time for the New Manhattan Project is right.
\
At the end of February, oil prices peaked to a two-and-a-half year high of $120 a barrel due to rumors that Libyan President Moammar Gaddafi had been assassinated. Libya is the world's 12th largest oil producer and continued strife within the country and the broader Middle East has impacted the entire petroleum export industry. As a result, our oil prices have continued to fluctuate based on the unpredictable events developing in the Middle East.
\
But the United States can no longer afford to allow political and economic unrest in other nations to dictate fuel costs, especially at a time when Americans are already feeling economic pain. Along with increasing our domestic supply of energy through drilling and expansion of clean coal and nuclear power, we must begin looking ahead to solve our energy challenges.
\
While we sit back and allow our gas prices to climb, nations like China are racing ahead in their efforts to achieve energy independence by seizing on technological innovations and making marked progress in relatively unknown areas like nuclear fusion. The Chinese Academy of Science announced in December 2009 that it has begun a new round of controlled nuclear fusion experiments. Their success has already exceeded the progress of both European Union scientists and American nuclear experts, who recently reengaged in fusion research in October 2010. Nuclear fusion remains relatively unexplored in the United States and is just one of many promising sources of energy that can move the United States toward energy independence. It is also one of the goals listed in my New Manhattan Project.
\
The project calls on the United States to reach 50 percent energy independence in 10 years and 100 percent in 20 years, and challenges individuals or groups to reach any of seven established energy goals:
\
- Doubling car fuel efficiency to 70 mpg while keeping vehicles affordable
\
- Cut home and business energy usage in half
\
- Make solar power work at the same cost as coal
\
- Make the production of biofuels cost-competitive with gasoline
\
- Safely and cheaply store carbon emissions from coal-powered plants
\
- Safely store or neutralize nuclear waste
\
- Produce usable electricity from a nuclear fusion reaction
\
There is a reason that so many people have hailed this as the most innovative energy solution in Congress. The New Manhattan Project is the only project that seeks to harness the best in American creativity and ingenuity by creating a competitive environment for scientists and researchers to achieve 100 percent energy independence within 20 years, ending our reliance on foreign sources of oil. Rather than relying on taxation to achieve energy results, with the New Manhattan Project enables the United States to only pay for results once we actually get them. Additionally, the bill encourages researchers, groups, educational institutions and businesses to help share the cost of the work towards achieving the goals.
\
Now more than ever, the time is ripe to make achieving energy independence a top priority for the United States. Now more than ever, I believe we need to catapult our nation towards energy independence and restore our competitive edge across the world. And now more than ever, I believe the New Manhattan Project is the tool to get us there.

21," The Clinton administration put new weight Wednesday behind efforts to bring nationwide competition to the electricity industry, holding out the promise of saving consumers $20 billion a year and helping the environment.\ Reaction to the administration proposal was mixed in Congress, where legislation for electric utility industry deregulation has been bogged down for months.\ Rep. Dan Schaefer, R-Colo., chief sponsor of a House bill, said the administration's long-awaited proposal ""aids the process of getting legislation this year.""\ But Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said he had concerns about much of the administration's approach and would like to see proposed legislation - not an outline of ""principles"" - before moving forward.\ In Virginia, Gov. Jim Gilmore is expected to sign a bill designed to move the state toward a competitive electricity market.\ The bill, passed by both chambers of the General Assembly, sets a target date of Jan. 1, 2001, for wholesale competition among power producers. It also calls for customer choice of electricity suppliers by 2004.\ The administration plan, announced by Energy Secretary Federico Pena, would call for open competition nationwide among electricity suppliers by 2003, but would allow states a way to ""opt out"" and not participate if they believe open competition is not to their benefit.\ Some states where electricity prices already are low have expressed concern that competition might not be beneficial and might lead to reduced services.\ Vice President Al Gore, in a statement, said the proposal, if accepted by Congress, would ""produce big benefits for both our economy and our environment"" and provide ""a down payment on the greenhouse gas reductions needed to avert global warming.""\ At least 16 states, with California and some Northeastern states leading the way, already have moved toward opening their electricity markets over the next few years. Whether federal legislation is needed has been the subject of intense debate.\ ""Americans should have the right to choose their own electricity supplier,"" Pena said, arguing that national legislation is needed to deal with environmental concerns and ensure that low-income customers do not lose service and reliability and regional concerns are addressed.\ ""Choosing an electric supplier should not be any more difficult than choosing a box of cereal,"" he said.\ The administration estimated that widespread competition among power suppliers would save consumers $20 billion a year - $230 per household - in direct electricity costs and indirect savings on products and services that benefit from the competition.\ Some energy experts have questioned whether savings would be that great, arguing that consumers would still be saddled with paying for so-called ""stranded costs"" - leftover bills from a highly regulated industry, such as costs of building nuclear power plants.\ The administration proposal would allow such costs to be passed on to customers under competition, although it would be left to individual states to determine to what extent the costs could be recovered.\ Other key provisions in the administration proposal include:\ * Creation of a $3 billion federal revolving fund to promote conservation and continued assistance to low-income consumers. States would provide matching money and the federal fund would come from a 1/ 10th cent-per-kilowatt-hour surcharge to all electricity customers.\ * Requiring utilities to produce at least 5.5 percent of their electricity from renewable sources such as wind or solar.\ * Establish federal right-to-know disclosure requirements to protect electricity consumers in a competitive market and regulations to ensure reliability.\ While environmentalists praised the conservation assistance fund, they expressed disappointment that the administration plan did not include more substantive measures to deal with global warming.\ Electric utilities account for nearly a third of the leading greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, and environmentalists had hoped the proposal would call for direct regulation of carbon emissions.\ Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner, who joined Pena at a news conference, said the EPA intends to work with Congress to pursue a carbon dioxide cap-and-trade program separate from the electricity restructuring issue. She said the administration remains ""absolutely committed"" to regulating carbon dioxide to help cut greenhouse gases.\ Officials insisted that competition will produce some carbon dioxide reductions from conservation programs and as utilities shift to less carbon-intensive fuels. Some environmentalists, however, suggest the opposite might occur if electricity prices decline, prompting consumers to pay less attention to efficiency and if utilities find cheap coal-fired power plants economical.\ Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists called the proposal ""a missed opportunity to begin meeting our obligations under the Kyoto climate treaty"" to reduce greenhouse emissions.\ Although utilities were divided over the proposal, the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned companies, said the government should not ""link environmental issues and utility restructuring."""
22,"LOS ANGELES -- John McCain picked up the endorsement of actor-turned-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on Thursday and predicted the backing of more political stars are on the way. \""You will see a flood of endorsements across this country from both liberals and conservatives,"" the Republican front-runner said. \The California governor joins Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and former presidential contender Rudy Giuliani, who dropped out of the race Wednesday, on the list of big-name Republicans to back McCain in recent days. The Arizona senator is trying to take command of the Republican race during the contests being held from California to New York on Tuesday. \Some analysts say endorsements help in individual states but may be more valuable in creating a sense of inevitability. ""It just greases the axles of the bandwagon,"" said John Pitney, a former aide to House Republicans who now teaches at Claremont McKenna College near Los Angeles. ""People want to be with a winner."" \Mitt Romney, who is chasing McCain for the nomination, played down Schwarzenegger's support. ""Their views are similar on a number of subjects,"" he said. \In addition to lauding his ""incredible credentials in national security,"" Schwarzenegger praised McCain for his efforts to ""end wasteful spending."" \He also cited McCain's environmental policies during an event at a company that makes solar-paneled roofing. McCain has been a vocal supporter of a plan that would cap greenhouse gas emissions and allow companies to trade emission allowances, known as ""cap and trade."" The senator wants such a program to be mandatory. \Schwarzenegger also lauded McCain for being able to work with Democrats to get things accomplished. Some conservatives say McCain has been too cozy with Democrats and has adopted their positions on the environment, immigration and other issues. \""He's spent a decade now essentially dissing conservatives,"" said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. \McCain said he has support across the spectrum, including independents who will be key in the fall. He noted that he also picked up an endorsement Thursday from conservative Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a former Giuliani backer. \""We need all parts of our party together if we're going to win in November,"" McCain said. ""Our party is beginning to realize that."""
23,"FACEBOOK \On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed cuts in carbon emissions from existing power plants, setting a target of a 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. \It is ridiculous to try to do this on our own. How about getting China and India to do as much as we in the USA have done before we lose more jobs and gain higher energy bills? The EPA isn't protecting any of us if the whole world isn't on board. \Sandy Pappas Zeek \China announced Tuesday that it would cap its emissions by 2016. That is a positive step to help protect the environment. Bravo to both USA and China. \Yang Sun \Note that China hasn't made a pledge with specifics, as the U.S. did. It just said it will have a cap. This is the problem: A few are expected to do all the work. \Frank Loncar \Hold on to your wallets because EPA's plan will crush the middle class. The cost of meeting these emission goals will drive up the cost of power and manufacturing, which in turn will be found in your utility bills. \Lou Creola \A window of greater than 15 years doesn't seem too onerous. Aiming for 2030 gives time to research clean technologies. \Terry Mayer \Just like when we started the space race, we need to start an alternative energy race. If we can find a way to harness solar energy more effectively, we could use it to power everything. \Jason Lewis \I applaud the plan to limit coal-fired power plant emissions. As a resident of northern New England, I gain little benefit from coal-fired plants yet worry about the pollution that has diminished the quality of our air, forests and lakes. \Jim Kardas \Even if these rules go into effect, they probably won't do enough. But we need to try. \David Eck \LETTERS \Last week, NPR interviewed C. Boyden Gray, one of the architects of the bipartisan cap-and-trade policy at the core of the 1990 Clean Air Act President George H.W. Bush signed into law to address acid rain. It was amazing to hear the interview because the Republican pedigree of cap-and-trade is not often acknowledged by today's GOP. \Then-Rep. Jim Inhofe voted for the 1990 Clean Air Act. In 2012, Inhofe told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, ""I was actually on your side of this issue (climate change) when I was chairing that committee, and I first heard about this. I thought it must be true until I found out what it cost."" Too bad Inhofe, now a senator, seems so hostile to reducing carbon emissions, even efforts that would positively affect the economy, such as a revenue-neutral carbon fee. The science of climate change is still true, even if Inhofe doesn't want to admit it anymore. \Devone Tucker \Brockton, Mass. \We are regulated by the EPA for carbon emissions. While we are so structured, who is structuring China and the rest of the world when their carbon emissions are more choking than ours? What is their part in all of this? \Patty Orlando \Villanova, Pa."
24,"WASHINGTON -- After fighting each other for decades, environmentalists and industrial businesses are working together in Congress to clear the air -- literally -- through a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. \While hundreds of groups are lobbying Congress on proposed climate change legislation, the 2-year-old U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) -- which has put rivals General Electric and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) on the same page -- is having more influence than most. \Draft legislation that Democrats hope to advance next month is ""modeled closely"" on the recommendations of the group, according to a summary of the measure provided by its authors. USCAP was repeatedly touted by lawmakers in hearings on the legislation last week. \""It's a remarkable dynamic,"" said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., a member of the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. ""It is not lost on members of Congress that you have this coalition that touches all points of the economy."" \Thirty companies and non-profit organizations belong to the coalition, including Dow Chemical, Duke Energy, the Nature Conservancy and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Members say a united front by disparate groups will be key to approving energy policy -- particularly in the Senate, where 60 votes likely will be needed to overcome a Republican filibuster and win passage. \""We have to construct a system that makes sense not just environmentally but economically,"" said Steve Cochran, director of the climate campaign for the Environmental Defense Fund, a USCAP member. ""Doing it 'with these companies' rather than 'to these companies' makes some sense."" \Under the bill, the government would impose a limit on emissions -- the proposal calls for a 20% reduction from 2005 levels by 2020. Companies that exceed their pollution limit may purchase credits, or ""allowances,"" from other companies that cut emissions by more than required. \Over time, the cap is reduced, and companies must decide whether to invest in technology to cut emissions, purchase more power from renewable sources or buy additional allowances. Both sides get something: environmentalists, a defined cap on emissions; companies, a smooth transition and more certainty. \""We are in that group shoulder to shoulder with several of the country's leading environmental groups,"" said Pacific Gas and Electric spokesman Brian Hertzog. ""There's a lot of similarities between what we're looking to advance and what that community is looking for."" \Significant questions remain, such as whether the government will initially distribute the allowances to companies for free, auction them off or do a combination of both. Also unresolved is how revenue collected by the government for the allowances would be spent. Even so, a number of USCAP recommendations are now part of the draft bill: \*Companies could buy offsets by investing in reforestation or renewable energy that could be used to meet emission targets. \*Carbon polluters could ""bank,"" or save allowances for use in future years. \* The Environmental Protection Agency would create a reserve of allowances that would be made available if the price of the permits rose to ""unexpectedly high levels"" under the system known as cap and trade. \USCAP members argue the proposal must not result in a sudden spike in costs. The EPA estimates that an average household would pay an extra $98 to $140 annually for energy under the cap-and-trade system, but some Republicans say the price tag could be significantly higher. \""Ultimately, it's the end user that is going to pay for this,"" said Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, an energy subcommittee member who said the companies involved with USCAP have had a ""mixed"" impact on the debate. ""Those companies will simply be passing along those higher costs."" \USCAP may help sway moderate members of the House panel, said John Coequyt, a global-warming legislative expert with the Sierra Club, which is not a coalition member. Coequyt, who described the environmentalists in USCAP as ""taking one for the team,"" predicted the effort will be more difficult in the Senate. \The Sierra Club has not taken an official position on the draft bill. Though the group supports many of its provisions, including the timeline for cutting emissions, it would prefer stricter limitations on new coal plants, spokesman Josh Dorner said. \""They negotiated a reasonably tough deal with the other groups in USCAP, and they brought it forward at a pretty tough time,"" Coequyt said. ""On the other hand, the environmental groups probably signed up for something that they might not have been willing to sign up for if they were saying what they really felt."""
25," Democrats turned back on Wednesday repeated efforts by Republican senators to soften the economic effects of a global warming bill before advancing it out of a Senate committee.\ It was the first bill calling for mandatory U.S. limits on greenhouse gases to be taken up in Congress since global warming emerged as an environmental issue more than two decades ago. The bill was endorsed 11-8 by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\ GOP critics of the bill argued that limiting greenhouse gas emissions could become a hardship because of higher energy costs.\ But Sen. John Warner of Virginia, a Republican co-sponsor who gave the bill legitimacy among many moderate GOP senators, called it ""a chance to give America our opportunity ... to be counted on this very, very important issue.""\ ""We now move to the Senate floor,"" said Sen. Joe Lieberman, I- Conn., who with Warner had introduced the legislation.\ The bill calls for the United States to cut carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 70 percent by 2050 from electric power plants, manufacturing and transportation.\ It would create a ""cap-and-trade"" system, wherein companies would have pollution allowances that they could sell if they went below the emission limits - or buy if they found they couldn't meet the requirements.\ The trading is aimed at reducing the economic effects of putting limits on carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, the leading greenhouse gas.\ Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the committee's chairwoman, called the legislation ""historic.""\ But the bill's prospects are anything but certain. It's not expected to come up for action until next year, and many Republicans have vowed to seek significant changes."
26,"As Virginia Sen. John Warner tells it, his legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions will help reduce global warming, lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil and create millions of jobs using new technologies.\""We are trying to solve one of the most difficult problems ever facing America,"" the Republican lawmaker said Monday in offering his bill to the Senate.\""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he added. ""Let us do something.""\But to President Bush and many other Republicans, doing nothing is a far better option than passing Warner's sweeping legislation mandating reductions in carbon emissions from factories, refineries, power plants and other businesses.\The Warner bill, they say, would harm the economy, drive jobs overseas, increase taxes and jack up the already soaring price of gasoline.\""It would have a devastating impact on the U.S. economy,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""It is, at its heart, a stealth and giant tax on virtually every aspect of industrial and consumer life.""\That ideological divide will be on prominent display this week, as the Senate debates a measure that Warner hopes will serve as a capstone to his 30-year Senate career.\Alarmed by the threat of global warning, Warner teamed up with Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat-turned-independent, to co-sponsor a complex bill aimed at cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by about 70 percent below current levels over the next four decades.\While rejecting the creation of a carbon tax, the bill would raise a projected $6.7 trillion over 40 years through the sale and trading of allowances of carbon emissions to meet mandated caps. Money raised through the market-oriented ""cap and trade"" system would be used to help consumers pay for higher energy costs and to help businesses develop new ""green"" technologies.\The measure made modest headway Monday when the Senate agreed to proceed with debate by a vote of 74-14. But within hours of the bill reaching the Senate floor, Bush promised to veto the measure if it reaches his desk in its current form.\Sponsors acknowledged they face an uphill battle in trying to push their legislation through the Senate. While most Democrats appear supportive, many Republicans remain opposed. Democrats effectively have 51 seats in the Senate, but 60 votes will likely be required under Senate rules to approve the measure. And Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., is not expected back on Capitol Hill this week as he recovers from brain surgery.\""I feel confident we'll have over 50,"" Lieberman said of the likely vote tally. ""We have a shot at 60, but it's going to be hard.""\Those apparently long odds make Warner's support all the more critical. As a respected, centrist Republican with a maverick streak, Warner could help persuade reluctant Republicans to come on board.\Kicking off what could be the most difficult legislative fight of his career, the retiring senator told reporters at a news conference Monday he was prepared to push for a victory no matter the odds.\""I'm going in with the concept we're going to win,"" Warner said. ""I'm going to keep my shoulder to the wheel until that final vote is taken.""\But if other Republicans are ready to join Warner, they have been slow in coming to his side. When the bill passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this year, Warner was the sole Republican voting for it.\Hoping to address conservatives' unease, Warner stressed a provision of the bill allowing the president to suspend the proposed emissions caps in times of emergency.\Warner and other sponsors also rejected the notion that the bill amounts to a large tax increase. They noted it provides nearly $800 billion over 40 years in tax relief to help consumers pay for higher energy costs.\In the opening hours of debate, senators traded dueling statistics to make their case for and against the bill. Critics, including the White House, said it would raise gasoline prices by $1.40 a gallon by 2050. Supporters said any price increase would be modest, noting prices have already risen by 250 percent since Bush took office in 2001."
27,"PITTSBURGH -- Many executives would find it hard to be cheery as they enter a new year marked by a wobbly economy, uncertain political trends and new technologies that pose profound challenges to old business models. \Yet General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt seems buoyant. \He says GE revenue will grow as much as 15% next year. And he bases his confidence, at least in part, on some of his initiatives since he replaced his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch, just days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \Immelt, 51, has pushed the company to expand in growth markets overseas. He also has made GE a leader in manufacturing a new generation of environmentally friendly technologies. \Many investors remain skeptical. The stock has underperformed the market during Immelt's tenure and is flat in 2007. \Investors seem to find it hard to make sense of a company poised to end this year generating about $172 billion in revenue from interests that span jet engines, energy production, commercial and consumer finance, health care equipment, home appliances and entertainment. \Further complicating matters have been a huge write-down in 2007 from a lending subsidiary dealing in subprime mortgages and a strike by TV and movie script writers that could lead to dramatic changes for NBC Universal. \Immelt discussed his company's challenges and opportunities with USA TODAY's David Lieberman at the seventh USA TODAY CEO Forum, in conjunction with the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. \The interview took place in front of an audience. These are edited transcripts. \QYou've spoken to Wall Street analysts. Next month, GE has its annual retreat in Boca Raton, Fla., for executives. What's your message? \A: We have always positioned the company to be a safe and reliable growth company. So if you think about what's going in the world, there's really kind of three big themes. \One is that the U.S. housing market is in retreat and the U.S. consumer is under real stress because of that. \Theme No. 2 is that global growth has never been healthier. I've never seen a time in my career where the global economy is less related to the U.S. economy than it is today, which is, I think, a good thing, not a bad thing. \And then the third thing is that there is a whole series of what I would call synthetic debt vehicles that just didn't work. Collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles. They're ugly when they end. \So what we try to tell investors is that this is a company that can still grow earnings 10% and still generate high returns because of the diversity of what we have, because of the strength of our businesses and the quality of the risk management we have as a company. \In 2007, for the first time in the history of GE, we'll have more revenue outside the United States than we'll have inside the United States. Our business outside the United States will grow between 15% and 20% next year. We're a $172 billion company. In 2008, with the U.S. economy growing at 1.5%, we'll grow revenue by 15% because we're in the right places with the right products at the right time. \Q: Domestically, you're not projecting a recession? \A: CEOs are lousy economists. I take what the world thinks. The world basically pegs the U.S. GNP (growth) next year at somewhere between 1.5% and 2.5%. Basically, the U.S. is in full employment. Interest rates are coming down rapidly. \There doesn't have to be a recession in the U.S. if everybody keeps their wits and if the Fed does what it can do and things like that. I just think there will be a real slowdown because (of) housing. In 50 years, the median house in the United States has never declined. It will decline in '07, it will probably decline in '08 and might decline in '09. \On China \QYou want to expand into China. Does it help GE to have the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing on NBC? \A: The Olympics are just a fantastic global brand. For those 17 nights, you really captivate the world. And if you're a global company like ours, you get a natural positive spin by being a part of the Olympics. It helps the totality of the company. \We also signed up in 2003 to be an Olympic sponsor. So at the Beijing Olympics, we'll do about $600 million of other GE business -- health care, electrical equipment, things like that. \One of the things we were able to negotiate with the Olympic committee is that all of the events are going to be televised live, which probably means that the swimming that you're going to watch at maybe 10 o'clock at night is actually going to be 9 o'clock in the morning in Beijing. The athletes weren't so thrilled about it, but we think it's going to be great viewing for most Americans. \Q: You've hung your hat on the environment, but China doesn't seem to care. \A: Young Chinese want money. They want clothes. They want freedom. They want to have access to the Internet. They want everything you want. And they don't want to live in squalor. \Their point of view is that at the time in which this country had great economic expansion, we could have cared less about the environment. We used coal. We did whatever it took to grow this economy. \But I'm a firm believer that the environment in China and India has to be cleaned up, will be cleaned up, mainly because the population won't tolerate it any other way. And companies like GE will be big benefactors of those investments. \Q: Can you put pressure on them? \A: The basic answer is, no. We have a lot of influence. We may have as much influence as any other company. But, in the end, we're not political beings. We meet with the government and politicians (and) we very strongly endorse and suggest that they should be working hard on their environment and environmental policy. And we're trying to sell them stuff to help them do it, whether it's coal gasification, whether it's wind energy, whether it's water desalination, to be an active participant in it. \Q: Human rights activists also say you should put pressure on China to resolve the conflict in Darfur. \A: We've been a big contributor to a lot of the relief efforts in Darfur and throughout Africa and will continue to do so. But, basically, I'm not a politician. It would be not accurate to assume that I carry political clout when we go around the world. \The decision that every company has to make in China is: Are you going to be in or are you going to be out? \So you can sit on the sidelines. We can talk about how terrible everything is, how awful everything is, how backwards it is and how we wish they did this, that and the other thing as a sideline character. Or we get in the battle. We build factories, we try to establish political ties, economic ties. And I think if we don't do that progressively as a company, we're going to move backwards -- as a company and as a country. \So, do I agree with everything, do I like everything? No. But, you know, that's probably true of my mother-in-law as well. Right? But I love her. In the end, you have to say, I'm either in or I'm out. And if you're in, you've got to be in all the way. And if you're not in, you say goodbye to that chapter in history. \On health care \QYou're a major manufacturer of health care equipment as well as a major employer. What do you think of the health care system here? \A: Health care is about 14% of GNP (gross national product). It's growing roughly 10% a year. If you look at the bow wave of demographics that are coming in terms of how long people are going to live and how long people that are living are going to be on the government dole, if you will, it's a big challenge. \We've got to do something about health insurance. It adds cost. \We have to do something about the transparency of quality measures and have reimbursement follow quality in terms of outcomes. \We have to do something about getting information technology broadly into the system. \We've got to do something that modernizes the Food and Drug Administration and (help) new technology get to market faster, but have a way to measure its efficacy. \(However,) health care is one of the few export industries we have. We shouldn't dismember this important industry just because we get demagogued and things like that. \On TV \Q How long do you think \the TV and screenwriters \strike is going \to last? \A: The strike has been going on for six weeks. And \(talks have) broken apart again. This is about something \important, which is fundamentally how the \digital revenue streams get sorted out between \video content companies like NBC Universal and the \writers and directors. \My hope is it doesn't last too much longer, but I \think the differences are profound and, to a certain \extent, they're worth taking a strong stand on. \Q: If it does last, will you lose money, \or will you come out OK because your \programming costs will go down? \A: What I would say is, prepare yourself \for lots of reality TV. So, yeah, I'd like to put \in a plug right now for maybe five nights a \week of Deal or No Deal. \I hope the strike gets settled amicably, \but I think everybody in the classic analog \network (TV) business has to rethink the \business model. You can't be in businesses \where the revenues go down and the costs \go up. \If you go back and take a classic TV show \like The West Wing, that might be a $1 billion franchise. \If you paid a billion dollars (for the show), you \could sell advertising on air and sell it back into \syndication for $2 billion. \If Heroes turns out to be as successful as West \Wing, which I think it could be, we will have to have \sold it 25 times. We will have to have sold it online, \globally, (with conventional TV) advertising, in your \Christmas stocking. \Q How do you compete with someone who feels like he's on a mission from God? For example, Rupert Murdoch paid $5 billion for Dow Jones, which owns The Wall Street Journal, and will use it to help launch his Fox Business Network. You had the same opportunity to protect CNBC. \A: If there's anybody you should admire in the business world, it's Rupert Murdoch. I'm a rabid competitor of Rupert. I want to beat him so badly I can't even describe it. \But when I shave in the morning, I'm worried about investors. When he shaves in the morning, he says, ""Hello, Investor. How are you doing today?"" \So you've got to have some disciplines that maybe he doesn't always have. \When I looked at Dow Jones, there wasn't one person in the entirety of GE that knew a gosh darn thing about running a newspaper. Not a one. So we're not going to pay $5 billion for The Wall Street Journal when we have no domain, no expertise, just because he is. No, thank you. \Now, when it comes to CNBC competing against Fox Business Network, we're going to try to crush them. In other words, we won't spare any expense. We won't try to do anything other than totally beat them. I've got as many tools as Rupert does, and maybe then some. \On leadership... \QWhat skills do people need to be leaders 10 and 20 years from now, especially in international business? \A: It's curiosity. It's being good with people. And it's having perseverance, hard work, thick skin. Those are three traits that every successful person that I've ever known has in common. \Most of what I learned when I was young was how to be a general manager. But successful leaders in the next 10 or 20 or 30 years will have to be real experts. They're going to have to know how to pick products. They're going to have to know how to pick countries. \What you should be learning is how to develop your own touch and feel for customers, technology, innovation, globalization -- things like that. ... And we're really in a what-and-where generation, not so much a who-and-how generation today. \Q: Generation Y has a different view of work. Does your management program need change? \A: Generation Y -- whatever they call it -- I've never seen people smarter, more curious, more worldly. I am so optimistic about the talent that I see. \The other thing I would tell Generation Y is that there's Generation A in India. And they want what you have. They want quality of living. They want a second car. They want a vacation home. \So either with you or with them, I'm going to build a future for GE. \Q: Does GE have a program to develop leaders internationally? \A: Our leadership programs are really global programs. If you walked into a GE factory in China, you could eat off the floor. It would have Six Sigma (quality improvement methodology). It would have managers that talk statistical process control, engineering control. So everything we do in one place, we do everyplace else. That is important, No.1. \No.2, the GE Foundation. We give about $100 million or maybe more to secondary education globally, mainly U.S., though. And this is to get more kids in high school to study math and science. Every successful country that I've ever seen -- if you said, ""What do they have in common?"" -- they graduate a lot of engineers. Or they have a lot of oil. \The biggest educational issue that we've got in this country: not enough people who are really strong in math and science, not enough kids who want to become engineers. And we've got to solve that. \...and leading GE \QYou can't be an expert in everything. Do you have a sniff test to be sure that you're getting good information? \A: I have things I watch. I watch rail loadings in the United States. I watch trailer rentals. I watch consumer delinquency. I get these things every day. So I have probably a dozen statistics that I have found, over time, are leading indicators of what's going on. \I'm on the board of the New York Fed, which I joined three years ago, so even though I didn't get A's in economics, I rub shoulders with people who got A's in economics at least once a month. And I kind of stir it all up in terms of how it feels and talk to the board -- and that's how I make decisions. \The only way to run a company like GE, with our size and mass and everything, is: Bad news has to travel as fast as good news. You have to have a management team and a culture where people are trained to give you bad news on losses, bad news on what's going on in markets. \Q: A company as big as yours suffers from the law of large numbers. You have to grow much more than a smaller company for the results to be meaningful. Is there any logic in splitting up the company? \A: In the last five years, we've sold 40% of our revenue. So we're a company that always has refreshed itself. We should always be very tough-minded about what fits and what doesn't fit. \But we try to position ourselves in big themes where size is an advantage. \The first one is infrastructure and infrastructure technology. This is energy, water, oil and gas, things like that. That's a $70 billion business that will grow 15% a year for the next five years. That's a business where small people need not apply. \Emerging markets -- $32 billion of our company's in emerging markets. This is China, India, Turkey, Eastern Europe, Russia, Latin America. That's going to pull the whole company along. \Our incremental growth next year will be $20 billion. So we're growing the company each year bigger than Nike, bigger than a lot of companies, but we can only do that if you make size an advantage and not let it be a disadvantage. \On politics \QYou said you're not a political person. Does that mean you're not going to make any contributions in the upcoming presidential campaign? \A: My main political party is GE. The company has always stayed pretty bipartisan. Will there be contributions? Sure. But I would say they'll be equal as time goes on. \Q: So you haven't picked any particular candidate at this point? \A: No. And I won't. I'm a CEO of a public company. You know in many ways the only reason why people know me is because I run a big company. And I don't ever want to confuse that with me taking a public position on stuff that fundamentally doesn't help GE investors. And so I just think that's the right position to have if you're running a public company. \On subprime troubles \QYou had a tough experience this year with the subprime mortgage market. \A: In about 2003, we bought a subprime originator called WMC in California. We ran it for probably two or three years. We paid, I don't know, $400 million, something like that, for it. We tracked it very hard. In the latter part of 2006, the market began to change. At the end of the first quarter of 2007, we basically made the decision to exit the business. And we probably wrote off $800 million, something like that, as we exited the business. \(Buying WMC) was a bad business decision, you know. It was the wrong business at the wrong time. It's not the first time we've done it. It won't be the last time we've done it. But that's kind of been the history. \Q: What lesson did you learn? \A: There are two lessons. One is the fundamental business decision that you could underwrite for somebody else to hold an asset, in the end, just was flawed. All of the other businesses we're in we hold ourselves. In other words, we underwrite for our own standards. The other one was: When you find something that doesn't work, exit immediately. And that's what we did here. \Look, if you run a big company, you're going to make mistakes. We bought Kidder Peabody in the \80s, sold it in the '90s. We got stuck on auto loans in the late '90s. We had a private-equity book in the late '90s. \At GE, we tolerate failure, but we don't tolerate a lack of learning. So, basically, we only let you make the same mistake once. That's the only way you can learn, I think, in a successful company of any kind. \On going green \QYou're one of the first big companies to take a bold stand to go green. Was that mostly a moral decision or a business decision? \A: I'd say it's more a business decision. We were doing business reviews in 2003-2004. And when I spoke to our energy business, our rail business, our appliance business, really a bunch of different businesses, they were all working on fuel efficiency, conservation and greenhouse gas emission reduction. \Our team got together and said, ""This is going to be a big theme."" So we launched, in 2005, what we call Ecomagination. We committed to having a certain level of customer engagement. We committed to hard revenue numbers. And we committed to reducing our own carbon footprint by 1% a year. \The world's kind of come our way. Society has just changed its mind about the environment in the U.S. and around the world. I learned a long time ago that when society changes its mind, business better get on board, get ahead of it or you'll get crushed by it. \But if this was only about reputation, I wouldn't have done it. My name's not above the door. It's GE. I work for investors. Our reputation first and foremost comes from being a great-executing, high-performance company. \Q: Al Gore wants to replace payroll taxes with a carbon tax (a tax on greenhouse gas emissions). \A: I'm a member of a group called the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, and our position really is about a cap-and-trade system (a cap on emissions and an exchange where companies could buy and sell allowances to produce them). At the end of the day, I think there should be a real dialogue between tax and cap-and-trade and things like that. \I think that there should be a market for carbon. That can be delivered with a cap-and-trade. It also can be delivered with a tax. \If you look at the most profitable energy asset in U.S. history, it's nuclear power plants. They're all 30 years old, and they're fully depreciated. \But if you're a utility CEO and you have to make a decision to invest in nuclear power, it's a hard decision. It's a $3 billion project. If you're 58, it's going to come online by the time you're long retired. \With no price for carbon, why would anybody take that kind of risk? That's why these market signals are so gosh darn important. \--- \About GE chief Jeffrey Immelt \Born: Cincinnati \Education: Dartmouth College, B.A. in applied mathematics; Harvard MBA. \Early job: At Duncan Hines, marketing Moist & Easy Brownie Mix with Steve Balmer, now CEO of Microsoft.

28,"WARDENSVILLE, W.Va. -- Here's a low-cost solution to global warming: chicken manure. \At Josh Frye's poultry farm in West Virginia, the chicken waste is fed into a large, experimental incinerating machine. Out comes a charcoal-like substance known as ""biochar"" -- which is not only an excellent fertilizer, but also helps keep carbon in the soil instead of letting it escape into the atmosphere, where it acts as a greenhouse gas. \Former vice president and environmental advocate Al Gore calls biochar ""one of the most exciting new strategies"" available to stop climate change. For Frye, it means that, before long, ""the chicken poop could be worth more than the chickens themselves."" \""I thought it was crazy at first, and my wife still thinks it's nuts,"" admits Frye, 44. Yet he has sold nearly $1,000 worth of biochar to farmers as far away as New Jersey, and plans to sell much more as he refines production. Venture capitalists, soil scientists and even members of Congress have all come to Frye's farm to see whether his example can be repeated. \Techniques such as biochar may represent the best compromise between what's good for the environment, and what's affordable during the recession, says Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who visited Frye's farm in August. As political support in Washington fades for more expensive pollution-fighting measures, such relatively cheap green technology may represent the immediate future of the environmental movement, analysts say. \The strategies range from the simple, such as putting carbon dioxide filters on top of smokestacks, to the controversial, such as a recent United Nations proposal to give out more free condoms -- which would in turn slow population growth, leading to fewer greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the planet to warm, the U.N. says. \Taken together, a ""portfolio"" of low-cost initiatives could have a meaningful, positive impact on the environment, says Jae Edmonds, a prominent climate change scientist at the University of Maryland. \More ambitious plans have stalled recently, including ""cap and trade"" legislation in the Senate that would set a national limit on greenhouse gas emissions and force companies to buy and sell permits to emit carbon dioxide. December's 193-nation environmental summit in Copenhagen failed to produce a binding treaty to cut global pollution. \""You have to make do with what you've got,"" Edmonds says. ""If these other proposals are being deferred, then in the years ahead, we need to embrace these low-cost technologies that can get people excited ... because every little bit helps."" \Biochar is typical of the promise -- and potential pratfalls -- of such technologies. Scientists are still trying to determine how much of an impact biochar can really make in reducing pollution. \In recent years, some promising ideas have either fallen short of expectations or had unintended negative consequences. \For example, the widespread use of corn ethanol as an additive to gasoline has caused U.S. food prices to rise sharply while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles by less than 1% a year, according to a report published last year by the Congressional Budget Office. \Timothy LaSalle, CEO of the Rodale Institute, a Pennsylvania-based non-profit group that advocates organic farming, says recent research indicates that a widespread shift to organic farming and other changes in how rural land is managed would trap such a large amount of carbon in the ground that they essentially could cancel out all carbon emissions from man-made sources, such as power plants. \LaSalle's predictions have bothered some scientists and environmental activists who accuse him of being too optimistic. LaSalle says he recently received a phone call from one of Gore's assistants challenging his findings. (Kalee Kreider, a Gore spokeswoman, had no comment.) \""I understand that scientists need to be conservative, but what we need right now are the outliers and extreme innovators to step forward and help solve this problem,"" LaSalle says. ""We've got to clean up this atmosphere as fast as we can."" \Seeing dollar signs \As with many new green initiatives, Frye's began with one main objective -- money. \""I always thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice to burn all this manure and use the heat to warm the chicken houses?' "" he recalls. Frye's farm produces up to 800,000 chickens a year, and hatchlings need to be kept at a steady temperature of about 90 degrees, resulting in about $30,000 a year in propane costs. \Research led Frye to an Illinois-based company, Coaltec Energy, which produces gasifiers for agricultural use. To afford the machine's approximately $1 million cost, Frye applied for grants and low-interest loans from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a federal agency that aids soil and water protection efforts, plus the West Virginia Department of Agriculture and other state agencies. \The machine looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Ladders and tubes stick out from seemingly everywhere, and Frye has spent the past three years figuring out the best way to use it. \What makes the machine special is its ability to heat the manure in an extremely low-oxygen environment -- a process that produces no smoke and no smell. \Some of the resulting heat is, in turn, funneled into one of Frye's chicken houses, where it helps keep his hatchlings warm. \It's the byproduct of the process -- the biochar -- that has environmentalists most excited, and has Frye seeing dollar signs. \Biochar can be produced from several sources including wood and switchgrass, and it was first used in agriculture several centuries ago by Amazon Indians. Only recently have scientists begun to fully appreciate its impact on the environment, says Johannes Lehmann, a soil scientist at Cornell University. \Because biochar contains high levels of carbon, the element contained in all living things, it often serves as a very effective organic fertilizer, Lehmann says. That, in turn, produces healthier plants which, through photosynthesis, suck more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. \Another aspect of biochar may be even more beneficial. Under normal circumstances, the carbon in waste material -- a leaf that falls to the forest floor, for example -- decays naturally, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. \But Lehmann says the carbon in biochar is particularly resistant to that conversion, so it stays ""locked into"" the soil much longer than other, unprocessed substances -- as long as 1,000 years in some cases. \""That's the key,"" Lehmann says. ""Through this process, you're taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere."" He says that even a relatively small-scale effort using such methods ""could make a significant dent in emissions on a global level."" \How much of a 'gamble'? \Lehmann says he and other researchers are still exploring which kinds of material make the best biochar, and how effectively it works in certain soils. He calls Frye a ""front-runner"" in poultry biochar, and says other producers may follow his example. \Meanwhile, Frye is working on increasing the carbon content of his biochar, which would make it more valuable. He frequently mails samples to scientists for analysis. When he wants to gauge the quality right away, he admits with a smile that he puts a little char in his mouth. (""If it's pasty and hard to swallow, then it's impure,"" Frye says.) \When Frye's machine operates at full capacity, it churns out as much as 9,000 pounds of biochar per day. \Based on his contacts with businesses, Frye says he can sell high-quality biochar for $1 a pound. ""There's big-time people ... looking at this,"" he says. \That gold-rush mentality has given some people pause. LaSalle, the organic farming advocate, fears biochar has become overhyped, cautioning ""there is too much venture capital involved."" \Pat Mooney, director of ETC Group, a Canadian environmental organization, describes biochar as a ""gamble."" \""It becomes an excuse for others to say: 'Hey, don't worry, we don't have to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions.' And that's just not true,"" Mooney says. \Even Mike McGolden, president of the company that sold Frye his gasifier, is cautious. \He says Frye's experimentation has paved the way for larger-scale producers, including a dairy farm and chicken egg-laying operations in the Chesapeake Bay area, to acquire similar technology. He says it's still unclear whether the technology will prove viable for other small-scale farmers. \Still, Moore Capito, the congresswoman, says she was ""very excited"" by Frye's operation during her recent tour of homegrown green initiatives in her home state, which included solar and wind farms. \""In the long run, these things might take a little longer (than cap and trade) to produce positive results, but then again they might not. We just don't know,"" Moore Capito says. \For Frye, it's a win-win. \""This started as a way for me to make savings,"" he says. ""But if it's good for me, and it's good for the planet too, hey, you sure can't beat that."""
29,"The railing against Washington continued Thursday as Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli accused the federal government of promoting environmental policies that will hurt the nation's economy.\Speaking at an energy conference organized by Gov. Bob McDonnell, the state's top lawyer took aim at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which under the Obama administration has stepped up efforts to reduce air and water pollution.\The EPA's finding that greenhouse gases are a public health threat - and its subsequent attempt to regulate them - is an overstep of authority, Cuccinelli said. He is one of several attorneys general with lawsuits pending to stop the EPA.\Rumored to be considering a run for governor or the U.S. Senate, Cuccinelli said federal policymakers need to find a balance between protecting the environment and promoting inexpensive, reliable energy.\""The EPA does not strike that balance at all,"" he said.\His comments come after McDonnell, speaking at the conference Wednesday, criticized the federal government for taking too long to approve energy projects such as offshore wind farms and coal-fired power plants.\EPA officials said last December that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases emitted from power plants, vehicles, factories and other sources ""threaten the public health and welfare of the American people."" Most scientists believe the gases contribute to global warming.\The EPA called on Congress to enact legislation, such as a cap-and-trade program, designed to reduce greenhouse gases. After more than a year of sporadic debate, lawmakers have yet to do so. Consequently, EPA officials said they would regulate greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act.\Cuccinelli, a global warming skeptic, said cap-and-trade regulations could cost a typical Virginia household $3,000 a year in higher utility bills and in higher costs for other products. He said he got that number from a report from The Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank.\He also cited a report from the National Association of Manufacturers that says Virginia could lose up to 50,000 jobs over 10 years.\""I'm sure that India and China are ecstatic about the legislation,"" said Cuccinelli, who predicted that American businesses would move their operations overseas.\The Congressional Budget Office estimates that cap and trade regulation would have little overall effect on the number of jobs because while it would eliminate some jobs it would create others.\Like many speakers at the energy conference, Cuccinelli said the U.S. needs to cut its reliance on foreign oil. It could do so, he said, by investing in both fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, and renewable energy.\The conference, which included a speech from oilman billionaire T. Boone Pickens, is part of McDonnell's attempt to brand Virginia as the ""Energy Capital of the East Coast."""
30," The Environmental Protection Agency has announced plans that could encourage the storage of carbon dioxide emissions deep underground, an emerging ""clean"" energy technique that energy experts say will help reduce the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.\ Capturing carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants before it's emitted and then injecting it thousands of feet into the ground is becoming an increasingly viable option, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study released in March.\ The study said storing emissions underground would be ""the critical enabling technology"" to achieve the conflicting goals of curbing greenhouse gases and meeting energy needs. ""Absent a technological breakthrough that we do not foresee, coal, in significant quantities, will remain indispensable"" in power production.\ Coal-fired power plants, the source of almost half the nation's electricity, emitted about one-third of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 2005, according to the Department of Energy.\ If the regulation EPA will propose settles issues such as preventing leaks and monitoring storage sites, it might remove one obstacle to the commercialization of underground carbon dioxide storage.\ ""The private sector needs certainty when making investments,"" says EPA associate deputy administrator Jason Burnett. The Energy Department is also investing: It announced last week it will spend $197 million over 10 years for underground carbon sequestration.\ The department estimates that North America can hold about 3.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide beneath the Earth's surface, theoretically enough to store U.S. emissions for centuries.\ ""Oil and gas have been trapped forever, so you know that the zones that it came from have the ability to hold the gas,"" says Mark Stewart, a geologist at the University of South Florida. ""What's holding everything back is a very uncertain regulatory environment."" The EPA expects to propose the rules next summer.\ Storing carbon dioxide underground is the last step in a process that could prevent more than 90% of a given power plant's emissions from reaching the atmosphere.\ The technology for removing the carbon dioxide before it's emitted has existed for decades. For example, the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in North Dakota captures its carbon dioxide, then sells it and pipes the gas to oil companies in Canada. Those firms inject the gas thousands of feet underground, which pushes remaining pockets of oil toward the fields' surface.\ Also needed, says Rich Furman, an independent energy technology consultant, is a carbon tax or a cap and trade program to make it costly to emit carbon dioxide. Only then, he says, will utilities and other industries store carbon dioxide on a scale large enough to substantially reduce global emissions.\ ""Right now, since there are no regulations requiring removal of CO2, it's only being done where they can make a profit by reselling it,"" he says."
31,"A long-term study conducted by University of Virginia scientists shows that Virginia's trout streams are rebounding from acidification, though not as fast or as thoroughly as waters in some other parts of the country.\The results were derived from a series of extensive surveys of water quality, conducted in 1987, 2000 and 2010. More than 100 volunteers, many from Trout Unlimited, which is cooperating with U.Va. on the study, fanned out across the state's mountains to collect this year's samples.\Most trout streams are in forested mountain watersheds, where the cool, oxygen-rich water that trout love is most common. Volunteers hit streams from Shenandoah County in the north to Scott County in the south. Locally, water was drawn from sites in the western parts of Madison, Greene, Albemarle and Nelson counties.\""I think brook trout sort of represent what's best of what remains of the natural world,"" said Rick Webb, a U.Va. scientist and the project's coordinator.\Brook are the native trout of the East Coast, revered by anglers as symbols of pristine nature more than for size or fight. The trout, top predators in their environment, range from deep green along their backs to yellow-pale bellies, their sides speckled with red and blue.\They aren't particularly sensitive creatures in the streams, unlike other creatures, such as mayflies.\""The aquatic community is degraded long before the trout disappear,"" Webb said.\Brook trout are sensitive to a variety of other factors related to water quality, he said, and other species of trout, some of which reproduce in the wild in Virginia, can be more sensitive to acid than are native brook trout.\The study's results showed a marked improvement in water quality for brook trout since 2000, in contrast with the infinitesimal uptick in water quality scientists found from 1987 to 2000.\Scientists measured sulfate levels in the streams, as well as acid-neutralizing capacity. When sulfate from the atmosphere reaches water, it turns to sulphuric acid. It's best known as acid rain, though rain isn't the only way it can end up acidifying waterways.\Median sulfate levels dropped by about 6 percent from 1987 to 2000. From 2000 to 2010, they dropped about 13 percent.\Median acid-neutralizing capacity increased about 16 percent from the first to second surveys and 55 percent from the second to third surveys.\The results are preliminary, and researchers are working to calculate what effect differences between water levels from year to year have on the data, but indications are that their findings won't change significantly, Webb said.\While Virginia has seen notable improvement, it's not as pronounced as the improvement seen in states in the Northeast. Webb attributed the variation mostly to differences in soil types.\""Things have not fully recovered by any means,"" Webb said.\The ground in some parts of Virginia will have a delaying effect on improvements, while other areas are permanently degraded, Webb said.\""Many of the streams that have been most impacted are likely not ever to recover, at least in a human time frame,"" Webb said.\Webb attributed much of the improvement to the most recent amendments to the Clean Air Act. The amendments were passed in 1990 but phased in since.\According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Acid Rain Program, which was part of the 1990 amendments, has helped to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions to 33 percent of 1980 levels.\""Nationwide, it's a success story,"" said Frank Rambo, a senior attorney with the Charlottesville-based Southern Environmental Law Center.\The program created a cap-and-trade system for sulphur dioxide emissions from power generation, a phenomenon most commonly associated with coal-powered electricity generation. Sulphur dioxide is a precursor to acid rain.\At the time, there was heated opposition to the move, Rambo said.\A cap-and-trade program sets limits on how much pollution a plant can produce. If companies beat the target, they get a credit that they can sell to companies that don't hit their targets. The program was implemented gradually, expanding to cover more plants and ratcheting down the caps. The last phase took effect this year, according to the EPA.\Modern coal-fired power plants can capture 95 percent to 99 percent of the sulphur dioxide they create, said Steve Gates, spokesman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, an industry lobbying group.\Rambo said other EPA regulations, not intended to combat acid rain, also have cut emissions chemicals that contribute to the problem.\Webb cautioned that, while there has been improvement, there are chemicals damaging the environment.\""Even though sulfate deposition has been reduced, it certainly hasn't been reduced to background level,"" Webb said.\Gates said that acid deposition is not at the forefront of Washington debate these days.\""What you hear is how much (sulphur dioxide) can be reduced,"" he said."
32,"He pushed to make homes and businesses more energy efficient. He offered government incentives for renewable power and, early in his administration, tried to tackle climate change with fees on excessive corporate emitters of greenhouse gases. \President Obama? Well, it may sound like him, but it's GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts -- a blue state with a Democratic-led legislature -- from 2003 to 2007. \The two men have fairly similar governing records on energy and environmental issues. Their campaign rhetoric, however, has differed on just about everything except boosting the nation's production of oil and natural gas. \Obama says the United States, despite a jump in oil and gas produced during his administration, cannot drill its way to energy independence. So he touts his push to double fuel economy for new cars and light trucks by 2025, increase solar and wind energy, and eliminate $4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil and gas companies. \Romney, who says the key to his goal of North American energy independence by 2020 is more drilling, favors those tax breaks. He opposes tax credits for large wind producers, which Obama says he'll renew so they don't expire Dec. 31. \Romney supports the entire Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas, the northern half of which Obama has so far declined to approve. \""There's a big difference"" between the two candidates, says David Kreutzer, an energy expert at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. ""There's an anti-fossil fuel thrust with this administration that would change"" under Romney. \""When it comes to our energy future, voters have a clear choice,"" agrees Heather Taylor-Miesle, director of the NRDC Action Fund, an environmental advocacy group. ""Romney's fossil-fuels-first approach is nothing more than drill, baby, drill -- with a nice haircut,"" she writes, adding that Obama has supported oil drilling to an extent that her group finds ""excessive."" \Romney as governor \What puzzles some analysts, in comparing the two candidates, is Romney's past. His record as governor differs markedly from his presidential campaign positions. \""There's a lot of similarity"" between Romney's record as governor and Obama's as president, says Kateri Callahan of the Alliance to Save Energy, a non-profit group that advocates energy efficiency. She applauds both men for the work they've done. \""He (Romney) really did drive energy efficiency into the Massachusetts economy,"" Callahan says, noting he backed tax credits -- up to $600 for individuals -- for homes and businesses to make efficiency upgrades. \She says he also supported efficiency and renewable energy projects, investing $15 million of state money into the Massachusetts Green Energy Fund LP, a venture-capital firm that helped finance about a dozen companies. Three of those companies have since gone under, including solar panel manufacturer Konarka, which received $1.5 million. \Romney, who once stood in front of a coal plant and said it ""kills people,"" launched a Climate Protection Plan in 2004 to reduce industrial greenhouse gas emissions as part of -- in his words -- a ""no regrets"" policy toward climate change. \His staff drafted the country's first interstate cap-and-trade system to cut emissions, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or RGGI. By the time RGGI was ready for his signature in late 2005, he had announced he wouldn't seek re-election, prompting speculation he might run for president. He declined to sign it, citing potential costs to state businesses. \Romney struck a balance as governor, says Brian Gilmore of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state's largest organization of employers. ""He certainly wasn't anti-environment, but he was concerned about potential regulations and their impact on employers,"" says Gilmore, who was glad that Romney walked away from RGGI. \His gubernatorial record is ""kind of a tale of two stories,"" says David Jenkins of ConservAmerica, a GOP environmental group. He says Romney was very pro-environment in his first two years but later got ""cold feet"" on some initiatives such as RGGI. ""He now sounds more like Rush Limbaugh than Ronald Reagan,"" says Jenkins, adding he won't vote for him. \Obama's record \Yet Jenkins says he also won't support Obama, citing disappointment that Obama didn't push hard enough to win Congress' approval of federal cap-and-trade legislation. The bill passed the House but faltered in the Senate. \Obama has a mixed record with environmentalists. He's been criticized for pulling back an EPA proposal to limit ozone emissions linked to smog, approving the southern half of the Keystone XL pipeline and failing to create new wilderness areas that would be protected from development. \They've lauded his support of renewable energy, which has doubled its U.S. production since 2008, his mandate for doubling vehicle fuel-efficiency and his EPA rules limiting carbon-dioxide emissions from new power plants, including coal-fired ones. \These rules have caused Obama heartburn on the campaign trail. Campaigning in coal country, where the president's popularity has plummeted, Romney has blamed Obama's EPA for putting coal miners out of work. \""The regulations may have long-term impact"" on the coal industry, but recent mine closures are due more to the plunge in prices for natural gas that make coal less cost-competitive, says Ted Boettner, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, a non-partisan research group. \--- \Comparing five key issues \1. Oil/gas drilling \Obama: Rejected the initial northern half of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Canada to Texas, but deferred a final decision. Proposed opening more offshore areas to oil and gas drilling but maintains moratorium off the Pacific and most of the Atlantic coasts. Seeks federal safety standards for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a process by which natural gas is extracted. Opposes $4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil and gas companies. \Romney: Approves of Keystone XL pipeline. Favors giving states the ability to regulate drilling and issue leases (even on federal land). Supports opening all federal land for oil and gas drilling, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Pacific, Atlantic and Alaskan coasts. Backs tax credits for manufacturers, including oil and gas companies. \2. Renewable energy \Obama: Favors renewal of the tax credit for utility-scale wind producers, slated to expire Dec. 31. Supports loan guarantees and grants for green-energy companies. \Romney: Opposes the renewal of the wind tax credit. Criticizes Obama's stimulus bill funding for solar, wind and electric vehicle companies. \3. Vehicle fuel efficiency \Obama: Finalized plans, with support of major automakers, to double fuel economy for light trucks and cars, to 54.5 miles per gallon, by 2025. \Romney: Opposes Obama's efficiency mandate, saying consumers will have to spend more on cars than they'll save by using less gas. \4. Clean air \Obama: Supports the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency, upheld by the Supreme Court, to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Backs tougher rules for limiting emissions from old coal-fired power plants. \Romney: Seeks to eliminate EPA's power to regulate carbon dioxide and remove its rules limiting emissions from coal plants. ""I exhale carbon dioxide,"" he said in November in New Hampshire. ""I don't want those guys (EPA) following me around with a meter to see if I'm breathing too hard."" \5. Climate change \Obama: Believes it's serious, exacerbated by fossil fuel use and linked to extreme weather. ""Climate change is not a hoax,"" he told the Democratic National Convention last month in Charlotte, N.C. ""More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future."" \Romney: Argues there's a lack of scientific consensus on the issue. ""We don't know what's causing climate change on this planet,"" he told the Consol Energy Center last October.\Credit: Wendy Koch, @wendykoch, USA TODAY"
33,"In March 2010, the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers issued a standard but stern warning about Solyndra, a California solar panel manufacturer: The company wasn't making money and never had, which raised ""substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."" Yet when President Obama visited Solyndra's plant in Fremont two months later, he gave a rousing pep talk and declared that ""the future is here."" \Alas, it wasn't. \Solyndra continued to struggle, canceled a planned public stock offering and filed for bankruptcy this month -- leaving the U.S. government as its biggest creditor and raising new questions about whether Uncle Sam should be playing venture capitalist. \Despite initial misgivings about the company's viability, an Energy Department program aimed at boosting ""clean energy"" projects had guaranteed a $535 million loan to Solyndra, which produced an innovative but expensive solar panel. Taxpayers are now on the hook for some or most of that money, depending on whether someone buys the assets. \Whether Solyndra is just an expensive embarrassment, or a full-fledged scandal, remains to be seen. Shortly after the bankruptcy filing, the FBI raided Solyndra's headquarters and the homes of its executives in connection with the loan. And today, a House oversight panel holds a hearing to probe how the company -- whose board and investors included some major campaign donors to Democrats and Obama -- got the money, and whether the administration properly vetted the application. \Even if Solyndra's collapse is nothing more than good intentions gone awry -- a big if -- it is a cautionary tale about why government should be extremely wary about betting tax dollars on specific companies. If there's one thing the marketplace virtually always does better than government, it's picking individual successes in an uncertain and highly competitive business. In fact, government involvement can unfairly tilt the playing field toward one company and away from competitors. \What the government can do is create an environment that makes it possible for the best companies to emerge and thrive. Government can fund basic research that is too expensive and too uncertain for struggling companies. It alone can set clear rules, provide a productive tax environment and fiercely defend American companies from unfair foreign competition. One reason for Solyndra's demise was a huge drop in solar panel prices that might have been caused by China's heavily subsidized solar panel manufacturers dumping below-cost panels on the world market. \You can bet you'll hear a lot more about Solyndra as the campaign season intensifies, and rightly so. This is a stain on Obama's stimulus program. At the same time, context is important. The Obama administration inherited the Solyndra application from the Bush Energy Department, and Solyndra is one of 42 projects in the Energy Department's $30 billion portfolio of clean energy loan guarantees. The department says none of those other projects is in trouble; we'll see. \Moving the nation away from its reliance on oil and coal would unquestionably have huge benefits for the environment and for national security. The most efficient way to attain that goal -- raising the price of fossil fuels to reflect their real cost via a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade plan -- isn't going anywhere in the current political environment. That leaves a variety of next-best options worth pursuing, but trying to pick winners among individual start-up companies ought to be at the bottom of the list."
34,"Environmental activists call it the most important Chesapeake Bay legislation since Richard Nixon signed the federal Clean Water Act in 1972.\Others, especially the agricultural industry, say it will drive farmers and ranchers from their land.\The Chesapeake Clean Water Ecosystem Restoration Act would pump $2.25 billion over the next six years into cleaning up the estuary, the nation's largest and home to a once bountiful supply of seafood.\For environmental watchdogs, such as the Annapolis, Md.-based Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the bill is long overdue. Past efforts to rid the bay of pollutants, including the landmark Clean Water Act, have largely failed to live up to their promise, they say.\The current bill, written by a pair of democratic Maryland lawmakers, U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. Elijah Cummings, could change that, according to Doug Siglin, the foundation's federal affairs director.\Essentially, the bill would fund the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's effort to prod Virginia, five other mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia to double the pace of their cleanup efforts, Siglin said.\The EPA wants to cut the amount of nitrogen - a pollution indicator that leads to oxygen-deprived dead zones - from entering the bay by about 30 percent by 2025.\States would be given the opportunity to meet the demand. For example, Virginia could target power plant emissions while Maryland clamps down on farm waste. If states do not meet the goals, the EPA can withhold Clean Water Act grants, which in Virginia this year amounts to $24 million, Siglin said.\The foundation and others have seized upon the increasing sense of environmental awareness created by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as an added measure for the bill's approval.\""This is extremely important for the bay, itneeds to be passed this year,"" Siglin said.\Whether that will happen is unclear. Powerful interests, such as the American Farm Bureau and various builder associations, have mounted opposition campaigns.\The bureau in particular has been active, encouraging its members to write members of Congress expressing their misgivings about the bill. Greg Hicks, vice president of communications for the Virginia bureau office, said portions of the bill could be devastating to the state's beef and diary farmers.\Unlike Hampton Roads farmers, who can only let so much animal waste and fertilizer run off their land, farmers west of Richmond aren't subjected to the same rules, Hicks said. Having to fence off cattle, cover manure pits, and install vegetation that slows runoff is expensive, he said.\""We're obviously opposed to it,"" he said. ""We don't think it's very realistic.""\Introduced last year by Cardin, the bill has taken a backseat to other issues such as health care and financial reform. It cleared the Senate Committee of Environment and Public Works last month and will, presumably, come before the full Senate.\Virginia's Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Jim Webb, have said little about it. A spokesman for Warner said the former governor ""hopes to get to 'yes' on the bay bill,"" but he is concerned about costs to farmers and localities tasked with implementing it.\The House version, still in committee, has secured the support of three Democratic Virginia lawmakers: Robert C. Scott of Newport News, Jim Moran of Arlington, and Gerry Connolly of Fairfax County. Moran chairs the appropriations subcommittee on the interior and the environment, which plays a heavy hand responding to funding requests.\While Siglin hopes Congress will approve the bill before year's end, it may be shelved by incumbents avoiding what could a controversial vote before November's midterm elections.\For more science and environment news, visit the Daily Press blog, The Deadrise, at dailypress.com/deadrise\THE CHESAPEAKE CLEAN WATER ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION ACT WOULD:\*Provide $2.25 billion over the next six years to clean up the bay\*Fund programs to reduce pollution from farms, sewage systems, and storm-water runoff\*Create and cap-and-trade system that allows polluters to sell excess credits\The pros and cons\Pros\*It would help cut pollution in the bay\*Could help revive the bay's struggling seafood industry\*Farmers in compliance could sell pollution credits\Cons\*It could put small farmers out of business\*Government has a history of not reaching Chesapeake goals\*Federal and states governments are already in debt"
35,"A tall, brick smokestack dominates the skyline of Hampton University and is the departure point for a new environmental initiative that will yield a healthier community and a more sustainable future for this venerable institution of higher learning.\In 1886, the college installed a centralized coal-fired steam plant to serve the expanding campus. Upgrades to the plant in 1946 increased its capacity to burn coal, and added oil as an alternative fuel. Well past its useful life, this antiquated plant and the crumbling system of steam distribution beg for replacement. According to William R. Harvey, president of HU, updating the steam plant would require at least $4 million. However, this would still leave HU tied to a 19th-century technology that pollutes the air, acidifies the seas, puts mercury in the food chain, drives global warming and promotes the removal of mountain tops in Appalachia.\Demonstrating real leadership in financially difficult times, Harvey is looking past the seemingly cheaper, short-term fix of continuing to rely on fossil fuel, to instead invest in an ecologically and economically sound solution. He recently committed to moving HU to an efficient (using 75 percent less energy) geothermal-based system of heat pumps to provide both heating and cooling.\HOW IT WORKS\Heat pumps move heat from one place to another by taking advantage of the physics of fluids changing back and forth between the states of gas and liquid.\A traditional air conditioner is a one-way heat pump, shifting heat from within a house to the outside air. An electrically powered pump compresses a gaseous refrigerant to a liquid, which is then allowed to expand back to a gas in a closed loop. Going from liquid to gas requires a lot of heat, which comes from the air in the house. When the pump recompresses the gas to a liquid, it releases the heat it got from inside the house, which is then dissipated back to the surrounding environment. A fan blowing at each point of heat exchange makes the system more efficient.\Essentially running the air conditioner in reverse brings heat from the outside air into a house. Many of us live in houses that rely upon such ""reversing"" air conditioners, called heat pumps.\Unlike traditional systems, geothermal heat pumps do not exchange heat with the outside air, but instead shift heat back and forth from ground water. This makes for a much more efficient system, since for equal volumes, water can store much more heat than air, which translates into much quicker transfer of heat, requiring the electric motors to work much less.\Also, traditional air-based heat exchangers fail to provide adequate heat when ambient air temperatures drop much below 40 degrees F. So they included energy-demanding electric resistance heaters to provide backup for cold days. In addition, traditional air-based systems use excessive electricity, as they run nearly constantly on very hot days.\Since groundwater remains a nearly constant 55-60 degrees F all year long, geothermal systems function well on both very hot and very cold days.\WHY WE NEED IT\If geothermal heat pumps really work so well, why don't all buildings with adequate supplies of ground water use them? The relatively new technology is more expensive to install than traditional systems. Even with the recent jumps in price, energy remains cheap enough for most homeowners or college presidents to opt for the short-term economics of less expensive but energy-wasteful old technology.\Yet forward thinkers understand that the era of ""cheap energy"" will end soon. Over the last century, we have deferred much of the real cost of fossil-fuel extraction and consumption to future generations.\The United States and most of the developed world stand poised to implement a cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide pollution, to fight global warming and the acidification of the seas. Cap-and-trade, coupled with exhaustion of fossil-fuel reserves, will certainly drive energy prices higher, making the investment in geothermal heat pumps that much more attractive.\Harvey is committed to raise the $35 million needed to bring geothermal to HU. However, the large capital outlay may dictate a staged approach, converting a few buildings at a time. When complete, HU will sport the largest such installation in the area, making it a model for the rest of the community, and one more accomplishment to add to the ""Harvey legacy"" of service to the university, community and nation.\Cuker is a professor in the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences at Hampton University.

36,"""Wall Street shifting toward Republicans,"" blared a front-page headline in The Washington Post last week. ""Commercial banks and high-flying investment firms have shifted their political contributions toward Republicans in recent months amid harsh rhetoric from Democrats about fat bank profits, generous bonuses and stingy lending policies on Wall Street,"" the Post announced, making it sound as if the sinister forces of corporate reaction were punishing the brave reformer in the White House. After all, Barack ""Teddy Roosevelt"" Obama assailed Wall Street bonuses for ""fat cats"" and has promised tax increases for the wealthy, in the name of spreading the wealth. \Except there's one datum, mentioned but not explored in the article that doesn't quite fit this story line: Wall Street is still giving more money to the Democrats. ""The wealthy securities and investment industry ... went from giving 2 to 1 to Democrats at the start of 2009 to providing almost half of its donations to Republicans by the end of the year,"" the Post reports. \Almost half. That's another way of saying that the allegedly vindictive Wall Street fat cats are still giving more than half of their political donations to Democrats, also known as the party in power. \It turns out that's what most big businesses and fat cats do: back the winner. And that's probably the best explanation for why the Republicans are getting more money from Wall Street these days. Everyone agrees that the GOP is poised to make huge gains in the House and Senate, conceivably taking one or both chambers. Scott Brown's victory in the Massachusetts Senate race also took away the Democrats' supermajority. As several lobbyists have explained to me, just as a matter of political math, the Republicans matter now. When Senate Democrats had all the power, lobbyists had to give more money to Democrats. Now that the equation has tilted back toward the center, giving has become more evenhanded. \Love for Obama \No doubt, with populist prairie fires raging across the political landscape, the White House hardly regrets being cast as the enemy of ""special interests"" and beady-eyed bankers who look like Mr. Monopoly. But the truth of the matter is a bit different. \It's worth remembering that Obama was the preferred candidate of Wall Street, and the industry gave to Democrats by a 2-1 margin at the beginning of last year. The top business donor to Democrats in 2008 was Goldman Sachs, and nearly 75 cents out of every dollar of Goldman's political donations from 2006 to 2008 went to Democrats. Few can gainsay the investment, given how well Goldman Sachs has done under the Obama administration. \It's not just Wall Street. Obama led in fundraising from most big business sectors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Aside from the desire to back the winner, and the cultural liberalness of East and West Coast plutocrats, why did Obama get so much support from precisely the constituency he demonizes? \Because it was good business. A host of big corporations bet that the much-vaunted Obama era would materialize. For instance, nearly 30 major corporations and environmental groups invested in Obama's promise to force the American economy into a new cap-and-trade system via the United States Climate Action Partnership (CAP). \Whatever the benefits of such a scheme for the economy and environment as a whole, these corporations, led by General Electric, were looking simply to cash in on government policies. GE, which makes many wind, solar and nuclear doodads that would be profitable under ""cap-and-trade,"" was poised to make billions if Obama succeeded in seizing control of the ""carbon economy."" GE is still protecting its bet, but after the failure in Copenhagen, the ""climategate"" scandals, and perhaps most significantly, that implosion of Obama's new progressive era, several heavyweights -- Caterpillar, BP and ConocoPhillips -- have pulled out of CAP, with rumors that more will follow. There are similar rumblings of discontent within the ranks of PhRMA, the trade association for the pharmaceutical industry, which had cut an $80 billion deal with the White House last year for its support of ObamaCare, only to see the whole thing unravel. \Profits and cheap dates \The lesson here is fairly simple: Big business is not ""right wing,"" it's vampiric. It will pursue any opportunity to make a big profit at little risk. Getting in bed with politicians is increasingly the safest investment for these ""crony capitalists."" But only if the politicians can actually deliver. The political failures of the Obama White House have translated into business failures for firms more eager to make money off taxpayers instead of consumers. \That's good news. The bad news will be if the Republicans once again opt to be the cheap dates of big business. For years, the GOP defended big business in the spirit of free enterprise while businesses never showed much interest in the principle themselves. Now that their bet on the Democrats has crapped out, it'd be nice if they stopped trying to game the system and focused instead on satisfying the consumer. \Jonah Goldberg is a member of USA TODAY's board of contributors and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute."
37,"Tis the season for glossy cardboard with lurid red-black-and-white photos of scowling politicos to land in your mailbox, but one face you won't see (though you'll hear a lot about him) is Reggie's - that is, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI.\House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, says the northeastern states' cap-and-trade agreement that Gov. Ralph Northam and Democratic legislators want to join will boost Virginians' electric bills.\In fact, Cox and some GOP colleagues can put a price on it: $144 a year. That's a couple pairs of shoes for a working family's kids, or a co-pay on an elderly Virginian's medicine, as Mary Margaret Kastelberg, who hopes to win back a Henrico County House district for the GOP, put it during a telephone press conference Thursday.\Cox said he believes language now in the state budget that blocks Virginia from participating in RGGI would go if Democrats take control of the General Assembly.\And yes, Republicans plan to make that point as they campaign, he said.\That $144 number comes from a letter that the State Corporation Commission's long-time expert on electric utility economics, Bill Stephens, sent in January to House Commerce and Labor committee chairman Terry Kilgore, R-Gate City, who was also at the press conference.\Stephens says linking the state to RGGI would boost Dominion Energy Virginia's costs by $3.3 billion over the next decade. Actually joining the program would cost $5.9 billion. That translates to a $7 a month increase to a typical residential customer's bill for the linkage or $12 a month if Virginia opts for the closer ties that come with joining the system.\Twelve dollars a month is $144, which is where that figure comes from.\In a more recent report, the SCC said it couldn't estimate the cost of RGGI.\The SCC noted that Dominion's customers would have to be in line for rebates of nearly $380 million if the General Assembly hadn't changed the way the state regulates electric utilities last year in a bill heavily lobbied by Dominion as a way to finance improvements to its grid and a huge expansion of solar and wind generating facilities. In fact, Dominion told investors that this clears the way for new facilities that would increase a typical residential bill by $29.37 per month (that's $352 a year) or 26% by Dec. 31, 2023, the SCC said.\Dominion, by the way, puts the cost of RGGI at $6.5 billion. Using a ratio derived from Stephens' letter, Shad Plank makes that a $156 bump to a typical annual power bill.\The state Department of Environmental Quality thinks joining RGGI will bring electric bills down by encouraging a shift from coal, oil and natural gas, which cost money to buy when firing up a power plant, to solar and wind. \The Natural Resources Defense Council, meanwhile, said electricity costs declined by 6.4% in RGGI member states between 2008 and 2016, while costs in other states rose 6.2%.\The benefit in terms of reduced carbon emissions is minimal, in the view of GOP House candidate and former Board of Social Services chair D.J. Jordan. Virginia has cut its emissions by 16% since 2000 on its own; RGGI emissions are down 17%, he notes.\The NRDC says RGGI has helped cut carbon pollution from power plants by more than half in its member states. Jordan noted that cap-and-trade markets often just move carbon to areas that aren't participating.\David T. Stevenson of the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware think tank that advocates free market policies, said RGGI cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% in member states, versus 20% elsewhere since 2007. \RGGI states lag the nation in the use of solar and wind power, but outpace other states in the percentage of electricity generated at nuclear or gas-fired plants. Utilities in RGGI states have seen their total collection of revenue from customers rise 4.6% versus 5.5% for the nation.\Perhaps here's what the numbers really add up to: politics.\""A true fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats in this cycle is that Republicans support policies that will make sure energy stays affordable, while Democrats support policies that will lead to higher power bills,"" Cox said.\Which prompted this from Virginia Democratic spokesman Grant Fox: ""His extreme agenda puts access to clean air and water at serious risk for all Virginians, and this is just another example of Virginia Republicans taking a page out of Donald Trump's anti-environment playbook to throw their constituents under the bus while siding with corporate polluters.""\ \Sales tax bump\Well, here's a surprise: sales and use tax collections, which have grown sluggishly in the past few years despite a buoyant economy, jumped by 12.9% in August.\Another surprise: Use tax collections - that is taxes paid on sales outside Virginia, basically from Internet vendors - soared by 44%. More than 1,200 new dealers signed up in August, and more than 31,700 Internet vendors now collect and pay use taxes to Virginia.\""I wasn't expecting it ... obviously, it's a good sign,"" said Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne.\Sales and use tax collections have been soft for years. Collections for all of the last fiscal year rose by just 3.8% and were up just 2.9% the year before that.\But last summer, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a South Dakota law taxing internet sales. This year, the General Assembly decided Virginia should too.\Layne warned legislators to be careful not to get too giddy about a big jump in revenue, since many of the biggest Internet dealers had already started collecting and paying the tax in response to the South Dakota decision.\He thinks the latest numbers indicate that smaller dealers are signing up. That would mean that a healthy rise in use tax collections would be sustainable for the long haul.\But since August collections aren't the biggest, he's hoping to get a better sense of the trend when the back-to-school spending numbers come in. He's also hoping to get a sense of whether Internet sales are still eating into sales at Virginia's brick-and-mortar stores.\And, he adds, there's another lesson to be gained from an unexpected change in tax collections That lesson: new ways of doing business and trends in distant financial markets mean it's wise to be cautious about counting on revenue windfalls.\Dave Ress, 757-247-4535, dress@dailypress.com"

It's by far the most significant attempt at changing the course of global warming since world leaders met in 1997 in Japan to craft the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed 37 industrialized nations at cutting emissions of six greenhouse gases (such as the carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal, oil and natural gas, aka fossil fuels) by 5.2% from 1990 levels. It was never ratified by the U.S. Senate and expires in 2012. \But despite predictions that time is running out to corral greenhouse gases, expectations already have been dashed that the Copenhagen sessions will produce a successful replacement for the Kyoto Protocol. \One reason: Technologies to cut back carbon dioxide emissions from factories and vehicles that feed the global economy add costs to fuel, food and more, an option that appeals neither to industrial nations struggling with the global economic meltdown or developing nations trying to ramp up economic growth. \President Obama and China's Hu Jintao signaled as much when they spoke Nov. 17. Obama endorsed a ""two-step"" plan for Copenhagen -- agree to emissions limits there and worry about a legal treaty next year -- and neither leader stated his limits. \""Copenhagen does not need to come up with the fine print of a climate-change deal,"" Yvo de Boer, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Nov. 4 in Barcelona. ""But it needs to ensure that the heart of an agreed outcome is functional and the implementation can begin swiftly."" \Still, many observers feel pressure to act sooner than later. Global temperatures have increased about 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1906, according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Without a new treaty to halt carbon dioxide emissions, world temperatures could rise an additional 7.2 degrees by 2100, raising fears of widespread crop failures, climate ""refugees,"" rising seas and desertification for regions such as the Southwest. \Greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the atmosphere. A United Nations Environment Programme report in September found effects such as drought, melting sea ice and ocean acidification arriving ahead of, and looking worse than, the IPCC's 2007 projections. \""Business as usual"" leads to an increase of more than 8 degrees, ""truly a catastrophic world,"" says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C. ""We've spent two decades putting this off. We won't get a second chance."" \Such forecasts, though, met renewed skepticism this week with the disclosure of e-mails stolen from England's University of East Anglia, including climate researchers privately bad-mouthing critics and struggling to explain if global warming is real, why recent years' temperatures didn't exceed 1998 and 2005 levels, the warmest on record. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., says the e-mails show scientists ""cooked the science"" and has called for an investigation. Climatologist Gavin Schmidt of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, however, said on the RealClimate website that the e-mails contain ""no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy,"" just ""a peek into how scientists actually interact."" \Now vs. the future \Still, what is at stake at Copenhagen, Meyer and other observers say, is the world's choice for the future: one where nations hedge now against the foreseeable risks of warming or gamble today that they won't happen tomorrow, and keep on burning coal and oil. \So what would a good Copenhagen deal look like? The United Nations' de Boer says it would hold: \*Greenhouse-gas emission goals for industrialized nations. \*Emission-free energy goals for developing nations. \*Promises of money and machinery from industrialized nations to meet those goals. \*Agreement on how to meet those goals and commitments. \""The issue is not whether you are for or against climate change, but rather how much are you willing to sacrifice to slow climate change,"" says Yale economist Robert Mendelsohn. \The U.S. Senate is contemplating bills that might lead to a 17% to 20% cut in U.S. emissions by 2020. In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the costs of creating a carbon ""market"" to achieve such cuts would be about $175 a year by then for the average household. With efficiency measures added, the Environmental Protection Agency says the bill proposal would actually lower energy costs for households but cause huge changes in the energy business -- with fossil fuels falling from about 85% of U.S. electricity generation today to 30% by 2050 -- costing jobs at coal plants while adding them in solar, wind and nuclear energy. \A flurry of meetings have led up to Copenhagen, starting with the 2007 session in Bali, where the Bush administration committed the nation to taking part in Copenhagen. The road to Copenhagen really started, however, in 1992, when the USA signed on to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreeing to keep global warming effects below ""dangerous levels."" \So what's dangerous? In March, a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences report updating earlier danger estimates found nothing but negative consequences should global temperatures rise more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. \The present concentration of carbon dioxide, the biggest player in global warming greenhouse gases, in the atmosphere stands at about 388 parts per million, compared with roughly 270 ppm prior to the Industrial Revolution. At the atmospheric equivalent of 450 ppm concentrations, the world faces a 50% chance of seeing global temperatures rise more than 3.6 degrees. \""The meeting's challenge is to get developed nations on line to economies that are low-carbon, and get developing nations investing in energy technologies that allow them to grow without entering the carbon-emitting trap,"" says Frances Beinecke, author of Clean Energy Common Sense: An American Call to Action on Global Climate Change. ""Copenhagen has to send them a signal that we are serious."" \In the U.S. Senate, that signal, a clean-energy bill, looks unlikely to pass this year as legislators look at the details, says Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a sponsor of one leading proposal. The bills all center on creation of a national ""cap-and-trade"" system, where rights to emit greenhouse gases are capped, and then sold and traded among industries. \Meanwhile, de Boer says, industrialized nations would more likely have to cut emissions about 80% to not cross the 450 ppm danger line. In 2007, the IPCC estimated such a cut would trigger a 3% reduction of the global economy, an impossible proposition amid a global recession, says David Victor of the University of California-San Diego. \""As soon as we put a price on carbon, the increased price will pass all the way down (to consumers),"" says Jae Edmonds of the Joint Global Change Research Institute at the University of Maryland. ""When I consider my home heating-oil bill, my natural-gas bill in the winter, the prices will drive decisions."" \A practical approach \Doing nothing costs, too. In October, for example, a National Research Council panel estimated that burning fossil fuels costs $120 billion in health expenses nationwide every year, mostly from at least 18,000 premature deaths caused by pollution, with a ""middle ground"" estimate of climate damages of $350 billion from storms, drought, wildfire and related effects. \""President Obama was just stating the obvious. There is no use in pretending that a full and final treaty will be ready by Copenhagen,"" Victor says. Expecting 192 nations to agree on anything realistic, he adds, seems like a bad strategy. \Instead, he suggests the major nations releasing greenhouse gases, particularly China and the United States, cut direct deals to save time. \""I just think that is the most practical approach,"" he says. \Chichilnisky says this idea won't work, because poor nations will then barrel down the fossil fuel path to industrialization without a global treaty that gives them a reason to invest in low-emission power. \In 2006, a British government report, the ""Stern Review,"" estimated that addressing climate change through efficiency, low-emission technologies and a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases, among other steps, would subtract about 1% from global Gross Domestic Product in 2050, as opposed to a roughly 5% to 20% cost to global GDP if nothing were done. Mendelsohn and other economists criticized this high cost estimate and its all-or-nothing response to climate change, rather than a step-by-step one. \""People seeking such a stringent policy that ensures global warming will not be harmful will demand such an expensive strategy that no one will agree to do anything,"" Mendelsohn says. ""In contrast, if we sought a moderate policy that will eventually lead to substantial reductions of greenhouse gases, it is very likely one could get global agreement in Copenhagen."" \TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE \Powerhouse topics of discussion \The International Energy Agency (IAE) says global energy will grow 40% by 2030. Fossil fuels make 75% of energy today, but some technologies can cut greenhouse emissions. \Coal power \-- ""Clean"" coal, with carbon dioxide emissions shunted to underground reserves, is crucial to cutting future greenhouse gases, according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A big task, it will add to energy bills and require 50% more pipelines than today's U.S. petroleum industry uses. \Natural gas \-- Natural gas is the lowest-impact fossil fuel for greenhouse gases and is the fastest-growing energy source nationwide. Even if Copenhagen produces limits on global greenhouse gas, natural-gas use is likely to increase -- perhaps 17% worldwide by 2030, IAE says -- because of its low rate of greenhouse emissions. \Wind power \-- The renewable-energy source seeing the biggest short-term increase is wind power, with U.S. wind farms raising their capacity 50% in 2008 -- more than 8,500 megawatts. Texas, Iowa, California, Minnesota and Washington lead the nation in wind power, says the American Wind Energy Association. \Leaders vs. global warming \Copenhagen hosts global climate treaty talks in December. Some world leaders have offered up greenhouse gas cuts already, and some haven't: \USA: President Obama has pledged to ""take significant mitigation actions and stand behind these commitments"" at Copenhagen. But no hard numbers yet. Congress contemplates 17% to 20% cuts. \China: President Hu Jintao pledged ""notable"" cuts in growth of emissions by 2020. No hard numbers. But China has signed clean- energy agreements and has stricter gas-mileage rules than the U.S. has. \United Nations: Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, says industrialized nations need 80% cuts compared with 2005 emissions. \Maldives: President Mohamed Nasheed pledges his nation will be ""carbon neutral"" with effectively zero emissions by 2050 and looks to grow algae to store carbon emissions for climate credits. \Japan: Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama pledges a 25% cut, compared with 1990 levels, by 2020. The campaign pledge revitalized moves toward a world climate agreement in September.\Credit: Dan Vergano, USA TODAY"
39,"Record-high prices for gasoline, heating and electricity and growing concern about global warming have pushed energy issues to the forefront of the 2008 presidential campaign. \Not since the gas lines of the 1970s has energy loomed so large as it does in the race between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, says Kenneth Medlock, an energy expert at Rice University. And it's an issue that is unlikely to fade between now and November. \While the candidates agree on a few energy-policy issues, such as not drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they are far apart on others. McCain, for instance, is more supportive of offshore drilling and strongly favors nuclear power. Obama envisions a bigger role for government in the nation's energy future, seeking to invest billions in new technology while mandating stronger fuel-efficiency and alternative-energy standards. McCain wants to rely more heavily on existing laws and market forces. \Both candidates are far more willing than President Bush to tackle global warming by imposing new fees on greenhouse gas emissions. \Consumers, who are reeling from high energy costs, will be watching to see how any action might hit their wallets. \""The prices are completely outrageous,"" says Amanda Browning, 31, of Detroit. Browning, a single mom who is at home taking care of her two children and 87-year-old grandfather, says it's not just about cost. She's concerned about energy's impact on the environment and the USA's reliance on foreign oil. \No matter who wins, there is likely to be far more action on energy policy than in the past few presidencies as high prices and concerns about global warming push the issue to the top of many lawmakers' to-do lists, says Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at the Stanford Financial Group. \""Something is certain to happen next year,"" Valliere says. \--- \Oil drilling \Both candidates have softened their positions \High energy prices have forced both candidates to soften their positions on oil-drilling restrictions, but they continue to disagree on the key issue of drilling offshore. \Obama says oil companies need to focus on drilling in areas already leased to the oil and gas companies and supports more drilling within areas, such as in parts of the Gulf of Mexico, where exploration and production is already permitted. \Obama says he is open to a bipartisan proposal in the Senate that would lift the moratorium on drilling in a small portion of the 1.76 billion-acre Outer Continental Shelf, the sloping undersea region between the continent and the deep ocean around the USA, if the move came in conjunction with aggressive commitments to new clean energy technologies and efficiency. Obama argues that drilling in the area is not an answer to reduce prices in the short-term or to promote long-term energy independence. \McCain advocates a complete lifting of the ban on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. \Congress imposed a moratorium on drilling in new offshore areas in 1981. It is hard to know how big an impact drilling in the OCS would have on energy costs, says Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. It's unknown how much oil and natural gas is there, how accessible it is or how easy it would be to hook up to pipelines, he says. \Neither candidate supports opening up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. \--- \Electricity \McCain wants to build 45 nuclear power plants \McCain is far more bullish than Obama on conventional electricity generation, especially nuclear power, as a way to meet soaring energy needs. McCain wants to build 45 nuclear plants which emit none of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming by 2030. That's ambitious. Until recently, no company had filed an application for a reactor since the 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown. \""We are at a national security exposure due to imported oil, and (McCain) would love to see nuclear power as part of the climate approach,"" says McCain senior adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin. \Some experts are skeptical. \""It's not going to happen,"" says Robert Kaufmann, director of the school of public and international affairs at Boston University. He says it's simply too tough to get permits to build nuclear reactors, largely due to safety and waste-storage concerns. \McCain also favors big subsidies to help the nuclear industry achieve his goal. Even conservative groups says that conflicts with his opposition to subsidies for ethanol. \""He's picking favorites,"" says Kenneth Green, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \Obama, by contrast, says that before the nation builds a new generation of nuclear reactors, issues such as the security of nuclear fuel and where to store waste must be solved. Some say he's paying lip service to a vital energy source. \""He's putting so many caveats on it, he's saying in effect we're going to do nothing,"" says Deborah-Wince Smith, president of the Council on Competitiveness, a group of CEOs, university presidents and labor leaders. McCain, meanwhile, favors Yucca Mountain in Nevada as a repository for nuclear waste; Obama does not, saying he wants to study alternatives. The Department of Energy has chosen Yucca, but concerns about costs and hazards such as earthquakes have stalled plans. \The candidates also differ on coal, which supplies 50% of U.S. electricity but accounts for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions, the chief greenhouse gas. Both want to develop technology to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal plants. McCain, though, says the U.S. should continue to build coal plants meantime. Obama says new coal plants must be designed to permit retrofitting of carbon-capture devices when the technology is available in a decade or more. \--- \Global warming \Similar strategies, but Obama's more aggressive \To combat global warming, both Obama and McCain want to impose new constraints and fees on companies that emit carbon dioxide. But Obama's plan is more aggressive. \Under a so-called cap-and-trade system, utilities, oil companies and other polluting industries would get a limited number of allowances from the federal government to spew carbon dioxide. Utilities that fall below their cap by switching from coal to renewable energy, for instance, could sell permits to those that exceed their limits. The cap would grow more stringent over the years. \Obama wants to reduce emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 the amount the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international monitoring group, says is needed to prevent a worrisome rise in global temperatures late this century. \McCain was one of the first Republicans to break with his party several years ago and introduce cap-and-trade legislation. But now he's calling for more modest carbon dioxide reduction than Obama: 66% below 1990 levels by 2050. \""It has to be a policy that can get through the Senate"" without dampening economic growth, McCain senior adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin says. \A bill that recently fizzled in the Senate would have required a 71% cut in carbon emissions by 2050. It would have raised electricity rates 45% in some areas and boosted gasoline prices 25 cents a gallon under some forecasts. \""We need to get to at least an 80% reduction if you're serious about avoiding the worst impacts of climate change,"" says David Friedman of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \But Tim Profeta, director of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy at Duke University, says the two candidates' goals are roughly similar. A big difference, though, is that Obama wants polluters to pay for permits; he would use the revenue for clean-energy research. McCain wants to give away most permits so consumers don't get socked with higher energy prices. \--- \Price relief \Obama wants tax credits paid for by oil companies \McCain and Obama have deep differences on delivering relief to U.S. consumers slammed by the rapid rise in energy costs. \Obama advocates tax credits of $500 for an individual and $1,000 for a married couple making up to $150,000 to help offset higher costs for gasoline, heating and other costs. The rebates, which would go to approximately 150 million Americans, would be paid for with a windfall tax on oil company profits. McCain is opposed to a windfall tax, arguing it would discourage investment. \Last summer, when the average price of gasoline rose to more than $4 a gallon, the candidates called for different remedies. \McCain during the summer supported the temporary repeal of the federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents per gallon as prices at the pump broke records. That proposal is tabled for now as the summer driving season has ended. Obama is opposed to the repeal of the federal gasoline tax, arguing it doesn't provide much relief to consumers and reduces a key source of funding for roads and other infrastructure. \Obama advocated taking oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help reduce prices. He proposed the removal of 70 million barrels, or about 10% of the amount of oil in the SPR, to be replaced within 12 months. \--- \Cars \McCain backs big fines on carmakers with low mpgs \Each candidate would use tax credits to promote higher-mileage automobiles. Obama would require manufacturers to meet higher mileage requirements, while McCain would increase the punishment for automakers that fail to meet the current mileage standard, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE. \CAFE is the average miles per gallon of a manufacturer's entire fleet manufactured in the USA. \Obama proposes increasing the U.S. fuel-economy standard by 4% per year in perpetuity. The increases would lead to 49.5 miles per gallon by 2025, up from the current 25. \""Technologically, it's feasible,"" Matthew Auer, an environmental expert at Indiana University, says of Obama's proposal. Obama backs a $7,000 tax credit for alternative vehicles such as plug-in hybrids and would mandate that all new cars be able to run on alternative fuels, such as biofuels. \McCain backs raising the penalties for violating the existing CAFE standard but does not support increasing the miles-per-gallon requirement. \A number of European automakers, such as Volkswagen and Porsche, pay millions in fines each year for not complying with CAFE. McCain advocates making the penalties high enough that it will be worth it to the companies to comply. \McCain also proposes a $5,000 tax credit for a zero-carbon-emission car, such as cars that are battery-powered. He does not advocate mandating that all cars run on alternative fuels. \--- \Renewable energy \Candidates split over subsidies for innovation \Everyone loves renewable energy, and Obama and McCain are no exceptions. Obama, though, has a more aggressive plan for expanding the role of renewables, while McCain espouses a more market-based approach. \Obama proposes spending $150 billion over 10 years for development of wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable energy, including fuels like cellulosic ethanol, made from grasses and plant waste. That, he says, would create 5 million jobs. \McCain is less precise, proposing a tax credit for companies doing research on renewables equal to 10% of their employees' wages. \Obama also favors a national standard requiring utilities to get 10% of their electricity from renewable power by 2012 and 25% by 2025. He also would require the U.S. to use 60 billion gallons a year of cellulosic ethanol by 2030. \McCain opposes quotas for the percentage of electricity from renewable sources, preferring to let industry decide how to comply with a cap he'd impose on greenhouse gas emissions. (See ""Global warming."") \The candidates also disagree on subsidies. \Obama supports current multibillion-dollar subsidies for ethanol but also backs a tariff on sugar cane-based ethanol that makes it more difficult and costly to import from Brazil. \McCain opposes ethanol subsidies and the tariff. ""His view is $4 gasoline is incentive enough,"" his senior adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin says."

To the Editor:
\
America must reject the Copenhagen Treaty. Its premise is flawed, and President Obama is pledging billions of American taxpayer dollars to do nothing to improve our environment. The Copenhagen Treaty places burdens on the United States while allowing other industrial countries to remain unrestricted. Even if enacted, the science is inconclusive whether this would cease climate change.
\
Unfortunately, there are some in Congress who want to pass laws that limit the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. They claim that CO2 is a pollutant. That is a myth and absolutely false. There is no scientific proof that CO2 is a pollutant.
\
Here's what I am telling my representatives in Congress:
\
1. Slow Down: The rush to label CO2 as a pollutant or pass cap-and-trade legislation will hurt our nation's economic recovery
\
2. Know the Science: There no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant
\
3. CO2 Has Benefits: Higher CO2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life.
\
4. Other Factors Involved: As for the greenhouse effect which warms the earth, CO2 is not even close to being the most important of the greenhouse gases. Most of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapor, which is about 30 times as abundant in the atmosphere as CO2 and has a much larger greenhouse effect.
\
5. CO2 is Green: More importantly, it has been proven that higher levels of CO2 result in more plant growth as well as less water being required for plants to grow faster and larger.
\
6. CO2 Supports Life: While CO2 accounts for less than 1 percent of the atmosphere, CO2 is essential to life on earth. In fact, we all exhale CO2 and enjoy it in our carbonated beverages.

I have to admit I am horrified at this slow motion disaster that is taking place in the Gulf of Mexico. I also submit that I am not surprised. British Petroleum is in league with other energy behemoths in their membership and support of globalist organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations. Sounds like an innocent think tank until you discover how it was founded and that the CFR, like BP is a primary promoter of the cap and trade scam that will shackle us all in high environmental taxes under a global government. That's right global government, goodbye USA, hello socialism.
\
One problem is the American people are on to the scam because of the released CRU e-mails revealing intentional cooking of the climate data and persecution of honest scientists, for which no one has made a perp walk. You can Google ""climategate"" or use infowars.com and get up to date that the earth has actually been cooling for about 10 years instead of warming.
\
If America continues to resist the push for global governance, companies like British Petroleum may try to manufacture a crisis for the customary reaction and obligatory solution. In the mean time, oil is flooding the gulf and our politicians may soon be crying out for draconian controls and a global authority to protect the environment.
\
Remember Copenhagen and all those pretty hammer and sickles dancing on the flags? Green is indeed the new red. Many have speculated that the rig explosion was an act of sabotage to force us into this New World Order that Prime Minister Gordon Brown constantly preached. BP's foot dragging and bungling remediation efforts seem to confirm a lack of urgency. You don't drill 5,000 feet deep without a contingency plan. I say boycott BP for a long time, maybe forever.

This is a political ploy used to gain support for a very controversial cap-and-trade energy bill (""Obama: Offshore drilling part of broader plan,"" News, April 1). \The obvious question to ask is why offshore drilling has been blocked by the president and Democrats for years. If it had been approved earlier, our economy would be in better shape and our dependency on foreign energy sources markedly reduced. \In addition, the billions used to purchase energy from foreign countries would have been invested here. The benefits would be lower utility costs for businesses and citizens, lower gas prices, and more jobs for those involved with exploration, processing, refining, transporting and distributing the oil. \We should have kept focusing on oil, natural gas, nuclear energy and coal for civilian, industry and military use rather than alternative energy sources. \Wind and solar power are not reliable enough to meet our needs. Also, the subsidization of ethanol is a prime example of bad energy legislation and should not be repeated. Ethanol is costly, inefficient and pollutes the environment. \Marvin L.

44,"The case for the U.S. entering into an international global warming treaty took a significant blow at the latest failed United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen. Not only did the conference fail to reach a meaningful agreement, but that failure will further jeopardize any action on global warming by an already skeptical U.S. Senate. In 1997, the Senate voted that any climate treaty would have to guarantee no harm to the American economy and similar emissions cuts from nations such as China and India. \In fact, the administration may have further undercut its position at home by proposing in Copenhagen that U.S. taxpayers hand over billions of dollars to help developing nations. \As the conference opened and leaders from around the world, ultimately including President Obama, descended on Copenhagen, some believed that a last minute agreement could be hammered out. But as reality took hold, the same obstacles that have persisted for the past decade remained. In the end, the Copenhagen ""agreement"" provides no binding agreement at all, no new targets or timelines, and no way to verify or enforce any type of emission cuts. \Even more troubling are significant concerns behind the science of global warming. Shocking leaked e-mails from a British university apparently show the world's leading climate scientists manipulating data, violating information disclosure laws and blocking publication of research contrary to their own. Investigations around the world are already underway, and the top scientist at the university has stepped down temporarily. \While politicians at the U.N. conference did their best to ignore this scandal, as George Monbiot, a writer for London's Guardian, blogs, ""Pretending that this isn't a real crisis isn't going to make it go away."" \The bottom line is this: The American people have caught on to the significant flaws of cap-and-trade policy. The Washington Post released a poll on Friday showing ""growing negativity toward the president's handling of the broader global warming issue."" Approval has plummeted from 61% last spring to 45% last week. Given the state of the American economy, it is hardly surprising that the American public is growing restless with policies that would put more Americans out of jobs and raise the cost of energy. \Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma is the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works."
45,"The biggest obstacle facing former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who formally entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday, is that President Obama's health care overhaul closely resembles Romney's state law. \For former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, a major roadblock is his past support, since recanted, for ""cap and trade"" legislation to fight global warming. \For former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, the rap is that he is too close to Obama because he served until recently as U.S. ambassador to China. \And for former House speaker Newt Gingrich, the near-fatal error was to attack a House-passed plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program. \All these GOP aspirants are in hot water with conservative activists because they ran afoul of a rigid orthodoxy that will make it harder for a Republican to retake the White House and more difficult to solve the nation's problems. \Many of these activists are sure of many things that Obama is a bad president, that man-made global warming is a myth, that health insurance mandates are unconstitutional, that Medicare should be privatized for future retirees, and that taxes should never be raised. \But in choosing their presidential nominee, uncertainty rules. Recent polls show that no candidate has consistently maintained the support of even one out of five GOP voters. Many of these polls also show dissatisfaction with the field. \While these two trends might seem divergent, they are actually related. The misgivings that many Republicans have about the candidates are a direct outgrowth of their certainty on issues. \By any objective measure, the GOP field has some impressive public servants. In a previous era, the party would begin coalescing around one. In the current environment, however, many of them, including potentially the strongest challengers to Obama, are being punished for past positions by party activists intent on litmus tests. \To be sure, Democrats have been known to have their own litmus tests, on issues ranging from abortion to the Iraq war. The GOP activists have every right to press their beliefs, and America benefits from having a credible movement for smaller government. But the nation also benefits from having two, broad-based parties whose leaders are able to address issues with bipartisan give-and-take and without fear of being demonized for compromise. \The most pressing of these issues is the soaring national debt. Yet the three Republican senators of the so-called Gang of Six that is trying to reach a deficit reduction deal have faced withering criticism from a group that opposes any tax hike under any circumstance. One senator, Oklahoma's Tom Coburn, decided to drop out. (Democrats in the gang, notably Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, have taken flak from the left for agreeing to cuts in benefits, but not at the same intensity level.) \Ultimately, the best measure for how off-kilter things have gotten in the GOP is Ronald Reagan. The party faithful regard him as a great president. But some of his policies would be unacceptable to today's purity police. \Reagan fought hard for conservative principles, but he knew when to cut deals, including one that saved Social Security. He raised taxes 11 times. And in Reagan's eight years in office, government spending was never less than 21.3% of the economy, well above the 18% that many of today's GOP leaders insist should be the maximum. \For these reasons, we suggest the activists cut the GOP field some slack. If they don't, they risk leading their party where Republican Barry Goldwater did in 1964 and Democrat George McGovern did in 1972: off an ideological cliff."
46,"Correction ran 11/9/2009: A story Friday about Al Gore's book misstated his age in some editions. He is 61.\WASHINGTON -- As global warming takes center stage in world affairs, Al Gore can't be far behind: The Nobel Prize-winning former-vice president-turned-energy entrepreneur is releasing his plan to crack the climate conundrum.\""The clock is ticking with respect to solving the crisis,"" Gore, 61, said Thursday as he sat in pinstripes and black cowboy boots in an environmentally certified conference room, with glass walls and white surfaces. Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis, which debuted Tuesday, ""offers us the tools to find a way out.""\In 416 pages, Gore offers a potpourri of lavishly illustrated recipes -- solar, geothermal and wind power solutions -- for slowing the greenhouse gases warming the climate. ""It is now abundantly clear that we have at our fingertips all of the tools we need to solve three or four climate crises,"" Gore writes. ""The only missing ingredient is collective will.""\Essentially, Gore proposes moving ahead with such technologies on a broad front while securing an international agreement that puts a price on the carbon dioxide wafting from smokestacks, and limits the deforestation that adds to greenhouse gases. (The Senate's environment committee, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., forwarded just such a ""cap-and-trade"" bill Thursday, for a vote, despite a boycott by committee Republicans.)\Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, but trap heat, warming the atmosphere. Manmade gases raised global average atmospheric temperatures about 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1905, according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and will likely raise them 3 to 7 degrees by 2100, depending on future emissions.\""It's good news that Gore is proposing solutions, because one criticism of (2006's) An Inconvenient Truth was that it was lacking those,"" said Chris Mooney, co-author of Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens our Future. ""Nevertheless, given his political history, there's no way (that) part of the country will listen to him.""\In a round of media interviews Thursday, Gore remained resolute.\""My former (political) experience taught me that grass-roots support is what will change things,"" he said, noting the book's ties to the Repower America website, which aims to enlist popular support for ""clean"" energy.\The book resulted from two years of ""solutions summits"" with scientists, economists and engineers, and lists four pages worth of contributors, as well as 25 independent reviewers. The fact-checking follows jibes over small errors in An Inconvenient Truth, the documentary that turned Gore into an icon of climate change.\""If opponents didn't think I was effective, they wouldn't complain about me,"" said Gore.\A recent Pew Research Center poll found 65% of Americans view global warming as a serious problem, an 8-percentage-point drop from 2008, but still a majority. ""The good news is the glass is more than half full, with most of the public wanting action,"" Gore said.\Surveys since 1997 suggest Gore's calls for tackling climate change mobilized Democrats, said Stanford's Jon Krosnick, while Republican views remained largely unchanged. Books such as this latest one, Krosnick said, ""may give a push to people already concerned about the globe heating up."""
47," The movement to curb global warming gained an important sponsor Thursday when Virginia Sen. John W. Warner announced his support for bipartisan legislation to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\ Warner, a centrist Republican, joined Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent, in co-sponsoring a sweeping proposal aimed at cutting emissions by 70 percent by 2050.\ The proposal, to be drafted and introduced in September, would establish caps on emissions and establish a market-based system for companies to buy and sell emission allowances. A new federal Climate Change Credit Corp. would auction the allowances to industry and use the proceeds to promote new environmental technologies.\ Lieberman, chairman of a key Senate Environment subcommittee on global warming, hailed Warner's backing of the controversial measure as an indicator of bipartisan momentum for enacting reforms as early as this year.\ ""There's no one I would rather have as a partner than John Warner,"" Lieberman said. ""We're friends. He brings his considerable stature and the respect of a wide, wide group of senators.""\ Warner, who had opposed global warming curbs in past years, said he had two requirements for signing on to Lieberman's package.\ ""It's got to be bipartisan,"" Warner said. ""And it's got to have as much support as possible -- and I think a great deal is needed -- from the private sector.""\ With Lieberman at his side, Warner said, ""The partnership we have formed I think is significant to the prospects for this legislation.""\ But even before the measure was unveiled, it drew a swift rebuke from the ranking Republican of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, which will consider the bill.\ ""The Lieberman-Warner bill will significantly harm the United States economy and fails to mandate reductions from the developing world,"" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.\ ""The American people deserve an open and honest debate on the merits of climate change legislation,"" he said, ""especially considering that mandatory carbon cap-and-trade legislation will impose the largest tax increase ever on the American public without any measurable climate benefits.""\ Warner acknowledged the contentious fight to come, portraying his pending bill as a start toward compromise legislation to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions.\ ""This is a continuing education process,"" Warner said. ""We've taken the first step.""\ That step marks something of a reversal for Warner, who voted against proposals to restrict greenhouse gas emissions in 2003 and 2005. Warner spokesman John Ullyot said the senator could not support those bills, sponsored by Lieberman and Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., because they did not include ""reasonable protections for industry and the economy.""\ The new measure, by contrast, creates a Federal Reserve-styled board to help control carbon costs if they threaten the health of specific companies or industries. The proposed Carbon Market Efficiency Board, appointed by the president with the consent of the Senate, would oversee the carbon market and have ""limited regulatory powers to control costs,"" according to a summary of the plan.\ Reaction to the package, not surprisingly, was mixed.\ The Natural Resources Defense Council said it welcomed the measure to ""help avoid the worst impacts of global warming.""\ Michael Lipford, Virginia director of the Nature Conservancy, applauded Warner's ""bold leadership on climate change.""\ But Emily Figdor of U.S. PIRG (Public Interest Research Groups), a nonprofit advocacy group, said the proposal doesn't go far enough.\ ""Significant changes will need to be made for the bill to provide the strong, science-based solutions to global warming that Americans are seeking,"" Figdor said. *"
48,"A consortium of 27 industry groups, the Coalition for a Strong Virginia Economy, want Gov. Ralph Northam to delay enacting several bills passed in the last legislative session that it believes will further harm businesses already crippled by actions taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\The group wants the governor to delay seven bills for at least a year, including legislation that would begin to increase the minimum wage annually starting Jan. 1, 2021, making it $9.50. The group wants that to be delayed until at least Jan. 1, 2022. The legislation, as written, would increase the minimum wage to $15 by Jan. 1, 2026.\""This action will give Virginia's businesses, large and small, manufacturers, retailers, construction, housing and agricultural and forestry industries an opportunity to rebuild our businesses, restore our customer base and rehire our employees before taking on more government mandates,"" the group says in its letter dated March 31. ""There is a strong possibility that many of these committed and long-standing businesses will not survive, and, if they do survive, it's hard to say how long it will take for them to see their operations return to a level near to that of the pre-COVID-19 environment.""\The group also wants delays put on bills that:\*Eliminate restrictions on which municipalities can tax items such as admissions and cigarettes as well as the amount of tax that can be levied, including transient occupancy taxes for lodging.\*Allow local and state agencies to require bidders on public works developments to enter into project labor agreements.\*Allow collective bargaining among public sector employees.\*Would require 100% of the state's electricity to be produced from renewable energy sources by 2050.\*Establish a carbon dioxide cap and trade program to reduce emissions at power sites.\Among the members who signed the letter to Northam are the Hampton Roads Chamber and Virginia Peninsula Chamber, the Virginia Manufacturers Association, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Virginia Retail Federation and the Virginia Trucking Association.\At a Wednesday press conference to update the state's residents on the spread of coronavirus, Northam said he's talking with the patrons of several bills as well as labor unions, the business community and others, and will make a decision on what to do.\The General Assembly reconvenes April 22.\The state's Republican leadership in the Senate, including Sen. Tommy Norment (R-James City County) had earlier written to Northam saying any legislation that ""increased taxes or fees, added regulation, or placed new limits on free commerce and economic growth should either be vetoed or amended,"" as a result of the coronavirus.

49,"From creating jobs to making Earth safe for future generations, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu made his case Tuesday to overhaul the nation's energy system.\In Newport News to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Jefferson Lab, Chu said the United States risks falling behind other nations, specifically China, by not responding quickly to climate change.\He called for investment in clean energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, and improving mainstay energy sources, such as nuclear and coal-fired power plants.\""I actually think this is the future to our economic prosperity,"" said Chu, who spoke before a few hundred people gathered at the Energy Department-funded nuclear physics research facility.\A key element to his plan is the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, a controversial bill that aims to blunt the effects of climate change. The bill, sometimes referred to as cap-and-trade, narrowly passed the House and awaits action in the Senate.\Detractors say it will do little to improve the environment, put businesses at a disadvantage and strain the incomes of everyday Americans. Chu addressed the last point.\Federal budget analysts think the typical U.S. household's energy bill could increase 48 cents per day under the proposed legislation, he said. That's a little more than $175 a year.\Chu likened the cost increase to buying insurance that will ensure a healthy, sustainable world for future generations.\""It's fundamentally the right thing to do,"" he said.\In an interview after his speech, Chu was asked about Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, which announced last year it intended to build a $6 billion coal-fired power plant in Surry County. Several nearby residents and environmental groups oppose the project.\Chu said he favors delaying new coal plants until companies further reduce harmful emissions, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, at existing plants. He said that in many cases, upgrading existing plants can be more cost-effective than building new ones.\The energy debate is rarely as contentious at Jefferson Lab, officially known as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Created in 1984, its primary research revolves around an electron beam that smashes atoms together in an attempt to better understand the nature of protons and neurons.\""It's like causing a car wreck to see what happens,"" said Kandice Carter, a spokeswoman at Jefferson Lab.\Still, the research has practical applications. Employees have garnered more than 80 patents since 1991. Oftentimes, different disciplines of science cross paths, said Hugh Montgomery, the lab's director.\Work performed at the lab could lead to enhancements in clean energy or energy efficiency, he said. Chu, a Nobel prize-winning physicist, agreed.\""You can't really tell,"" he said.\ENERGY SECRETARY AT JEFFERSON LAB\U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu appeared at Jefferson Lab in Newport News on Tuesday. In addition to commemorating the facility's 25th anniversary, Chu weighed in on controversial topics, including climate change legislation, a proposed coal-fired power plant in Surry County and the economy."
50,"One way to deal with a problem is to pretend it doesn't exist. This approach has the virtue of relieving you from having to come up with a solution, spend money or make tough choices. The downside, of course, is that leaky faucets and other problems rarely solve themselves and, in fact, usually get worse if ignored. \Such is the case with climate change, a threat that too many members of Congress, most of them Republicans, have decided to manage by denying the science. That head-in-the-sand approach avoids messy discussions of higher energy prices, but it just got harder to justify. \Late last week, the nation's pre-eminent scientific advisory group, the National Research Council arm of the National Academy of Sciences, issued a report called ""America's Climate Choices."" As scientific reports go, its key findings were straightforward and unequivocal: ""Climate change is occurring, is very likely caused primarily by human activities, and poses significant risks to humans and the environment."" Among those risks in the USA: more intense and frequent heat waves, threats to coastal communities from rising sea levels, and greater drying of the arid Southwest. \Coincidentally, USA TODAY's Dan Vergano reported Monday, a statistics journal retracted a federally funded study that had become a touchstone among climate-change deniers. The retraction followed complaints of plagiarism and use of unreliable sources, such as Wikipedia. \Taken together, these developments ought to leave the deniers in the same position as the ""birthers,"" who continue to challenge President Obama's American citizenship a vocal minority that refuses to accept overwhelming evidence. \The Climate Choices report didn't generate big headlines because its conclusions aren't new; they are consistent with the scientific consensus about global warming. That consensus acknowledges some uncertainty in the extent to which climate change is the result of human activity, and how bad global warming will be if nothing is done. \Even so, as the report says, ""uncertainly is not a reason for inaction,"" and the most effective national response to climate change would be to ""substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" \If the deniers want a more legitimate basis for resistance, it is this: Even bold and costly national U.S. actions to limit greenhouse gases will be ineffective unless developing nations also curb their emissions. It's hard to imagine China and India acting, however, if the U.S. doesn't lead. \The Climate Choices report, requested by Congress, suggests investing in clean-energy technology, looking for ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and most important putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions. ""Cap-and-trade,"" a complex but proven way to use market forces to reduce pollution, passed the House in 2009. Like health care reform, though, it has become so unpopular in GOP circles that at the first Republican presidential debate this month, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty abjectly apologized for once supporting the idea. ""I've said I was wrong,"" Pawlenty groveled. ""It was a mistake, and I'm sorry."" \For now, his party's rejectionist stance is unrivaled among major political parties, including conservative ones, around the warming planet. The latest scientific report provides clarity that denial isn't just a river in Egypt. It paves a path to a future fraught with melting ice caps, rising sea levels, shifting agricultural patterns, droughts and wildfires. \Leaky faucets, indeed."
51,"RICHMOND - Trailing in polls, Democrat R. Creigh Deeds on Monday blasted his Republican foe in Virginia's gubernatorial race as no friend of working women or gays and twice accused him of lying.\Deeds' pugnacious style reflected the urgency Democrats feel three weeks from Election Day as they struggle to keep the governor's seat for a third four-year term despite a political environment far different from a 2008 race that Barack Obama and the Democrats swept.\Republican Robert McDonnell, comforted by polls showing him with a solid lead of 8 to 9 percentage points, appeared relaxed and confident in the first prime-time televised debate. That was even as Deeds again lashed him over a stridently conservative graduate thesis he wrote in 1989 that criticized women with careers, gays and unmarried people who live together.\The sharp tone reflects the stakes before both parties in an election viewed as an early voter verdict on Obama and an allied Democratic Congress.\The issues of taxes, transportation, energy policy and rights of gays and women dominated the third of four debates and the only one carried by stations in every market statewide.\Deeds took the offensive early on the gender issue as both candidates pledged to continue an executive order mandating equal pay for male and female state government workers.\""Women constitute 54 percent of our population, government should look like the people we represent,"" Deeds said, pledging that half of his Cabinet would be women.\Deeds also quickly flagged the thesis McDonnell wrote at age 34 for a master's and law degree at Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson's Regent University, the school's pro-male hiring policies and McDonnell's vote in 2001 against a resolution calling for equal pay when he was a member of the House of Delegates.\""I've been married to a working woman for 33 years,"" McDonnell countered. ""My oldest daughter was a platoon leader in Iraq when Creigh and I ran against each other a couple of years ago, and I'd say that's the ultimate working woman.""\The Democrat accused McDonnell of lying about positions Deeds had taken on energy and tax policies.\McDonnell claims in television ads that Deeds supports tax increases and a federal cap-and-trade energy measure that would cost Virginia families thousands of dollars a year.\And he renewed the charge in response to McDonnell's claim that Deeds supported a $1 billion boost in taxes, saying he had just heard McDonnell ""restate a lie.""\McDonnell told reporters after the debate that he found Deeds' calling him a liar ""to be really below the dignity of a gubernatorial campaign.""\Virginia and New Jersey are the only states electing governors this fall, and Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, Obama's choice as Democratic National Committee chairman, has pledged at least $6 million to his home state to keep the GOP from winning his seat for the first time in eight years.\Deeds entered the debate needing a breakout moment. Polls by The Washington Post and by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc. in the past week showed McDonnell with a solid lead and faring much better among independent voters than Deeds.\The Post poll showed that the thesis ranked low among voters' chief concerns heading into the Nov. 3 election.\The League of Women Voters and AARP sponsored the debate."
52,"The Sheboygan (Wis.) Press, in an editorial: ""Much of the debate this Earth Day centers on whether global warming is real or not.

Other scientists ... say the earth is merely going through a normal cycle. ... Eventually, the cycle will shift to one of global cooling. While Earth Day is as good a time as any to continue the global warming debate, fact is, you don't have to subscribe to the global warming theory in order to take steps to preserve the environment.

53,"Voters supported an eco-minded measure to ban fracking for natural gas in Longmont, Colo., but rejected one to require boosting wind and solar energy in Michigan. A split verdict for the environment? \Perhaps, but the 2012 elections and especially President Obama's victory suggest the nation's energy and environmental agenda will largely continue in the same direction -- not great news for backers of former GOP governor Mitt Romney. \""Obama's re-election will have a huge impact,"" says David Kreutzer, an energy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \""We'll see the continuation, and perhaps the acceleration, of anti-fossil-fuels regulations,"" he says, citing Environmental Protection Agency rules to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants. Stock prices for coal companies, which could be affected by the rules, have fallen since the election. \Kreutzer expects Obama to reject the revised northern leg of the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline, which Romney supported, and to push for renewal of tax credits for utility-scale wind producers, which Romney opposed. \""We're kind of back to where we were,"" he says, noting that Congress remains split between a GOP-led House of Representatives that has balked at Obama's efforts and a Democrat-controlled Senate that often can't muster the 60 votes needed to end filibusters. \Yet environmentalists expect gains on Capitol Hill, citing the Senate victories of Democrats Martin Heinrich in New Mexico, Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Jon Tester in Montana. The wind industry hailed the Senate election of Independent Angus King, a former governor who became a wind project developer, in Maine.  \""This will absolutely embolden the Senate,"" says Heather Taylor, director of the NRDC Action Fund, the political advocacy arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. She says oil and gas interests spent hundreds of millions on campaign ads but have ""nothing to show for it."" \Her camp cites other victories, including the gubernatorial win in New Hampshire of Democrat Maggie Hassan, who backs her state's participation in a nine-state cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Hassan's GOP opponent, Ovide Lamontagne, said he'd pull New Hampshire out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI. \In the Boulder suburb of Longmont, Colo., nearly 60% of voters supported a grass-roots measure to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the process by which natural gas is extracted from shale deposits. \But in Michigan, nearly two-thirds, or 63%, of voters rejected a ballot that would amend the state's constitution to require that 25% of its electricity come from renewable sources by 2025. Kreutzer says they voted against ""higher electricity bills,"" but Taylor says exit polling shows they rejected the measure mostly because they didn't want to amend the constitution for it. \Whatever the reason, both sides are pushing their ideas. Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, called on Obama last week to expand domestic oil and natural gas production. Romney supported opening all federal lands to drilling. Obama has opened some but not all. \""With both candidates supporting more development of America's vast oil and natural gas resources, energy is a big winner in this election,"" Gerard said in a statement. \Denise Bode, who heads the American Wind Energy Association, is rallying Democrats and Republicans to renew the production tax credit for wind farms, slated to expire at the end of December. \She says the credit's uncertainty has caused layoffs at wind farms and its expiration could kill 37,000 jobs within a year. \The environmental activist group 350.org will hold another White House rally on Sunday to pressure Obama to block a revised northern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline. \Other environmentalists are calling on the EPA to finalize rules limiting carbon and soot pollution from new power plants as well as industrial or commercial boilers. \They cited Obama's victory speech early Wednesday when he talked about a future that would not be ""threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.""\Credit: Wendy Koch, @wendykoch, USA TODAY"
54,"Two years ago this month, crude oil prices spiked to more than $145 a barrel, driving the price of regular gasoline to more than $4 a gallon and painfully reminding the nation once again how vulnerable it is to the whims of the international oil market. \It's reasonable to ask what policymakers have done in the past 24 months to try to reduce that vulnerability. For that matter, it's reasonable to ask what they've done in the 37 years since the Arab oil embargo, which caused huge lines at gasoline stations, to stop enriching hostile petro-states in the Middle East and elsewhere. \The answer: not nearly enough. \There have been energy bills, incentives for oil drilling, tax breaks for solar and wind and biofuels, billions for energy research, and so on. But here's the one metric that matters: In 1973, the United States imported about 30% of its oil. Now it imports about 68%. \The Senate will soon take up another energy measure, one that now looks likely to emerge as a watered-down compromise that will do little to change things. The legislation could contain some useful incremental provisions to address BP's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and promote home energy efficiency. But it won't swing for the fences. ""Cap and trade"" -- a mechanism to limit greenhouse-gas emissions by making oil, coal and other fossil fuels more expensive over time -- is dead for now. \That's too bad. Because if there's one thing that really works, it's price. \Consider what happened when gasoline prices spiked in 2008. It was painful for just about everyone, and particularly hard on lower-income people and those who had to drive long distances. But it did more to change habits and reduce oil usage than anything Congress and a parade of presidents had done in decades. \In June 2008, Americans drove 12 billion fewer miles than in June 2007, part of the longest sustained drop in driving since high prices discouraged driving in the 1970s. Car buyers suddenly wanted smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and began to try to shed their SUVs. Sales of Toyota's 50-mpg Prius hybrid shot up by 69% in 2007, exceeding those of the popular Ford Explorer SUV. The Toyota Corolla was the No. 1 selling car in the country in June 2008, while the Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado pickups -- traditionally best-sellers but comparative gas guzzlers -- had dropped to fifth and sixth place. But once prices fell, so did sales of the Prius and Corolla. The F-150 and Silverado again rose to the top of the heap. \Four decades of experience suggests the only way to wean the nation off its ruinous oil addiction is prices that go up and stay up. And, although it's a political non-starter for now, the simplest and best way to achieve that is to gradually raise the federal gasoline tax, now 18.4 cents a gallon, where it has been since 1993. \The arguments for a gas-tax increase are no less compelling for their familiarity. Higher taxes would produce substantial revenues -- roughly $1 billion a year for every extra penny in tax -- that could be used to fix roads and reduce the budget deficit. They would make fuel-efficient cars more attractive. \Ultimately, higher taxes could help drive alternative technologies that would slow the flow of money to finance some of the world's worst regimes and multinational oil companies, such as BP. \Whether increasing the gas tax would reduce the need for drilling in environmentally sensitive areas such as the Gulf depends on worldwide demand for oil, which is being driven upward by the rising economies of China and India. But those countries have their own efforts to curb gasoline use, and reducing consumption in the USA, the world's top oil consumer, is essential. \To be sure, the middle of a shaky economic recovery is a bad time to raise taxes. But total gasoline taxes are now lower than they've been in decades after adjusting for inflation -- less than half what they were per mile driven in 1970, for example. And while shocking the economy with a tax increase of 50 cents or $1 a gallon all at once wouldn't be prudent, phasing in such an increase -- a penny or two a month for 48 months, for example -- would limit the economic damage. \A gradual increase would also send an unmistakable message that the price of gasoline will eventually rise to reflect its real cost to the economy, the environment and national security. And it would give car owners plenty of time to plan for a change. \Brave (or foolish) politicians have been calling for this for years with no success, but it's an idea whose time should come. The alternative is a status quo where nothing changes except the amount of environmental degradation and the nation's weakness in the face of foreign oil suppliers."
55,"VIRGINIA BEACH - Gov. Ralph Northam is pushing hard for clean energy, clean water, a clean Chesapeake Bay and environmental justice with $733 million in new spending contained in his proposed budget package.\The governor announced the partial plan Wednesday at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Brock Environmental Center ahead of unveiling his full spending package next week.\It includes not only big investments in bay cleanup, clean energy infrastructure, offshore wind energy, land conservation and community outreach, but also paves the way for Virginia to join a regional partnership to reduce carbon emissions - a move that Republicans in Richmond blocked earlier this year.\Northam said in a statement that his plan proves that ""a clean environment and a strong economy go hand-in-hand.""\""These significant investments in environmental protection, environmental justice, clean energy and clean water will combat climate change and ensure we maintain our high quality of life here in Virginia,"" Northam said.\CBF President William C.

These investments are expected to put Virginia on track to meet its 2025 deadline for bay restoration.\Zack Greenberg of The Pew Charitable Trusts said in a statement that the $10 million Northam earmarked for reef work would keep Virginia a ""national leader in large-scale oyster restoration.""\*$40 million to upgrade the Portsmouth Marine Terminal to lure new investments in the offshore wind energy supply chain. The plan would also create the state's first Office of Offshore Wind, tasked with coordinating with local, state and federal agencies to secure supply chain and industry jobs.\Secretary of Commerce and Trade Brian Ball said in a statement that the proposed investments ""will create new business opportunities, expand customer access to renewable energy and spark high-demand jobs of the 21st century.""\*$171 million to conserve natural lands and improve state parks.\*$25 million to the state Department of Environmental Quality for efficiencies in permitting, greater public engagement and environmental protections. Some $2.7 million is earmarked for environmental justice and community outreach.\*$10 million for a new Clean Energy Revolving Loan Fund to help governments, small businesses and low-income residents pay for clean energy infrastructure.\Finally, Northam struck a budget provision that the Republican-led General Assembly had inserted earlier this year that prevented the state from joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. RGGI is a cap-and-trade market run by nine states to limit carbon emissions by major industrial polluters.\Republicans had argued that membership would hike electric bills for Virginians by about $12 a month, although the DEQ had said bills could go down.\Then last month's election flipped the General Assembly to majority Democrat, and now the Democratic governor says he plans to propose legislation to join RGGI.\On Wednesday, House majority leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, and House Commerce and Labor Committee Chairman Terry Kilgore, R-Gate City, issued statements insisting that RGGI membership will cost Virginians, particularly lower-income residents.\""Radical environmentalists spent big during the 2019 campaign to get Democrats elected, and they expect a return on their investment,"" Gilbert said. ""Now we know what that return looks like: a carbon tax that will cost Virginia jobs and stick hard-working families with higher energy bills - nearly $6 billion over 10 years.""\""Southwest Virginia has seen this before,"" Kilgore said. ""Richmond tries a new scheme and our power bills go up.""\Northam has shown a strong commitment to mitigate the impacts of climate change, including announcing flood-protection building standards last month for new state-owned property. The new standards are considered the strongest in the country. A global hot spot for sea level rise, Virginia suffers the tidal flooding and more intense storms associated with climate change.\In August, Northam released the state's third and final Watershed Implementation Plan, a road map to clean up the Chesapeake. The plans are devised by bay states to fulfill their mutual commitment to have anti-pollution measures in place by 2025 to restore the nation's largest estuary. Studies have shown that Virginia is largely on track to meet that deadline, but only with more investment.\Northam is scheduled to present his full spending package to the Joint Money Committees on Tuesday.\Tamara Dietrich, 757-247-7892, tdietrich@dailypress.com"
56," This year marked the 10th annual America Recycles Day - which was on Nov. 15 - an anniversary that falls in the midst of national debate about how our country can most effectively respond to the fast-approaching crisis of global warming.\ Although a majority of Americans now believe recycling is very important, many do not yet appreciate the major role it can play in combating the worst effects of climate change.\ The fact is that a dramatic increase in recycling can provide all of us with a simple but meaningful way of placing our homes, our cars and our lifestyles on the front line of climate change solutions - solutions that can play a role in protecting the small, fragile planet we all share.\ The National Recycling Coalition strongly believes that emerging legislation to combat climate change provides a singular opportunity to re-energize the public's commitment to recycling by education, and, more important, by much-needed investment in our recycling infrastructure.\ Just think: A bottle used today can be recycled to recreate a bottle for use tomorrow. With each step forward in recycling, we have more materials that can be reused - thereby avoiding the significant greenhouse gas emissions created by harvesting virgin materials and dealing with their disposal in landfills and waste combustors.\ Happily, we can build this new initiative on a growing foundation of good news. Over the past few decades, the U.S. recycling rate has grown from single digits to more than 30 percent - annually salvaging 82 million tons of reusable materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, steel, glass, yard waste and computers.\ That's the equivalent of removing the carbon emissions of 39.4 million passenger vehicles from the road each year. Recycling all of our 251 million tons of trash obviously is even better - offsetting the carbon emissions of more than 120 million vehicles.\ American businesses also are increasingly demonstrating environmental leadership. Consider just a few recent examples:\ * Coca-Cola is investing $60 million in recycling initiatives in the United States with the goal of recycling and reusing all the plastic in its beverage containers.\ * Waste Management Inc. plans to increase the volume of recycled materials it processes from 8 million to 20 million tons per year over the next dozen years.\ * Office supplier Staples Inc. is offering recycling for computers and monitors at all of its 1,400 stores.\ * Computer maker Dell Inc. offers free recycling of any of its used products for recycling.\ Yet much more remains to be done. The new numbers on recycling released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are sobering indeed. They show a disturbing trend: In recent years, the growth of recycling has slowed, with the recycling rates of some key materials and products flattening or declining.\ Between 1990 and 2000, recycling volumes and rates rose about 10 percent annually. Yet from 2000 through 2005, the growth rates tapered off to a meager 1 percent to 2 percent a year. And last year they did not grow at all.\ The reality is that most of the 80 percent of Americans who recycle do so only on an occasional basis. These ""sometimes recyclers"" view the many benefits of recycling as too abstract. While they may have a vague notion of saving a tree or doing the right thing for the environment - they often get little or no emotional reward for the effort. When you recycle on a daily basis your emotional reward comes from not just feeling good about your actions, but knowing you are setting an example that will motivate others to recycle as well.\ With all America's wealth and ingenuity, we should be the recycling model for the world. Higher recycling rates of 50 percent and even 80 percent are achievable and can lead us quickly to the nirvana of Zero Waste. It is hoped the omnibus climate change legislation now moving through Congress will be the catalyst for a renewed national pledge to move from a disposable nation to the world's first sustainable one.\ Many of the current climate change proposals, including the sweeping bipartisan Senate bill sponsored by Connecticut's Joseph Lieberman and Virginia's John Warner, will launch a multi-pronged assault on global warming. Missing in all of the legislation, however, is any recognition of the value of recycling in combating global warming.\ One vital addition: enabling legislation that allows the private and public sectors to work together on jointly funded local projects. Communities and industries that develop new recycling projects should have the incentive of participating in a cap-and- trade program. Tax policy should provide tax credits and other carrots for processors to modernize and expand infrastructure. Manufacturers should be motivated to optimize the use of recycled materials in their products.\ It is only fitting after a decade of celebrating America Recycles Day that the value of recycling in a carbon-constrained world be fully recognized, realized and enhanced for all Americans. That alone would be a giant step forward in changing the climate.\ Krebs is the executive director of the National Recycling Coalition Inc. ( www.nrc-recycle.org)."
57,"WASHINGTON - Capitol Hill Democrats who soon will run the House of Representatives are prioritizing climate change nearly a decade after their attempts to slow global warming helped whisk them out of power.\Party leaders vowed to hold hearings on President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to undo Obama-era climate rules and demanded internal documents on administration decisions to scale back restrictions on fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.\Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is vying to regain her role as House speaker, said she planned to revive a special congressional panel designed to examine climate change. The Select Committee on Energy Independence & Global Warming was shelved after Republicans took over the House in 2010.\That urgency grew after the release Friday of a dire government report that climate change poses an increasing risk to the planet in the form of extreme weather, worsening health conditions, the spread of new diseases, increasing drought and famine and economic decline.\Trump said Monday that he's not buying the National Climate Assessment's warning that the effects of global warming could reduce the nation's GDP by as much as 10 percent by 2100.\""I don't believe it,"" he said when asked about the conclusions of the report, which was written by dozens of top scientists from 13 federal agencies in the Trump administration.\Though they won back the House during the midterm elections by campaigning largely on health care, Democrats got the backing of environmental groups that poured tens of millions of dollars into their campaigns and registered liberal voters.\The quandary for the party leaders when they take back power Jan. 3 is how aggressively to pursue an issue that contributed to the tea party wave that fueled the Republican takeover of the House in 2010. How prepared are they to address arguments that ""alarmist"" climate change policies would increase energy prices and reduce consumer choice? How willing are they to take on a president who was elected two years ago on an America First platform that promised to ""bring back coal"" as part of an energy independence agenda?\For now, Democrats are content to build a case through fierce congressional oversight and the power to subpoena administration records, knowing that any major legislation they could pass probably would be vetoed by the president even if it got past the Republican-controlled Senate.\Lawmakers led by incoming Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J., demanded documents related to Environmental Protection Agency proposals to let states regulate their power plants, freeze fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks and roll back requirements on the power industry to check and repair methane leaks.\""The tragic and human and financial costs of unchecked climate change are high and increasing fast, and unfortunately the administration's actions for the last two years are only exacerbating these conditions,"" Pallone wrote in a letter Nov. 20 to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler.\The emphasis on climate change - which Trump has labeled a ""hoax"" perpetrated by China - comes amid a cascade of scientific reports, including from the United Nations, that portend catastrophic social, economic and environmental consequences within decades if global temperatures keep rising.\Effects are already being felt through stronger hurricanes, more intense wildfires, melting glaciers and loss of habitat, researchers say.\The Trump administration has made expansion of fossil fuels, including more offshore oil and gas drilling and mining, a centerpiece of its energy and economic agenda. The president also pushed to undo Obama-era steps aimed at addressing climate change: proposing a new Clean Power Plan rule to give states more authority to regulate the industry; recommending a freeze on mile-per-gallon standards for cars and light trucks after the 2020 model year; and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the international accord to gradually reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.\""This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,"" Trump said June 1, 2017, when he announced the withdrawal from the Paris accord.\An EPA spokeswoman said the agency was reviewing Pallone's letter.\David Doniger, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said forcing records into the light of day could pressure the EPA to withdraw rules or Congress to pass laws if they show the agency selectively used information or improperly skewed cost-benefits analyses to favor the fossil fuels industry.\""It's always important to know … more about the real influence and the real reasons and the real beneficiaries of these decisions,"" he said. ""The public has a right to know that.""\Pelosi was speaker in 2009 when the chamber narrowly passed a ""cap and trade"" bill to address climate change. Portrayed by opponents as little more than an energy tax that would hit consumers' wallets, the measure never came up for a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate and helped fuel the tea party wave that propelled Republicans to take control of the House in 2010.\Some House Democrats are content with modest efforts to address global warming.\""It's going to be, I think, more of an opportunistic strategy, where, in various pieces of legislation across the board, we're going to insert measures that address climate change,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., co-chairman of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, told The Hill newspaper.\Even if the House did pass an aggressive plan, it's doubtful the GOP-controlled Senate would take it up.\CREDIT: Ledyard King, USA TODAY"
58,"The Obama administration's historic plan to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants, unveiled Monday, could hasten the nation's shift from coal toward natural gas, energy efficiency and renewable sources such as wind and solar. \The controversial proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency calls for a 30% national cut in power-plant emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide -- below 2005 levels -- by 2030, but states get varying reduction goals, depending on their power mix. \The 645-page plan, a key pillar of President Obama's climate initiative, requires states to develop and implement plans for meeting targets. Recognizing that coal-fired facilities emit more carbon than other plants, the plan sets lower 2030 targets for some states that rely heavily on coal, such as West Virginia, than those such as New York, with a more diversified energy mix. \""The U.S. energy sector is in transition, anyway,"" and the plan's rollout in the next 15 years will help ""shape"" that shift in a low-carbon direction to address climate concerns, says Tim Profeta, director of Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environment Policy Solutions. \The nation's energy industry has dramatically shifted toward natural gas in recent years as new drilling techniques lowered its production costs. Power plants fueled by natural gas produced 30% of U.S. electricity in 2012 -- up from 16% in 2000. Plunging prices for solar panels and wind turbines have also prompted a surge in renewable energy. \In contrast, the coal industry has hit hard times. Its power plants still provide the nation's largest share of electricity, 37%, but that's down from 52% in 2000 and is expected -- even without the latest EPA proposal -- to hit 32% by 2040, according to the Energy Information Administration. \The EIA, which says the number of U.S. coal power plants has fallen from 633 in 2002 to 557 in 2012, expects 60 gigawatts of coal-fired power -- a fifth of U.S. coal capacity in 2012 -- will retire by 2020, and that's excluding the impact of the new EPA rule. The EPA says the average age of U.S. coal plants is now 42 years. \Critics say the EPA plan, expected to trigger legal challenges, amounts to a ""war on coal."" Rep. Nick Rahall, D- W.Va., said Monday that he and his state's GOP colleague, Rep. David McKinley, will introduce legislation to stop the new proposal, along with another one last year aimed at future power plants. \""This new regulation threatens our economy and does so with an apparent disregard for the livelihoods of our coal miners and thousands of families throughout West Virginia,"" Rahall said. \The new EPA rule, along with federal limits on mercury emissions taking effect next year, could force the retirement of at least one-third of the nation's coal-fired power plants by 2030, says Mike Duncan, CEO of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, an industry group. ""It creates a reliability and affordability problem,"" he says, adding it will raise electricity prices for consumers and manufacturers that will push jobs overseas. \Advocates say the plan has health, climate and economic benefits. ""This is not just about disappearing polar bears or melting ice caps. This is about protecting local economies and jobs,"" said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, adding it will spur innovation and create jobs. \The EPA projects annual compliance costs of $7.3 billion to $8.8 billion by 2030, but since the proposal is expected to reduce air pollution, it says annual public health benefits will total $55 billion to $93 billion by avoiding up to 100,000 asthma attacks and 2,100 heart attacks each year. \The proposal, which won't take effect for at least two years, lets states meet targets in a variety of ways that include greater use of pollution-control technology, energy efficiency, natural gas or renewable energy. States could also follow California others that created cap-and-trade programs that cap overall emissions but allow polluters to buy government-issued credits from clean-energy producers. \The ultimate impact will ""come down to costs,"" says Richard J. Campbell, a specialist in energy policy at the non-partisan Congressional Research Service. He says states will look for cost-effective ways to comply, including the potential retirement of more coal-fired power plants. \The EPA rule could accelerate the U.S. shift away from coal, but gives states plenty of options, says Kyle Aarons, a senior fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a non-profit group. \Even coal-reliant states should be able to meet goals, says Dan Bakal, director of electric power for Ceres, a non-profit that promotes corporate sustainabilty. He says they've yet to take steps, including trading pollution credits, that states with low carbon-emission rates have deployed. \Duke University's Profeta agrees, saying the proposal is ""not unsympathetic to coal-heavy states."" The EPA sets a 20% emission-reduction target for West Virginia and 19% for Wyoming by 2030, and an 18% cut for Kentucky. It sets a 44% goal for New York, which state can get credit for prior emission-cutting efforts.\Credit: Wendy Koch, USA TODAY"
59,"""Cheer up,"" advised writer Philander Johnson, ""for the worst is yet to come."" \That's good advice for conservatives these days. Things are grim, particularly for the GOP. The share of Americans who describe themselves as Republicans is plummeting so quickly, pretty soon more voters will call themselves Hobbits than Republicans. While Barack Obama is surprisingly weak given all of the Democrats' advantages, the smart money remains that the Democrats will capture the White House and expand their majorities in Congress considerably. \The issue climate is arguably even worse. From Social Security to health care to the environment, Democrats have the wind at their backs. If Obama continued to run from the left and won in November, Democrats would be able to claim the biggest mandate for liberalism since 1964. \Democrats would be able to dispatch a cavalry of young judicial reinforcements to renew the effort to push the courts ever further to the left. Some form of socialized medicine would be implemented. President Obama would in all likelihood fulfill his pledge to pull out of Iraq. Taxes would go up. Farm subsidies increase. State-level efforts to establish gay marriage by undemocratic fiat would find eager accomplices in Congress and the Justice Department. Draconian taxes on energy use -- often hidden behind cap-and-trade schemes -- would be implemented in the name of combating global warming. The ""Fairness Doctrine"" might be restored to silence conservative media. There are even rumors that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pondering legislation that would require dogs to take orders from cats. \Plight of the right \The knife of doom cuts deeper still. The intellectual press is positively brimming with mostly gleeful autopsy reports about conservatism's alleged demise. In a wandering piece for The New Yorker, titled ""The Fall of Conservatism,"" George Packer simultaneously argues that the right is out of ideas and that it really never had any worth speaking of in the first place. In discussions, public and private, you often hear phrases such as brain-dead, spent, exhausted, used up, played-out-like-Carrot Top and the like to describe the plight of the right. \A particularly popular line of argument found all over the place holds that conservatism is a pale shadow of what it was in the days of Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater and now William F. Buckley. Indeed, many liberals have adopted the annoying habit of talking about Reagan, Goldwater and Buckley as if they have always loved and respected them. It reminds one of that line from Stripes where Bill Murray says to his girlfriend, ""Tito Puente's gonna be dead, and you're gonna say, 'Oh, I've been listening to him for years, and I think he's fabulous.'"" \Regardless, all this gloom and doom is overdone. Conservatives have a natural inclination toward pessimism. Back in 1968 -- when Packer et al thought conservatism was ascendant -- many conservatives thought it was done. Richard Nixon's thoroughly liberal domestic agenda, and the willingness of conservatives to tolerate it, was proof according to conservative intellectual Brent Bozell that conservatism had ""ceased to be an important political force in America."" \People need to remember that there's a difference between ""conservatives"" and ""Republicans."" One reason the Republican ""brand"" has been so badly tarnished is that Republicans lost credibility as conservatives. They spent money like a pimp with a week to live. They got comfortable with power and the perks that come with it, and they tolerated cronyism and incompetence. And while the GOP is the more conservative of the two parties -- and hence the natural home for the American right -- it needs to be remembered that Republican failures are not synonymous with conservative ones. \Also, the strength of the conservative establishment shouldn't be discounted. In 1964, Goldwater was almost alone, relying on a couple of magazines to champion his cause. Today, there is an enormous conservative intellectual infrastructure, largely independent of the Republican Party. From proliferating state-level think tanks to massive organizations based in Washington, D.C., such as the Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute, the causes of limited government, defending life and promoting free markets are hardly without champions. And thanks to talk radio, Fox News and a general acceptance of conservatism as a legitimate viewpoint, it has never been easier for conservatives to get their arguments to the public. \Reality bites \Reality could yet prove to be the grinder for a lot of liberal baloney. After New York Mayor Ed Koch lost his re-election bid, he was asked whether he would ever run again. He responded, ""No, the people threw me out. Now they must be punished."" There's a lot of wisdom in that. Parties -- and voters -- learn from their own mistakes and those of others. \""Example is the school of mankind,"" noted Edmund Burke, the founder of modern conservatism, ""and they will learn at no other."" \The GOP made some awful blunders, and it is paying the price for them. But such payments can also purchase redemption if you learn the right lessons. \Moreover, if conservatives are right about their ideas -- and I think they are -- then socialized medicine won't work, high taxes will be counterproductive, and Obama's promise to mesmerize foreign leaders with his listening skills will not survive contact with our enemies. Al-Qaeda will not defang itself into a Muslim version of the Shriners simply because our president's middle name is Hussein. \T.S. Eliot was right. There are no truly won causes because there are no truly lost causes. Conservatism's got a lot of life left in it, in part because conservatism is simply a part of American life. And because conservatism has always done better on offense than on defense, the coming liberal maelstrom might be carrying with it the seeds of a conservative revival as well. \Jonah Goldberg is editor at large of National Review Online and author of Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning.

60,"Where the newspaper stands\ Gov. Tim Kaine seems to be searching for a legacy. At first it looked like it might be a significant upgrade to preschool in Virginia, until political and economic realities ganged up. He's taken an interest in land conservation - a good cause, but one advanced in bits, unlikely to have legacy-making impact. Transportation? Hardly.\ How about leading the fight against coal? It's the kind of fight that could make a lasting, meaningful difference, because coal- fired power plants pollute the air and water; cause smog and acid rain; sicken people, plants and animals. They're the largest single source of the carbon dioxide emissions that most scientists believe are contributing to global warming.\ Virginia has dirty, noxious coal-fired plants. But the plans to fix them, by both utilities and the legislators who regulate them, fall far short of what's needed. And now Dominion Virginia Power is seeking permission to build a huge new plant in southwest Virginia that will burn coal and waste wood and produce huge amounts of pollution.\ Virginia will need new supplies of electricity to accommodate growth, certainly. But their power should come from sources, such as nuclear power, that are less polluting than coal. The same kind of organized effort that's fighting the new coal-fired plant should go into helping move forward Dominion's plans to add reactor capacity to its North Anna plant. And into requiring - not just requesting, as Virginia does now - that utilities produce more power from nonpolluting alternatives.\ The governor's newly released energy policy is appropriately enthusiastic about renewable alternatives and open to expanded nuclear production. But it's too willing to accept that coal-fired plants are necessary to meet Virginia's needs.\ Fighting coal could be a nice fit for a governor looking for a legacy. Because what it will take is not money but courage. It will take political savvy, because the General Assembly is generally disposed to do the bidding of big utilities, particularly Dominion, which is generous with its members and very effective at lobbying. It's the kind of fight that will exact a political cost - and that's the kind of fight Virginia's system, which prohibits governors from succeeding themselves, invites. A governor leaving office has little to lose and much to gain from a good fight.\ And the fight against coal is one that needs to be fought. Because coal is a dirty fuel. Sure, it's cheap, but relying on cheap power just diminishes the impetus to get serious about conservation. Coal's cheapness deceives us, for the real cost of burning it, if we factor in the environmental damage it does, is enormous.\ For guidance, Kaine could call on his counterparts in states that have had the courage to stand up to polluting coal plants. Kansas recently denied a permit to a big plant, citing the link between the great quantities of carbon dioxide it would emit and climate change and environmental damage.\ New York's governor recently issued regulations to cut carbon dioxide emissions in power plants. He's carrying out the commitment New York made when it banded with other Northeastern states to cut carbon dioxide emissions, using a cap-and-trade approach that takes advantage of market forces to motivate improvement. California has mandated reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other sources.\ Sen. John Warner might add some inspiration: He has stepped up in the U.S. Senate to lead an effort to cut emissions from power plants, as well as from manufacturing and vehicles. In doing so, he'll have to battle an industry that's looking forward to building scores of new coal-fired plants. And his legislation, if it prevails, won't solve Virginia's problem: how to stop the proposed new plant.\ Dominion can paint lipstick on the pig by describing the proposed Virginia City plant as ""clean coal"" and talking about how it will use the latest ""clean coal technology."" But that's a misleading label, since this plant won't use the still-being-proven technologies that could make coal-burning reach the standard of cleanliness the environment needs.\ Dominion can tout that the plant will be ""carbon-capture compatible,"" but that mouthful doesn't mean anything, either. The promise it holds out - that there's a way to capture, and stash, the huge amount of carbon dioxide that comes from burning coal - is a hollow one. No one has come up with a way to do that, and even state regulators are dubious about Dominion's claim. The fact is, until that technology exists, the new plant will pump out more than 5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.\ Add in the 25 million pounds of pollutants per year it could emit, according to the state Air Pollution Control Board, and the plant as designed will be one of the biggest polluters in the state.\ We don't need that.\ Environmental groups are gearing up to fight the new plant, but what's needed is someone to take the lead, someone with visibility, clout and political chits to spend. Without such a leader, the long- established tendency of Virginia's legislature and regulators to kowtow to Dominion promises no outcome that will be good for Virginia. As evidence of that tendency, consider the legislature's latest stab at electricity regulation, which rewards utilities with an additional profit guarantee for building coal-burning plants. There's a legislative flourish that benefits utilities, not Virginia's air-breathing citizens.\ Conservation has to play a much bigger role in meeting our energy needs, and it's appropriately a centerpiece in Kaine's plan. We have scarcely begun to pick the low-hanging, easy fruit of reducing electricity use and increasing efficiency. Maybe if we can wean ourselves off cheap, dirty, coal-fueled power, and experience the real cost of electricity - including the cost to our air and our lungs, our children and our wildlife - we'd squander less of the precious stuff."

Ask Congress about a cap on carbon emmissions
\
To the Editor:
\
After a few busy months in Washington, D.C., Congress is taking a much-needed break. Many of Virginia's representatives will be back home, talking with constituents and holding town hall meetings -- giving all of us a chance to get answers about the big issues facing our country.
\
If you get that opportunity, I suggest you ask your representative what they are doing to help us achieve energy independence, improve our economy, make the United States more competitive in world markets, create opportunities for farmers, and protect our environment -- in other words, ask them what they're doing about climate change.
\
That one question will yield all those answers because, if done right, fighting climate change can help solve all of those challenges. In fact, rarely has one policy proposal -- a limit on the carbon pollution that causes climate change -- given us the chance to address so many critical issues.
\
With such a policy -- a ""cap"" on emissions -- there would be a limit on the carbon pollution that can be emitted into the atmosphere. (Carbon pollution comes from burning oil and other fossil fuels.) Companies would each have set limits on the amount of pollution they can give off. If a company reduces its emissions under their allowed level, they can sell the remaining allowances to other companies. Businesses can also save allowances for future use.
\
One result of the cap is that businesses will look for ways to be more efficient in how they use oil and other fossil fuels. This will spur new investments in developing and producing more energy efficient technology.
\
In fact right now, while we sit on the sidelines, foreign companies are developing cleaner fuels and energy efficient technologies. Being more energy efficient is one of the reasons Toyota recently passed General Motors as the world's largest car manufacturer.
\
But it is not too late for Virginia businesses to can get in on the action. There is no reason our workers and companies cannot become the manufacturers and sellers of new technologies. They only need Congress to act and implement a cap and trade system to combat global warming.
\
Fortunately the economic benefits of fighting climate change or just not confined to manufacturing. Farmers would also enjoy the benefits of increased demand for the crops they grow that could be used to produce biodiesel, low carbon ethanol, and other cleaner fuels. Plus, they could also get credit for farming practices that reduce emissions and store carbon in soils.
\
These new opportunities for farmers could ripple through rural area, helping to create jobs in small towns and farming communities across the state. A cap on carbon emissions will also reduce our dependence on imported oil, by promoting the use of energy efficient technology and renewable fuels.
\
If our overall economy does not use as much fossil fuels we will not have to import as much oil from the Middle East and other unstable regions of the world.
\
This August is a great opportunity for people who care about these problems to make our voices heard. Hopefully we can send a clear message to our members of Congress that when they go back to Washington, DC in September if they are serious about solving big problems, they need to be serious about passing a cap on carbon emissions.

A flat tax is a bad idea
\
To the Editor:
\
Many people talk about a flat tax rate as part of a fair tax plan and a solution to lower taxes. I just have to comment. What is a real ""fair tax"" plan? What does ""regressive versus progressive taxation"" mean in lay terms? What can we really do to fix taxes?
\
It sounds so fair to tax everyone at the same rate and at one time I thought it was the way to go. But consider this: say you are a couple and have an income of $30,000 and another couple has an income of a million dollars. At a tax rate of 10 percent for all, the first couple would pay $3,000; the second couple would pay $100,000. Now with the cost of living in this old world, who would be hurting for money worse: the first couple with $27,000 income after taxes or the second, with $900,000 in income?
\
That's what is meant by regressive taxes. It hits lower-income folks harder than higher-income folks. A progressive tax rate is instead based upon ability to pay. Say the couple making $30,000 is taxed at the rate of 5 percent and the couple making a million is taxed at the rate of 10 percent. They would pay $1,500 and $100,000 respectively. The family with fewer resources has to pay less as a percentage of their income. But the flat tax charges both families equally. That's why a flat tax is regressive.
\
It's also why progressive taxes make more sense. Wouldn't we all like to be well-paid ball players, be elected to Congress or be a CEO with high incomes of millions of dollars? But we can't all have jobs like that. Many play a part in society working at jobs that are necessary, with much lower incomes. Should lower-income people suffer under a regressive tax system that doesn't consider the standard of living they have to endure to pay their fair share of those taxes?
\
When we tax very low-income people in a regressive tax system, we actually cost ourselves extra in taxes in the long run. Often those people are thrown back on tax-funded social programs for help when they don't have the funds to acquire basic necessities. Letting low-income people keep more of their income saves all taxpayers money even if it's just by cutting out the administrative costs to administer social programs.
\
But what can we do to cut taxes? The answer is two fold.Who is paying the bulk of the tax burden today? Have you ever sat down and looked at all the taxes -- local, state, federal, which includes fees to drive your car, have a dog or cat, gas, utilities, sales, etc. -- that you are really paying? What percentage of your income is really going to taxes and fees to run government offices and programs? What does that leave you with to live on? Start there.
\
A flat tax sounds good but in reality it's just a diversion, not a solution.

William Jones (""Not Chernobyl,"" June 16) objected to my using subsidies from federal and state programs designed to promote solar energy. He reasoned that solar energy is not really cost-competitive since it requires subsidies to encourage adopters. He also objected to having his tax money used for this.\The International Energy Agency reports that fossil fuels received $557 billion in financial subsidies (for the entire world economy) in 2008. Between 2002 and 2008, subsidies from U.S. federal sources were $70.2 billion for fossil fuels and only $12.2 billion for renewable energy.\In addition to the direct monetary subsidy afforded to fossil fuels, we and the environment pay a hidden tax. We pay with increased medical costs associated with asthma and other diseases exacerbated by emissions. And we pay with persistent damage to the ecosystem resulting from the extraction, handling and burning of fossil fuels. Think mountaintop removal, oiled beaches, a warmer climate and an acidified ocean.\Without those subsidies, fossil fuel would be much more expensive. And Jones has paid a lot more of his tax money to support the likes of BP, ExxonMobil and Massey than he has to help spawn a U.S.-based clean-energy economy.\Another reader inquired about the SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Credits) we produce with our system and then sell. Many states mandate that a portion of the electricity provided by utilities comes from renewable sources. The utilities buy the electricity from commercial wind and solar operations, as well as home-based producers like me. This is different from buying ""permission to pollute"" as is done in cap-and-trade systems like that used for sulfur (acid-rain) pollution or that proposed for carbon.\Benjamin Cuker\Hampton\Service life\All out there who know how great we veterans and active-service members have it must also know the impact service to country has on the families. For example, place yourself before a Veterans Affairs judge over denied claims from radiation exposure and asbestos for service during a conscript time, in the 1950s.You sign a contract to do your duty - no opting out. It's ""Aye, aye, sir"" and get on with it. Then there are the 60 to 70 hours a week, plus duty days, at base pay, no overtime, a normal routine for many. Plus, the aftereffects from zinc chromate, PCBs, fiberglass, asbestos and beryllium.\In 10 years' time from commissioning date, I had six deployments of six months and four short ones. My wife practically raised our two sons, as well as transferring seven times. Since leaving active duty I have had to pay for all my dental work, hearing aids (service-related), eyeglasses and other medical needs, plus we must enroll in Medicare Part B (more cost) where our then-implied contract called for such items to be included in our lower pay scales and sometime under Social Security.\The fourth generation of my family is now serving in the all-volunteer force knowing full well all the consequences based on my counsel. (My grandson just put in an 88-hour week.) As I have echoed, ""Keep our troops in your mind and hearts; folks, you never know when you will need them."" Who is often the first to respond to an urgent need? Why is it employers often seek out former military personnel?\There must be something to military service both tangible and intangible we possess.\Edwin C. Oyer\Williamsburg\Copycat policy\This is in reference to ""Care for cats,"" May 29. What kind of person ignores an animal in need? Managing the feral cats is an issue that is long overdue. If the Peninsula Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals does not have room or cannot take on any more animals, why is it a crime to feed animals that are in need?\The personnel at Steve's Restaurant need some guidance and help with these cats. They sought help and ended up fined. Isn't starving an animal to death cruel, when you have the means to feed it? Isn't it our responsibility as humans to care for our strays? Our community leaders need to step up and help.\Our family donates food and money yearly to the SPCA to help the animals they have in their facility. What about the animals that have to scavenge to get enough food to live? I would like to see a plan implemented that will manage the feral cat situation, other than not feeding them and fining people who do. Maybe we could research how other cities manage this problem and institute some of their policies.\Linda Reagan\Newport News\A teacher's life\Reference the letter ""Teachers' pay,"" May 30. For the third straight year, teachers' salaries are frozen, and some teachers are losing their positions.\As far as teachers having a ""hefty salary,"" my salary is significantly lower than that of nearly all of my peers with similar educational background and experience. The average teacher's salary in Virginia is substantially lower than that of the national average; most local teachers earn far less than $50,000. When I started teaching in Newport News in 1974 with a salary of below $10,000, I had no illusions of becoming wealthy, and now as I finish my 36th year, I still find myself struggling to make ends meet.\Students attend 180 school days, but teachers work 192 or more, and far more than 6 1/2 hours a day, attending meetings and receiving additional training, tutoring and sponsoring activities after school, planning and preparing lessons, grading papers, contacting parents and attending school-related activities.\Many of the 5,000-plus students I've taught have returned to thank me and other teachers for making a difference in their lives and for helping them acquire the skills and experiences to compete, be successful, and attain a happy and productive life.\It is insulting to equate teachers with baby sitters. Educators don't baby-sit; we light the flame, and ultimately we pass the torch and trust them with our future. I didn't become a teacher to get wealthy. I teach because it's one of the most important, challenging and rewarding professions. It enriches me in a way that money cannot.\Tom Stroup\Newport News\To all dads\In response to David Squires' acknowledgment of dads, ""A special Father's Day 'thanks,' June 17. Maybe I misunderstood something. I feel he should have been a little bit more general or made a blanket statement: I want to thank every dad out there, in the world, doing what a real man ought to do.\We so often will just give a better acknowledgement to our moms, and rightly so.\However, there are men out there that give the meaning to the word ""father."" They are ""fighting a good fight"" and are not getting the thank-yous they so deserve. Thank you to my dad. I don't think there is a word in the dictionary to say more than thank you. Oh wait a minute, there is: I love you.\Sheryl L. Parris\Hampton\Think forward\The time is long past due for this country to pass green jobs, tax credits for green energy and a climate bill. The naysayers are uninformed about climate science or only interested in short-term profits. Our children and grandchildren need this legislation even more than we do.\Glenn Shean\Williamsburg"
63,"Colleen Holcomb (R)\Occupation: Attorney/Partner at Holcomb Law, P.C.\Age: 45\Education: B.A. Wellesley College, political science, J.D. Regent University School of\Law, M.A. Journalism Regent University School of Communication and the Arts\Previous public office: None\Family: Married to Wayne Holcomb, one son, 21, stepson, 15, stepdaughter, 12.\What would be your first bill (or budget amendment) if elected (and why would it be at the top of your list)?\There are so many things Virginia does well. We are currently the No. 1 state for business, and we must work to protect that. But, Virginia is failing children in foster care. Virginia ranks dead last among all 50 states in placing children in foster care in permanent homes by the time they age out of the system. Compared to their counterparts, foster children who are not placed in permanent homes are exponentially less likely to graduate from high school and more likely to experience homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, teenage pregnancy and to become victims of human trafficking. In addition to the horrific personal consequences to these children, on average, every child who ages out of the foster care system costs taxpayers $300,000 over the child's lifetime. This is a human rights crisis we must address, so the first bill I would introduce would be a student loan repayment program for Social Services caseworkers to increase retention of case workers. High turnover among Social Services caseworkers contributes significantly to Virginia's failure to place foster children in permanent homes. By addressing retention issues, we can better serve these vulnerable children.\Hampton and Poquoson are both low lying and vulnerable to flooding; what is your view about sea level rise and what, \if anything, the state role in addressing it should be?\In speaking with leaders in local municipalities, I have been told that it would be more effective and cost-efficient for the state to have its own fund to address some of these issues, rather than having to rely on the federal government for resiliency project funding and recovery efforts. I also support the formation of the Virginia Hurricane Risk Reduction Authority, an entity capable of working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to expedite needed resiliency projects.\If you could tell voters in a sentence or two or three what your basic approach would be as a legislator and what issue (or issues) matter the most to you, what would you say?\My basic approach as a legislator would be to first ask, ""How would this impact my constituents, and how can I do what's best for them?"" That requires asking questions, listening to residents and experts, looking for proven solutions, not defaulting to political agendas. The issues that matter most to me are issues that involve human dignity. To me, that means protecting our economy, because a thriving economy enables residents to use their gifts and talents to secure opportunities, then continue the cycle by then contributing to the community. A strong economy also increases revenues to fund our priorities like education, safety and transportation. Upholding human dignity also requires that we take care of those who take care of us and keep our communities safe by protecting firefighters, police and other first responders. It should go without saying that protecting human dignity means we do not legalize infanticide, but given the Democrats' doubling down on the radical partial birth abortion bill H.B. 2491 and Governor Northam's comments on the bill, we need to ensure that we have a delegate who will defend human dignity.\What have I neglected to ask you that I should have - and what would you tell me?\I have a passion for people. I have been blessed with great opportunities, and I want the same for all Virginians. I also know what it's like to have serious financial struggles, to have high student loan payments but be unable to find a job and to be without healthcare because the premiums are too high. I want to spare others that pain. I know the hard work and sacrifice it takes to build a business. I also know what polices encourage and enable employers to offer higher wages and good benefits, and I want to protect those policies. I believe we are at a crossroads in the Commonwealth. We are currently experiencing an opportunity economy as the #1 state for business. Employers are telling me they cannot find enough applicants to fill the jobs available. But if Democrats take control of the House of Delegates, we will take a sharp U-turn away from this opportunity economy. If Democrats succeed in overturning our Right to Work status, instituting burdensome regulations, arbitrarily raising the minimum wage and implementing costly energy taxes, we will lose jobs quickly. If Democrats maintain barriers to prevent small businesses from providing health care coverage to their employees, hardworking people will suffer. If we lose businesses and jobs we lose tax revenue and will be unable to fund priorities like education and public safety - that motivates me to fight, and that's why I'm running.\Martha Mugler (D)\Current occupation: Executive Assistant, Old Point National Bank\Age: 58\Education: BA Radford University, communications major\Previous public office: Hampton City School Board (2008 to present)\Family: Married to Ross, three adult children\What would be your first bill (or budget amendment) if elected (and why would it be at the top of your list)?\My first priority as a delegate will be to protect and increase public school funding. I will boost teacher wages to keep Virginia competitive with our neighboring states, lead the way to create workforce development programs to better prepare students for college and good-paying jobs, and fight to fully fund our public schools no matter the zip code. As a legislator in Richmond, I will also pursue public school infrastructure support to ensure our public schools provide a safe and healthy environment for our school children.\Hampton and Poquoson are both low lying and vulnerable to flooding; what is your view about sea level rise and what, if anything, the state role in addressing it should be?\As Delegate, I pledge to find solutions to the complex issue of man-made climate change. I will pursue legislation that will support efforts to address climate change and support regulations on carbon pollution, and support a shift from reliance on fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar which can ultimately become a true job creation opportunity for the Commonwealth. The communities of the 91st include Hampton, Poquoson, and York County - all of which are identified as particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and flooding. Virginia needs to pass legislation to fund participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) which presents the opportunity to cut carbon emissions from power plants and link the state with the nine-state carbon cap and trade program. The legislation would enable Virginia to auction the allowances and invest the revenues into programs that benefit the public - specifically coastal resilience in our district.\If you could tell voters in a sentence or two or three what your basic approach would be as a legislator and what issue (or issues) matter the most to you, what would you say?\My approach to legislating will be to work across the aisles to collaborate in order to make common-sense decisions for the citizens of the 91st District and the Commonwealth. The issues that matter most to me are fully funding public education, access to affordable health care for all Virginians and protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions. This is a stark contrast from my opponent who would like to limit access to affordable health care to the newly 400,000 eligible under Medicaid expansion.\What have I neglected to ask you that I should have - and what would you tell me?\I believe every Virginian deserves a quality education, and that starts with pre-K. Earlier this summer, the Governor signed an executive directive to expand access to early education for all at-risk children in need of quality pre-kindergarten. Governor Northam's Executive Directive is a monumental step towards ensuring all children receive a quality education. As delegate, I will continue to work until universal pre-K is a reality in Virginia - especially here in Hampton Roads.\Caption: Holcomb\Mugler"
64,"WASHINGTON - He first achieved national renown with a speech hailing bipartisanship, but will leave the White House with the widest partisan gap in approval ever recorded.\He spent much of his presidency singing the praises of cooperation across party lines, but nearly all his major accomplishments resulted from party-line votes or executive actions.\And if Republicans accused him of paying too much attention to Democratic interests, allies blamed him for neglecting his party. Democrats lost a dozen governorships and hundreds of state legislative seats, as well as control of Congress, during his tenure.\President Barack Obama leaves office with job approval ratings comparable to the final marks for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. But unlike them, Obama's support is overwhelmingly party based.\Eight in ten Democrats on average approved of Obama's work over the last eight years while only about one in eight Republicans did so. Now nearly nine in ten Democrats and six in ten independents, but only about one in seven Republicans, give him positive marks, according to polling by the non-partisan Pew Research Center.\That's disheartening for the leader who was hailed at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, when he was a little-known Illinois state legislator running for the U.S. Senate, when he declared ""there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America.""\Last January, in his final State of the Union address, Obama cited the increase in partisanship during his presidency as among his greatest regrets.\In an interview with the Washington Bureau several weeks later, Obama said he still believed in bipartisanship, but that he had decided early it could not be his top priority.\""Bipartisanship is not a virtue if we don't do anything, and we just leave problems unsolved,"" Obama said. ""Bipartisanship is a virtue if we, both sides, (say) 'Look, we have a problem. We may differ on how we solve it, but let's sit down and negotiate.' And there's never been an issue in Washington that I haven't been willing to take a half loaf or a quarter loaf.""\As he saw it, he had tried again and again without success to divide the loaf, only to be met with what the White House saw as relentless opposition.\After all, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky famously said in 2010 that the ""single most important thing"" for the GOP was to make Obama a one-term president, a goal hardly conducive to compromise.\""When you can't get a negotiating partner across the table who is going to agree to anything, then you have to make a decision,"" Obama said about the fight over the 2010 Affordable Care Act. ""Do I just drop it? Or ... do you say, 'Wow, I've got millions of people out there who don't have health insurance and I need to go forward' ""?\""At that point then, it was just a majority muscle move,"" he added.\Republican leaders claim Obama never offered half a loaf or anything like it. They say he didn't have the legislative experience to cut deals or was too aloof to engage in the fine art of wining and dining lawmakers to his side.\""Almost without exception, President Obama begins serious policy discussions by explaining why everyone else is wrong,"" McConnell wrote in his 2016 autobiography.\""The conversation would last as long as it took the President to feel satisfied that his soliloquy had outlined the issue well enough for me to understand,"" he wrote. ""Speaker Boehner famously put the phone on his desk and carried on a separate conversation during one of these exchanges with the President. I never put the phone down, but on one occasion, I did watch at least an inning of baseball.""\While both political parties blame the other for the widening partisan divide, the causes are not so simple. Leaders were caught in a dynamic that has emerged over decades.\In the 1960s and 1970s, the Democratic and Republican parties had broad coalitions of liberals, moderates and conservatives. Presidents could forge bipartisan consensus for major legislation, from civil rights to environmental protection.\But the ability to compromise weakened in the 1980s as Republicans grew more consistently conservative and Democrats more reliably liberal.\The divide widened under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, and worsened further under Obama.\Greater levels of education, the advent of social media, greater racial diversity, increased income inequality, and changes in the economy probably all played a role.\To the extent that Obama and Republicans in Congress have aggravated the gap, the two sides have very different explanations.\As Obama tells it, the story begins early in his first term as he rode to Capitol Hill in the presidential limousine. He was going to meet with Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, then the House minority leader, to discuss ways to stimulate the economy to avert a depression after the housing market collapse at the end of the Bush administration.\Obama said he had phoned Boehner and asked to ""come up to your caucus and talk.""\""As I'm driving over, he puts out a press release saying, 'We're against it,' "" Obama told friends later, referring to the alert he saw on an aide's Blackberry.\""We hadn't talked to anybody yet!""\Dozens of interviews with Obama aides and the president himself suggest that the limousine story, which he told and retold over the years, deeply colored his thinking about his GOP adversaries.\Boehner's team has a different memory of the incident.\They say it wasn't their intransigence that started the gridlock of the last eight years but Obama's initial approach to them.\They say he made clear that the Democratic majority in Congress, led by the newly-elected Democratic president, would push through a economic stimulus bill with or without Republican support.\Obama's handling of the stimulus bill was ""the original sin"" of his young administration, ""setting the course of partisanship and confrontation,"" former Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.\""There's an argument to be made that the history of the Obama presidency would have been very different if he had insisted on bipartisan discussions and input on the stimulus bill,"" Steel said.\In the end, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus was formally known, passed Congress with three Republican votes in the Senate and none in the House.\Mutual recriminations only worsened later that year when the administration and Congress negotiated over Obama's proposed health care reform law.\On that, the two sides again share a story but give it different interpretations.\For months, White House and Senate staffs shuttled up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, chasing potential compromises but finding none.\Eager to break the impasse, Obama invited Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a senior committee member, and several other lawmakers to the Oval Office for a session he thought could clear the way.\He set up the meeting the way he had learned from Republicans in the Illinois Senate: No public arrival. No parade before reporters. Just a few aides and officials in the room.\Grassley, with his low-key manners and graying hair, looked like the negotiating partners of Obama's past. Like Obama, he had done deals across party lines before.\It was early August. They sat in the Oval Office, Obama cross-legged in an arm chair, Grassley leaning back on a beige couch.\Can we make this idea work, or that one? Obama asked, working his way down the list. Is there another way you want to do it? Would he be willing to vote with the Democrats?\After a pause, according to a White House witness, the senator leaned toward the president and looked him in the eye.\""You know what, Mr. President?"" he said, ""I've got to admit - there's no change that allows me to vote for this thing.""\Obama and top advisers told that story often later. To them, it marked the moment they realized the Republicans were not prepared to consider the president's top domestic priority.\The moment symbolized something else for Grassley: Obama had started with a Democratic plan - government-based health care coverage - and was willing to tweak it only to pick up enough Republicans to allow the White House to claim it had bipartisan support.\Grassley said he wouldn't play that game. ""I said to the president, 'That's not bipartisanship,' "" he recalled.\For Obama, who believed in universal health care - or something close to it - the issue was simple. What was the point of winning the White House if you couldn't help people as you'd promised?\The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, passed in early 2010 without a single Republican vote. The party-line dispute contributed to the Democrats' heavy losses in midterm elections later that year, giving Republicans control of the House.\After that, the stalemate was set.\Republicans argued that the Obama was trying to ram his political agenda - including cap-and-trade legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and an overhaul of immigration laws - down their throats.\After bitter debate, the climate change bill was passed by the House but was never brought to a vote in the Senate, where it died. In 2013, the opposite occurred for immigration reform. It narrowly passed the Senate, but died without a vote in the House.\After that, Obama increasingly used executive authority to order rule changes for the environment, immigration, unemployment and other issues.\That means President-elect Donald Trump can reverse or amend many of them as soon as he takes office.\Jim Manley, a former top aide to then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said Republicans still remember Obama's boast to GOP leaders in the Oval office in 2009. ""Elections have consequences,"" the new president told them.\""They've never forgotten that,"" Manley said.\Credit: Washington Bureau - - christi.parsons@latimes.com - ; By Christi Parsons ;and Lisa Mascaro"
65,"Who's got the power? \Washington is a tribal town, and the election of a new chief -- make that commander in chief -- is sparking the most extensive reordering of influence and access since George W. Bush moved in eight years ago to take over from the Clinton administration. \""The changes are not only symbolic,"" says Stephen Hess, a veteran White House staffer whose latest book, What Do We Do Now? A Workbook for the President-elect, was published last week. The election returns prompt realignments at the White House and federal agencies, on Capitol Hill and in K Street lobbying firms. ""A game of musical chairs,"" Hess says. \Many Republicans are out of luck, their party having lost not only the White House but seats in the House and Senate for the second election in a row. Among Democrats, Obama's chief primary rival, New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, has scrambled to make amends by campaigning for him. Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman finds himself in a political no-man's land: The Democrats' vice presidential nominee in 2000 became an independent and spent months stumping with Republican nominee John McCain. \Then there are the big winners -- those who supported Obama early or filled critical roles in his path to the White House. They instantly become Washington's most sought-after guests for everything from Saturday night parties to Sunday morning TV talk shows. \Some of those who have the president-elect's ear and trust are obvious: His wife, Michelle, took a potent if largely private role in providing advice at critical points of the campaign. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate and Obama's political godfather, urged his junior colleague to make a presidential bid when others counseled caution. And whoever emerges as Obama's point person on the nation's financial crisis will tackle the administration's most pressing immediate concern. \Some winners are less obvious, including a 76-year-old Indiana Republican who will be an unlikely ally of Obama's in the Senate, and a 5-year-old Washington think tank that's poised to be both resource and scold for the incoming administration. \A look at seven of Washington's rising power centers during the Obama administration: \1. The best friend \Valerie Jarrett has known Barack Obama since 1991, when she offered a job to his fiancee, Michelle Robinson, as a City Hall aide to Mayor Richard Daley. Since then, Jarrett has become a trusted adviser to the Obamas as well as a fundraiser, sounding board and surrogate speaker. \""Practically a sister,"" Barack Obama has said. Jarrett is smart, calm, loyal and discrete. \That puts her in the tradition of such influential presidential best friends as Bert Lance for Jimmy Carter and Vernon Jordan for Bill Clinton. (Jordan happens to be related to Jarrett.) \Jarrett, 51, shares with Obama an exotic childhood. She was born in Iran, where her father, a doctor, participated in a program to help developing countries. At age 7, she and her family moved to Hyde Park, the wealthy, integrated area in Chicago where the Obamas live. \She is CEO of Habitat Co., a real estate company that has been acting as a court-appointed receiver for the Chicago Housing Authority -- the latest in a string of high-powered jobs, but presumably not her last. Wednesday, Obama announced she would help lead his transition team. \For both Obamas, campaign strategist Anita Dunn says, Jarrett is ""a combination of close friend who is totally loyal and absolutely honest, and valued adviser who protects their interests and can be trusted to execute successfully on any project she's given."" \2. The enforcer \Rahm Emanuel is everything Barack Obama is not. While Obama is cool and smooth, known for having marshaled a low-drama campaign, Emanuel is combative and coiled. His nickname: Rahmbo. \Even so, Obama announced Thursday that the Chicago congressman will be his White House chief of staff. That choice signals the president-elect's willingness to play political hardball even as he espouses the rhetoric of hope. (That contrast led House Republican leader John Boehner to call the pick ""ironic."") \Emanuel, 48, won both admirers for his savvy and detractors for his aggressiveness during his stint at the Clinton White House, where he had played a leading role in pushing for passage of NAFTA and a welfare overhaul. In 1999, the political operative returned to Chicago, where he made millions of dollars as an investment banker. He was elected to Congress in 2002. \He has been on a fast track, heading the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during his second term and helping engineer the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 2006. He had been positioned to be a future speaker of the House. \Despite his take-no-prisoners style -- even everyday conversations can be laced with profanity -- Emanuel did duck one tough call this year. Because of his ties to Obama and Hillary Clinton, Emanuel declined to endorse either until the Democratic contest was largely decided. He told reporters beforehand that he was ""hiding under the desk."" \3. The running mate \Vice President-elect Joe Biden is no Dick Cheney. Obama has made it clear that unlike President Bush, he won't be delegating the sort of far-ranging authority to his running mate that at times has made Cheney seem like the chief operating officer of the Bush administration. \During the campaign, Biden made some verbal missteps, including when he gave Republican nominee John McCain fodder for ads and attacks by predicting that Obama would be ""tested"" by foreign enemies during his first six months in office. \However, Biden is now poised to be one of the administration's most influential voices, one with a network of ties forged over 35 years in the Senate. \""Every major decision he'll be making, I'll be sitting in the room to give my best advice,"" Biden said at the vice presidential debate. \Biden's relationships with other senators could be helpful when there are confirmation battles and his tenure as Judiciary Committee chairman is likely to make Biden a key player if a Supreme Court nomination arises. \Most of all, Biden's years on the Foreign Relations Committee, which he has chaired, will give him a powerful voice on issues ranging from the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq to dealings with Iran. (Of course, that is also territory for the new secretary of State.) \""I think Biden is positioned in many respects to play the role that Walter Mondale did (in the Carter administration), a sort of senior adviser and troubleshooter across the board,"" says Joel Goldstein, a St. Louis University School of Law professor and author of The Modern Vice Presidency: The Transformation of a Political Institution. \In one way, Biden will be like Cheney, Goldstein says: At 65, Biden isn't likely to be eyeing a presidential bid of his own in, say, 2016, when a second Obama term would be over. \4. The bipartisan buddy \Richard Lugar seems an unlikely ally. At 76, he is a courtly, conservative Republican with a serious mien; he first was elected to the Senate from Indiana when Obama was a teenager in Hawaii. \Even so, Lugar took note when Obama talked in his 2004 Senate campaign about the dangers of nuclear proliferation, an issue to which Lugar has devoted years of effort. Lugar sent Obama a congratulatory letter when he won that Senate race and urged him to seek a seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \In 2005, Lugar invited Obama to join his annual trip to Russia and the former Soviet republics to tour nuclear, biological and conventional weapons sites. \The trip and a related bill enacted in 2007 -- it boosted U.S. efforts to destroy conventional weapons and interdict weapons of mass destruction -- became Exhibit A for Obama during the presidential campaign of a substantive achievement, and one that demonstrated his ability to work across party lines. \During the final presidential debate, Obama cited Lugar, running mate Biden and former Middle East envoy retired general James Jones as examples of people ""who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House."" \Lugar's ties are even closer to Biden, with whom he has served for three decades in the Senate. The two have alternated as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Lugar said in an interview Wednesday that they have ""a wonderful relationship."" \""I look forward to trying to be helpful"" to the Obama administration, he says, although he insists he's not interested in being secretary of State or having another administration job. \5. The advocate \Claire McCaskill was there when Barack Obama needed her most. Five days after he lost the New Hampshire primary, the freshman senator from Missouri endorsed him. \Her embrace was important for a reason beyond its timing: She was the first female senator to back Obama over Hillary Clinton. McCaskill said her daughter had pushed her to take a stand and not be ""a cheesy politician who's playing it safe."" \McCaskill became one of the Obama campaign's leading surrogates, unflappable enough to be regularly deployed to defend Obama during big controversies. \Dispatched to Fox News last month after Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., suggested racism among rural whites would prevent Obama from winning Pennsylvania, she dismissed John McCain's attacks. \McCain ""reminded me of the weather in Missouri when it comes to economic policies,"" she parried. ""Wake up tomorrow, and it's going to change."" \McCaskill, 55, is a former state auditor who lost a gubernatorial bid in 2004 and then won the Senate seat in 2006; Obama had campaigned for her. She conveys an aura of Show-Me State common sense. \Before the Missouri primary, McCaskill urged Obama to borrow a game plan from her Senate race, stumping in conservative rural areas as well as Kansas City and St. Louis. Obama did and eked out a victory in the Democratic primary. \""There are very few people who are closer to me, who I have relied on more for counsel or advice,"" Obama said in June. ""Should I be successful, she will be somebody who has the utmost access to the Obama administration."" That will give McCaskill influence well beyond her seniority ranking -- she's 95th out of 100 -- in the Senate. \6. The idea man \John Podesta has run the White House from the inside as President Clinton's chief of staff, and Obama tapped him to help run transition operations. \After that is done, Podesta plans to affect the new administration from the outside, at the think tank run by former Clinton aides that he founded in 2003. The Center for American Progress has been a resource for the Obama team on policy and personnel. \Its model is the conservative Heritage Foundation, which in 1981 published a 1,000-page department-by-department blueprint for Ronald Reagan's new administration called ""Mandate for Leadership."" \Podesta's group is scheduled to release a 50-chapter e-book next week on how to run the new administration. Already sent to the Obama team: A memo detailing what the past five president-elects did on each day of their transition. \In 1981, defense analyst Larry Korb wrote the Pentagon chapter for Heritage; this time, he's drafted the chapter on Iraq for the Center for American Progress. The exercise can shape policy at a time presidential appointees often are overwhelmed, he says. ""You say, 'These are your options ... and the pluses and minuses for doing them.'"" \Podesta, 59, is blunt-spoken, no-nonsense and tightly wound. Aide Jennifer Palmieri, also a veteran of the Clinton White House, says the group wants to ""mine the traps"" and ""create an environment"" conducive to passing universal health care and a cap-and-trade emission program to combat global climate change. \""There also will be times when we're an irritant"" to the Obama administration, she predicts, ""pushing the administration and Congress to go further."" \7. The leader of the opposition \Mitch McConnell first had to survive election night. That done -- he won a fifth Senate term in Kentucky over a tough challenge from Democrat Bruce Lunsford -- the Senate GOP leader stands as the Republican best positioned to throw roadblocks in the way of the Democratic president. \Republicans lost at least six Senate seats Tuesday, giving them the lowest count for either party for three decades. Even so, they maintained what McConnell calls ""the power of 41."" That's the number of votes needed to mount a filibuster and stall Senate action on just about anything. \McConnell will have to hold the diminished GOP ranks together, from outspoken conservative Jim DeMint of South Carolina to moderates such as Maine Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe. \McConnell, 66, who is married to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, is more of a behind-the-scenes tactician than the GOP's public face. \He will have to pick his shots, says Grover Norquist, who heads a group called Americans for Tax Reform and convenes a working session for dozens of conservative activists each Wednesday. \""One, what are the things you have to fall on your sword to stop?"" he says. That list should be limited to four or five matters of principle. ""If you start to filibuster everything, then people"" -- Norquist mentioned in particular ""the two ladies from Maine"" -- are likely to begin breaking ranks"
66," DENVER -- Voters in Boulder, Colo., will decide Tuesday whether the city will become the first in the nation to impose a ""carbon tax"" on homeowners and businesses to fund efforts to reduce emissions that cause global warming.\ If approved, the ballot measure would tax electricity usage and add about $16-$20 a year to the average residential electric bill. Businesses would pay an additional $46 a year on average, and industries an extra $3,226, according to Yael Gichon of Boulder's environmental affairs office. The tax could raise $860,000 in the first year.\ Gichon and Matt Baker, director of Environment Colorado, a Denver- based environmental group, say that if the measure passes, it will mark the first time a U.S. city has voted in favor of a carbon tax to combat global warming.\ The levy is called a carbon tax because most electricity in the USA is produced by burning coal and natural gas, which emit carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming.\ Climate Smart, a local group that supports the tax, estimates the average monthly residential electric bill of $63 would increase $1.38, or 2.2%. A medium-size office building would rise $33, or 0.6%.\ Boulder, one of the state's most liberal communities, has a long history of environmental activism, such as preserving open space, recycling and encouraging use of public transit. The town of about 92,000 residents is home to the University of Colorado and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""We have probably more climate scientists living in Boulder than any other city in the world,"" Mayor Mark Ruzzin says.\ The City Council authorized the ballot measure to fund a city plan to reduce greenhouse emissions 7% below 1990 levels. To accomplish that, Boulder would have to cut emissions 24% by 2012. About half of the city's emissions are attributed to burning fossil fuels for electricity.\ Four years ago, the city adopted emission targets set by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement the United States has not ratified, to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.\ ""There is a strong environmental ethic in Boulder,"" Ruzzin says. ""People are looking to do the right thing, and the climate action plan gets us down that road.""\ No group has organized in the city to oppose the tax measure, and even the Boulder Chamber of Commerce has endorsed it. Climate Smart expects to spend about $8,000 on yard signs and ""a few newspaper ads,"" volunteer Ken Regelson says.\ Gichon says the tax would fund efforts to increase energy efficiency, spur the use of renewable energy such as wind and solar power, and encourage residents to drive less. The tax also would fund city-sponsored energy audits for residences, and educational programs on utility-sponsored rebates for installing energy- efficient appliances, light fixtures and insulation.\ Many states have mandated special charges on electric bills to fund energy-efficiency and renewable-energy programs. And some city- owned utilities, including Fort Collins, Colo., have raised rates to pay for renewable-energy programs."
67," Global warming's demands on human ingenuity, and pocketbooks, will take center stage Friday in the latest international report on climate change.\ Whether humans bury greenhouse gases, blunt them with new technology or buy them off with tax incentives, banishing the emissions responsible for global warming will take quick action, experts conclude in advance of the report.\ The latest International Panel on Climate Change report, ""Mitigation of Climate Change,"" examines fixes -- or ""mitigation"" in climate lingo -- to global warming, both technological and economic. The report will underline the environmental and financial benefits of quick action to cut emissions, says report co-author John Drexhage of Canada's International Institute for Sustainable Development.\ But fixes also come with costs explored in the report. If governments, for example, impose fees on carbon dioxide emissions, it would raise the price of electricity for businesses and homeowners alike. For that reason, the USA and China, major users of coal, have objected to calls in the panel's draft report for quick action on just such a move, says Tony Kreindler of Environmental Defense, an environmental research and advocacy organization.\ Problematic visions of the future\ In the first of two reports earlier this year, the World Meteorological Organization-sponsored panel, which features thousands of climate scientists reviewing studies, included a best estimate that average surface temperatures will rise roughly 3 to 7 degrees this century. In the second report, the panel concluded that environmental impacts of warming were already apparent in migrating species, earlier springtimes and sea-level rise. The summary warned of a future of increased droughts, floods and species extinctions.\ ""We have three choices: mitigation, adaptation or suffering,"" says Harvard's John Holdren, co-chair of the National Commission on Energy Policy. ""And we are already starting to do a little of each one.""\ A summary of the third and latest report's scientific chapters will be released in Bangkok after review by political representatives of more than 100 nations, including the United States.\ The key debate in Bangkok, Drexhage says, will center on a simple chart. The chart shows ways that fast economic moves worldwide, both in technology and in imposing taxes or fees on emissions, would limit global warming. The key goals are keeping this century's average surface temperature rise roughly below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, he adds. That's the point where many dangerous impacts, such as declining grain yields in Africa and the spread of tropical diseases toward the poles, almost certainly loom.\ The report evaluates mitigation from a number of angles:\ *Technologies ranging from better building design to nuclear power to carbon sequestration, which shunts greenhouse gases from smokestacks into underground rock formations.\ *Future emission ""scenarios,"" ranging from a ""business as usual"" world in which fossil fuel use continues unabated to ones with strict limits on greenhouse gases.\ *Economic estimates from combinations of technologies, policies and scenarios.\ A 'monumental' task\ ""The truth is we are facing a monumental challenge in climate change"" tied to humanity's widespread reliance on fossil fuels for energy, says Vicki Arroyo of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Combined with cement production, which requires heating immense amounts of limestone in a process that releases carbon dioxide, that dependence adds more than 6 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere annually. The next climate report, Arroyo says, ""will make clear there are costs of not acting, and there are costs of acting, to deal with it.""\ Money, not science, becomes the point of debate over climate change with the release of the mitigation report, says report co- author Anthony Patt of Boston University.\ On one side, Patt suggests, some will take the position outlined in February by Newsweek pundit Robert Samuelson that significantly changing emissions ""would be costly, uncertain and no doubt unpopular."" Others will agree with last year's Stern Review, an economic review of global warming's implications headed by the United Kingdom's chief economist, which argued that reducing carbon dioxide emissions would lower economic growth modestly this century, while inaction would trigger global recession by 2050 because of the environmental effects of runaway climate change.\ ""In my view, I think the report will make plain that a lot of avenues exist"" for addressing climate change, Patt says.\ No one technology or policy will address climate change by itself, Holdren says. The energy commission he co-chairs, for example, released an April report calling for charging businesses a steadily rising price per ton on carbon emissions, combined with government incentives and technology developments to lower emissions. ""People are starting to notice climates changing, see it in their real lives,"" he adds. ""It's too late to stop global warming. The real question is whether we can prevent catastrophic (man-made) interference with climate.""\ TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE\ 'Mitigation' glossary\ *Adaptation.

\
PETERSBURG - A push for green renewable energy, the rebuilding of infrastructure and investing in education would be a key factor in job creation, said Dr. Wynne LeGrow, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Congress in the 4th District. ""We need to rebuild the infrastructure and we need to concentrate on wind and solar power,"" LeGrow said in an interview with The Progress-Index on Thursday.
\
LeGrow also said that he supports President Barack Obama's plan to let the Bush tax cuts expire for Americans with an income above $200,000. He blasted his Republican opponent, Congressman J. Randy Forbes, for claiming fiscal conservatism and his refusal to debate before the Nov. 2 election. ""He doesn't have the courage of his convictions, he's afraid to sit down beside me and have me pin him down on all the money he has wasted,"" LeGrow said. ""So he is coming up with these laughable excuses,"" he said.
\
But right now, things aren't looking too promising for LeGrow. A recent poll by The New York Times suggests that 64 percent of Virginians would cast their vote for Forbes if the election was today, while only 33.4 percent would vote for the challenger. The newspaper calculated that LeGrow has a 1 percent chance of unseating Forbes, who has served in Congress since 2001.
\
LeGrow does not allow these poll numbers to discourage him. ""President Obama won this district two years ago,"" he said. ""Last year was not a good year for Democrats [in Virginia], but things are changing. When President Obama was elected, it was the first time since 1964 that a Democrat won the state. If we can get our base out, then we can do it again,"" he said.
\
LeGrow's liberal ideas are in strong contrast to Forbes' staunch conservatism. But fiscally, Forbes' voting record is far from being conservative, LeGrow said. ""Congressman Forbes voted against health care reform but for the medicare prescription drug plan, which cost about $1 trillion over the next ten years, and that was not paid for,"" LeGrow said. ""Many Republicans try to present themselves as fiscal conservatives. Mr. Forbes voted for the war in Iraq, that I never would have voted for, that's another $1 trillion. And the Bush tax breaks - For the first time in our history, people got a tax break at the same time we were going to war,"" he said.
\
""It makes no sense,"" LeGrow continued. ""That was trillions of dollars that went into debt, which Congressman Forbes voted for. And suddenly, he is the fiscal conservative. That's just not the case. I think I'm the fiscal conservative between the two of us, even though on other issues I'm certainly more liberal than he is,"" he said.
\
If enacted, the proposal to let the Bush tax cuts expire for families making more than $250,000 and individuals making more than $200,000 would cause the tax income to increase by $800 billion over the next ten years, LeGrow said. The money could be used to rebuild the infrastructure, like roads, bridges, airports and high speed rail. ""This would create jobs and it would also provide the income that you need,"" he said.
\
LeGrow criticized what he called the Republican denial of global warming. ""One of the main reasons I ran was that I didn't feel that Congress was adequately addressing global climate change,"" he said. ""I'm convinced that that's real and we are causing it by burning fossil fuels.""
\
LeGrow's solution to the problem: ""Converting to green renewable energy sources is something that we need to do,"" he said. ""There is a proposal that power plants produce a certain percentage of their energy by renewable energy sources and gradually increase that percentage over the years. I would certainly be in favor of something like that being initiated.""
\
LeGrow added in the scientific community, global warming is not a point of contention. ""It's real, it's happening,"" he said. ""Generally, people who don't believe it are people who almost go out of their way not to learn about it. It's a matter of educating the public,"" he said.
\
And without education, new jobs created in the green energy field will not be filled, LeGrow said. ""You have to invest in education. If you're going to produce jobs, you have to have educated young people to fill the jobs,"" he said. ""We have to make sure that the young people are educated. It has been shown that the educational level has dropped. We used to be tops in science and math, and now this country is ranked 11 among developed countries. That has to be turned around,"" he said.
\
To address the problem of energy production and independence, Forbes in 2008 proposed a bill he named The New Manhattan Project. The proposed bill included $14 billion in prizes and $10 billion in grants to be awarded to private entities, which completed one of seven tasks related to achieving energy independence.
\
LeGrow considers this plan unrealistic. ""If someone is going to develop a nuclear fusion generator in their garage, Congressman Forbes wants to give him a price,"" LeGrow said. ""But that's not going to happen. It showed me that his understanding of global climate changing and the energy problem is just very superficial. He was going to put some prices up for accomplishing certain things and not do what needs to be done right now, what we have the technology to do.""
\
Instead, LeGrow proposes Cap and Trade or a carbon tax, which would motivate consumers to use less fossil fuel. ""Mr. Forbes' whole approach with that was what he called scientific breakthroughs that would solve the problem,"" LeGrow said. ""We know what to do now, it's just a matter of having the political will to do it. Clearly, he doesn't.""
\
LeGrow also disagrees with Forbes on health care reform. In an interview with The Progress-Index last week, Forbes said that his team had contacted more than 1,000 doctors and nurses in Virginia to ask them about their views on the Democrats' idea of health care reform. Forbes said that all of them opposed the bill.
\
LeGrow, a retired nephrologist, said that Forbes did not give him the chance to participate in his survey. ""I got a notice that there was going to be a telephone conference on a certain day, and that conference was on the day before I got the notice,"" LeGrow said. ""My wife, who is a nurse, got a notice that there was going to be another phone conference on medical issues, and she got the notice a day or two after the conference was held. You're not going to get much negative feedback if you contact anyone who might be against [health care reform] after the meeting,"" he said.
\
LeGrow said that he would have voted for the Democrats health care bill, but added that it doesn't go far enough. ""I have called doctors, trying to raise money, and some of them are in favor for it, some are against it,"" he said. ""But if you bring up the specific things that are done already - you can no longer deny health insurance to children with pre-existing conditions - that's good. Young adults under the age of 26 can stay under their parents insurance. That's good. There is no lifetime limit on health insurance, if you have some chronic problem, you don't reach a point where the insurance company can just cut you off. No doctors that I talked to ever said that there is anything wrong with any of that.""
\
LeGrow said that the doctors' main concern with the bill was the cost. ""Their complaint is that it is too expensive,"" he said. ""But it's paid for. The day the bill passed, it was paid for.""
\
But it wasn't their different opinions on health care reform that has brought this race to the attention of the national media. When LeGrow, a self-proclaimed atheist, criticized Forbes in various web blogs for his push to designate the United States as a Judeo-Christian nation and to let Congress declare religion a prerequisite for freedom and reject ""the notion that the laws and Constitution of the United States require the exclusion of God from matters of government,"" Forbes quickly responded, accusing LeGrow of attacking his religious beliefs.
\
""That's a blatant lie,"" LeGrow said. ""I have never attacked him or anyone else for their religion. I'm in favor of religious freedom, but I'm also in favor of separation of church and state,"" he said. ""I don't care what his or anybody's religion is,"" LeGrow added. ""In this country, if it was run by people like me, religious freedom would be much safer than if it were run by people like Forbes, because the people who came to this country for religious freedom weren't escaping countries that were run by atheists. They were getting away from countries where church and state was combined.""
\
The most recent topic dominating media coverage of the race is Forbes' refusal to face LeGrow in a public debate. ""The reason why he is not going to debate me is that he is afraid to,"" LeGrow said. ""So far, he has come up with at least five reasons why he won't debate me.""
\
And without a debate, it might be difficult for LeGrow to communicate his message to voters - especially in a climate of populism as promoted by the Tea Party. ""It's frustrating,"" LeGrow admits. ""You got the Tea Party out there who thinks that we are paying the highest taxes we've ever paid when in fact taxes are lower than they have been in 60 years,"" he said. ""Some people, no matter how many facts you put before them, they are going to ignore it. They are going to vote the way they want, even if it's hurting them individually.""
\
LeGrow said that he, too, is concerned with the country's $13 trillion debt. ""I agree with [the Tea Party],"" he said. ""The problem is, they have nothing after that, other than being angry.""
\
And just like the Tea Party movement, LeGrow said, the Republican party as a whole has few concrete ideas for fixing the problems the country currently faces. ""Their Pledge to America, that's not a plan that I can see,"" he said. ""What I have seen is some vague generalities with no specifics behind them. It's a superficial plan, but not a real plan. The whole thing is vague, there is no meat there.""

69,"Many controversial issues lend themselves to split-the-difference compromises, but the Keystone XL pipeline isn't one of them. That puts President Obama in a tough spot as his administration nears a decision on the proposed $7 billion project, which would carry tar-sand oil from Canada to Gulf Coast refineries. \For the environmentalists who strongly supported Obama's re-election, Keystone has become a crucial test of his promises to take climate change seriously. Thousands demonstrated in Washington on Sunday against the project, asserting that the pipeline would unlock so much dirty oil that it would be ""game over"" for the globe if the project proceeds. \For Canada, whose government badly wants the pipeline to go forward, the decision is an equally crucial test of the two neighbors' relationship. And for the United States, the project offers a rare opportunity to create jobs and lessen the nation's decades-long dependence on oil from unstable or unfriendly suppliers. \Both sides make strong arguments, but after more than four years of exhaustive study, the right answer on Keystone remains: Build it. \At a time of rising global competition for energy resources, the pipeline would bring reliable new oil supplies to a U.S. that still imports 40% of its crude, 7.6 million barrels a day last year. And 40% of those imports come from OPEC nations such as Venezuela, Iraq and Nigeria. Keystone is expected to supply 830,000 million barrels a day, a key step toward the long-sought goal of North American energy independence, which suddenly seems attainable. \Much of the opposition to Keystone has come from critics who say running a big pipeline through the heart of the USA is too risky. Haven't they noticed that tens of thousands of miles of oil pipelines already crisscross the United States? As long as the nation's quarter-billion vehicles rely almost exclusively on gasoline and diesel, pipelines are the safest and most efficient way to move it. \Obama delayed a final decision on Keystone last year, in part to allow a rerouting around environmentally sensitive areas in Nebraska. That has been accomplished, and Nebraska's governor signed off on the new map last month. \Nor would blocking Keystone keep the tar-sands oil in the ground. In a world starving for oil, it's overwhelmingly likely the oil would find another way to market -- through a pipeline to West Coast ports to carry it to China, to East Coast ports to carry it to other nations, or by barge, rail and existing pipelines into the USA. \The goal of locking down tar-sands oil and stopping other forms of fossil fuel production such as fracking -- as many protesters demanded in Sunday's demonstration -- would be more compelling if the U.S. were ready to shift to renewable fuels such as solar, wind and biomass to power vehicles, heat homes and run factories. Last year, though, renewables supplied just 9.4% of all U.S. energy needs, despite robust tax incentives for wind power and electric cars. Shutting down conventional sources of energy at this point is naive and economically destructive. \Demand might be further reduced by making vehicles and buildings more efficient. A carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system could do the same by making the price of conventional fuels better reflect their cost to the environment. \Until that day, though, the best choice for the economy and the planet is to ensure ample, secure supplies of energy. The Keystone pipeline is an essential part of that strategy."

\
Carol Browner, Clinton's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, gave little hint during a 3 1/2-hour confirmation hearing to changes she would make.
\
But 10 senators with the Environment and Public Works Committee, who outlined their own environmental priorities rather than grill the nominee, made it clear Browner immediately faces an array of divisive issues.
\
Shedding some light on her own dogma, Browner, 37, said: ``The most important thing we can do for the environment is to begin to move our efforts and activities upstream ... (focusing on) pollution prevention.''
\
Senators were especially concerned about impacts and costs of regulations on businesses and communities.
\
On the panel's urgent list: Safe Drinking Water Act's call for better monitoring and upgrades of local water treatment plants; Clean Water Act's $2.5 billion revolving fund to pay for local sewage treatment plants; Superfund overhaul to lower costs and speed cleanup of hazardous waste sites; wetlands protection; and garbage disposal.
\
Browner agreed all the issues were ``very important.'' She would not be cornered on such contentious issues as supporting a carbon tax or banning new waste incinerators.
\
Browner said she aimed to end the agency's ``adversarial relationship'' with business.
\
Senators also urged Browner, Florida Environment secretary lawyer, to cut costs within the $7 billion, 18,000-employee agency.

71,"As Virginia Sen. John Warner tells it, his legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions will help reduce global warming, lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil and create millions of jobs using new technologies.\""We are trying to solve one of the most difficult problems ever facing America,"" the Republican lawmaker said Monday in offering his bill to the Senate.\""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he added. ""Let us do something.""\But to President Bush and many other Republicans, doing nothing is a far better option than passing Warner's sweeping legislation mandating reductions in carbon emissions from factories, refineries, power plants and other businesses.\The Warner bill, they say, would harm the economy, drive jobs overseas, increase taxes and jack up the already soaring price of gasoline.\""It would have a devastating impact on the U.S. economy,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""It is, at its heart, a stealth and giant tax on virtually every aspect of industrial and consumer life.""\That ideological divide will be on prominent display this week, as the Senate debates a measure that Warner hopes will serve as a capstone to his 30-year Senate career.\Alarmed by the threat of global warning, Warner teamed up with Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat-turned-independent, to co-sponsor a complex bill aimed at cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by about 70 percent below current levels over the next four decades.\While rejecting the creation of a carbon tax, the bill would raise a projected $6.7 trillion over 40 years through the sale and trading of allowances of carbon emissions to meet mandated caps. Money raised through the market-oriented ""cap and trade"" system would be used to help consumers pay for higher energy costs and to help businesses develop new ""green"" technologies.\The measure made modest headway Monday when the Senate agreed to proceed with debate by a vote of 74-14. But within hours of the bill reaching the Senate floor, Bush promised to veto the measure if it reaches his desk in its current form.\Sponsors acknowledged they face an uphill battle in trying to push their legislation through the Senate. While most Democrats appear supportive, many Republicans remain opposed. Democrats effectively have 51 seats in the Senate, but 60 votes will likely be required under Senate rules to approve the measure. And Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., is not expected back on Capitol Hill this week as he recovers from brain surgery.\""I feel confident we'll have over 50,"" Lieberman said of the likely vote tally. ""We have a shot at 60, but it's going to be hard.""\Those apparently long odds make Warner's support all the more critical. As a respected, centrist Republican with a maverick streak, Warner could help persuade reluctant Republicans to come on board.\Kicking off what could be the most difficult legislative fight of his career, the retiring senator told reporters at a news conference Monday he was prepared to push for a victory no matter the odds.\""I'm going in with the concept we're going to win,"" Warner said. ""I'm going to keep my shoulder to the wheel until that final vote is taken.""\But if other Republicans are ready to join Warner, they have been slow in coming to his side. When the bill passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this year, Warner was the sole Republican voting for it.\Hoping to address conservatives' unease, Warner stressed a provision of the bill allowing the president to suspend the proposed emissions caps in times of emergency.\Warner and other sponsors also rejected the notion that the bill amounts to a large tax increase. They noted it provides nearly $800 billion over 40 years in tax relief to help consumers pay for higher energy costs.\In the opening hours of debate, senators traded dueling statistics to make their case for and against the bill. Critics, including the White House, said it would raise gasoline prices by $1.40 a gallon by 2050. Supporters said any price increase would be modest, noting prices have already risen by 250 percent since Bush took office in 2001."
72,"It's been less than four months since California committed to getting all of its electricity from climate-friendly sources by 2045. But the idea is already catching on in other states.\At least nine governors taking their oaths of office this month, from Nevada to Michigan to New York, campaigned on 100 percent clean energy, or have endorsed the target since it was enshrined in California law. \The District of Columbia also set a 100 percent clean energy goal last month. So did Xcel Energy, a Minneapolis-based utility that serves 3.6 million electricity customers across eight Western and Midwestern states.\The policy's growing popularity is driven in part by market trends and technological advances that make it easier to envision a future in which fossil fuels are no longer burned for electricity. \But experts say California's passage of Senate Bill 100 is also playing a role.\""Sometimes other states don't want to admit that they're looking to California for leadership. But they really are,"" said Carla Frisch from the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado-based think tank that has worked with cities and states on energy policy.\As the world's fifth-largest economy, California wields enormous power to influence environmental policy nationally and even globally. The state's actions have reshaped how industries do business, changed people's habits and set the agenda for other states and countries. \Automakers have been forced to build fuel-efficient cars for decades because of California's authority to set tailpipe-emission rules stricter than those of the federal government.\The Golden State's aggressive policies can also prompt a backlash. In the four-plus years since California lawmakers voted to ban single-use plastic bags at most stores, nine states have passed laws blocking local governments from enacting such bans.\California's role as a global leader was front of mind of then-state Sen. Kevin de Leon as he crafted the 100 percent climate-friendly energy legislation. The Los Angeles Democrat had previously written a bill raising the state's clean energy target to 50 percent by 2030.\But within a few years, it had become clear the state could meet that goal far sooner than expected, without the massive economic disruption opponents had predicted.\""California has long shown the rest of the nation how to protect the environment while growing the economy,"" De Leon said. ""If California can do it, everyone else can.""\What's unique about 100 percent clean energy, supporters say, is that it's caught on with lawmakers and the public in a way other climate change policies haven't.\Many economists say a market-based tool that puts a price on planet-warming carbon emissions is the cheapest way to fight climate change. But even in places with broad support for climate action, it's been difficult to build support for those types of policies. Voters in Washington state overwhelmingly rejected a carbon tax in 2016 and again in 2018.\Adam Browning, executive director of the Oakland-based advocacy group Vote Solar, cited a common refrain among climate advocates - that the only two problems with a carbon tax are ""carbon"" and ""tax."" Nobody likes taxes, and most people don't have strong feelings about carbon.\A 100 percent clean energy policy, is simple and focused on positive change, Browning said. Supporters can highlight the potential benefits of cleaner air, job creation and cutting-edge technologies.\""It's exciting to be a part of, it speaks to values, it speaks to solutions, and it speaks to things people like. And it has overwhelming bipartisan support,"" Browning said.\The concept didn't originate in California. Hawaii became the first state to pass a 100 percent clean energy mandate in 2015, and U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, introduced federal legislation to that effect in 2017. More than 100 cities have endorsed the concept, according to the Sierra Club, as have 150 major corporations that are part of the RE100 coalition.\But in the months since California passed its clean energy mandate, the idea has gained significant political momentum.\Voters in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin elected new governors in November who signed a pledge from the League of Conservation Voters to support 100 percent clean energy by 2050. In several states, the new governors mark a dramatic shift from their predecessors.\David Bookbinder, chief counsel for the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C., described the groundswell of support for 100 percent clean energy policies as a ""political trend"" first and foremost.\""These are all governors who are Democrats, and they're all trying to be progressive. And saying '100 percent renewables' is money in the bank as far as their base is concerned,"" Bookbinder said.\The Niskanen Center encourages politicians to support a carbon tax as an economically efficient way to reduce emissions. \Still, Bookbinder described the expanding support for 100 percent clean energy as a positive development in the fight against climate change. It shows that the public is beginning to take the problem seriously, he said, and that lawmakers see ""political mileage"" in committing to ambitious climate action.\For many of the newly elected governors, it's unclear exactly what flavor of ""100 percent clean energy"" they'll ultimately seek.\At the same time, goal-setting is the easy part. When it comes to eliminating fossil fuels from electricity, the devil will be in the details - and other states will be looking to California to see if it's really possible.\The biggest issue California needs to work out: how to move beyond natural gas, the state's largest source of electricity.\Some ideas are already being put into practice, such as batteries that store solar power for nighttime use, geothermal plants that generate clean energy around the clock and time-varying electricity rates that encourage people to use energy at different times of day. \But it's not yet clear how those policies and technologies will fit together, or how quickly California can radically reduce its use of gas.\Credit: By Sammy Roth - Los Angeles Times\Caption: What's unique about 100 percent clean energy, supporters say, is it's caught on in a way other climate policies haven't.\Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times"
73," The Environmental Protection Agency has announced plans that could encourage the storage of carbon dioxide emissions deep underground, an emerging ""clean"" energy technique that energy experts say will help reduce the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.\ Capturing carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants before it's emitted and then injecting it thousands of feet into the ground is becoming an increasingly viable option, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study released in March.\ The study said storing emissions underground would be ""the critical enabling technology"" to achieve the conflicting goals of curbing greenhouse gases and meeting energy needs. ""Absent a technological breakthrough that we do not foresee, coal, in significant quantities, will remain indispensable"" in power production.\ Coal-fired power plants, the source of almost half the nation's electricity, emitted about one-third of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 2005, according to the Department of Energy.\ If the regulation EPA will propose settles issues such as preventing leaks and monitoring storage sites, it might remove one obstacle to the commercialization of underground carbon dioxide storage.\ ""The private sector needs certainty when making investments,"" says EPA associate deputy administrator Jason Burnett. The Energy Department is also investing: It announced last week it will spend $197 million over 10 years for underground carbon sequestration.\ The department estimates that North America can hold about 3.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide beneath the Earth's surface, theoretically enough to store U.S. emissions for centuries.\ ""Oil and gas have been trapped forever, so you know that the zones that it came from have the ability to hold the gas,"" says Mark Stewart, a geologist at the University of South Florida. ""What's holding everything back is a very uncertain regulatory environment."" The EPA expects to propose the rules next summer.\ Storing carbon dioxide underground is the last step in a process that could prevent more than 90% of a given power plant's emissions from reaching the atmosphere.\ The technology for removing the carbon dioxide before it's emitted has existed for decades. For example, the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in North Dakota captures its carbon dioxide, then sells it and pipes the gas to oil companies in Canada. Those firms inject the gas thousands of feet underground, which pushes remaining pockets of oil toward the fields' surface.\ Also needed, says Rich Furman, an independent energy technology consultant, is a carbon tax or a cap and trade program to make it costly to emit carbon dioxide. Only then, he says, will utilities and other industries store carbon dioxide on a scale large enough to substantially reduce global emissions.\ ""Right now, since there are no regulations requiring removal of CO2, it's only being done where they can make a profit by reselling it,"" he says."

A QUICK READ ON THE TOP MONEY NEWS OF THE DAY
\
JAPAN'S TRADE SURPLUS: Japan announced a record trade surplus Tuesday, to meet to discuss the trade imbalance. Japan's surplus surged to $111.3 billion the year ended March 31, vs. $88.2 billion the year before. Japan's surplus with the United States grew to $46.1 billion, vs. $38.5 billion. Exports rose 7.4% to $344.4 billion, and imports rose 0.3% to $233.1 billion. Economists say the news would give Clinton ammunition. They expect Clinton to make it clear that he wants to see specific industries - including auto parts, supercomputers and financial services - make measurable progress selling in Japan.
\
RJR'S NEW DEAL: RJR Nabisco changed its plan for letting investors buy into its food lines without owning tobacco operations. Reason for the change: concern about the effect of a cigarette-price war. RJR still will sell 93 million shares of its food stock, called RN-Nabisco. But it won't issue more Nabisco stock to RJR shareholders. Also, it had planned to pay a dividend on the stock of its tobacco business, renamed RN-Reynolds. Now, RJR says it will delay the proposed dividend on Reynolds stock ""until there is a clear assessment of the domestic tobacco environment."" Also new: Each RJR share will become one Reynolds share. Before, each RJR share would have become one-third Reynolds share.
\
BETTER MILEAGE: U.S. autos could become gasoline sippers with parts available now, says a report by the Sierra Club, the Center for Auto Safety and the Public Interest Research Groups. Example: A Ford Taurus could be modified for $1,100 to get more than 42 mpg, increasing mileage 55%. Modifications: smaller engine, lightweight materials for fenders and body panels, a five-speed transmission. Safety wouldn't be compromised, the report says.
\
OPEC AVOIDS CONFLICT: OPEC ministers and delegates from other oil-producing states shied from confrontation with the West when they met Tuesday to decry plans for a carbon tax on petroleum. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to examine the likely impact of new energy taxes. Speakers said proposed taxes aren't intended to help prevent global warming so much as to fill Western governments' budget needs. Delegates said oil prices are too low.
\
CHINA'S SPENDING SPREE: China agreed to buy $160 million worth of cars and trucks from the Big Three U.S. automakers. It was China's second splurge on U.S. vehicles in nine months. In July, Chrysler got the lion's share of a $149 million agreement. The latest deal: 3,600 Chevrolet Corsica sedans and 1,000 Chevrolet Lumina APV minivans, more than 1,000 '93 minivans and 3,600 Plymouth Sundances and 5,200 Ford Tempos.
\
TREASURY AUCTION: Yields on seven-year Treasury notes fell in Tuesday's auction to 5.54% from 6.41%, the lowest level at auction since the government began issuing them regularly in 1978. Previous low: 6.01%, Oct. 7. The government got bids totaling $18.8 billion, and $9.76 billion in notes were sold.

75,"In March 2010, the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers issued a standard but stern warning about Solyndra, a California solar panel manufacturer: The company wasn't making money and never had, which raised ""substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."" Yet when President Obama visited Solyndra's plant in Fremont two months later, he gave a rousing pep talk and declared that ""the future is here."" \Alas, it wasn't. \Solyndra continued to struggle, canceled a planned public stock offering and filed for bankruptcy this month -- leaving the U.S. government as its biggest creditor and raising new questions about whether Uncle Sam should be playing venture capitalist. \Despite initial misgivings about the company's viability, an Energy Department program aimed at boosting ""clean energy"" projects had guaranteed a $535 million loan to Solyndra, which produced an innovative but expensive solar panel. Taxpayers are now on the hook for some or most of that money, depending on whether someone buys the assets. \Whether Solyndra is just an expensive embarrassment, or a full-fledged scandal, remains to be seen. Shortly after the bankruptcy filing, the FBI raided Solyndra's headquarters and the homes of its executives in connection with the loan. And today, a House oversight panel holds a hearing to probe how the company -- whose board and investors included some major campaign donors to Democrats and Obama -- got the money, and whether the administration properly vetted the application. \Even if Solyndra's collapse is nothing more than good intentions gone awry -- a big if -- it is a cautionary tale about why government should be extremely wary about betting tax dollars on specific companies. If there's one thing the marketplace virtually always does better than government, it's picking individual successes in an uncertain and highly competitive business. In fact, government involvement can unfairly tilt the playing field toward one company and away from competitors. \What the government can do is create an environment that makes it possible for the best companies to emerge and thrive. Government can fund basic research that is too expensive and too uncertain for struggling companies. It alone can set clear rules, provide a productive tax environment and fiercely defend American companies from unfair foreign competition. One reason for Solyndra's demise was a huge drop in solar panel prices that might have been caused by China's heavily subsidized solar panel manufacturers dumping below-cost panels on the world market. \You can bet you'll hear a lot more about Solyndra as the campaign season intensifies, and rightly so. This is a stain on Obama's stimulus program. At the same time, context is important. The Obama administration inherited the Solyndra application from the Bush Energy Department, and Solyndra is one of 42 projects in the Energy Department's $30 billion portfolio of clean energy loan guarantees. The department says none of those other projects is in trouble; we'll see. \Moving the nation away from its reliance on oil and coal would unquestionably have huge benefits for the environment and for national security. The most efficient way to attain that goal -- raising the price of fossil fuels to reflect their real cost via a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade plan -- isn't going anywhere in the current political environment. That leaves a variety of next-best options worth pursuing, but trying to pick winners among individual start-up companies ought to be at the bottom of the list."

\Bipartisan, workable climate solutions exist, and they do not include creating new carbon taxes. Free-market innovation -- not government regulation or taxation -- is the best way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\People are globally rejecting carbon taxes as the answer to lowering emissions. French citizens took to the streets to protest an energy tax aimed at carbon. In America, voters in Washington state voted down a ballot measure to create a tax on emissions.\The reasons for this rejection are clear. Energy providers pass the cost of taxes on to consumers in the form of spiking electric bills and fuel prices. American families will see an increase in their energy costs without a return on that investment.\Some in Washington have suggested that Americans could receive dividend checks from collected carbon taxes -- an idea that's wishful thinking at best. Just as far-fetched is the idea that establishing a carbon tax would roll back regulations. Any new carbon tax would add red tape, not reduce it.\Those of us interested in real solutions are looking to free-market innovation to reduce emissions.\Clean and constant nuclear power emits zero carbon dioxide. We should expand America's nuclear energy production and continue to support innovators building advanced reactors.\Just as critical is the development of technologies to capture carbon and use it to produce commercial products such as building materials.\The private sector is already doing its part. Recently, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos each dedicated part of their personal fortunes to research carbon-reduction technologies that can be deployed across the globe.\In 2019, America led the world in reducing energy-related carbon emissions. Promising research and a growing natural gas market will reduce emissions even further.\Punishing carbon taxes and the regulations that would accompany them are not the answer to reducing America's carbon emissions. Bipartisan agreement can be found by looking to innovation.\Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., is chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\"

78,"PITTSBURGH -- Many executives would find it hard to be cheery as they enter a new year marked by a wobbly economy, uncertain political trends and new technologies that pose profound challenges to old business models. \Yet General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt seems buoyant. \He says GE revenue will grow as much as 15% next year. And he bases his confidence, at least in part, on some of his initiatives since he replaced his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch, just days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \Immelt, 51, has pushed the company to expand in growth markets overseas. He also has made GE a leader in manufacturing a new generation of environmentally friendly technologies. \Many investors remain skeptical. The stock has underperformed the market during Immelt's tenure and is flat in 2007. \Investors seem to find it hard to make sense of a company poised to end this year generating about $172 billion in revenue from interests that span jet engines, energy production, commercial and consumer finance, health care equipment, home appliances and entertainment. \Further complicating matters have been a huge write-down in 2007 from a lending subsidiary dealing in subprime mortgages and a strike by TV and movie script writers that could lead to dramatic changes for NBC Universal. \Immelt discussed his company's challenges and opportunities with USA TODAY's David Lieberman at the seventh USA TODAY CEO Forum, in conjunction with the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. \The interview took place in front of an audience. These are edited transcripts. \QYou've spoken to Wall Street analysts. Next month, GE has its annual retreat in Boca Raton, Fla., for executives. What's your message? \A: We have always positioned the company to be a safe and reliable growth company. So if you think about what's going in the world, there's really kind of three big themes. \One is that the U.S. housing market is in retreat and the U.S. consumer is under real stress because of that. \Theme No. 2 is that global growth has never been healthier. I've never seen a time in my career where the global economy is less related to the U.S. economy than it is today, which is, I think, a good thing, not a bad thing. \And then the third thing is that there is a whole series of what I would call synthetic debt vehicles that just didn't work. Collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles. They're ugly when they end. \So what we try to tell investors is that this is a company that can still grow earnings 10% and still generate high returns because of the diversity of what we have, because of the strength of our businesses and the quality of the risk management we have as a company. \In 2007, for the first time in the history of GE, we'll have more revenue outside the United States than we'll have inside the United States. Our business outside the United States will grow between 15% and 20% next year. We're a $172 billion company. In 2008, with the U.S. economy growing at 1.5%, we'll grow revenue by 15% because we're in the right places with the right products at the right time. \Q: Domestically, you're not projecting a recession? \A: CEOs are lousy economists. I take what the world thinks. The world basically pegs the U.S. GNP (growth) next year at somewhere between 1.5% and 2.5%. Basically, the U.S. is in full employment. Interest rates are coming down rapidly. \There doesn't have to be a recession in the U.S. if everybody keeps their wits and if the Fed does what it can do and things like that. I just think there will be a real slowdown because (of) housing. In 50 years, the median house in the United States has never declined. It will decline in '07, it will probably decline in '08 and might decline in '09. \On China \QYou want to expand into China. Does it help GE to have the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing on NBC? \A: The Olympics are just a fantastic global brand. For those 17 nights, you really captivate the world. And if you're a global company like ours, you get a natural positive spin by being a part of the Olympics. It helps the totality of the company. \We also signed up in 2003 to be an Olympic sponsor. So at the Beijing Olympics, we'll do about $600 million of other GE business -- health care, electrical equipment, things like that. \One of the things we were able to negotiate with the Olympic committee is that all of the events are going to be televised live, which probably means that the swimming that you're going to watch at maybe 10 o'clock at night is actually going to be 9 o'clock in the morning in Beijing. The athletes weren't so thrilled about it, but we think it's going to be great viewing for most Americans. \Q: You've hung your hat on the environment, but China doesn't seem to care. \A: Young Chinese want money. They want clothes. They want freedom. They want to have access to the Internet. They want everything you want. And they don't want to live in squalor. \Their point of view is that at the time in which this country had great economic expansion, we could have cared less about the environment. We used coal. We did whatever it took to grow this economy. \But I'm a firm believer that the environment in China and India has to be cleaned up, will be cleaned up, mainly because the population won't tolerate it any other way. And companies like GE will be big benefactors of those investments. \Q: Can you put pressure on them? \A: The basic answer is, no. We have a lot of influence. We may have as much influence as any other company. But, in the end, we're not political beings. We meet with the government and politicians (and) we very strongly endorse and suggest that they should be working hard on their environment and environmental policy. And we're trying to sell them stuff to help them do it, whether it's coal gasification, whether it's wind energy, whether it's water desalination, to be an active participant in it. \Q: Human rights activists also say you should put pressure on China to resolve the conflict in Darfur. \A: We've been a big contributor to a lot of the relief efforts in Darfur and throughout Africa and will continue to do so. But, basically, I'm not a politician. It would be not accurate to assume that I carry political clout when we go around the world. \The decision that every company has to make in China is: Are you going to be in or are you going to be out? \So you can sit on the sidelines. We can talk about how terrible everything is, how awful everything is, how backwards it is and how we wish they did this, that and the other thing as a sideline character. Or we get in the battle. We build factories, we try to establish political ties, economic ties. And I think if we don't do that progressively as a company, we're going to move backwards -- as a company and as a country. \So, do I agree with everything, do I like everything? No. But, you know, that's probably true of my mother-in-law as well. Right? But I love her. In the end, you have to say, I'm either in or I'm out. And if you're in, you've got to be in all the way. And if you're not in, you say goodbye to that chapter in history. \On health care \QYou're a major manufacturer of health care equipment as well as a major employer. What do you think of the health care system here? \A: Health care is about 14% of GNP (gross national product). It's growing roughly 10% a year. If you look at the bow wave of demographics that are coming in terms of how long people are going to live and how long people that are living are going to be on the government dole, if you will, it's a big challenge. \We've got to do something about health insurance. It adds cost. \We have to do something about the transparency of quality measures and have reimbursement follow quality in terms of outcomes. \We have to do something about getting information technology broadly into the system. \We've got to do something that modernizes the Food and Drug Administration and (help) new technology get to market faster, but have a way to measure its efficacy. \(However,) health care is one of the few export industries we have. We shouldn't dismember this important industry just because we get demagogued and things like that. \On TV \Q How long do you think \the TV and screenwriters \strike is going \to last? \A: The strike has been going on for six weeks. And \(talks have) broken apart again. This is about something \important, which is fundamentally how the \digital revenue streams get sorted out between \video content companies like NBC Universal and the \writers and directors. \My hope is it doesn't last too much longer, but I \think the differences are profound and, to a certain \extent, they're worth taking a strong stand on. \Q: If it does last, will you lose money, \or will you come out OK because your \programming costs will go down? \A: What I would say is, prepare yourself \for lots of reality TV. So, yeah, I'd like to put \in a plug right now for maybe five nights a \week of Deal or No Deal. \I hope the strike gets settled amicably, \but I think everybody in the classic analog \network (TV) business has to rethink the \business model. You can't be in businesses \where the revenues go down and the costs \go up. \If you go back and take a classic TV show \like The West Wing, that might be a $1 billion franchise. \If you paid a billion dollars (for the show), you \could sell advertising on air and sell it back into \syndication for $2 billion. \If Heroes turns out to be as successful as West \Wing, which I think it could be, we will have to have \sold it 25 times. We will have to have sold it online, \globally, (with conventional TV) advertising, in your \Christmas stocking. \Q How do you compete with someone who feels like he's on a mission from God? For example, Rupert Murdoch paid $5 billion for Dow Jones, which owns The Wall Street Journal, and will use it to help launch his Fox Business Network. You had the same opportunity to protect CNBC. \A: If there's anybody you should admire in the business world, it's Rupert Murdoch. I'm a rabid competitor of Rupert. I want to beat him so badly I can't even describe it. \But when I shave in the morning, I'm worried about investors. When he shaves in the morning, he says, ""Hello, Investor. How are you doing today?"" \So you've got to have some disciplines that maybe he doesn't always have. \When I looked at Dow Jones, there wasn't one person in the entirety of GE that knew a gosh darn thing about running a newspaper. Not a one. So we're not going to pay $5 billion for The Wall Street Journal when we have no domain, no expertise, just because he is. No, thank you. \Now, when it comes to CNBC competing against Fox Business Network, we're going to try to crush them. In other words, we won't spare any expense. We won't try to do anything other than totally beat them. I've got as many tools as Rupert does, and maybe then some. \On leadership... \QWhat skills do people need to be leaders 10 and 20 years from now, especially in international business? \A: It's curiosity. It's being good with people. And it's having perseverance, hard work, thick skin. Those are three traits that every successful person that I've ever known has in common. \Most of what I learned when I was young was how to be a general manager. But successful leaders in the next 10 or 20 or 30 years will have to be real experts. They're going to have to know how to pick products. They're going to have to know how to pick countries. \What you should be learning is how to develop your own touch and feel for customers, technology, innovation, globalization -- things like that. ... And we're really in a what-and-where generation, not so much a who-and-how generation today. \Q: Generation Y has a different view of work. Does your management program need change? \A: Generation Y -- whatever they call it -- I've never seen people smarter, more curious, more worldly. I am so optimistic about the talent that I see. \The other thing I would tell Generation Y is that there's Generation A in India. And they want what you have. They want quality of living. They want a second car. They want a vacation home. \So either with you or with them, I'm going to build a future for GE. \Q: Does GE have a program to develop leaders internationally? \A: Our leadership programs are really global programs. If you walked into a GE factory in China, you could eat off the floor. It would have Six Sigma (quality improvement methodology). It would have managers that talk statistical process control, engineering control. So everything we do in one place, we do everyplace else. That is important, No.1. \No.2, the GE Foundation. We give about $100 million or maybe more to secondary education globally, mainly U.S., though. And this is to get more kids in high school to study math and science. Every successful country that I've ever seen -- if you said, ""What do they have in common?"" -- they graduate a lot of engineers. Or they have a lot of oil. \The biggest educational issue that we've got in this country: not enough people who are really strong in math and science, not enough kids who want to become engineers. And we've got to solve that. \...and leading GE \QYou can't be an expert in everything. Do you have a sniff test to be sure that you're getting good information? \A: I have things I watch. I watch rail loadings in the United States. I watch trailer rentals. I watch consumer delinquency. I get these things every day. So I have probably a dozen statistics that I have found, over time, are leading indicators of what's going on. \I'm on the board of the New York Fed, which I joined three years ago, so even though I didn't get A's in economics, I rub shoulders with people who got A's in economics at least once a month. And I kind of stir it all up in terms of how it feels and talk to the board -- and that's how I make decisions. \The only way to run a company like GE, with our size and mass and everything, is: Bad news has to travel as fast as good news. You have to have a management team and a culture where people are trained to give you bad news on losses, bad news on what's going on in markets. \Q: A company as big as yours suffers from the law of large numbers. You have to grow much more than a smaller company for the results to be meaningful. Is there any logic in splitting up the company? \A: In the last five years, we've sold 40% of our revenue. So we're a company that always has refreshed itself. We should always be very tough-minded about what fits and what doesn't fit. \But we try to position ourselves in big themes where size is an advantage. \The first one is infrastructure and infrastructure technology. This is energy, water, oil and gas, things like that. That's a $70 billion business that will grow 15% a year for the next five years. That's a business where small people need not apply. \Emerging markets -- $32 billion of our company's in emerging markets. This is China, India, Turkey, Eastern Europe, Russia, Latin America. That's going to pull the whole company along. \Our incremental growth next year will be $20 billion. So we're growing the company each year bigger than Nike, bigger than a lot of companies, but we can only do that if you make size an advantage and not let it be a disadvantage. \On politics \QYou said you're not a political person. Does that mean you're not going to make any contributions in the upcoming presidential campaign? \A: My main political party is GE. The company has always stayed pretty bipartisan. Will there be contributions? Sure. But I would say they'll be equal as time goes on. \Q: So you haven't picked any particular candidate at this point? \A: No. And I won't. I'm a CEO of a public company. You know in many ways the only reason why people know me is because I run a big company. And I don't ever want to confuse that with me taking a public position on stuff that fundamentally doesn't help GE investors. And so I just think that's the right position to have if you're running a public company. \On subprime troubles \QYou had a tough experience this year with the subprime mortgage market. \A: In about 2003, we bought a subprime originator called WMC in California. We ran it for probably two or three years. We paid, I don't know, $400 million, something like that, for it. We tracked it very hard. In the latter part of 2006, the market began to change. At the end of the first quarter of 2007, we basically made the decision to exit the business. And we probably wrote off $800 million, something like that, as we exited the business. \(Buying WMC) was a bad business decision, you know. It was the wrong business at the wrong time. It's not the first time we've done it. It won't be the last time we've done it. But that's kind of been the history. \Q: What lesson did you learn? \A: There are two lessons. One is the fundamental business decision that you could underwrite for somebody else to hold an asset, in the end, just was flawed. All of the other businesses we're in we hold ourselves. In other words, we underwrite for our own standards. The other one was: When you find something that doesn't work, exit immediately. And that's what we did here. \Look, if you run a big company, you're going to make mistakes. We bought Kidder Peabody in the \80s, sold it in the '90s. We got stuck on auto loans in the late '90s. We had a private-equity book in the late '90s. \At GE, we tolerate failure, but we don't tolerate a lack of learning. So, basically, we only let you make the same mistake once. That's the only way you can learn, I think, in a successful company of any kind. \On going green \QYou're one of the first big companies to take a bold stand to go green. Was that mostly a moral decision or a business decision? \A: I'd say it's more a business decision. We were doing business reviews in 2003-2004. And when I spoke to our energy business, our rail business, our appliance business, really a bunch of different businesses, they were all working on fuel efficiency, conservation and greenhouse gas emission reduction. \Our team got together and said, ""This is going to be a big theme."" So we launched, in 2005, what we call Ecomagination. We committed to having a certain level of customer engagement. We committed to hard revenue numbers. And we committed to reducing our own carbon footprint by 1% a year. \The world's kind of come our way. Society has just changed its mind about the environment in the U.S. and around the world. I learned a long time ago that when society changes its mind, business better get on board, get ahead of it or you'll get crushed by it. \But if this was only about reputation, I wouldn't have done it. My name's not above the door. It's GE. I work for investors. Our reputation first and foremost comes from being a great-executing, high-performance company. \Q: Al Gore wants to replace payroll taxes with a carbon tax (a tax on greenhouse gas emissions). \A: I'm a member of a group called the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, and our position really is about a cap-and-trade system (a cap on emissions and an exchange where companies could buy and sell allowances to produce them). At the end of the day, I think there should be a real dialogue between tax and cap-and-trade and things like that. \I think that there should be a market for carbon. That can be delivered with a cap-and-trade. It also can be delivered with a tax. \If you look at the most profitable energy asset in U.S. history, it's nuclear power plants. They're all 30 years old, and they're fully depreciated. \But if you're a utility CEO and you have to make a decision to invest in nuclear power, it's a hard decision. It's a $3 billion project. If you're 58, it's going to come online by the time you're long retired. \With no price for carbon, why would anybody take that kind of risk? That's why these market signals are so gosh darn important. \--- \About GE chief Jeffrey Immelt \Born: Cincinnati \Education: Dartmouth College, B.A. in applied mathematics; Harvard MBA. \Early job: At Duncan Hines, marketing Moist & Easy Brownie Mix with Steve Balmer, now CEO of Microsoft.

80,"Since Republicans took control of the Senate in January, their actions on climate change have ranged from oblivious to laughable to reckless. Here's a first-quarter recap: \Jan. 21: During a debate on the Keystone XL pipeline, the Senate voted on an amendment stating that the climate is changing and that humans are significantly responsible. Forty-nine Republicans opposed the amendment; only five -- Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois -- voted in favor. In other words, more than 90% of the Republican caucus rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus. So much for the ""sense"" of the Senate. \Feb. 26: Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of -- yes -- the Environment and Public Works Committee, carried a lumpy snowball on to the Senate floor. Inhofe, author of The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future, apparently regarded the presence of snow in Washington in February as evidence that the globe isn't warming. ""Do you know what this is?"" he asked. ""It's a snowball just from outside here. So it's very, very cold out. Very unseasonable."" Never mind that 2014 was the hottest year worldwide since modern record-keeping began, and the eastern U.S. has been an island of cool in a sea of global warmth. \March 3: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urged states to defy the Obama administration's flexible plan to curb carbon pollution from existing power plants, the nation's leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Hold back on the costly process of complying,"" he advised in an op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader. McConnell, playing to his state's large coal industry, followed up with a detailed letter to every governor. The Senate leader howls when he thinks the Obama administration is going beyond the law, as in changing immigration regulations unilaterally, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with heedlessly counseling states to break the rules. \In contrast to the Senate GOP's embarrassing, head-in-the-sand approach to climate change, other prominent Republicans -- hardly environmental extremists but less attached to the fossil-fuel lobby -- are promoting useful ideas that could help the U.S. achieve the 26%-28% emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2025 that the Obama administration pledged Tuesday. \Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary in the George W. Bush administration, calls global warming ""a crisis we can't afford to ignore,"" and his institute is funding research and advocating for faster action. \George Shultz, secretary of State during the Reagan administration and a pillar of the GOP establishment, is calling for ""significant and sustained support"" for energy research and development. Like Paulson, Shultz backs a revenue-neutral carbon tax that would level the playing field and prevent the atmosphere from being used as a free waste dump. \This plan would put the U.S. on a path toward lower emissions and provide American leadership going into this year's global climate talks. And what is the likelihood that this Senate will approve such a sensible, market-based policy? \Call it a snowball's chance."
81,"The Governor's Commission on Climate Change finished its yearlong deliberations Thursday by adopting a more aggressive plan for fighting global warming than Gov. Timothy M. Kaine had suggested when he set up the panel last year.\Kaine had asked the commission to find ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions - mostly carbon dioxide from cars, power plants, factories, landfills, buildings and homes - by 30 percent of the projected levels in 2025.\But the commission voted during its last work session Thursday to go further and faster. It recommended that Virginia shoot for reductions of 25 percent below 1990 emission levels by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.\The goals mirror what President-elect Barack Obama has endorsed for a federal program to combat global warming and follow closely what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has embraced.\""Basically what we said was, 'This is a good start but we need to cut further, we need to do more,' "" said Skip Stiles, a Norfolk environmentalist and one of 30 members of the governor's climate commission.\Environmentalists pushed for tougher measures Thursday, urging support for a national carbon tax and adoption of California tailpipe emission standards for cars and trucks. Both items were defeated.\The commission came within one vote of passing a policy statement that called for no new coal-fired power plants in Virginia until carbon-capturing technology is available to offset expected air pollution. Such technology is not expected to be ready until at least 2020.\Had the policy passed, it could have blocked the construction of the Virginia City power plant in southwestern Virginia, a major project sponsored by Dominion Virginia Power and protested by environmentalists.\Commission Chairman L. Preston Bryant, the governor's secretary of natural resources, cast the deciding vote to kill the policy statement.\The climate commission consists of government officials, politicians, environmentalists, industry executives, utility leaders, coal and natural gas experts, academics and scientists. It has been meeting monthly this year to study global warming in Virginia and what actions should be taken to protect the environment without ravaging an already battered economy.\Throughout the year, the group found that Virginia emits about 175 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, more than Greece, Pakistan and other nations. That number rose by 34 percent between 1990 to 2004.\Virginia ranks near the bottom of the 50 states for energy conservation, according to scientific studies.\The commission also found that sea-level rise related to Earth's gradual warming is putting coastal Virginia - and Hampton Roads, in particular - at great future risk of flooding, storm surge and erosion.\In the end, the commission embraced more than 100 recommendations, touching on areas such as mining, home heating, auto insurance and garbage recycling.\The package will be compiled next month into a narrative report and delivered to the governor by Dec. 15.\To enact recommendations, Kaine can seek to pass legislation and funding in the 2009 General Assembly, issue executive orders or recommend new regulations through state agencies, said Bryant, the commission chairman."

THE EDITORIAL PAGE; LETTERS
\
I was profoundly disappointed with your abuse of the English language in your attempt to gain support for an editorial opinion (""Cooling it on global warming,"" Debate, Our View, Friday).
\
To describe a 5-year difference in global temperature of seven one-hundredths of a degree as ""torrid"" is just plain dishonest.
\
While I can appreciate creative writing as well as the next guy, if everyone were to adopt that type of poetic license, it wouldn't be too long before we'd find ourselves describing the president and Congress as ""remarkably effective."" Jim Morales Hales Corners, Wis.
\
Time to be proactive
\
The essence of the argument put forth in your editorial ""Cooling it on warming"" was right on target. I must, however, take issue with your statement that ""other than scale, global warming is not much different from ozone depletion."" True, the Montreal Protocol, which led to the initial efforts to reduce ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, showed that nations can work together for a common environmental cause. It must be kept in mind, though, that the cause was a depletion of the ozone layer with globally uniform consequences - not global warming with globally diverse consequences.
\
Still, we must take this opportunity to make a commitment, to be proactive instead of reactive for a change. We have a chance to finally cease ignoring the fact that we can and do irreparably alter our environment through our excesses and lack of vision. It is imperative that we at last display a modicum of courage and respond to the multiple warnings and the sound, but admittedly not perfect, scientific predictions that say we're on the brink of warming our climate at a speed unknown in natural history. Harold W. Bernard Jr. Author, Global Warming Unchecked Langley, Va.
\
Need prudent choices
\
There are many things that can be done to reduce global warming gas emissions that do not cost much and serve to reduce other pollution sources as well. These include expanded efforts to use energy more efficiently and a greater reliance on non-fossil sources such as nuclear, wood and wind. The use of nuclear power, for example, has been the source of the largest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in the electrical sector.
\
The bottom line is that we can make prudent choices that both reduce emissions while making economic sense and be winners regardless of whether climate change is ultimately found to be a real threat. Dr. Theodore M. Besmann Research group leader Oak Ridge Natl. Laboratory Oak Ridge, Tenn.
\
Carbon tax benefits
\
Your editorial comes close to hitting the mark; the global warming problem is really one of carbon dioxide build-up in the atmosphere. Perhaps it is time to begin cutting back on the use of fossil fuels.
\
However, your proposed solution in the United States - developing alternative energy sources to stimulate less consumption of fossil fuels - could be taken one step further.
\
I believe a tax should be levied on all fossil fuels, coal and gas as well as oil (whether imported or domestic), in recognition of the need to seriously begin the process of reducing our dependence on them. It might be called a ""greenhouse tax"" based on the pounds of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of energy produced, and be used to fund research and development of energy sources such as solar and other renewables, hydrogen-fueled and electric cars, and electricity from advanced nuclear power plants.
\
I hope the administration and Congress will recognize that an obligation of leadership is to lead, not follow, public opinion and move to resolve the problem of continued accumulation of greenhouse gases.
\
In this arena, the United States must set an example if we are to achieve the international cooperation needed to resolve what may well be the ultimate ""environmental crisis."" Daniel B. Bullen Associate professor Iowa State University Department of Mechanical Engineering Ames, Iowa

83,"VIRGINIA BEACH - Gov. Ralph Northam is pushing hard for clean energy, clean water, a clean Chesapeake Bay and environmental justice with $733 million in new spending contained in his proposed budget package.\The governor announced the partial plan Wednesday at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Brock Environmental Center ahead of unveiling his full spending package next week.\It includes not only big investments in bay cleanup, clean energy infrastructure, offshore wind energy, land conservation and community outreach, but also paves the way for Virginia to join a regional partnership to reduce carbon emissions - a move that Republicans in Richmond blocked earlier this year.\Northam said in a statement that his plan proves that ""a clean environment and a strong economy go hand-in-hand.""\""These significant investments in environmental protection, environmental justice, clean energy and clean water will combat climate change and ensure we maintain our high quality of life here in Virginia,"" Northam said.\CBF President William C. Baker called the plan ""great news for everyone who cares about clean water.""\It also earned plaudits from the James River Association, The Nature Conservancy and the Chesapeake Conservancy.\The budget proposal includes:\*$400 million for bay cleanup by helping localities reduce stormwater pollution and upgrade wastewater treatment plants, increased oyster reef restoration and more aid to farmers to curb nutrient runoff. These investments are expected to put Virginia on track to meet its 2025 deadline for bay restoration.\Zack Greenberg of The Pew Charitable Trusts said in a statement that the $10 million Northam earmarked for reef work would keep Virginia a ""national leader in large-scale oyster restoration.""\*$40 million to upgrade the Portsmouth Marine Terminal to lure new investments in the offshore wind energy supply chain. The plan would also create the state's first Office of Offshore Wind, tasked with coordinating with local, state and federal agencies to secure supply chain and industry jobs.\Secretary of Commerce and Trade Brian Ball said in a statement that the proposed investments ""will create new business opportunities, expand customer access to renewable energy and spark high-demand jobs of the 21st century.""\*$171 million to conserve natural lands and improve state parks.\*$25 million to the state Department of Environmental Quality for efficiencies in permitting, greater public engagement and environmental protections. Some $2.7 million is earmarked for environmental justice and community outreach.\*$10 million for a new Clean Energy Revolving Loan Fund to help governments, small businesses and low-income residents pay for clean energy infrastructure.\Finally, Northam struck a budget provision that the Republican-led General Assembly had inserted earlier this year that prevented the state from joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. RGGI is a cap-and-trade market run by nine states to limit carbon emissions by major industrial polluters.\Republicans had argued that membership would hike electric bills for Virginians by about $12 a month, although the DEQ had said bills could go down.\Then last month's election flipped the General Assembly to majority Democrat, and now the Democratic governor says he plans to propose legislation to join RGGI.\On Wednesday, House majority leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, and House Commerce and Labor Committee Chairman Terry Kilgore, R-Gate City, issued statements insisting that RGGI membership will cost Virginians, particularly lower-income residents.\""Radical environmentalists spent big during the 2019 campaign to get Democrats elected, and they expect a return on their investment,"" Gilbert said. ""Now we know what that return looks like: a carbon tax that will cost Virginia jobs and stick hard-working families with higher energy bills - nearly $6 billion over 10 years.""\""Southwest Virginia has seen this before,"" Kilgore said. ""Richmond tries a new scheme and our power bills go up.""\Northam has shown a strong commitment to mitigate the impacts of climate change, including announcing flood-protection building standards last month for new state-owned property. The new standards are considered the strongest in the country. A global hot spot for sea level rise, Virginia suffers the tidal flooding and more intense storms associated with climate change.\In August, Northam released the state's third and final Watershed Implementation Plan, a road map to clean up the Chesapeake. The plans are devised by bay states to fulfill their mutual commitment to have anti-pollution measures in place by 2025 to restore the nation's largest estuary. Studies have shown that Virginia is largely on track to meet that deadline, but only with more investment.\Northam is scheduled to present his full spending package to the Joint Money Committees on Tuesday.\Tamara Dietrich, 757-247-7892, tdietrich@dailypress.com"
84,"There must surely be easier ways to prepare for retirement.\As he winds down a 30-year career in the U.S. Senate, Virginia Republican John Warner hoped to secure one lasting legacy for his children and grandchildren: legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions that warm the Earth.\That hope was effectively shattered last week, when his fellow Republicans rose to obstruct work on a bill that represented nearly a year's worth of negotiations.\The Climate Security Act was co-sponsored by Warner and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn. It would cap emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming by as much as 71 percent below current levels over four decades.\Supporters, mostly Democrats, vowed to bring the measure back next year, when - they hope - a new president will be eager to take on the global warming challenge.\That option isn't open to Warner, who will step down in January at 81.\Instead of basking in the glow of a crowning legislative achievement, Warner watched his critics rail against a bill that they said would raise gasoline prices and cost thousands of jobs.\""We've got a real monstrosity here,"" complained Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. and an outspoken conservative. ""I am unalterably opposed to this colossal Washington intervention in the American economy.""\With his trademark gentility, Warner brushed off the defeat. It came when supporters mustered only 48 of the 60 votes needed Friday to end a Republican filibuster blocking the bill.\""No, I'm not sad,"" he told reporters shortly after the vote. ""I've learned to look at every day and thank the good Lord I'm on this side of the grass.""\But there's little doubt that the defeat came as a blow to Warner, a political centrist hoping to use his reputation as an elder statesman to forge a bipartisan coalition for action on global warming.\""I know that he put 110 percent behind it,"" said lobbyist Robert Jones, director of the Virginia Climate Initiative, a group backing Warner's bill. ""He was hopeful of seeing it move further.""\From the beginning, the effort to regulate carbon emissions promised to be an uphill - if not improbable, task.\Environmentalists would push for dramatic restrictions. Businesses would complain of economic hardships and higher energy prices. And consumers might take little notice of the effort as they battle soaring gasoline prices.\But Democrats were encouraged when Warner agreed last year to join them in pursuing global warming legislation.\With the battle lines so clearly drawn, lawmakers agreed, few were better suited to the challenge than Warner - who has built his reputation on comity and bipartisan consensus.\It was Warner, after all, who helped defuse tensions over Supreme Court nominations in recent years by forming the ""Gang of 14"" - a group of centrists from both parties who agreed to guard against any filibuster of controversial court candidates.\""If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have made it to this point,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. She's chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on which Warner sits.\Working with Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent, Warner sought to steer a centrist course on regulating carbon emissions.\The two men rejected imposing a carbon tax, as pushed by some liberals, and rejected strict mandates on industry that lacked flexibility.\Instead, they sought a market-based regulatory system in which polluting industries could buy and sell ""allowances,"" or permits, for the emissions that they create above specified limits.\The complex bill, which consumes nearly 500 pages of legislative ink, calls for the government to auction off most of the allowances and use the revenue to invest in clean-energy technologies. It also directs about $800 billion in revenue over 40 years to be used as tax relief to help consumers cope with higher energy prices.\But opposition to the measure was intense.\""The Lieberman-Warner bill achieves its goals by putting our economy in a vise and squeezing,"" said Jay Timmons, executive vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, in a video message. Timmons - previously chief of staff for former Sen. George Allen, R-Va. - also said, ""We shouldn't address climate change at the expense of destroying American jobs.""\Senate Republican leaders initially agreed to take up Warner's bill and began debating it. But it was clear that the measure was going nowhere by Wednesday, when GOP leaders insisted on having clerks read aloud every word of the bill-a process that consumed an entire day.\Republican leaders complained that they didn't have adequate time to study the bill and said they used stalling tactics partly to protest the slow pace of unrelated judicial nominations.\In the end, Warner was able to persuade only about eight of his 48 GOP colleagues to join him in trying to push the bill forward.\""Sometimes, I feel I'm on the TV program 'Survivor,' "" complained Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, a moderate who joined Warner on the bill, despite pressure from her party to resist. ""You get the distinct impression you're no longer a member of the tribe.""\Conservatives said the philosophical gulf was too wide to support Warner's bill, despite his efforts at compromise.\""Senator Warner is a centrist,"" said freshman Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. and a conservative opponent of the bill. ""He is wonderful to deal with. But as they were putting this bill together, they were listening to the wrong people.""\Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas and a leading conservative voice, called Warner ""a magnificent senator and a statesman of the first order."" But Cornyn said he thought that Boxer, a liberal Democrat, had taken charge of Warner's bill.\Warner refrained from attacking his critics but urged them to offer an alternate plan.\""We are trying to solve one of the most difficult problems ever facing America: our energy shortage and carbon emissions,"" he told his colleagues on the Senate floor. ""Doing nothing is not an option. Let us do something.""\Nothing, however, is likely the outcome this year. Although the House is set to begin work on its own global warming legislation, prospects for final passage by year's end would appear bleak, based on the Senate impasse and President Bush's veto threat.\""I'm delighted that we laid the foundation for this very important legislation,"" Warner told reporters, in an optimistic spin on his defeat.\Dismissing thoughts of a landmark capstone to his career, Warner said:\""I don't seek any legacies. I just acknowledge humbly the privilege of having served 30 years in the greatest legislative body in the world."""

PAUL VOLCKER: AUTHOR
\
Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, shunned the media throughout his 40-year career in public service. But to promote his just- published book, Changing Fortunes: The World's Money and the Threat to American Leadership, he has appeared on CNN's Larry King Live and granted some rare interviews to newspaper reporters. He's scheduled to appear on NBC's Today Friday morning and PBS' McNeil-Lehrer NewsHour June 22. Last week, Volcker talked with USA TODAY economics reporters Beth Belton and Mark Memmott in his New York office. He had just returned from a 12-day consulting trek to Hong Kong, Australia, France and Switzerland. Earlier this year, he visited Moscow and East Europe to advise finance officials on how to fix their collapsed economies. Volcker splits his time between consulting, teaching at Princeton University and being chairman of James D. Wolfensohn, a small New York investment bank. At his office there, on the 40th floor of a mid town skyscraper, the 6-foot-6 Volcker sipped iced tea, often leaning back in his leather chair to chuckle at his own jokes. Volcker is best known as the Fed chairman who whipped inflation by pushing up interest rates until the prime rate hit a record 21.5%. Then, the economy slid into recession. The New Jersey native is also an avid fly fisherman. On one wall of his office hangs a watercolor of a memorable trout catch. And he is father of two children. A small oil painting of a sad clown face, painted by his daughter when she was 10, adorns another wall.
\
Q: Why did you decide to write the book?
\
A: There are a lot of people through the years who said, ``You ought to write a book.'' I never responded. But then Toyoo Gyohten (TOY-u Gee-OH-ten), the co-author ... was (at Princeton), and I was there, and they said, ``Why don't you give a seminar together?'' I said, ``well, if we're going to go to all that trouble of giving a seminar on postwar international stuff, stick a tape recorder in the room, and it'll be simple, we'll have a book.'' Part of the purpose was to contribute to the educational process and maybe even the motivational process of young students interested in the public service.
\
Q: What do you see as the key issue in domestic policy?
\
A: It's so dull and people are so tired of hearing about it, but I do think the budget problem ... cuts across a lot of the other problems.
\
Q: What needs to happen?
\
A: It's obviously a political choice. I don't see how you can balance the budget by passing a constitutional amendment. You've got to balance the budget by reducing expenditures or reducing the rate of growth of expenditures or increasing the rate of growth in taxes. ... If you want to amend the Constitution, then we should make it harder to spend money ... presumably by a line-item veto. Or you can make it harder to spend money very directly by amending the Constitution to say you need better than a simple majority of (Congress) to spend money. Make it 60%.
\
Q: How frustrating was it as the Fed chairman to talk about this ad nauseam and see things just getting worse?
\
A: It gets very frustrating. There's only one very cynical advantage. Every time you wanted to get them (Congress or the administration) off your back, you could say, ``Well, what did you do about the budget recently?'' And the answer was always, ``Nothing'' (laughter).
\
Q: Do you agree with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , who says inflation is not to be feared at today's levels?
\
A: Inflation is pretty well under control at the moment. You would like to see it reduced further. We are making some progress, and interest rates don't fully reflect that because the deficit is so big.
\
Q: If you were still at the Treasury and the president called you for advice on the July economic summit and on the state of the economy, what would you say?
\
A: The state of the economy is moving ahead, however sluggishly. We don't have any dramatic actions to be taken to speed the recovery. Trade would certainly be on the agenda. If they could really finish up this General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it would be a great accomplishment. I'm sure they won't, but that would be good. They could do some work coordinating assistance to the East. ... On the environment, the weight of the evidence looks pretty clear that the greenhouse effect is a problem. Doesn't it make sense to raise revenues with a carbon tax or a gas tax?
\
Q: How much do you miss being in government?
\
A: I am not immune from the feeling in the country as a whole, which is, ``Who wants to go to Washington?'' That is a pretty sad comment from me, because I spent a lot of my life there, taking great pride in government service.
\
Q: In the book, there were numerous people you encountered at the Treasury or the Fed who have left public service. Are we in danger of losing that kind of brain trust?
\
A: No doubt about it. ... There's clearly been a trend toward politicization, (and) you lose something when you do that. ... Back in the days of Roosevelt, when everything was getting highly politicized, presumably he had (just more than 200) political appointments in the administration. Now we've got 3,000. Or look at Congress. When I first went to Washington in the 1950s, there were 350 professional staff people in Congress. Now there are (15,000 to 20,000) professional congressional staff people. It costs $2 billion just to run the Congress. It makes it a lot harder to be in a bureaucracy downtown that spends half its time fending off the congressional staffer types.
\
Q: The period from 1979, when you became Fed chairman, through the '81-82 recession, you must have been surprised that interest rates had to go as high as they did to control inflation.
\
A: Yes. No doubt about that.
\
Q: What were Federal Open Market Committee meetings like then? You're human, too, and you saw unemployment going to 11%.
\
A: Well, in fact, once the Fed governors got the bit in their teeth, meetings were dull (laughter). I'm exaggerating a little bit, but there was a real strong attitude that we'd better see it through and we'd better not flinch in terms of what, to me, were unexpected levels of interest rates. That sentiment was surprisingly strong. And I sensed a good deal of support in the country. People were alarmed. They understood that something had to be done about inflation. ... They associated our actions with dealing with something they thought was a big problem.
\
Q: Is there any parallel between those times and now?
\
A: It's harder now because then there was a clear feeling of emergency and an enemy. Now people are not happy, but there are no nice enemies.
\
Q: Isn't inflation still the No. 1 enemy?
\
A: To me, inflation is always the No. 1 enemy, but it's not in an emergency state (now). Back in the early 1980s, when those price figures began coming in at an annual rate of 15% or so, I mean that was scary even to great liberals who didn't like to worry about inflation. That was the most inflation we'd ever had in the country, maybe outside a few wartime months in the whole history of the U.S. ... Inflation continues to be a chronic problem, a residual problem. But it doesn't scare you when you get up in the morning the way it did a lot of people then. Unemployment's a problem now, but you don't have a Depression level of unemployment. You don't have a feeling of enormous crises, you don't obviously have a war. ... The enemy isn't sticking his nose up there quite so clearly.
\
Q: The Fed and Alan Greenspan have been criticized for not acting quickly enough. Is that fair?
\
A: That's luck. No, it is unpleasant to be in the Federal Reserve in an election year, I assure you. It's not very pleasant to be there in even small recessions. ... I think he's done a remarkable job in some sense in not being criticized more than he has been.
\
Q: When the reader finishes your book, should he or she be pessimistic or optimistic?
\
A: Challenged (laughter). What really aggravates me is, compared to the problems of a Russia or Eastern Europe or even Europe now or potentially Japan and certainly Latin America, the kind of problems we have are quite manageable. But we're not managing them. And I'd like the reader to think, ``Goddammit, let's manage it!'' And that does require some restraint on spending. And it may require something on restraining the growth in entitlement programs. It may require some reorientation and increase in taxes, but since we've got among the lowest tax take (as a percentage of gross national product) of any advanced country, I don't think it's going to kill us. That idea that it's going to kill you is nonsense. What kills you is the failure to tax.

86," Virginia Power, the State Corporation Commission, environmentalists and consumer advocates are wrestling with the issue of power conservation and the extent it should be embraced by the utility.\ How the question is answered will determine the number of power plants Virginia Power builds, the amount of pollutants released into the air and how much utility bills will increase.\ Virginia Power's foremost job, said spokesman James Norvelle, ""is to provide reliable power at a reasonable cost. When you flip on the light switch, we are going to be there for you.""\ Virginia Power, the state's largest utility with 1.7 million customers, sees conservation as a secondary service.\ The utility has 22 programs in its ""Demand-Side Management Plan."" Eight deal with saving energy by reducing demand; eight are load management programs that shift demand from peak hours; and six deal with making the company's operations more efficient.\ Norvelle said the programs will reduce peak demand by 235 megawatts this year. One megawatt lights 250 homes.\ Reducing the peak load means Virginia Power does not have to buy expensive power from other utilities or build a new plant to help meet peak power demands, Norvelle said.\ And that means ratepayers save money.\ But most of the savings come from load management programs, which shift power use away from peak demand hours.\ Environmentalists argue that load management does not conserve power.\ ""We have gone on record questioning their commitment"" to conservation, said Richard Parrish, a staff attorney with the Charlottesville-based Southern Environmental Law Center. ""Everything they do is load management.""\ ""Load management saves money by avoiding the necessity of peak power plants. It benefits the ratepayers but not the environment,"" Parrish said.\ ""Conservation, on the other hand, benefits both the ratepayer and the environment.""\ Less demand means fewer power plants, which means less pollution released into the atmosphere, environmentalists say.\ Parrish said the utility needs to view conservation as a resource it can use to meet future power demands.\ ""We want the utility and the SCC to use conservation as a cost- effective resource to meet demand,"" he said.\ The SCC, which has final authority over major utility decisions, has begun to cautiously move into the realm of conservation, SCC spokesman Kenneth Schrad said.\ ""The commission has just finished a yearlong study and has issued an order encouraging conservation and load management,"" he said.\ The problem, said Schrad, is determining the benefits and costs of conservation.\ ""Our goal is that all consumers should benefit, and that one customer not benefit at the expense of another,"" Schrad said.\ The SCC has named a 15-member task force to hammer out a way to measure the cost-effectiveness of energy conservation. Included on the task force are representatives of consumer groups, electric utilities, natural gas companies, and environmental groups.\ ""I do not expect a consensus,"" said Mary Doswell, a task force member and director of demand-side analysis for Virginia Power.\ ""We're faced with a major balancing act here,"" said Schrad."
87," Since May, John Rader's family, along with 300,000 other customers of Puget Sound Energy, have been saving money by watching the clock.\ Rader, of Puyallup, Wash., has cut his electric bills 20% by adding a timer to his hot-water heater and keeping the dishwasher and washing machine off when electricity costs the most. ""We really haven't changed our lifestyle that much,"" Rader says. ""We're just more attuned to the way we use electricity.""\ Rader and his neighbors represent a small but growing group of consumers who are being rewarded for confining electricity use to times when power is cheapest.\ More than a dozen utility companies in 17 states offer pilot programs with time-of-day pricing for electricity. In some cases, consumers are charged different rates during the day instead of a fixed rate.\ More complex programs offer computer links or specialized meters for consumers to track the hourly cost so they can adjust their electricity use.\ Within a decade, computerized refrigerators and water heaters could be able to automatically adjust their thermostats based on minute-to-minute shifts in electricity costs.\ ""These are all trends whose time is coming,"" says Steven Rosenstock, a researcher with the Edison Electric Institute, an organization of privately owned utilities.\ As the West sweats through threats of blackouts this summer, and the rest of the nation grumbles about high electric bills, this evolving system of real-time pricing offers the potential for lower rates and a more efficient use of the nation's power system.\ Electricity can cost a utility 10 times more from 6 to 10 a.m. and 5 to 9 p.m., when people are home and run the air conditioning or heat. They switch on lights, cook meals, turn on the dishwasher or throw in a load of clothes. Utilities have to buy expensive electricity on the spot market to cover the surge in demand.\ In addition, there are ""super peaks"" during weather extremes. Even more power is needed for cooling or heating, which strains a utility's ability to provide enough electricity to all customers.\ By reducing the amount of electricity used during those hours, utilities could put off the huge cost of building power plants or avoid spot-market purchases.\ For example, California utilities usually pay less than $100 per megawatt-hour (one hour of a megawatt of electricity, which powers about 1,000 households). But on several hot days last July, electricity demand pushed the price of electricity well over $700 per megawatt-hour.\ ""We think it's important for consumers to see not only the money they can save on their monthly bill, but that they're also avoiding costs down the road,"" says Gary Swofford, Puget Sound Energy's chief operating officer. ""If we don't have to build a new plant, that's a huge cost they won't pay in the future.""\ So-called demand-side management isn't new. In the past, utilities tried to conserve electricity by offering rebates to consumers who purchased energy-efficient appliances and weatherized their homes.\ More recently, utilities such as Florida Power & Light, Potomac Electric Power and Xcel Energy (formerly Northern States Power) have offered price breaks to customers who allow their utility to automatically shut down their air conditioners or hot-water heaters by radio control when demand for electricity is high.\ Programs such as Puget Sound Energy's give customers more of a role in energy management. Standard electric meters, which provide monthly data to meter readers, are replaced with cellular meters that transmit how much electricity is used minute-to-minute, matching the power use to the real-time cost of electricity.\ Smaller pilot programs being conducted by Gulf Power in Florida and Georgia Power display similar information on a special monitor in the homes of customers.\ Swofford says the utility doesn't expect customers to slavishly monitor electric use on the Internet. But by making people aware of pricing peaks and valleys, he believes they will change habits over time.\ ""This is largely about increasing general awareness,"" he says.\ For example, if each homeowner washed one load in a dishwasher (which uses 2.4 kilowatts per load) after 9 p.m. instead of during peak hours, Puget Sound Energy could shift 25% of its peak power demand to off-peak hours, when electricity is cheaper.\ Dilip Wagle, a power expert with the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. in Seattle, says if instituted nationally, such programs could save $10 billion to $15 billion annually while eliminating the need for 200 additional power plants over the next decade.\ But time-of-day pricing faces formidable challenges. The computer networks and special metering systems are a big capital investment for utilities. And state regulators are reluctant to change the traditional electric rate structure. It took Puget Sound Energy nearly a decade to win approval from the Washington state public service commission.\ ""There was concern that it isn't easy for low-income and elderly to shift energy usage,"" Swofford says.\ For now, customers such as Rader don't mind monitoring and adjusting electricity use. He sees it as a cost-saver and as a way to preserve the environment for his two sons. ""Saving money is great, but I want to do my part for my kids,"" he says."

90,"If you think the USA would be better off with a higher unemployment rate, fewer small businesses and less money in family bank accounts, you should support big increases in federal taxes on gasoline and other motor fuels. \Enacting sharply higher fuel taxes that would make it dramatically more expensive for people and goods to move around our nation would have the effect of imposing economic sanctions on ourselves. This amounts to a perfect recipe for a double-dip recession. \Opposing a huge fuel tax increase isn't the same as opposing energy conservation and the use of alternative fuels. \The United States already has in place federal fuel mileage standards approved for new cars and light-duty trucks requiring them to be able to go an average of 36 miles on a gallon of fuel by 2016. That alone will save billions of gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel each year. \Additionally, a law enacted in 2007 will require American refiners to mix 36 billion gallons of biofuels (such as ethanol) with gasoline and diesel fuel each year by 2022. American refineries are expected to produce 180 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel this year, so the law already in place will substantially cut the amount of petroleum used to fuel vehicles. \While challenges must still be overcome to achieve this level of biofuels -- and government has a responsibility to ensure the objective and, through scientific testing, to make sure that biofuels in larger amounts are safe for engines and the environment -- work should continue to examine alternative fuels, including electricity and natural gas. \What's disturbing about efforts to establish alternatives to affordable and efficient petroleum fuels for our vehicles is that these efforts always depend on multibillion dollar taxpayer subsidies. As a result, as the number of alternative-fueled vehicles grows, the amount of subsidies coming out of the wallets of Americans could easily rise to hundreds of billions of dollars annually, with no limit. \It makes sense for Congress to consider approving a small increase in the federal 18.4-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax -- a handful of pennies per gallon -- if the money raised would go to the Highway Trust Fund to maintain, improve and expand our nation's road system. \Using some of this money to fund mass transit, to further reduce gasoline consumption, is also worth considering. \But piling on billions of dollars in new gasoline taxes on top of billions of dollars in growing subsidies for other forms of energy is unwise, unaffordable and harmful. \Charles T. Drevna is president of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association."
91,"Gov. Bob McDonnell's proposal to eliminate the state tax on gasoline is bad for the environment, will lead to more congested roads and promote highway damage. Drivers now pay 17.5 cents per gallon of gasoline or diesel fuel to help fund transportation in the Old Dominion. Despite diminishing returns due to inflation, this fee has remained unchanged for years. Lawmakers in Richmond fear the consequences of voting for any tax increase. While the governor understands the importance of addressing transportation, he is trying to do so without taking responsibility for increasing taxes. He plans to replace the tax on gasoline with an increase in the general sales tax. He could then boast that his administration made it cheaper for everyone to drive. He is banking on consumers paying more attention to price at the pump than to a 0.8 percent increase in costs for general merchandise. This may be good politics but it is bad policy for the environment.\The gas tax is a direct user fee. People who drive more spend more time on the roads and pay for that privilege through the tax on fuels. When gas prices rise, people drive less; when gas prices fall, they drive more. Gas prices also influence the type of vehicle drivers will buy. Periods of cheap fuel promote sales of gas-guzzlers such as SUVs. Persistent high gas prices drive more consumers to smaller and more efficient autos. Gas price even influences how fast people drive. (The Congressional Budget published these findings on gas price and driver habits in a 2008 report.) \McDonnell's plan also includes a $15 increase in registration fees applied the same to all vehicles, regardless of weight. Gas-guzzlers and fuel-efficient hybrids will pay the same amount. \The consequences of cheap fuel include more gasoline burned and roads crowded with more divers in oversized vehicles. More gasoline burned means more environmental damage. The extraction, refining, transportation and burning of petroleum is dirty business. Think air pollution, climate change, ocean acidification, oil spills and wars for oil. \Gas-guzzling, oversized vehicles promoted by cheap gas prices do harm beyond the fuel they waste. Large vehicles tax the environment by requiring more raw materials and energy to build than smaller ones. Their excessive weight also does more damage to roads then smaller and less-massive cars. And simply being larger means they occupy more of the road, leading to more congested highways. For example, consider the Toyota Prius (50 mpg, 3,042 pounds, 175.6 inches long) and the Cadillac Escalade (16 mpg, 7,100 pounds, 202.5 inches long). Compared to the Prius, the Escalade will cause twice the road damage and will occupy 15 percent more highway. The same stretch of Interstate 64 that would start to slow from congestion with 100 SUVs, would keep flowing with about 114 small cars. \McDonnell's plan also calls for a $100 annual penalty for driving an alternative fuel vehicle (think electric cars). This might make sense if his plan still used the gas tax to help fund roads, but because it eliminates that state tax, this is simply a measure to punish those who dare to drive without paying tribute to the governor's oil company patrons. Note that oil and gas companies contributed $186,406 to his last election campaign. \Every other state uses a gas tax to help pay for transportation infrastructure. The McDonnell plan would be a unique gift to the gasoline industry, SUV dealers and road-repair companies across the Old Dominion. It would be so much better for the environment and much fairer to the working folks of Virginia if we simply did like most other states and used a realistic tax on motor vehicle fuels to sustain a sound transportation infrastructure. \Cuker is a professor of Marine and Environmental Science at Hampton University."
92," *According to an optimistic projection, it will cost $800 billion through the next century to limit carbon emissions responsible for the warming of the earth's atmosphere. A pessimistic estimate puts the cost at $3.6 trillion.\ *In July 1988, the United States for the first time depended on foreign sources for more than half of its oil. During the oil embargo of 1973, U.S. dependency was 33 percent.\ *West Germany is spending $50 million a year researching the use of hydrogen as a fuel. U.S. spending is one-tenth that.\ Environmental problems. Security problems. Economic problems. Technological problems.\ Our dependence on fossil fuels, primarily oil and gasoline, is helping to fill the atmosphere with gases that are trapping heat - the greenhouse effect.\ Our growing dependence on foreign oil - and the decline of our own production - makes us more susceptible to the economic blackmail that saw oil prices quadruple 16 years ago.\ There is a growing realization that our nation is losing its technological superiority. In computers, in electronics - even in the quality of education we offer our children - the United States is slipping and in some cases is already behind.\ But when the history of the decline of the United States is written, it will not say that we were overcome by our problems. It will say we were too selfish to make the sacrifices necessary to solve those problems.\ Consider, as just one example, the gas tax. A 10-cent increase in the gas tax would raise $10 billion. How could that money be used?\ Research and development of alternative fuels would be a good place to start. New fuels would make us less dependent on foreign nations. That's a better investment in security than a fleet of ships in the Persian Gulf. New fuels could ease environmental concerns ranging from the greenhouse effect to smog to pressure for off-shore oil exploration.\ As everyone in Hampton Roads knows, there aren't enough roads. Revenue from a gas tax could be used to build and repair highways and bridges, as well as help fund mass transport.\ Some of the money could be used to ease the deficit burden, freeing funds for education and removing the economic restraints that prevent the United States from taking a more activist role in the restructuring of Eastern Europe.\ A gas tax would also be a powerful incentive for people to use less gas, and that would be good. A $1 tax would still leave the price of gasoline in the United States below what it is in most other countries.\ In as far as it would promote conservation, a gas tax would have kinder, gentler implications for the environment, would ease the trade deficit, promote energy independence and lessen security concerns - a matter of growing importance considering the inevitable cuts facing the defense budget.\ President Bush has stuck to his pledge of no new taxes for a year. But who could have foreseen the changes that have occurred across the globe in the past 12 months? If the United States wants to lead those changes rather than follow in their wake, it can't continue to be shackled by debt. It can't watch other nations surpass it in technology, and it certainly can't continue to ignore the environmental problems it faces.\ The solutions to these problems will be complex and difficult. The gas tax offers a good starting point."
93," Tolls are fairer\ Increasing taxes on gasoline and not on diesel fuel penalizes those using gas, and the truckers get off free. Further, tourists and others will buy gas in adjoining states before coming into Virginia to circumvent the higher price they must pay for gas, thus negating the tax.\ Tolls are much fairer to all concerned. A closer watch must be kept on the Virginia Department of Transportation to ensure it is held accountable for engineering mistakes and cost overruns on all highway projects.\ C. E. Raye Respress\ Grafton\ I'll pay\ I am willing to pay for my share of using the roads in Virginia by an increase in the gas tax. Money is clearly needed on a long- term basis to construct, improve and maintain our roads. I do not favor some short-term approach or one that tries to shift the cost to someone else.\ Floyd A. Chambers\ Hampton\ Reasons to pay\ A gas tax would: Raise necessary transportation funds in an efficient and equitable manner; cause drivers to think twice before making unnecessary trips; possibly cut down slightly on congestion; cut global warming; help our balance of payments by not sending as much money overseas; fight terrorism by not sending as much money to countries unfriendly to us; encourage smaller, more fuel- efficient vehicles; show the rest of the world that we are not just spoiled brats who just want to consume as much of the world's resources as quickly as we can.\ Steve Wann\ Williamsburg\ Raise the gas tax!\ Since moving back to Virginia two years ago, we have found three aspects of our old home troubling:\ The poor condition and capacity of the Interstate system; the lack of funding for services for the handicapped; the low pay scale for teachers.\ These concerns are troubling because we relocated from a ""poor"" southern state and expected at least parity, if not improvement, in the areas of our lives that are controlled by the state.\ The current transportation plan does little to fix the first and exacerbates the others even further. Raise the gas tax! It's a fair and simple users' tax. It addresses the problem without impacting other budgeted state services. Now is a good time to implement since gas prices can fluctuate by 10 cents from week to week.\ Mark Dawson\ Hayes\ Users should pay\ Not sure why the spineless folks in Richmond don't want a gas tax, but that is obviously the best way to fix the transportation problem. All people who use the roads pay for the roads; seems pretty simple to me.\ James ""Bucky"" Jarvis\ Gloucester\ Raise tax 10 cents\ Delaying the decision to raise taxes insures that the same roads and highways will cost more in the future.\ A 10-cent-per-gallon increase in gas tax would provide $500 million to begin much-needed major building and repair. A fee imposed in state auto inspection and repair would supplement transportation funds long range.\ Give Gov. Tim Kaine the tools to act on this critical issue before March 26; the General Assembly apparently will never act on it.\ Art Jensen\ Hampton\ Fuel tax is fair\ Virginia's transportation system should be funded with fuel taxes and not from a collection of hidden fees and taxes on indirectly related sources. The road tax should include both gas and diesel fuel taxes, with a significant increase in the diesel fuel tax to compensate for the extraordinary wear and tear to our road system from heavy truck traffic.\ This is the only fair, equitable and efficient way to collect taxes in direct proportion to the use of the roadways.\ Arnold H. Janot\ Williamsburg\ Add sales tax\ The present bill awaiting the governor's action is an example of government at its worst -- I don't think it's fixable, and it should be vetoed.\ Let everyone pay their fair share, and while we're at it, build in an adjustment for inflation so we don't go through this ridiculous exercise every few years. A percentage on the sale of every gallon of fuel (all kinds) -- sounds like a sales tax, doesn't it? Regressive? Yes, but this isn't an income tax, it's a use tax. You use it; you pay for it. What could be simpler?\ Sounds like an argument for tolls, too, doesn't it?\ Stewart Winn\ Williamsburg\ Out-of-staters pay\ There is no other course. The public accepts large swings in the price of gasoline now. How much flak will occur if a 10 to 20-cent tax is added to the price of a gallon of gasoline? Those traveling in Virginia, regardless of where they live, will pay their share.\ Hugh Williams\ Newport News\ Pay, not borrow\ Increasing the gas tax would be the best way to fund the needed transportation requirements for Virginia. Taking funds from the general budget or borrowing money and imposing substantial additional costs is not a very sensible approach to solving our problems. These approaches simply shift the burden onto our children and grandchildren due to the incompetence of our legislature to propose a sensible solution -- i.e. increase the gas tax.\ The price of fuel in the United States is already very low compared to many countries, and encourages wasteful and destructive national policies regarding the use of petroleum and the flow of funds out of our country.\ So let's increase the gas tax and use the funds for general transportation improvement -- not just highways.\ Michael P. Gaus\  Williamsburg\ Environment, too\ Incrementally increase the gas tax until it hurts. It will hardly be noticed amid the wide price fluctuations we normally experience.\ Environmental considerations alone dictate that we discourage increased use of autos.Responsible citizens should act to ensure that their elected representatives act responsibly. There is life beyond the next election.\ Ronald R. Cabell\ Newport News\ Use the surplus\ I do not want a tax increase on gas. We have a surplus in the general fund (what are we saving it for). There are increases in all my taxes I pay, and my cost of living supplement does not keep up.\ David L. Williams Sr.\ Hampton\ Why hide cost?\ Instead of trying to hide a ""tax increase"" by hikes in various fees, bite the bullet and raise the tax on gas at the pump. That is the most efficient, simple, easy-to-collect and fair way to raise funds to improve our roadways. Those that use the roads pay.\ Al Lambert\ Hampton\ Fair fuel tax\ Our Republican representatives vastly overrate the backlash from increasing the gas tax. Virginians know we must fund the transportation needs of the state. And an increased fuel tax is as near a perfectly fair user tax as this Republican can think of.\ Robert Peace\ Williamsburg\ Listen up, GA\ With a 10-cent increase, am I willing to pay an extra $2.20 to fill the 22-gallon tank on my SUV? You bet I am.\ Our legislators instead want to raid the general fund, put us in deep debt (Who pays for that? We do.) and add more bureaucracy, which translates into more costs. Maybe they will get the message before the next election.\ Al Huneycutt\ Newport News\ It's simple\ The gas tax increase is the easiest way. It taxes the users, including tourists.\ What does selling a house have to do with the transportation and road situation? Look at the other possibilities proposed and ask the same question.\ Lee T. Edgerton\ Williamsburg\ Promote efficiency\ Raise the gas tax in Virginia to 50 cents per gallon. The people who use the roads and those who use the biggest gas-guzzlers would pay the most. It would also force American car manufacturers to enter the fuel efficiency market.\ The General Assembly's proposal is the work of idiots.\ Donald Bosserman\ Williamsburg\ Ridiculous proposal\ An increase in the gas tax is the most equitable solution to the state's road-funding problem. What the legislature has proposed is ridiculous: Several taxes and fees scattered about and using funds intended for education, health, law enforcement, etc. only creates more paperwork that not only costs more but will take away from other important services.\ Ron Hutson\ Mathews\ GA bailout\ The patchwork of fees and tax increases currently proposed by the legislature is nothing short of an abdication of responsibility.\ Richard Strenkowski\ Williamsburg\ Upfront cost\ I favor a 10-cent per gallon gas tax in lieu of the tangled bureaucratic legislation passed by the General Assembly.\ Phil Olekszyk\ Gloucester\ Pay a percentage\ Compute the gas tax as a percentage of gas prices so we do not have to go through this ridiculous drill again. The bean counters can figure out the percentage.\ Tom Wishart\ Williamsburg\ System's in place\ If the gas tax increase is phased in a couple of cents at a time every three months or so, we will not notice the difference. If this is done we will have the funds to do the required highway work, and as a side benefit a few folks might be encouraged to drive more fuel- efficient vehicles.\ The system to collect this gas tax is already in place; no new bureaucracy is necessary to implement it.\ W. Gaylord Lockett\ Seaford\ State's roads\ To regionalize taxes for Virginia highways is the wrong approach. Everyone in the state, if they drive a vehicle or not, has a need for highways. Hampton Roads is a port facility, and millions of tons of cargo come through it. This affects all the citizens and all the roads.\ A tax increase on gasoline is the way to go, and earmark that tax specifically for the highway fund.\ Ken Strickland\ Hampton\ Not area's problem\ The burden of solving traffic congestion in Virginia should be borne statewide and not locally. The roads are used by all, and users should pay for the traffic fix.\ Tom Hughes\ James City County\ Va.'s low tax\ Virginia's gas tax is among the lowest in the nation. There is already a system in place to collect the current tax. Raising the gas and diesel fuel tax by 12 or 15 cents per gallon is an equitable burden on users of the road system, including those that use Virginia as a conduit north and south.\ Warren Hathaway\ Williamsburg\ 1986 tax rate\ Does anyone really think they could live like they do today while earning 1986 wages? The same principle applies to highways and the people building them.\ Bob Sigler\ Hampton\ Adjust for inflation\ The gas tax hasn't changed for two decades. We need to raise the gas tax to adjust for inflation, and have a formula in the tax code to continue to adjust for inflation. The gas tax is the simplest way to charge the users of our roads and highways. This would allow us to shift money to other forms of transportation.\ Norm Berge\ Williamsburg\ Tax sodas, not gas\ On the surface, it appears to be the logical solution. In reality, the rise in gas prices creates a recession. Everything is delivered by trucks. The cost of delivery will be passed on to consumers.\ When gas prices rise, consumer spending slows down considerably. Businesses stop hiring; unemployment goes up. It's a losing cycle for the economy engine. Even people who don't drive will ultimately pay for this gas tax. We would be better off putting a 10-cent increase on sodas.\ Dave Skirvin\ Gwynn *"
94,"Two years ago this month, crude oil prices spiked to more than $145 a barrel, driving the price of regular gasoline to more than $4 a gallon and painfully reminding the nation once again how vulnerable it is to the whims of the international oil market. \It's reasonable to ask what policymakers have done in the past 24 months to try to reduce that vulnerability. For that matter, it's reasonable to ask what they've done in the 37 years since the Arab oil embargo, which caused huge lines at gasoline stations, to stop enriching hostile petro-states in the Middle East and elsewhere. \The answer: not nearly enough. \There have been energy bills, incentives for oil drilling, tax breaks for solar and wind and biofuels, billions for energy research, and so on. But here's the one metric that matters: In 1973, the United States imported about 30% of its oil. Now it imports about 68%. \The Senate will soon take up another energy measure, one that now looks likely to emerge as a watered-down compromise that will do little to change things. The legislation could contain some useful incremental provisions to address BP's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and promote home energy efficiency. But it won't swing for the fences. ""Cap and trade"" -- a mechanism to limit greenhouse-gas emissions by making oil, coal and other fossil fuels more expensive over time -- is dead for now. \That's too bad. Because if there's one thing that really works, it's price. \Consider what happened when gasoline prices spiked in 2008. It was painful for just about everyone, and particularly hard on lower-income people and those who had to drive long distances. But it did more to change habits and reduce oil usage than anything Congress and a parade of presidents had done in decades. \In June 2008, Americans drove 12 billion fewer miles than in June 2007, part of the longest sustained drop in driving since high prices discouraged driving in the 1970s. Car buyers suddenly wanted smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and began to try to shed their SUVs. Sales of Toyota's 50-mpg Prius hybrid shot up by 69% in 2007, exceeding those of the popular Ford Explorer SUV. The Toyota Corolla was the No. 1 selling car in the country in June 2008, while the Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado pickups -- traditionally best-sellers but comparative gas guzzlers -- had dropped to fifth and sixth place. But once prices fell, so did sales of the Prius and Corolla. The F-150 and Silverado again rose to the top of the heap. \Four decades of experience suggests the only way to wean the nation off its ruinous oil addiction is prices that go up and stay up. And, although it's a political non-starter for now, the simplest and best way to achieve that is to gradually raise the federal gasoline tax, now 18.4 cents a gallon, where it has been since 1993. \The arguments for a gas-tax increase are no less compelling for their familiarity. Higher taxes would produce substantial revenues -- roughly $1 billion a year for every extra penny in tax -- that could be used to fix roads and reduce the budget deficit. They would make fuel-efficient cars more attractive. \Ultimately, higher taxes could help drive alternative technologies that would slow the flow of money to finance some of the world's worst regimes and multinational oil companies, such as BP. \Whether increasing the gas tax would reduce the need for drilling in environmentally sensitive areas such as the Gulf depends on worldwide demand for oil, which is being driven upward by the rising economies of China and India. But those countries have their own efforts to curb gasoline use, and reducing consumption in the USA, the world's top oil consumer, is essential. \To be sure, the middle of a shaky economic recovery is a bad time to raise taxes. But total gasoline taxes are now lower than they've been in decades after adjusting for inflation -- less than half what they were per mile driven in 1970, for example. And while shocking the economy with a tax increase of 50 cents or $1 a gallon all at once wouldn't be prudent, phasing in such an increase -- a penny or two a month for 48 months, for example -- would limit the economic damage. \A gradual increase would also send an unmistakable message that the price of gasoline will eventually rise to reflect its real cost to the economy, the environment and national security. And it would give car owners plenty of time to plan for a change. \Brave (or foolish) politicians have been calling for this for years with no success, but it's an idea whose time should come. The alternative is a status quo where nothing changes except the amount of environmental degradation and the nation's weakness in the face of foreign oil suppliers."
95," Senate Democrats conceded Monday that a temporary repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax increase is unavoidable, and Republican leaders prepared to tap the nation's savings institutions to pay for it.\ Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said the Senate could vote as soon as today on the tax cut, which he proposed less than two weeks ago. He planned to discuss the timing with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.\ ""We think (it) is inevitable,"" Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters. Republicans are ""in the majority. They have the votes to pass legislation.""\ The leading proposal for paying for the cut, according to House and Senate aides, was separate legislation that strengthens the government fund insuring savings and loan deposits.\ That plan requires a one-time premium payment from S&Ls, and, under budget rules, the money can be used to offset the tax cut. GOP leaders also are looking at a cut in Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.\ The Clinton administration supports the S&L legislation and Daschle said ""I'm not necessarily averse"" to using it to cut the gas tax.\ Republican leaders are pushing hard for the repeal, which is seen as having wide popular appeal. Dole, Clinton's rival in the presidential race, notes repeatedly that the tax increase was approved ""without a single Republican vote.""\ Many Democrats are criticizing the tax cut, saying it could amount to a windfall for the oil companies who pay the tax and ultimately pass it on to the consumer. And environmentalists maintain the tax cut would encourage more energy consumption and hurt the environment.\ Repeal is ""attractive as a matter of raw politics, but it is terrible as a matter of public policy,"" said Sen. Charles Robb, D- Va. ""Just as we were beginning to make sustained progress in bringing down the deficit ... we blink. We can't take the political heat.""\ However, some Democrats feel compelled to vote for the tax cut and Republicans are near unanimous in backing it.\ At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton wanted the tax cut considered as part of a balanced budget. But that doesn't mean Clinton had decided to veto the tax cut.\ ""If it comes to us separately, we'll look at it separately,"" McCurry said. ""We would hope that the Congress would give equal priority treatment to raising the minimum wage.""\ With gas prices soaring roughly 20 cents per gallon since February, Dole on April 26 proposed shaving the 1993 increase of 4.3 cents off the 18.3-cent federal gasoline tax.\ Dole, R-Kan., suggested the Senate should act today, which marks what the private, business-financed Tax Foundation has called Tax Freedom Day. That's the date, according to its calculation, by which the average taxpayer has earned enough to pay federal, state and local taxes for the year.\ It ""would be good day to pass the gas-tax repeal. It seems to me it might have a nice ring to it,"" Dole said."
96," An attempt to break Virginia's budget stalemate came from the Senate Wednesday when it abandoned a $1.6 billion transportation plan that included a gas tax increase.\ Senate Finance Chairman John Chichester said he reluctantly backed off because the House was unwilling to discuss new highway funding. He termed it ""a major, major concession.""\ House budget negotiators were not impressed. They said the gas tax hike was never up for discussion anyway, so the Senate wasn't giving up that much.\ ""They just bowed to the inevitable,"" said Del. Vince Callahan, R- Fairfax. ""It's not a concession at all, and they know it.""\ The transportation debate was among the highlights as the General Assembly convened a special session on passage of a 2005-06 budget. Gov. Mark R. Warner ordered lawmakers back to work when they failed to approve a budget during the regular 60-day session and a subsequent three-day extension.\ Wednesday also featured debate in the House of Delegates over reintroduced legislation that would raise money by eliminating sales tax exemptions for businesses.\ Lawmakers also spent time sorting out procedural details, such as whether to accept $115 daily reimbursement from taxpayers for lodging and food on days when they attend floor sessions. House members decided to accept the payments. The Senate did not.\ Chichester said the next move in the budget battle was up to the House, now that the Senate had dropped its demand for a 3-cent per- gallon gas tax hike. The Senate also abandoned its call to increase the titling tax and the vehicle registration fee, plus a measure that would have applied the sales tax to the wholesale price of fuel.\ Other major sticking points of the Senate budget are still in place, though. Senators want raise the general sales tax from 4.5 cents to 5.5 cents and the cigarette tax from 2.5 cents per pack to 35 cents. They would also raise the rate on wealthier income tax filers.\ The Senate passed its own version of the budget Wednesday -- essentially the same document without the transportation component.\ The House of Delegates didn't get as far in its business. The House considered, but did not pass, a measure that raised money by eliminating sales tax breaks for a variety of businesses. The measure is needed to provide cash for the House version of the budget, which delegates will consider later.\ The sales tax bill, sponsored by Del. Phil Hamilton, R-Newport News, was similar to one debated during the regular session. But this new version would forbid utility companies from retaining exemptions.\ By offering up essentially the same measure as they did before, some said the House and Senate were back on the same collision course that forced the General Assembly into overtime.\ ""There you go again,"" said Minority Leader Frank Hall, D- Richmond. ""It's the same thing you had before a rush to judgment ... on a bill that's still warm.""\ The House Finance Committee approved it in a 12-- 9 vote.\ Democrats refused to fast track the bill once it got to the House floor. They contended the sweeping measure required at least one day of study.\ ""We wanted them to know and the public to know what they are doing, you don't legislate at night,"" Hall said. ""They have the votes to pass this, of course, but we wanted to get a look at it.""\ When Democrats balked at the speedy approach, the House adjourned for the day. The House will return today. The Senate will return Friday.\ ""I guess we'll be here every day until Sunday,"" Hamilton said, referring to the span of time that will be needed to pass the revenue bill and a budget.\ House Republicans stressed that passing the bill allows them to get back to the negotiating table.\ ""This is only a vehicle,"" said Del. Harry R. Purkey, R-Virginia Beach. ""If I thought for a moment that this would be the final version, I would have some reservations about passing it.""\ Despite the contention that it is a procedural tool, business lobbyists rushed to the impromptu Finance Committee meeting to rail against it.\ ""This is the single most ill considered, anti-business piece of legislation to come before this body in my 20 years,"" said Steve Haner, a spokesman for the Virginia Chamber of Commerce.\ Manufacturers, airlines and phone companies said that the bill, which supporters say would raise $561 million over two years, would handcuff businesses.\ ""These are not handouts, these are not tax breaks,"" said Brett Vassey, president of the Virginia Manufacturing Association. ""They are basic fundamental requirements for businesses to be competitive in this environment.""\ The reintroduction of Hamilton's bill came as a shock to some who have argued that the measure has unintended consequences.\ ""Some of us were expecting a different approach because of the conversations we've had,"" Haner said. ""We really are a little surprised that we're seeing exactly the same bill.""\ BUDGET BREAKDOWN: DAY 1\ THE GOVERNOR\ Submits the same budget plan he presented to the General Assembly in December, saying it is a good starting point for compromise.\ THE SENATE\ Changes its budget proposal to eliminate an increase in the tax on gasoline, but left in place an increase in the sales tax and modifications to the income tax.\ THE HOUSE\ Quits for the day when Democrats and Republicans failed to fast- track revenue raising legislation.\ WHAT NOW?\ * The Senate will not meet again until Friday.\ * The House must resolve its procedural fight before it can resume its battle with the Senate and the governor.\ WARNER ON THE RADIO\ * Gov.

WASHINGTON AND THE WORLD
\
President Bush praised an accord that will bring cleaner air and improved visibility to Arizona's Grand Canyon as he began a campaign-style swing throught the West. Bush took part in a ceremony on the canyon's South Rim celebrating the pact between government, industry and environmental groups that will sharply reduce emissions from a nearby power plant. ``We don't see smog today, but sometimes fumes obscure this lovely view,'' Bush said. ``We're here to say today `no more.' '' Bush - accused by some environmentalists of not doing enough to protect the environment - defended his policies: ``We're making progress. ... You can't respond to the extremes.'' Other stops on the three-day trip: Utah, Oregon, California and Illinois. CAMPAIGN FILING: Nebraska Sen. Robert Kerrey took the first step toward entering the race for the Democratic presidential nomination by filing papers to form a ``Kerrey for President'' campaign committee. The Federal Election Commission filing allows him to start raising and spending presidential campaign funds. Kerrey - a liberal former governor and Vietnam War hero - is expected to declare his candidacy Sept. 30 in his hometown of Lincoln. Major Democrats in the race: ex-Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. A new poll suggested if Wilder were the nominee he would overwhelmingly lose his home state to President Bush if the election were held today. The survey by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research of 803 registered voters found 72% of Virginians would vote for Bush over Wilder. It has a 3.5% margin of error. CUTLINE:KERREY: Ready for presidential run

OREGON GOP RACE: An interesting Senate primary season is shaping up for Democrats and Republicans in Oregon. Former Baptist minister Joe Lutz announced he'll again try to unseat Sen. Bob Packwood in the GOP primary. Lutz, a Eugene insurance salesman, mounted the only strong Republican challenge Packwood has faced in his four terms, garnering 42% of the vote in the 1986 primary. He said he plans to attack Packwood's support for abortion rights. Also seeking the GOP nomination: Medford lawyer John DeZell. Facing off in the Democratic primary: businessman Harry Lonsdale - who lost a close 1990 election to Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore. - and Rep. Les AuCoin.

GASOLINE TAX: House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., formally ditched his efforts to pass an unpopular 5-cents-per-gallon increase in the gas tax. Last summer, the die was cast when he pulled a $153.5 billion highway bill from floor debate rather than face the risk of being defeated on an issue for which he had lobbied. President Bush had threatened to veto the highway bill if the tax was attached. Foley said he would substitute a three-year extension of a 2.5-cent tax hike enacted as part of the 1990 budget agreement. The revenue goes to rebuilding roads and bridges.

98," With state budget surpluses gone and an unwillingness to raise taxes, many lawmakers are talking about borrowing money.\ Some are advocating issuing bonds for construction on college campuses. Others want to do the same for highways.\ State Sen. Bill Bolling, R-Hanover, plans to ask his colleagues to sign off on a more than $400 million bond package that would include money for new state parks, including one on the Middle Peninsula, and a host of other environmental measures.\ The bond proposal would pay for the following:\ * New state parks. One of those would be along the water on the Middle Peninsula, Bolling said, although the exact location has not yet been determined.\ * Upgraded sewage-treatment plants that dump less untreated waste into the James and other rivers.\ * Repairs on several dams and replacements of others.\ * The purchase of land to preserve open space.\ * The closing of old landfills.\ The park on the Middle Peninsula would have access to the bay or one of its tributaries. Beyond that, the initiative would help the Middle Peninsula as much as any other part of the state, Bolling said.\ ""We've got agricultural land, forests, rivers and streams and the bay,"" said Bolling, who heads a legislative advisory panel called the Commission on the Future of Virginia's Environment. ""And all of that will benefit from this.""\ Bolling said the state can afford to borrow the money and, with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget, bonds could help ease the blow to state services.\ Bolling could have a hard time selling his idea to budget writers in the Senate. As one of the few allies Gov. Jim Gilmore had in the Senate last session, Bolling squabbled with Senate leaders behind closed doors in an effort to keep the car-tax cut on schedule.\ QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\ What are your top three priorities in this General Assembly session?\ The adoption of a new state budget.\ Bond referendums for capital projects in the area of higher education and conservation and natural resources.\ I will sponsor a series of measures designed to enhance the commonwealth's ability to prevent and respond to potential terrorist attacks.\ What specifically do you want to accomplish for your district?\ Adopting a budget that avoids tax increases and directs available funds to priority areas such as education and public safety is important to the people of the 4th District and to all Virginians. In addition, the approval of a conservation and natural resources bond package that enables us to provide funding for key environmental initiatives, such as land conservation and the upgrade of wastewater treatment plants, is very important to the people of the Middle Peninsula.\ Should Hampton Roads voters be given the chance to increase local taxes or fees to generate money for transportation projects? If yes, do you favor an increase in the gas tax, an increase in the sales tax, placing tolls on some roads and bridges or some combination of those three? If no, how should the state find the money to fund expensive projects such as the Third Crossing?\ My support for regional tax referendums depends on the content of the legislation. While it is difficult to object to letting voters decide an issue of this nature, the enabling legislation needs to include the following specific provisions to receive my support.\ First, participation in the referendum must be optional and at the discretion of the local governing body of the involved localities.\ Second, the legislation has to require that the referendum be approved by a majority of the voters in each locality participating in the referendum.\ Third, the specific projects to be financed by the referendum and the specific fiscal impacts of the referendum must be clearly communicated to the voters.\ Fourth, any proposed tax increase must be discontinued when all of the projects identified in the referendum are completed.\ The state is facing roughly a $1 billion spending shortfall this year. Where should the state cut spending? Please be specific.\ We should approve no new government programs. We should limit any increases in spending for existing programs to the essential responsibilities of state government, i.e., education and public safety.\ All other areas of state government will be required to reduce their existing budgets substantially.\ Finally, we must consider the responsible use of alternative funding sources, such as the rainy day fund and general-obligation bonds to address the commonwealth's most pressing capitol needs.\ SEN.

Former Rep. John B. Anderson, R-Ill., was a presidential candidate in 1980.
\
WASHINGTON - Wide-ranging reasons can be advanced to support a rise in the federal gasoline tax to at least 50 cents a gallon. When I proposed it nine years ago as I began a campaign for the presidency, it was chiefly on the grounds of lessening our dependence on imported oil. The two oil shocks of the '70s were vivid reminders of the perils of that overdependence.
\
Just last December, according to the American Petroleum Institute, for the first time in nine years the USA is again importing more oil than it produces. It should not be difficult to convince patriotic Americans that we are a nation at risk if that situation continues.
\
The growing list of prominent Americans who support a gasoline tax includes former Presidents Ford and Carter, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Drew Lewis, co-chair of the National Economic Commission, the body that has the mission of coming up with deficit-reduction proposals by March 1.
\
Greenspan urges a gas tax to encourage conservation and help combat the trade deficit. The others are attracted to it more for its potential of producing as much as $50 billion in sorely needed revenues. But these objectives are closely related to our future economic security and well-being.
\
The hand-wringing over the baleful effects of the budget deficit on savings, investment, interest rates and prospects for future growth and prosperity has at least produced consensus in the political community that the time for action is now. Lacking is the political will to challenge the public with the idea that a gas tax would be their contribution to a more secure nation for themselves and their children. Let's put it in that context:
\
Do all of us want to have a share in helping to build a stronger and better-balanced economy? Do we want to have some part in creating a healthier environment? Do we want to show not only the producers of the OPEC cartel but the entire world that we are strong in our ability to take decisive actions to solve our problems now because we really care about the future?
\
With the mobilizing effect of courageous political leadership, the answer would be a resounding ``yes''!

100,"John Kraus has a new Toyota Prius V hybrid wagon that he's very fond of. He also has new Virginia tax on it that he's none too happy about. \Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, signed a new law last month that lowers the gas tax for everyone but slaps a $64-per-year fee on hybrid and electric car owners to help make up for what those drivers aren't paying at the pump. \""What's not to like about getting better than 40 miles per gallon of gas?"" asks Kraus. ""Oh, wait -- less revenue for Virginia. Well, excuse us for helping to reduce the nation's oil dependency."" \Legislation that would levy a fee or tax on greener wheels is now pending in Texas, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Arizona. A similar bill died in committee in Idaho. Washington state added a $100 registration fee in February for all-electric vehicles. \To some, it seems like crazy, conflicting policymaking. After all, even President Obama is telling consumers to use less gas and buy hybrid and electric vehicles. But policymakers argue it makes sense because gas taxes pay for highways -- and battery-powered vehicles use the roads, too. \""The good news is they use less gas,"" Virginia Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton says of hybrid and electric vehicles. ""The bad news is they have the same impact as a regular gasoline-powered car, yet provide little or no money for highway maintenance."" \It's a conundrum facing state legislatures: How to make up for the decline in gas tax revenue -- which is in part due to the increase in sales of hybrid and electric vehicles -- without unduly penalizing those who are doing their part for the environment. \Hybrid and electric vehicle sales are expected to increase by about 17% to 550,000 vehicles from 2012 through 2016, according to the automotive forecasting company ALG. But they made up only 3% of new vehicle sales last year, so are hardly the only gas-tax culprit. \State and federal gas tax revenues are also down because: \Federal and most state fuel taxes haven't been increased in years -- decades in some cases -- so inflation means those dollars have far less purchasing power today. \Gas taxes are typically a flat per-gallon amount that doesn't increase as the price of gasoline does. \People have been driving less since the recession. \Cars are far more fuel-efficient. \Massachusetts State Sen. Richard Moore, a Democrat who sponsored that state's pending legislation, says he proposed a sales tax exemption for electric vehicles and their chargers but wants those vehicles to be charged for miles traveled, too. \""We need to encourage purchase of alternative-fuel vehicles like electric and hybrid to help diversify the sources that power our transportation (and) reduce vehicle emissions for the benefit of the environment,"" Moore said in an e-mailed statement. But a miles-driven tax is needed for road and bridge upkeep, he says. \The Chesapeake Climate Action Network believes politics were at work when Virginia added the tax on hybrid and electric vehicles while lowering the gas tax. \""We don't normally work on transportation, but this was such a strong, clear attack on solutions to climate change that we thought we had to do something,"" says Beth Kemler, the group's Virginia state director. \In Indiana, Republican Rep. Randy Frye had a hybrid/electric vehicle tax amendment removed from a transportation bill so a group of legislators could study the issue this summer and get advice from experts on how the tax should be set. \""We don't want to overtax or undertax,"" says Frye. Hybrid and electric vehicles ""do use the roads, so they need to pay their fair share."" \Virginia tried a fairly novel approach to address the issue, which Connaughton says represented a complete overhaul of how the state collects revenue for transportation. And he says it was long overdue. \Most gas taxes are based on vehicle fuel economy when cars averaged about 10 miles per gallon. After calculating that the typical internal combustion-powered car contributes about $100 a year in gas taxes, McDonnell decided to raise the state sales tax from 5% to 5.3%, lower the overall gas tax rate from 17.5 to 10.5 cents a gallon and add the hybrid/electric tax. It was proposed at $100, but lowered to $64. \Kraus questions Virginia's move because it's a ""flat tax on investment in energy-efficient technology."" \""Gas taxes do more than just pay for roads,"" he says. ""Gas taxes also discourage gas consumption, which means less traffic, more use of public transit, and less demand for new roads."" \Connaughton says Virginia had no choice, and soon the rest of the country will have to follow with innovative ways to fund highways. After all, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials projects there will be an average gap of $14.7 billion a year in the money needed by the federal Highway Trust Fund and the money coming into it from 2015 through 2023. \The trust fund, which pays for transit, highway construction and maintenance and safety, gets 89% of its revenue from the federal fuel tax. \""There is obviously the concern this will discourage people from buying these types of vehicles; however, the fee is not excessive,"" Connaughton says. ""It is a necessary evil.""\Credit: Jayne O'Donnell, @JayneODonnell, USA TODAY"
101," Legislators live by two- and four-year election cycles. Fixing transit problems requires them to take a longer view.\ The debate over transportation will headline the coming legislative session, and the ideas are lined up bumper to bumper.\ The state must seek public-private partnerships. It must examine user fees. Tolls have merit. A more efficient state transportation department is a must. Amending the state constitution is up for discussion. Diverting existing taxes to highways is one answer. Increasing the gasoline tax is probably off the table. Then again, maybe not.\ Not for 20 years has the General Assembly prepared to undertake such a comprehensive look at its roads, bridges and mass-transit systems.\ It boils down to two broad questions: What's the best way to operate a road-building business? And how best to pay for it?\ The second question might get more attention than the first. Higher taxes aren't likely in the 2006 session, leading members of the Republican majority says. That's partly because the state has a healthy cash flow, and partly because legislators just raised nontransportation taxes in 2004.\ But if raising the gasoline tax is a hard sell for legislators who sign no-tax pledges, conservatives sound ready to embrace tolls and fees in some combination.\ Sen. Marty Williams, R-Newport News, will be in the thick of the debate as chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. He said legislators must find a solution that worked over the long haul.\ ""The only problem with the gas tax is that it doesn't keep pace with inflation,"" he said in response to a Daily Press survey. ""And there's that pesky little pledge too many of our members have signed. Whatever we do, we should make sure the revenue stream is sustainable.""\ Two Republicans -- Del. Harvey Morgan of Middlesex and Sen. Thomas K. Norment Jr. of James City -- are interested in a plan to put tolls on interstate highways. Former Gov. Gerald Baliles has advanced that as one way to come up with needed cash.\ Legislators should consider a slight increase in transportation- related fees, said Del. Phillip A. Hamilton, R-Newport News. Fees for driver's licenses, vehicle inspections and registrations should be on the table.\ Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, said legislators must first assess costs, then make better financing decisions.\ Apart from generating the money, legislators are expected to debate how best to protect it. Many Peninsula-area lawmakers support a constitutional ""lockbox"" for the transportation trust fund.\ Gov.-elect Tim Kaine says a lockbox of some sort is critical. In the past, state leaders have raided transportation money to pay for other needs, and that undermines public trust.\ Many members of the General Assembly want to see a greater reliance on public-private partnerships, and the local delegation is no exception.\ However, that approach can result in more tolls. Hamilton is among those Republicans who would consider leasing the tolling rights to private contractors who build and maintain new roads.\ In addition to financing, the operations side of transportation will also get attention.\ The Virginia Department of Transportation has boosted its record of completing projects on time and on budget, but Williams said legislators must continue to push for greater efficiency.\ He wants to take ""a hard look at VDOT"" to ensure that the state is spending its transportation money in the best possible way.\ There's so much to consider that some legislators are floating the idea of a special session for transportation, like the one that happened in 1986.\ Democratic Dels. Mamye BaCote of Newport News and Jeion Ward of Hampton said they'd be open to that.\ BaCote said that the state must develop a transportation policy for the next 20 years and that a special session would allow legislators to focus on that single issue. Ward said the debate might be too broad to consider in a regular session.\ ""The issue of funding transportation in the commonwealth,"" Ward said, ""should be seen in its entirety."" *\ STEERING TALK TO MONEY How should the General Assembly pay for upgrading Virginia's network of roads and bridges, while making investments in mass transit and rail? Are tax or fee increases needed?\ SEN. MARTY WILLIAMS, R-NEWPORT NEWS: ""I think a broad section of the public has taken the position that we are not going to begin to solve our transportation problems without additional revenue. Tolls are an excellent example of a user fee, as is the gas tax. The only problem with a gas tax is it doesn't keep pace with inflation, and there's that pesky little pledge too many of our members have signed.""\ SEN. FRED QUAYLE, R-CHESAPEAKE: ""A combination of tolls, fees, even gasoline tax increases need to be considered as methods of financing our transportation needs. In addition, the use of public- private partnerships should be used as much as possible. There is no credible method of financing that should be ignored.""\ DEL. MELANIE RAPP, R-YORK: ""As the governor-elect made clear during the course of his successful campaign, we first need to secure the monies already earmarked for transportation before looking to taxpayers for additional funding. In addition, I support continuing efforts similar to those enacted by the General Assembly last session, when we committed an additional $850 million to meet transportation needs.""\ DEL. JEION WARD, D-HAMPTON: ""We must identify short-term and long- range needs and determine the best means for funding.

The non-partisan group's analysis of all 50 states found, ""most state gas taxes are built to fail, and cannot generate sufficient transportation revenue today or in the long-term.""\According to the report, 36 states - including Virginia - rely exclusively on a fixed-rate per gallon tax.\Virginia's gas tax rate of 17.5 cents per gallon has remained static since mid-1986.\According to the study's data, only Alaska has gone longer than Virginia and Oklahoma since the last time the state's gas tax was increased.\The buying power of Virginia's gas tax revenue has declined 45 percent in the 25 years since the gas tax was last raised and it would take a 14.5 cent increase to return the rate to the previous level. But if that were to happen, the rate change would generate $580.3 million annually, the report stated.\""If every state updated its gas tax rate to match the level of purchasing power it had the last time it was raised, state gas tax revenues would be roughly $10 billion higher per year,"" the report stated.\To read the full report, go to itepnet.org.\HRT DOCUMENTS\About 50,000 pages of public documents are now available on HRT's website, www.gohrt.com, as part of a continued effort to improve transparency at the once-beleaguered transit agency.\So far, 694 documents have been posted on the Hampton Roads Transit website, according to Tom Holden, an HRT spokesman.

To the Editor:
\
These are tough economic times for Virginians. In a recession, we all need to stretch our money further, and having more money in our pockets to start with is one way to stretch our funds. Creigh Deeds, the Democratic candidate for governor, does not agree. Following Deeds' admission of his plan to raise taxes if elected governor, I looked at some data to see exactly how much Deeds would have to raise our taxes to meet his goal. Deeds' transportation plan, from the little information available, includes a $1 billion non-general fund tax increase for roads. Based on figures calculated by the Virginia Department of Taxation in the summer of 2008, $1 billion dollars would translate into a gas tax increase of at least 20 cents per gallon. Alternatively, or in addition to the gas tax increase, there could be a sales tax added to gasoline sales as well. The previous figure may seem daunting, but even more ominous is the fact that this prediction is likely overly-optimistic. The calculations were completed a year ago - since then, auto sales have drastically decreased and gas prices are much lower than the estimated $3.92 per gallon used in these calculations. Consequently, even a higher sales tax per gallon would be needed to create the same amount of revenue.
\
But you really can't be sure it will be just a gas tax increase or a gas sales tax as Deeds fails to disclose exactly how he would raise the $1 billion. Perhaps he will have to increase the gas tax, impose a sales tax on gasoline, and raise vehicle registration fees, or a combination of these.
\
Deeds must provide more details of his plan for solving Virginia's transportation needs. Virginians cannot elect someone who refuses to clearly state a plan for solving our transportation issues, especially a plan that is based on higher taxes. I don't believe raising taxes in a recession is the best way to generate revenues. Innovative ideas must be used to ensure that regressive taxes such as the gas tax aren't hitting low and middle income citizens at the worst possible time.
\
Even Deeds' fellow Democrats disagree with his tax raising proposals. Gov. Kaine has recognized the economic environment and did not include tax increases in his revenue proposals for the next General Assembly Session. Democratic State Sen. Ed Houck (17th District) criticized tax raising proposals in a recent email to constituents. Recently former Democratic Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder refused to endorse Deeds for governor, as he did not support raising taxes in a recession - the same stance he took nearly 20 years ago when he had to manage our state during tough economic times .
\
The bottom line is Deeds must be clear before the election on his tax raising proposals so citizens can add them up cast an informed ballot. There appears to be a great deal of buyer's remorse at the national level - Virginians deserve better!

104,"There are no Mayan predictions of doom for 2013 and there will be no 13/13/13 to follow last year's 12/12/12 -- those triple-digit oddities are gone for another century. But unless you suffer from triskaidekaphobia, in which case a shiver will run down your spine every time you see a calendar, there is plenty to look forward to in the coming 12 months.\There's another big election in November, and there will likely be another year of arguing about how to pay for highway improvements and repairs. There will be rocket launches at Wallops Island and an aircraft carrier launch in Newport News. Virginia will seat a new United States senator, and Hampton will look for a police chief. \Here's a look at what you can expect: \TRANSPORTATION \Transportation likely will continue to be a hot button topic as controversial mega projects at the Midtown/Downtown Tunnels and U.S. 460 move forward amid a deepening statewide funding crisis. \This month, the Virginia General Assembly could take up the issue of sustainable transportation funding in light of a looming 2017 deadline when all construction funds are expected to dry up along with the state's ability to match federal grants. Of course, since one of the main components of this argument is the need for new revenue, and with 2013 being an election year, there is also the very real possibility lawmakers will once again take a pass on the issue. \A long-awaited study on the merits of widening Interstate 64 from Hampton to Richmond -- the region's top highway priority -- is expected to be completed in coming weeks and could become a big issue for the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization, which will have to decide whether to put it into a project pipeline. \Subsidies that help operate Virginia's Amtrak passenger rail services end in October, and the state will have to make up the difference to keep the trains running. How the General Assembly will address the need for another new revenue stream is anyone's guess. \CRIME AND COURTS \A number of high-profile criminal trials are scheduled for 2013. \In Newport News, John Ragin is scheduled to stand trial late in the year in the stabbing deaths of his wife, Crystal Ragin, a 32-year-old Army sergeant at Fort Eustis, and her three children -- Sierra, 15; La'Kwan, 10, and Rasheed, 6. Ragin is charged with three counts of capital murder and one count of first-degree murder in the August 2011 deaths. \Fort Eustis soldier Jesse Evans' trial is expected this year. Evans is charged with involuntary manslaughter and DUI-related charges in the deaths of Christopher Newport University students Sierra Smith and Kimberley Brin. The Court of Appeals of Virginia must first decide whether Evans' blood alcohol level certificate can be used as evidence during the trial. \STATE GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS \Come November, Virginians will select their next governor. The presumptive GOP nominee is socially conservative Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who has made a name for himself over the past three years championing conservative causes and attacking the federal government on a host of issues. \Presumptive Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe is a former head of the Democratic National Committee with close personal ties to former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham-Clinton. Expect the negative ads to begin flying fast and furious long before the traditional Labor Day kick-off to the campaign season. \The 2013 General Assembly session, which begins Jan. 9, which could turn out to be as contentious as last year's edition. \Gov. Bob McDonnell, entering his final year in office, wants to index the state's gas tax and pass a K-12 education reform package that includes a raise for teachers and reforms to teacher tenure and evaluations. He'll have a couple of fights on his hands. McDonnell's fellow Republicans are leery of indexing gas tax, and Democrats don't want teacher raises tied to tenure reform legislation. \Democrats may push for Medicaid expansion in keeping with the federal health-care reform law, and in light of the shootings in Newtown, Conn., could look for stricter gun control. Both ideas are anathema to Republicans, who may seek to expand the state's concealed-carry laws into public schools. \Maybe the two sides can find middle ground on mental health care reform. \EDUCATION \School administrators will audit safety and security on campuses across the Peninsula following the Sandy Hook shootings. Local school districts have crisis plans and a wide range of measures in place - from security officers to threat assessment teams - that they will review to see if they can make improvements. In the wake of the tragedy, Gov. McDonnell called on lawmakers to have a ""reasonable"" discussion about allowing school officials to carry weapons on campus. \Declining enrollment will mean less state funding and smaller budgets for school systems in Newport News, Hampton, Poquoson and Surry County. \SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENT \A fight over Atlantic menhaden could ripple through the General Assembly as lawmakers must approve a management plan for this ""most important fish in the sea"" or face serious federal consequences. \The plan is to reduce commercial harvest of menhaden along the East Coast by 20 percent to help the stock rebuild from years of overfishing. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation plans to champion this plan, as well as $217 million for clean water budget amendments just proposed by Gov. McDonnell. \NASA's Curiosity rover/mobile lab will continue to scoop up the Martian surface, scouting for the building blocks of life. NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton played a key role in designing Curiosity's landing system, enabling it to soar through ""seven minutes of terror"" in the Martian atmosphere last summer to land with aplomb and barely a bump on the red planet. Langley will continue test flights to better measure air pollution, develop lighter-weight aircraft and advance ""green"" aviation. Late in the year, it will conduct a splash test using a full-size Orion space capsule. \Early in the year, the Wallops Flight Facility on the Eastern Shore will begin launching big rockets to resupply the international space station, opening a new chapter in the newly refurbished space port and Virginia's ambitions to become another ""space coast."" \Jefferson Lab will continue its $310 million renovation at its Newport News facility, doubling the energy of its particle accelerator. It will complete its $72 million Technology and Engineering Development Facility. \MILITARY \The U.S. military's pivot from the battlefields of Afghanistan to the home front will be evident in Hampton Roads. \With more service members leaving, transition-assistance offices at Fort Eustis and Naval Station Norfolk will continue to be busy, as they were in 2012. The Hampton VA Medical Center is bracing for an increased workload, whether it is treating unseen wounds like PTSD or reaching the area's homeless veterans. \Navy families may be waiting longer for their loved ones to come home. The length of deployments trended upward in 2012, and the six- or seven-month tour at sea may be a thing of the past, at least for the time being. \In Washington, all eyes will be on Senator-elect Tim Kaine, the newest member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He'll be replacing Jim Webb as Virginia's go-to guy in the Senate on military funding and policy. \MARITIME \The state will decide this year whether to turn over operations at Virginia's state-owned port terminals to a private company. \In 2012, Virginia received three offers to buy the operating rights at facilities in Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Warren County, as well as at a private container terminal in Portsmouth. \APM Terminals and Maher Terminals are still in the running for the long-term deal. A decision is expected in the spring. \Newport News Shipbuilding is scheduled to launch the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, the first of a new line of carriers. In late January the shipyard will attach the Ford's newly designed island. \In mid-March, shipyard workers lay the keel of the John Warner, a Virginia-class submarine named for the former Navy secretary and Virginia senator. \Shipyard management and its largest union, United Steelworkers Local 8888, will begin negotiating a new contract in January. The current contract expires in March. The steelworkers will be led by Arnold Outlaw, who was re-elected president in April 2012. \NEWPORT NEWS \The $72 million Apprentice School project should be completed by the fall. The downtown development includes an 80,000-square-foot school, 175 apartments, retail and a parking garage. \The City Council will choose a new city manager to replace Neil Morgan, who is retiring in May. It remains to be seen if there will be a nationwide search or if the city will promote from within. \The city expects to sign a development agreement with ex-NFL quarterback Aaron Brooks and Armada Hoffler for Brooks Crossing, a project along lower Jefferson Avenue in the Southeast Community. If successful, the development would include a grocery store, police precinct, bank, offices and a ""signature restaurant."" \HAMPTON \Fort Monroe enters 2013 in much the same way it began 2012 -- with the state and Army still negotiating the ownership transfer. With the value of disputed land continuing to delay the process, negotiations could still take months. \Hampton will look for a new police chief to replace Charles ""Chuck"" Jordan Jr., who resigned in mid-November after multiple investigations were launched looking into an undercover cigarette sting operated by the police division. \It will be a big year for unveiling new plans -- consulting firm Sasaki Associates, the National Park Service and a semi-public group called Hampton First are expected to complete new master plans for Fort Monroe, Phoebus, Buckroe and downtown. \WILLIAMSBURG-JAMES CITY COUNTY \James City County likely faces another year of uncertainty on its Board of Supervisors. After failing to nominate an interim supervisor for Powhatan District, the choice will likely wind up in the hands of the circuit judges of the 9th Circuit, as it did a year ago. \The Historic Triangle is awaiting a decision from the State Corporation Commission on Dominion Power's application to string a 500-kilovolt line above the James River. James City and Williamsburg, along with Colonial Williamsburg, the College of William and Mary, the National Park Service and a list of others, oppose the plan, preferring the cable to be underwater. Dominion says that idea is cost-prohibitive and claims the practice is extremely rare, however the company is in the process of running a 230-kilovolt line beneath the York River. \Williamsburg-James City County Schools is expected to develop a plan to return the James Blair central office site to a school. That decision is due in late summer. \YORK/POQUOSON \The Virginia Supreme Court may hear York County's appeal regarding aquaculture. The cases began when two York County residents, Greg Garrett and Anthony Bavuso, asserted they did not need permits to raise oysters because their homes were in zoning districts that allowed for agriculture or aquaculture. York County disagreed. \Budget issues for local government and schools in both York County and Poquoson will also be something to watch, especially as officials determine whether to give raises and how to pay for them. \ISLE OF WIGHT \As the long-awaited U.S. Route 460 bypass moves closer to fruition, Isle of Wight will renew its focus on wooing new companies to Windsor's Shirley T. Holland Intermodal Park. Touted as a linchpin in county economic development, the park hasn't had any new tenants brewing -- publicly, at least -- since Green Mountain Coffee Roasters opened this year. \The county will work with International Paper to recruit new industries and jobs to the company's repurposed Isle of Wight campus. \The Board of Supervisors will work to opt out of the U.S. Department of Justice's pre-clearance provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That will open the door for expanding the number of voting districts from five to seven, an idea that garnered public support during redistricting two years ago. \The doors will open on the county's new school, Georgie D. Tyler Middle School, next year. The facility will replace the dilapidated Windsor Middle School. \GLOUCESTER \Gloucester residents will see if 2013 brings better relations between the Board of Supervisors and School Board. \Members of the Board of Supervisors have repeatedly criticized decisions the School Board made over the design, location and amenities of a new middle school, sparking some ill will. Construction on the new school is expected to start in 2013. \Three supervisors are up for re-election: Carter Borden, John Northstein and Louise Theberge. There has been talk in Gloucester that former supervisor Teresa Altemus intends to run against Theberge in an at-large race. \In March, Brian and Shannon Gore are expected to stand trial on felony child abuse charges. The couple is accused of penning a daughter in a modified cage until Gloucester Sheriff's deputies and investigators stumbled upon the girl -- found naked, emaciated and covered in her own feces -- in April 2011 while searching the Gores' single-wide trailer in an unrelated investigation. \Daily Press reporters Jon Cawley, Ashley Kelly, Todd A. Wilson, Sarah Pawlowski, Tamara Dietrich, Hugh Lessig, Michael Welles Shapiro, Joe Lawlor, Robert Brauchle, Allison Williams and Matt Sabo, and Virginia Gazette editor Rusty Carter, contributed."
105,"Business and labor groups kicked off a week of dire warnings and noisy jackhammers to promote highway and bridge construction Monday, to overcome congressional reluctance to boost funding for the projects. \""If we don't do anything, nothing is going to happen,"" Thomas Donohue, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on a panel at the Newseum. ""All of us have got to go up and explain to our representatives that we're so glad to have them -- and we need the money, or we might not keep them."" \In the same vein, Laborers' International Union of North America announced Monday a $1million campaign in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan for radio ads and billboards to highlight the costs and safety perils of deteriorating highways and bridges. \The radio ad, featuring jackhammers, says the country doesn't need another bridge collapse like Interstate 35 in Minneapolis in 2007, which killed 13 people. Billboards say potholes cause injuries and prompt $80 billion in auto repairs. \""We're not trying to scare people -- we are trying to inform the American public,"" said Terry O'Sullivan, the union's general president. \Construction funding is urgent because the highway trust fund is projected to run out of money for new projects in August. \The size of the shortfall is uncertain, depending on construction spending and tax revenues. The Transportation Department projected in March a $700 million shortfall by September. But the American Road and Transportation Builders Association expects Congress will need to provide $16 billion to cover the shortfall. States are expected to halt or postpone projects at that point, which business and labor groups say would eliminate jobs and hurt the economy. \Even if lawmakers plug the shortfall of billions of dollars this year, a broad spectrum of business, labor and state governmental advocates are urging Congress to create a new funding source for highway and bridge construction that would last four or five years. A long-term bill is important because states must budget for projects months or years in advance. \To promote the need for repairs, advocates cite a study of Federal Highway Administration data that 63,000 bridges nationwide need repairs. \AAA, the automobile club, estimated that poorly maintained roads cost each motorist an extra $324 each year for repairs and operating costs. \Pete Ruane, CEO of American Road and Transportation Builders Association, said the funding solution can't be ""one of the mystery-meat proposals that are out there -- not one-off stuff, real money the states can plan on over a sustainable period of time."" \Funding is contentious because the highway trust fund has traditionally been funded by a gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, a rate set in 1993 that hasn't keep pace as cars became more fuel efficient. But raising the gas tax or overhauling the corporate-tax code -- as President Obama proposed instead -- is unlikely in an election year. \Major business and labor groups have endorsed a boost in the gas tax. \""Increasing the gas tax, however, is going to require some courage, which seems in short supply in Washington these days,"" Donohue said. \The week of advocacy coincided with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee planning a vote Thursday on a highway bill, but without deciding on additional funding. \--- \$324 \Average cost of vehicle repairs to each driver annually due to poorly maintained roads, according to AAA.\Credit: Bart Jansen, @ganjansen, USA TODAY"
106," WASHINGTON - From his perch on a key Senate subcommittee, Montana Sen. Max Baucus said he is in an ideal spot to get a lot of money for state transportation projects this year.\ In 1998, when Congress last portioned out money from the federal tax on gasoline, Montana got a 60 percent boost in funding -- a feat Baucus hopes to repeat this time around. Other states received 40 percent more on average.\ Baucus is the senior Democrat on the Transportation, Infrastructure and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The subcommittee divvies up federal gas tax dollars among the states, which use the money to build and improve roads and bridges and pay for mass transit.\ Although Congress is not expected to vote on a transportation bill until this fall, Baucus held hearings on the matter last summer and introduced a bill that would distribute federal money for the next six years.\ ""We have the only bill that's really going anywhere, at least at this point,"" Baucus said.\ Although Baucus said he is a strong supporter of Amtrak, he doesn't support dipping into the federal gas tax pot to keep it alive. The beleaguered railroad lives hand-to-mouth and company officials have threatened to shut it down this spring if they do not get $1.2 billion in additional funding this year.\ Only those programs that contribute gas taxes should get the money, Baucus said.\ Amtrak's Empire Builder line cuts across northern Montana, serving as a link to the Pacific Northwest for communities that don't have airports.\ ""The goal is to keep and support it and at the same time not cut back on highway funds,"" Baucus said. ""We'll find a way to save it.""\ Passing legislation that will help boost the nation's economy is also high on Baucus' priority list. Because he is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, he'll have a major say on what is finally presented to the Senate for a vote.\ Last month, Baucus unveiled his own proposal for stimulating the economy, a rival to President Bush's plan. Bush's plan would cost $674 billion over 10 years. Baucus' would cost $160 billion.\ More than half of the money in Bush's plan would be used to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends. Democrats complain Bush's plan favors the rich and will not recharge the economy quickly enough.\ Baucus said nearly half of his plan - or $75 billion -- would be spent erasing states' projected budget deficits in 2004 so they don't have to lay off employees, eliminate services and construction projects and raise property taxes. About $45 billion would be spent to eliminate the income tax for the first $3,000 of taxable wage income.\ ""We need quick, immediate and significant relief to the people who will actually spend the money and stimulate consumer demand,"" Baucus said.\ Getting disaster relief for Montana's drought-stricken farmers is also a high priority. The Senate is close to approving a $3.1 billion assistance package for all the nation's farmers, far less than the $6 billion the farmers are seeking.\ The Bush administration is demanding that spending for other agricultural programs be cut to pay for the assistance. Baucus and the farmers say the money should come from the same place that all other money given to those hurt by earthquakes and tornadoes comes from - the general fund.\ ""The White House is demanding offsets, which I think is cruel,"" Baucus said. ""Farm programs and disasters are entirely separate, there's no relationship.""\ Credit: Gannett News Service"
107," Auto trends\ Hybrid vehicles ... recently reached an all-time high penetration of the automobile market: 2.3 percent. Virginia ranks No. 2 in the nation - just behind California - in hybrid sales.\ But the recent sales glut is expected to slow down soon. Honda is discontinuing its hybrid Accord ... . And although more hybrid models are in the works, total hybrid sales by 2010 are not expected to exceed 800,000 - or less than 5 percent of all vehicles sold in the U.S.\ The Prius ... remains king of the molehill - principally because it announces its hybrid character more dramatically than other vehicles, and a majority of Prius owners buy them at least in part out of vanity: The No. 1 reason for buying a hybrid is that ""it makes a statement about me"" (not ""it makes a statement about the environment""). Financial incentives and the ability to drive in HOV lanes also account for much of the appeal of hybrids. But hybrids also carry a higher price that their better mileage might not recoup, and consumers are becoming aware of the trade-off.\ It's entirely possible that hybrids might one day dominate the domestic car market, especially if gas prices fly into the stratosphere. But it seems more likely they'll prove a transitional species between today's gas-guzzlers and microcars ... or another generation of vehicles that don't use internal combustion.\ Still: For now, at least, they're the new beefalo.\ - Richmond Times-Dispatch\ Raise gas tax for repairs\ ... The nation's transportation infrastructure is crumbling, as the Minneapolis bridge collapse tragically illustrated. A federal gas tax increase should be part of the solution. The tax, currently 18.3 cents a gallon, hasn't budged in 14 years.\ Minnesota Rep. James Oberstar ... proposed a 5-cent increase to establish a trust fund for repair and replacement of structurally deficient highway bridges.\ The tax increase would generate about $25 billion over three years and could be used only for bridges.\ The proposal was immediately rebuffed by the committee's senior Republican.\ A day later, President Bush quickly dismissed it. That's not much of a surprise, given Bush's vow to veto a 5-cent gas tax increase two years ago. But that vow came before a 40-year-old bridge with a nearly two-decade history of troubling inspection reports collapsed into the Mississippi River, killing at least eight.\ A gas tax cannot be discounted as a means of paying for the more than 70,000 bridges across the country, including some in Virginia, classified as structurally deficient.\ Engineers estimate that will cost more than $188 billion. ...\ Our highway infrastructure is dying from neglect and lack of appropriate funding. Bridge repair work that is expected to take at least a generation cannot be accomplished if pork project spending continues.\ Repair work will require fiscal responsibility and increased, dedicated revenue.\ A gas tax increase can supply the latter. Only Congress can supply the former.\ - Roanoke Times\ Second thoughts on fees\ ... It's looking more and more like Gov. Tim Kaine and the legislature overextended when they raised $65 million for transportation - and promoted driver safety as a byproduct - by imposing fees on bad drivers.\ If lawmakers wanted to promote safety, then they should have given more serious thought to the effectiveness of doing so by hiking fines ... .\ And if they wanted to raise money for transportation, a 1-1/2- cent increase in the gasoline tax would more than replace the fee revenue.\ There's more rationale than the architects get credit for in asking people who tie up traffic by their bad driving to bear a higher financial burden for clogged roads.\ But several years of experience with bad driver fees in Texas and Michigan adds to a growing sense that the plan wasn't carefully vetted. No one seems quite able to prove claims that road safety has improved in states with similar fees. And officials in both Texas and Michigan describe an unintended consequence, courts clogged with unpaid fines. ...\ A legal challenge to the Virginia fees, brought by an 81-year- old Roanoke woman, fined after she allegedly ran a red light and caused an accident, illuminates the predicament. Her fine exceeds her monthly income, an action so punitive as to invite disrespect for the law. ...\ Anecdotal evidence suggests that plenty of citizens will soon be driving illegally because their jobs depend on it. As the debate goes forward, lawmakers ought to consider separating the two goals. Then they can ask, is there a better way to promote driver safety?\ For sure, there's a simpler way to raise revenue.\ - The Virginian-Pilot"
108,"Get over it\Some readers seem to be concerned about ""global warming"" lately. The truth is that, geologically, the Earth has been going through warming and cooling periods for way longer than humans have been around to observe it. \I find it a little presumptuous to assume that mankind has so much effect on the planet. \The Guardian, that noble publication that assists traitors, reported that of 12,000 climate scientists 97 percent agreed that climate change was due to human influence. Why not just say that 100 percent of 11,640 agree? There are way more climatologists than a cabal of 12,000 that associate to agree. \Don't get me wrong, we'd all like clean water and air, but to penalize this country's citizens to the exclusion of China, India, Russia and all of the developing nations that don't give a hoot about the environment is fiscal suicide. \The whole notion is only used as a cudgel to get people to behave as you wish they would. \So go ahead and buy that home at the beach, life is short, just be prepared to vacate when the ocean decides to take it back. \A.S.Kenley \Hampton \Well-deserved \Your editors' grant of ""thorns"" to General Assembly members who voted to eliminate the $64 tax on hybrid vehicles rang a chord with me. While I strongly supported Gov. Bob McDonnell and legislators in legislating a long-ignored need for transportation improvements, I objected just as strongly the way the legislation is funded. \Still do. \While the tax on hybrids is significant, more in principle than in substance, it pales compared to the essence of eliminating the gas tax, which gives thousands (millions?) of out-of-state drivers a free ride on Virginia's highways. Also, the inequities in the funding formula, not subjected to critical analysis for 30-plus years, remains an issue. \The gas tax must be revisited and so should the funding formula. However, the likelihood of this happening is slim. As my senator, Tommy Norment, says, ""it would start a civil war."" There's something wrong with that. \Joe Mann \James City County \Litter bugs \Even those of us who love the snow and cold are tired of being cooped up inside and are wondering if spring is actually going to arrive. \May I be the first to warn everyone that melting snow has unearthed unsightly highways littered with trash? I can't remember seeing so much litter along back roads and major routes alike. \What happened to those civic groups who claimed sections of highways and dutifully cleared the trash leaving the beauty of nature for us all to enjoy? I applauded their efforts but obviously they were no match for average citizens who simply open their car window and so rudely rid themselves of garbage. \Wendy Barrick \Poquoson"

The president vetoed product liability legislation that had passed Congress with broad bipartisan support (``Limits on awards on lawsuits vetoed,'' News, Friday). Unfortunately for the president, many saw the White House's ploy for what it was, a bow to America's trial lawyers, who have funneled millions of dollars into the coffers of the Democratic National Committee and the president's own campaign. Ironically, just last week the leadership of the DNC attacked pro-gun lawmakers and accused them of being ``in the pocket'' of the National Rifle Association for accepting NRA contributions and urged them to send the money back and reject its extremist agenda.

Oil shortage a windfall
\
Rising fuel costs remain in the headlines (``GOP set for gas tax, wage battle,'' News, Monday). Several reasons have been given, such as the hard winter in the North. Several statements in regard to the duration of high prices well into the summertime lead me to believe that the prices are artificial in nature and are due primarily to heavy market speculation on oil futures. The market once again has provided short-term investors a windfall while penalizing the majority.
\
What is more important? Continuing with an environment where the speculative short-term investors are rewarded for creating market turmoil? This environment rewards predatory investment and barbaric treatment of the employee through unnecessary downsizing and destabilizes core U.S. corporations. Or creating an environment where stability and long-term investment are encouraged?

Manufacturers beware
\
A recent ruling by a federal judge allowing victims of violent criminals to sue makers of guns that may have been used in the crime is an outrage. By this twisted reasoning, automakers may be held liable for drunken drivers when a death or injury involves one of their cars, or clothing manufacturers may be liable because the perpetrator of a criminal act wore their jeans or underwear while committing a crime.
\
If we do not soon get a grip on reality, we will drive out of business the makers of all products that could possibly be misused to commit a crime. That would result from their fear of being sued because some sociopathic idiot committed a crime with their product.

Clinton's `mad cow' problem
\
Does President Clinton have ``mad cow'' disease? We already raise cattle on marginal land that should be left in a natural state, and now Clinton wants to allow ranchers to graze cattle on environmentally sensitive land so they can make a higher profit (``$50 million cattle buy aims to help ranchers,'' News, Wednesday). We are cutting back on beef consumption because we are trying to save our health. That should not lead to a sacrifice of the environment to save marginal ranchers.

I propose that all environmental organizations ask their members to boycott beef, lamb and mutton until the ranchers/hunters/farmers stop killing native wildlife that either competes with or allegedly preys on livestock and until grazing policy is changed to protect our public lands.

You can have a ball at malls
\
I personally visit over 100 malls nationwide per year, having one of the world's largest retailers of fine ladies' and men's clothing as a client. The basis of your story last week regarding the death in general of America's malls was unfounded and misrepresented the truth (``Malls are like, totally uncool, say hip teens'' News Cover Story, Wednesday).
\
Each week I see early-morning mall-walkers, retirees, business people and moms and dads shelling out the bucks all across America. Right alongside them are those ``pesky'' teen-agers you referred to as having vacated every mall in the world due to the ``uncoolness'' of shopping where their parents shop.
\
In reality, not only do these young people shop at malls, but many are employed there. On payday they dump large portions of their paychecks right back into, you guessed it, The Mall.
\
In case you haven't noticed, this is a huge country that thrives on the entire mall experience. But don't take my word for it. Just take a drive into Anytown, USA, and notice the millions of dollars in construction projects for new malls.
\
Maybe you should research a little deeper the next time you decide to condemn something as near and dear to the American people, including teen-agers, as shopping malls.

110," RIGHT HEART, WRONG JOB\ The director of the state's Department of Environmental Quality announced his resignation the other day. Let's hope the move does not come too late for the environment.\ Gov. George Allen announced the resignation of Peter W. Schmidt, who leaves behind a far greater legacy for cutting staff in the department than for anything he may have done for the state's environmental quality. Whether that says Allen is soft on environmental protection or has given more importance to reducing the size of state government is anyone's guess.\ During Schmidt's tenure, the agency moved to relax regulations governing air and water quality at the same time that it reduced the agency staff from more than 800 to fewer than 700. As for the quality of the environment, some observers say it has suffered because of concessions made to industry over the needs of the environment.\ Joseph Maroon, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told reporters that Schmidt may have had his heart in the right place, but that he was in the wrong job.\ ""He presided over an agency at a time when its own staff in many cases feared for their own jobs if they stood up for the environment,"" Maroon said.\ Meanwhile, the health of a number of stretches of major Virginia rivers, including the James, continues to be impaired. A DEQ list of dirty waters passed along recently to local health officials includes a 20-mile stretch of the James in the Lynchburg area.\ A recent story reported that local health officials are trying to decide how to inform the public about the risks of swimming in contaminated waters. Given the effort that has gone into cleaning up the James River in the past two decades, it seems incredible that portions of it could be contaminated to the point that it's unfit for swimming.\ Should Schmidt be held responsible for that? Or should the responsibility go to the top - to the governor?\ Identifying those sources of pollution and prescribing a program for cleaning them up ought to be a top priority for Thomas L. Hopkins, the deputy secretary for natural resources who has been named by the governor to replace Schmidt at DEQ.\ - The News and Advance, Lynchburg\ MAKE PITCH FOR STAFFORD\ Virginia could blow its chance to get a major league baseball team unless the Allen administration starts pitching for Stafford County.\ A search for a stadium site is under way because a group of investors is hoping to buy the Houston Astros or another National League team and move it to northern Virginia. To assist in that effort, the Virginia Baseball Stadium Authority wants localities to submit stadium site proposals by June 17.\ Fairfax and Loudoun counties have scrapped plans to participate, and Arlington is touting a site that's too close to National Airport.\ Stafford County, meanwhile, has a suitable site adjacent to Interstate 95 and only 28 miles south of the Capital Beltway.\ Skeptics say that site is ""too distant."" Those people myopically see the District of Columbia as the center of the universe, with places like Springfield and Arlington in nearby orbits. They are people of limited vision whose astronomy texts aren't up to date regarding the latest patterns of economic evolution in Virginia.\ - The Free Lance-Star, Fredericksburg\ GAS TAX TRUTH\ Even as the House was passing its bill suspending its repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax increase until the year's end, Rep. Gerald Solomon was celebrating its salubrious effect on his largely rural upstate New York constituents. Solomon says that many of his neighbors have to drive 100 miles each working day, about 25,000 miles a year. They will not save much - a dollar a week, if you do the math. Divide 25,000 miles by 21.48, the average fuel efficiency for passenger cars, and you get 1,164 gallons. Multiply that by 4.3 cents and the annual saving is $50.05.\ - The New York Times\ NO RIGHT TO EUTHANASIA\ Something ominous is happening in the medical profession. Scores, if not hundreds, of physicians and nurses are becoming convinced that they have the right to decide who shall live and who shall die.\ This is a strange and sinister turn of events. Because for nearly 2,000 years, those who dedicate themselves to the healing arts have looked to the Hippocratic oath as a model for the ethical practice of medicine. Part of that time-honored oath states: ""I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.""\ These ancient words sound hollow in light of the results of a recent survey of medical professionals. Twenty percent of intensive care nurses responding to the survey admitted hastening the deaths of terminally ill people, sometimes without the knowledge of doctors, families or the patients themselves.\ In other words, the nurses took it upon themselves to decide who should live and who should die.\ Most claimed they did it out of compassion for the patient. They wanted to see an end to what they termed needless suffering.\ It's time for the Supreme Court to make it clear that euthanasia is not a constitutional right. No physician or nurse has the right to prescribe - or administer - a lethal dose of any drug. No medical professional has the right to decide who will live and who will die.\ If the court refuses to rule, it is likely that euthanasia will become as common as sniffles and runny noses.\ And if it does, watch out. The life they take may be your own.\ - The Daily Times, Farmington, N.M.\ ROAD MAP FOR DAMAGES\ Middle-class workers all over the nation are holding a prayer vigil for the unfortunate Alabama doctor whose dreams of early retirement were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.\ On May 20, the heartless justices reversed a $2 million punitive damage award the doctor had received when his brand-new BMW was secretly repainted after shipping damage. Oh, the humanity, the human suffering! A brand-new BMW, and a touch-up job! ...\ Stiff upper lip, Doc. The Supreme Court did the rest of us a huge favor: It gave judges nationwide guidelines on determining damage awards. ...\ Congress has tried but failed to agree on federal limits for punitive damages awards, and rightly so. Damages vary immensely among plaintiffs, as does the behavior by defendants that causes them.\ The Supreme Court road map for the nation's courts is a sensible approach.\ - Springfield (Mo.) News-Leader\ TOO HIGH A PRICE\ Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, has proposed significant steps forward in the fight against underage smoking. Considering the source, the self-imposed restrictions the company called for are not just reasonable, but radical.\ But this gift comes not bedecked in ribbons, but with very large strings attached.\ The biggest string is the company's insistence that it will adopt its proposals only if the Food and Drug Administration is never allowed to regulate tobacco products. Though tobacco critics contend that cigarettes are simply a delivery system for the drug nicotine - which comes under FDA regulation - the agency has no jurisdiction over cigarettes.\ FDA regulation of cigarettes is key not only to prevent underage smoking, which brings the industry an estimated $2 billion each year, but also to limit the damage tobacco companies do to the public health while raking in $45 billion annually.\ Philip Morris is asking too high a price for the promise of what is simply responsible behavior.\ - Springfield (Ohio) News-Sun\ GOP PLAN REASONABLE\ What would Americans think of a 1997 federal budget plan written to achieve the following goals?\ * Balances the budget in six years.\ * Over the same time frame, increases Medicare spending from $5,200 per eligible person today to $7,000, while protecting the popular Medicare system's solvency until the year 2008.\ * Boosts spending on Medicaid - the principle medical program for the poor - from $99 billion today to $145 billion in 2002, while also preserving that program.\ * Increases welfare spending from $83 billion now to $105 billion by 2006.\ * Hikes spending on Superfund cleanup sites by $700 million.\ * Adds $2.85 billion to clean water projects and ups spending on national parks.\ * Cuts taxes and encourages more savings.\ To be sure, there are offsets to pay for the goodies. This is done by hammering federal waste, including:\ * Axing the departments of Commerce and Energy.\ * Shutting off subsidies and closing tax loopholes that benefit large, profitable corporations.\ * Withdrawing funding for the Education Department's politically correct Goals 2000 program, the Americorps ""volunteer"" program that costs taxpayers $30,000 per volunteer and a host of other costly programs.\ Most voters ought to be delighted with this plan. After all, it satisfies the nation's essential domestic needs, balances the budget, reduces tax burdens and scraps much wasteful spending. It is, in fact, the budget blueprint working its way through the GOP-led Congress - and, sadly, it has no chance of ever becoming law.\ President Clinton has already made clear that when the measures come to him in the form of appropriation bills later in the year, he will veto them just as he did last year when he shut down the government and blamed it on Congress.\ Clinton and his leftist allies are winding up their propaganda machine to label GOP spending increases as ""drastic cuts,"" Republicans as ""extremists"" and the White House's big-spending proposals, which fail to balance the budget in six years or cut taxes significantly, as a model of compassion and restraint.\ If one defines ""compassion"" as bankrupting the very programs that most help the elderly, the poor and the vulnerable, then they could be right.\ - The Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle"
111,"Politics; See related story: 02A\ WASHINGTON -- With a jab at the power of ""Big Oil,"" Vice President Gore will propose reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil by providing tax credits for consumers who buy energy-efficient cars and incentives to companies that upgrade power plants and factories.\ Gore's plan will be outlined in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia. It is designed to show the Democratic presidential candidate as concerned both about energy prices and environmental protection while portraying Texas Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican opponent and a former oilman, as a captive of the energy industry.\ ""The entrenched interests want to protect the status quo, and the apologists for these interests say that we simply cannot have a clean environment and affordable energy at the same time,"" Gore spokesman Chris Lehane says. ""They say we can't do this. Al Gore says we can.""\ The speech, on the third week of Gore's ""progress and prosperity tour,"" comes as both campaigns are angling to deflect voter ire about high gasoline prices. Gore has suggested that major oil companies have engaged in price-gouging. Bush has criticized the Clinton-Gore administration for failing to use diplomacy to convince other countries to pump more oil.\ ""After eight years of no leadership, no national energy policy, Al Gore is now offering nothing new,"" Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer says. ""The only consistent energy policy Al Gore has proposed is higher prices and higher taxes,"" citing Gore's support for a 4.3-cent increase in the federal gas tax in 1993 and passages in his book, Earth in the Balance.\ Gore aides refused to provide a price tag for the new plan. But they described it as more ambitious and more expensive than the Clinton administration's five-year, $4 billion proposal to increase energy efficiency and address global warming. That plan, unveiled in 1998 and revamped in 1999, hasn't been enacted by Congress.\ Gore will propose:\ * Tax credits to help consumers and small businesses purchase cars, trucks and homes that include new energy-efficient technologies, such as a hybrid car that runs both on gasoline and electricity.\ * Grants and credits to upgrade power plants and factories to be more energy efficient and environmentally clean.\ * A federal fund to help states and cities develop alternative sources of transportation such as light rail, high-speed rail links and cleaner, safer buses.\ * Incentives to encourage private investment in new environmental and energy-efficient technologies. The program would offer to share some of the risk with venture capitalists for funding groundbreaking research and development.\ Aides say Gore will describe his first big goal as reducing the ""stranglehold"" major oil companies have on the nation's economy by doing more to develop clean, affordable and reliable energy in the USA and by using energy more efficiently. He'll call that goal the long-term solution to the immediate problem of high gas prices in the Philadelphia speech Tuesday and one in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday.\ Gore is expected to outline other major goals as well. These include: reducing the incidence of asthma in children and respiratory diseases in seniors tied to polluted air; forming partnerships with particular industries to reduce pollution, save energy and create jobs; addressing the threat posed by global warming and climate change; and preventing future power brownouts by increasing the reliability of power grids in the USA.\ While the environment has been one of Gore's signature issues for more than a decade, the Bush spokesman criticized him for failing to take a stand on a controversy that has pitted environmental concerns against energy production. Bush last week said he opposed breaching four dams in the Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest that are blamed by scientists for a sharp decline in salmon. ""That would take away a healthy source of domestic production"" of energy, Fleischer said, asking of Gore. ""Why won't he take a stand?""\ Gore says if elected he would convene an environmental summit on salmon."
112," Senate gas tax refund: the thought counts\ In the General Assembly, Senate Bill 708 contains a provision to rebate the proposed 5 percent wholesale gas tax. The refund mechanism is being ridiculed by members of the House of Delegates, and others, as being unduly cumbersome. Del. Vince Callahan calls it ""one of the most bizarre proposals I've seen down here in years."" Del. Leo Wardrup says, ""If you tried very hard to design something more cumbersome, you'd be hard-pressed to do it.""\ Indeed, the mechanism is cumbersome and probably unworkable. Who is really going to save their gas receipts and submit them twice a year to Richmond for refund of the gas tax?\ But this misses the point of the proposal. Senators understand that the impact of this additional regressive tax on lower- and middle-income taxpayers is significant. It is important to relieve the impact on those least able to pay. Unfortunately, the mechanism chosen to accomplish this objective is inappropriate.\ Data compiled by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy on the effects of the Virginia Tax Reform Act of 2004 confirm the extent to which the commonwealth's tax system is unfair to the poorest families. Families in the two lowest quintiles (those with annual incomes less than $34,000) pay a significantly higher percentage of their total income in sales tax, property tax and income tax combined than those in the highest two quintiles. The 2004 law aggravated this condition. The proposed 5 percent wholesale tax on gasoline would worsen it further still.\ A much more sensible approach would be to create a targeted income tax credit to offset the gas tax. A credit of $100 per taxpayer, phased out for incomes between $35,000 and $50,000, would achieve the objective with the greatest efficiency.\ Let's support the intention of the Senate to address the regressive effect of this tax, but let's do so in a more efficient way.\ David Jarman\ Williamsburg *\ Downside of SOLs\ Many people believe that Virginia's Standards of Learning play an important role in education. A clear majority of Virginians think SOL scores are an indicator of school performance.\ While many people believe SOLs are a positive factor, I believe that they have a negative impact. Why do we learn it? Because it's on the SOL. Why is it taught? Because it's on the SOL. That seems to be the basis of everything taught in school.\ One reason SOLs have a negative impact is that not all students test well. There should be another way to test a student's knowledge, such as projects, written papers and portfolios. Another reason is that SOL tests are not an adequate measure of student learning. Students who take average classes and students who take honors classes take the same SOL test. Obviously the SOL is supposed to be more challenging for average students and less challenging for honor students, which is not positive.\ The negative impact certainly outweighs the positive impact of Virginia SOLs, and they should be eliminated and a new form of assessing knowledge should be used.\ Catherine Byrd\ Newport News\ Responsibility first\ In response to the ""Safety first"" letter on March 2: It is not incumbent upon the city (or even the university) to provide ""alternate crossings"" beyond what currently exist at Christopher Newport University.\ In kindergarten, we learned how to safely cross the street. To do so in an ideal manner you should look; use the regulated, marked crosswalks; and cross only when the signal tells you to do so -- period. Not as soon as you hit the ""walk"" button, not whenever you decide to do so.\ If you decide to disobey the law and cross the street other than at the marked crosswalks (something known as ""jaywalking"" to adults - - a ticketable offense), we were told to look both ways for traffic and when it is clear to do so, only then should we proceed across the roadway.\ What this really boils down to is personal responsibility. In today's society we are quick to blame someone else -- anyone else -- for our problems and shortcomings. Yet many apparently lack the moral fiber to take responsibility for their own actions. The students attending CNU are supposed to be among the brightest in their class. If they cannot understand the minimum requirement for safely crossing the road, then perhaps CNU should re-look its acceptance standards, or at least ask prospective students if they actually know how to safely cross a street.\ Wes Krohn\ Newport News\ For independence\ After reading the letters to the editor for the past few months, I think I have this figured out: Republicans are war loving, take money from the poor and are idiots. Democrats are giving away the country, accept any excuse and are morons.\ We got what we deserve. Americans used to pride themselves on being independent, thinking for themselves and having the courage to say no when we needed to. Unfortunately the independent thinker in politics is dead. They have been replaced by a bunch of follow- party-line, listen-to-the-lobbyist, vote-how-you're-told sheep being led to the polls. We haven't voted for the best person in so long I wonder if we could anymore. We don't even vote for the lesser of two evils -- we aren't given that much of a choice.\ It's our own fault. We accept what we are given by the parties and don't demand anything better. We need to start.\ R.W. Smith\ Hampton\ Foreign languages\ I am writing in response to your editorial ""Go global"" (Feb. 5). I am a foreign language teacher in Williamsburg and, obviously, I support your suggestions to increase our attention to the study of languages. As you state, it is imperative in our world that we are able to communicate with others in languages other than English.\ Nevertheless, I take great exception to the criticism of language teaching, teachers and teaching methodology. As a world language teacher, I have continually made every effort to improve my language skills, to increase my cultural knowledge of the areas where the language is spoken and to improve my teaching skills. I have done this through travel, exchange programs and hosting students and teachers from other countries. To suggest that a native speaker of the language would be better qualified than I to teach the classes that I teach is to demean all that I do to bring the language alive and to create an interactive learning environment. There is much more to language learning and language teaching than just speaking the language. If one need only speak a language in order to teach it, that would mean that anyone here in the United States would be qualified to teach English. I doubt that you would agree with that supposition.\ Suzan A. Griffin\ Williamsburg\ Share the cost\ James City County supervisors could take note of Chesapeake's method of preserving green space through mutually agreeable purchase. Thus, the cost is borne by all who enjoy it.\ At present, the county supervisors continue on their quest to force rural landowners to bear the cost. We are not wealthy people; none of us that I know of can live in one of the McMansions that are so attractive to Northern retirees. James City County is intent on stealing our family lands, which is akin to stealing another person's life savings.\ Let the cost be borne by all, not just the rural landowner.

113,"This week, the Editorial Board will address key issues as the campaign season ramps up with Labor Day. This is not an analysis of candidates' positions, but a set of benchmarks to help voters evaluate the men and women running office.\The series begins today with economic issues, which must frame the rest. Tuesday through Friday, we'll address transportation, education, energy and the environment, and lastly a miscellany of other issues.\DISCIPLINED SPENDING\The challenge to decision-makers is to impose discipline on the spending side of the state budget. Since 1998, spending on government operations has grown 80 percent - factoring in inflation and population growth, that's 23 percent more per state resident.\That is unsustainable. This year, the economy will sharpen budget writers' pens, but the risk is that spending will take off with the recovery. Be wary of candidates who promise new programs without specific plans for where the money will come from.\To find big efficiencies, we must look at big expenditures, and none is bigger than K-12 education. It was the biggest contributor to the run-up in spending: While enrollment grew 9 percent in the last decade, state spending on schools was up 35 percent - without commensurate gains in achievement or graduation rates. The standards that drive school funding are overdue for scrutiny and adjustment, to filter out costs and refocus spending on what delivers results.\This economy should force another long-overdue move: requiring state workers - like private ones - to share in the cost of their retirement, which takes a big bite out of the state budget (and local budgets, too).\ATTRACTIVE TAX RATES\The boon to Virginians from disciplined spending and management will be reduced pressure on income and sales taxes. Those two fund the lion's share of the state budget, and they come right out of the pockets of ordinary residents.\One way to alleviate pressure on general taxes is user fees, where appropriate. No less a conservative than Ronald Reagan was a fan of assigning the cost of a service, at least in part, to the people who consume it. One example is the gas tax, which should be raised (it's still set at its 1983 level) to pay for road projects.\But taxes must be considered from a broad economic perspective. What matters is the totality of taxes individuals and businesses pay, not just the rate for specific taxes. So tax increases in one segment should be offset by spending reductions and tax reductions elsewhere in the budget. This does not dictate a zero-sum, ""revenue-neutral"" approach, but the goal must be tax rates as low as compatible with essential obligations.\A PRO-BUSINESS CLIMATE\Low tax rates, disciplined spending and prudent management will help Virginia maintain its business-friendly environment. Aggressively nurturing that environment should be a priority for the men and women who win election in November.\The focus should be on attracting or expanding employers with potential for growth and well-paying jobs. The ingredients of a success will include the strategic use of incentives to draw businesses and facilitate expansions, a regulatory approach that balances the common and the corporate good, and being sure that our education system develops an effective work force at all levels."
114,"Increase sin taxes\Sylvia Moore's letter ""Tolls will further divide region,"" June 8, is another example of how folks are frustrated with our state government. Moore stated, ""We all use roads as trucks deliver goods and supplies to stores, offices and houses,"" hence all of us paying for tolls is redundant. I say no to tolls as well. Do we really need motorists to slow down and stop to pay a toll around here? And do you really want vacationers from out of state, who pour millions of dollars into our economy, to pay tolls?\May I offer a solution as to where to get the money to build roads and bridges without asking for tolls or raising state taxes? The Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. This state-run business had a record in annual gross sales for fiscal year 2007 in the amount of $607.4 million. Let's add 50 cents per bottle (just a hypothetical number) to help raise state funds for roads.\Let's increase the excise tax on cigarettes. Currently, Virginia ranks 48th among states with an excise tax of 30 cents. Compare that to New Jersey where smokers pay a $2.58 excise tax. Let's double the excise tax on a pack of smokes.\At least entertain the idea and have the accountants run the numbers, and I bet Virginia will have its funding for making Hampton Roads leaner and more accessible to the outside world, and relieve the choking congestion while we commute around our beautiful state.\Scott K. Tuck\Newport News\Make everyone pay\For road funding, user fees make little sense. Arguing in favor of user fees to pay for our roads, James V. Koch cites fees at Yellowstone National Park, saying he doesn't give it a second thought (""For road funding, user fees just make sense,"" June 14).\He should. To justify a 10-year extension of the 1996 Fee Demonstration Program for Yellowstone and the other national parks, the Bush administration's FY2004 budget proposal provided the following guideline for the imposition of user fees:\""In general, if the benefits accrue broadly to the public, then the program should be financed by taxes paid by the public. In contrast, if the benefits accrue to a limited number ... then the program should be financed by charges paid by the private beneficiaries.""\Toll advocates are trying to convince us that using the roads, bridges and tunnels is a matter of choice. We working stiffs find the prospect of paying a toll for the privilege of getting to work akin to slaves being asked to pay for their chains.\The roads, highways, bridges and tunnels that comprise our public transportation infrastructure are primal arteries essential to virtually every facet of our society. The choke-points and potholes created by our failure to keep up with commercial development and population concentration threaten the future of all of us. Our transportation infrastructure is not a local, state or regional challenge. It is a universal problem requiring universal funding for a universal solution.\Calvin A. Griffin\Yorktown\Raise the gas tax\The Daily Press has presented readers with various transportation funding plans recommended by prominent professionals and politicians. The plan by James V. Koch seems most practical (""For road funding, user fees just make sense,"" June 14). If a driver uses a highway or bridge-tunnel, then she or he is expected to pay a user fee for the upkeep.\My fellow citizens may not mind paying the fee so long as they get the requisite services. The question is: how to collect the fees. Tolls and gas tax are the answer.\However, there is a problem with tolls, especially at choke-points such as the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel. Tollbooths will involve construction cost, followed by a continuous maintenance and operations cost. Vehicles need to slow down at tollbooths, resulting in possible backups and accidents.\Alternatively, an increase in the gas tax is a more efficient way to collect fees. A modest increase in gas tax can fund transportation projects, reduce driving and enhance demand for mass transit.\The argument against a gas tax increase put forth by Gov. Tim Kaine and other politicians is that it will add further strain to the user's budget. The commonwealth's gas tax of 17.5 cents a gallon ranks lower than 41 other states, and has not increased during the past 20 years.\This is the time for our state elected officials to act. Be courageous and enact a state gas tax law for funding transportation projects. This appears to be an efficient way to collect funds with an added advantage of reducing demand for gas, lowering future crude oil prices and protecting our environment.\Kelwyn D'Souza\Director of The Eastern Seaboard Intermodal Transportation Applications Center (ESITAC),\Hampton University, Hampton\Why me?\Why will only some of us have to pay for road improvements? We live in Hampton, I work in Norfolk, and my wife works in Virginia Beach. We both cross the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel every working day.\My neighbor works in Williamsburg. So it looks like, if tolls are put on the bridges, I'm going to be paying for road improvements for him and everybody else who doesn't have to cross a bridge-tunnel every day. This does not make sense to me. Shouldn't all Virginians pay the same? Don't make me a Southsider.\Mike Hiltke\Hampton"

116," The Senate approved a $214 billion bill Thursday to upgrade the nation's highways and mass transit systems and bring tens of thousands of jobs to communities across the country.\ The giant bill also would crack down on drunken driving and preserve a program helping women and minorities win government construction contracts.\ It took two weeks for the Senate to hammer out the final version of the 800-page bill, as lawmakers made sure their states got a fair share of the huge pot and fought for money for covered bridges, ferries and levitated trains.\ ""It really gives a major boost not only to jobs, not only to the environment but really for quality life across the board,"" said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a chief architect of the legislation.\ ""This was a mountain to climb, and we're at the top."" The bill passed 96-4, sending it to the House for consideration. The only dissenting votes were from Wisconsin's two Democrats, Herbert Kohl and Russ Feingold, and Pennsylvania's two Republicans, Arlen Specter and Rick Santorum.\ House Republican leaders Thursday reached what Speaker Newt Gingrich said was the ""framework"" for the House version of the bill. Aides said they would go along with a Transportation Committee bill seeking $217 billion, $3 billion more than the Senate. Congress must get the completed bill to President Clinton before May 1, when the current short-term highway spending law expires.\ In the gallery for the final vote was Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who praised the Senate for doing a ""great job.""\ The legislation carves out $173 billion for highway construction and safety programs through 2003, up 38 percent from the six-year plan that ended last fall. Mass transit would get $41.3 billion, a 31 percent boost.\ Supporters said the bill could have a major impact on the economy, citing figures that every $1 billion in transportation spending creates 42,000 jobs.\ Reflecting the prospects of future budget surpluses and pressures to do something about the nation's crumbling infrastructure, the final bill was considerably more generous than legislation coming out of Senate committees last fall, with $26 billion more for highways and an additional $5 billion for mass transit.\ The new money in part will come from a decision that 4.3 cents of the federal gas tax previously reserved for reducing the budget deficit would go exclusively to transportation needs. Supporters insisted they could stay within budget caps by cutting other programs, although no one was specifying where those cuts would be made.\ The stage was set for a final vote Wednesday, when Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, agreed to come up with more money for seven states whose senators felt they lost out under new formulas for distributing highway funds.\  The Senate earlier agreed that each state should get back at least 91 percent of the money it pays into the federal highway trust fund.\ ""It is a long road, still, toward fairness - from our perspective, I emphasize - but this represents a step along the road,"" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said of the deal, which would give his state an additional $11 million a year."
117," For Ross Perot followers determined to make lemonade out of the lemon left them by their hero's withdrawal from the presidential race, here's an old idea that hasn't been going anywhere: Demand a balanced budget.\ Perot loyalists can even use the plan left behind by Perot, the one that calls for a 50-cent increase in the federal gas tax, higher alcohol and tobacco taxes and a 10-percent cut in government programs.\ It's hard to imagine a populist movement demanding higher taxes. But then it's impossible to imagine the United States continuing on its current fiscal course and surviving much into the 21st century as a healthy, dominant nation. We must pay off our debt and make the investments we need in our cities and in education, the environment, transportation and science.\ There are some who think this can be done without raising taxes, and they have dominated the political debate over the past 12 years, during which the national debt has quadrupled. Perot understood how big a hole that thinking has left America in, and he was ready with a program to dig the nation out.\ Maybe he dropped out of the presidential race because he didn't think Americans would accept such painful medicine. Maybe his followers can prove Perot wrong."
118,"THE NATION; Activists for environment and others say the price is too high\CHICAGO -- Sometime late this year, over the objections of environmentalists, residents and a federal judge, state road crews are likely to begin work on a 12.5-mile, $700 million extension of Interstate 355.\The eight-lane highway will eventually provide a speedy route around the western edge of the metro area, about 35 miles from downtown. Because it is a toll road being built without federal money, the state has been able to avoid federal regulations as smoothly as drivers are expected to one day circumnavigate the city.\Dozens of toll roads are being built nationwide. From the Suncoast Parkway near Tampa to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge across Puget Sound, to an extension of the Dulles Toll Road at Leesburg, Va., state and local governments and private contractors are turning to tolls to pay for new roads.\They are choosing toll-financed construction because it's simpler and faster. It also allows state and county officials to create partnerships with private builders on some of the most expensive construction projects on the books.\""Tolls have become the policy du jour to build new freeways,"" says Mike Truppa of the Environmental Law and Policy Center of the Midwest. ""With toll financing, states can dodge federal laws that would closer scrutinize construction.""\The most common way for a state or county to finance road construction since World War II has been through federal allocations of gas tax revenue and some state funds. The federal portion requires help from a member of Congress who had the clout to compete successfully for the funds. Using the federal money also means abiding by hundreds of stringent federal regulations, such as environmental impact statements.\Anti-sprawl groups and environmentalists have routinely used these federal rules and regulations to stop construction of roads or cause long delays. States have found that by avoiding federal money, they can avoid the politics and the protests.\Typically, a state will sell bonds to raise money to build a toll road. The bondholders are repaid, with interest, from toll collections. Nationwide, states and counties collected nearly $5 billion in tolls in 1998.\Toll roads account for 5,000 miles nationwide, including 6% of the 42,800 miles of interstate highway, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Most of the $64 billion in federal gas tax money collected in 1998 is being used to maintain and improve the nation's interstate highways, parts of which were completed 45 years ago.\Without toll financing, some experts suggest, few highways would be built these days.\""All of the money collected in gas taxes is barely enough to maintain the current system,"" says Neil Schuster of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association. ""The choice is often either a toll road or no road.""\Fast road in Florida\Lesley Blackner, a lawyer for the Sierra Club in Florida, has tried every way she knows to stop Suncoast Parkway, a toll road that will stretch from the Tampa airport 80 miles north through Citrus County, one of the least populated and most pristine areas of the state. She cites Suncoast Parkway as an example of a state's disdain for the federal regulatory process.\In late 1994, the Federal Highway Administration advised the state not to build a freeway through Citrus County with federal gas tax money because it would pass through environmentally sensitive areas. A year later, the state announced it had scrapped plans for a freeway and instead would build a turnpike with a toll.\""The turnpike authority feels it is not constrained. Nothing gets in its way,"" Blackner says. ""They just put a nice ribbon of concrete right through wetlands and pretty soon contractors are building subdivisions with one-acre lots and condos for retirees.""\The state says the toll road is essential. It will reduce congestion on state Route 19, which carries as many as 19,000 vehicles a day, or about 120% of its capacity, according to Michael Washburn of the Florida Department of Transportation.\Last year, a federal judge threw out the Sierra Club's lawsuit, which cited the turnpike as a threat to the environment, including the endangered Florida panther. Blackner expects her appeal to be rejected.\Earlier this month, Gov. Jeb Bush announced a road construction plan he calls Mobility 2000. It includes $47 million in seed money for construction of the final 26 miles of the toll road. About 54 miles have been completed.\Puget Sound squabble\In Washington state, authorities went a step further and hired a private contractor to build a bridge over Puget Sound to connect Tacoma to Gig Harbor on the Olympic Peninsula. The state says it could not afford the $500 million bridge, which will be built alongside 50-year-old Tacoma Narrows Bridge\Although the state will pay for improvements leading to the bridge ramps, the private firm, United Infrastructure Washington, will pay the cost of the bridge. It also will collect a $3 round-trip toll to recover its construction costs.\The state's role will be limited to regulating the private firm.\Richard Yasger, a Boeing software engineer who commutes across the existing bridge daily, says residents are incensed about the toll. Jim Metcalf of United Infrastructure Washington, says the state has gone out of its way to address criticism. It included a referendum on the November 1998 ballot asking residents who would use the bridge whether they would be willing to pay a toll. Fifty-three percent said they would.\Yasger, who heads the Peninsula Neighbors Association, lost a court bid last week to stop construction. A state judge dismissed the association's lawsuit, making it likely construction will begin by the end of the year. Yasger and the association will likely appeal, but Metcalf is confident the road has been cleared for the new toll bridge.\Reconsidering\The arrangement in Washington is not unique.\Private toll operators have built roads and bridges in Alabama, California, Michigan and Virginia after state and local authorities chose not to spend tax money on the roads. In Virginia, the Dulles Greenway extension of the Dulles Toll Road is regulated by the state, but it is privately owned and operated.\In a few places, privatization of toll roads is being reconsidered.\Lawmakers in California, the state widely credited with inventing the freeway, will hold a series of hearings this month in Sacramento on the privatization of toll roads. Four private toll roads have been built around the state. San Diego residents are protesting a fifth proposed private toll road, which is designed to allow traffic to skirt the metro area along its eastern edge.\In Illinois, after the acrimonious fight over the I-355 extension, the state toll authority is reconsidering the idea that toll roads are the best way to build highways.\Gov. George Ryan installed his former chief of staff, Tom Cuculich, as head of the Illinois State Highway Toll Authority, a quasi-governmental agency.\Cuculich has instructions to reconsider everything about toll roads, from the merits of privatization to the price at the tollbooth, where drivers throughout Illinois pay $1 million a day in tolls. His report is due this week.\""This is basically a chance to look at cost and consequences,"" Cuculich says. ""And it comes out of the sense of frustration the governor shares with the public over toll roads.""\TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE:\Highway funding\More than $107 billion was spent on U.S. highway construction in 1998.

PHOENIX - Nobody here is boasting about Phoenix being the USA's fastest-growing major metro area. They're too busy grappling with demands of the exploding population.
\
``When you continue growing at this rapid pace, it really stretches your ability to provide services,'' says the Regional Public Transportation Authority's G. Kenneth Driggs.
\
``I, for one, would be pleased to see growth simmer down,'' says Paul Glick, 76, who moved here from Maryland in 1982.
\
His gripe: traffic. In a recent traffic jam, Glick spotted a bumper sticker: ``Welcome to Arizona. Now go home.''
\
Metro Phoenix grew by 25.9 percent between 1980-86 to 1.9 million - the swiftest growth of any million-plus metro area.
\
The magnets: good weather and opportunities in a growing electronics industry.
\
Problems:
\
-Environment: Only Los Angeles and Denver have worse carbon monoxide pollution. Possible solutions: more buses and car pools.
\
-Water: Shortages loom, as farming and development tap the ground supply. The $4 billion Central Arizona Project diverts Colorado River water.
\
-Roads: Phoenix has the fewest miles of highway of any metro area. Voters approved a half-cent gas tax hike to build 230 miles of freeway.
\
Long known as aggressively pro-growth, Phoenix is tempering its view. ``We have taken a hard look at trying to provide controlled growth, to eliminate the downside effects,'' says Vice Mayor John Nelson.
\
Phoenix --is projected to grow to 3.2 million by 2000.

WASHINGTON/POLITICS
\
Health insurance reforms approved overwhelmingly by the House and Senate are bogged down in election-year gridlock, threatening to send Congress home for July Fourth with little to brag about.
\
That impasse, along with stalled efforts to raise the minimum wage and reduce the gas tax, have mired Congress' Republican leaders in the same frustration that the Democrat-controlled Congress faced in 1993 and 1994.
\
Then, the GOP minority was blocking the Democrats' initiatives. Now Republicans are unable to move legislation they know is popular with voters.
\
So little has been accomplished by the 104th Congress this year, ``it may set a record for the fewest bills passed by a Congress,'' says James Thurber, American University political scientist.
\
The average number of bills passed in one Congress over a two-year term is 650. Last year, the GOP Congress passed 28.
\
Republicans and Democrats are battling for election-year credit for health reforms, which polls show 80% of the public supports.
\
Both chambers voted for health reforms guaranteeing that workers who change jobs will be able to maintain coverage even if they change jobs or have chronic health problems.
\
But a House GOP plan to give tax breaks to people who save for medical emergencies has met fierce opposition from Democrats.
\
As GOP leader, Bob Dole was so frustrated when Democrats blocked his initiatives on health care and other issues, he moved up his departure from the Senate.
\
Now Democrats are testing the new Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., who warns: ``We're down to a very short fuse here.''
\
Frustration also is growing in House GOP ranks. Because of Democrat opposition to tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs), Republicans have proposed a ``demonstration project'' that would allow only a small group of people put money in MSAs.
\
But Democrats are resisting. They charge MSAs will only benefit the wealthy and drain the Treasury.
\
``This is such a phony issue,'' House Speaker Newt Gingrich insists. He describes MSAs as a private-sector plan that helps 40 million people. ``The liberals' basic argument is that it may be too popular.''
\
Nor has Congress closed a deal to lift the minimum wage in two stages by 1997. The first was supposed to raise the wage from $4.25 to $4.75 by July 4.
\
But Lott says the Senate won't even vote on the measure until July 8 -- and then only if the Democrats agree not to bring it up again should it be defeated. Democrats are balking.
\
Republicans are stymied on two fronts, Thurber says: ``They do not have a clear agenda. There's nothing like the Contract with America'' this election year. Second, he says, Democrats forced the GOP on the defensive about ``hot button items in the polls: Medicare, Medicaid, education and environment.''

WASHINGTON; See related story: 06A
\
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bob Dole was more than a little irritated as he stood before the Internal Revenue Service Building Tuesday, demanding to know when Democrats would allow a vote on repealing a portion of the gas tax.
\
``It's going to happen one of these days. Why not do it today?'' the Republican Senate leader asked at a news conference.
\
But Dole already knew the answer to his question: Tom Daschle.
\
Over the past year, Daschle, leader of the Senate Democrats, has emerged as the chief nemesis of Dole and Senate Republicans. Working with a minority band -- 47 Democrats to the 53 Republicans -- Daschle has set up roadblocks for Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, at every turn.
\
Tuesday, Daschle used Senate rules to ensure that Democrats got a vote on their plan to increase the minimum wage before Dole gets a vote on his plan to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax -- or anything else.
\
Furious Republicans such as Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah called the parliamentary jockeying ``pathetic'' and ``a two-bit game.'' But Daschle said he had ``no choice'' but to stall until the GOP allowed Democrats a vote.
\
As the battles heat up, no one seems more surprised at Daschle's performance than Senate Democrats themselves.
\
Daschle won his minority leader's job 15 months ago by just one vote when Democrats were still reeling from the GOP's 1994 landslide.
\
The South Dakotan, 48, was an unknown quantity then. He had spent eight years in the Senate but never chaired a committee or subcommittee. He was best known as protege of George Mitchell, D-Maine, then majority leader.
\
Half the Senate Democrats thought Daschle was too mild-mannered and inexperienced to stand up to an opponent like Dole. Others said uniting Democrats was impossible.
\
Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn joked at the time that Daschle would ``need an Army division and one Air Force wing to unite the Democrats.''
\
Now those doubts seem to have evaporated. Democrats have stood together on issues ranging from opposing the balanced-budget amendment and GOP reforms of Medicaid and Medicare to crusading for the minimum wage increase.
\
``Tom has done a very good job of developing consensus,'' says Democratic National Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, whom Daschle beat for the leadership post.
\
Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., no fan of the Democrat's delaying tactics, says he realized that Daschle was having an effect when Dole went to Daschle and complained that every time he tried to get a bill passed, it got loaded up and stalled with unrelated amendments.
\
According to Simpson, Daschle looked at the Senate majority leader and said, `` `Welcome to the Senate, Sen. Dole.' Boy, I never heard him talk like that before,'' Simpson says.
\
Daschle has worked in government most of his adult life. At the end of a three-year Air Force tour in 1972, he landed a Washington job as aide to South Dakota Sen. James Abourezk.
\
He served four House terms before winning his Senate seat in 1986.
\
Prairie-plain, Daschle often moves through Capitol Hill corridors unrecognized by lines of tourists looking for famous faces -- or at least a politician moving with a large retinue of aides.
\
But Daschle seems to like it that way. After winning his post, he vowed that his main job would be to ``consult with every major player in our caucus'' behind the scenes before going to the Senate floor or to reporters to talk about the issues.
\
He emphasizes that style in weekly strategy lunch sessions with Democrats, saying little until he hears everyone. ``Some people mistake listening for being very quiet. He listens,'' says Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt.
\
``He listens and brings people together. And he's not backing down.'' Daschle also is careful to let other, higher-profile members take the spotlight. He deferred to Massachusetts' Edward Kennedy to lead the fight for an increase in the minimum wage. Kennedy leads debate and news conferences; Daschle lines up votes.
\
Daschle sketched out the filibuster strategy that forced Dole to slow the Senate to a crawl. By blocking Senate action on a popular immigration reform bill, Dole finally conceded that he had no alternative but to satisfy Democrats and assure them that there would be a vote on the minimum wage at some point.
\
That maneuvering infuriated Republican leaders in both the House and Senate, who oppose the minimum wage increase.
\
Daschle is ``throwing sand in the gears'' of the Senate's legislative machine, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, complained on TV.
\
Armey has a point. As minority leader, Daschle's main role has been as an obstructionist. While Democrats seldom get the votes to pass their own legislation, Daschle usually can block Republican measures by holding together at least 41 Democrats -- the number needed to block ``cloture,'' which limits debate and guarantees a vote on the merits of the legislation.
\
Armey says Daschle is clearly waging warfare daily on behalf of President Clinton's re-election campaign. ``Can Bob Dole handle the obstructionism of Sen. Daschle?'' he asks. ``I don't know''
\
Daschle shrugs off the criticism, promising that Democrats ``absolutely'' will keep the pressure on, fine-tuning the strategy in weekly meetings with the White House as the campaign intensifies.
\
Increasing the minimum wage ``is only one piece of our (economic) security agenda along with health, pensions and crime control. And then there's education and the environment,'' he said in an interview.
\
That ability to focus and carefully sell the Democrats' agenda are two characteristics most often cited by senators on both sides of the aisle as reasons for Daschle's success as leader.
\
``He's certainly standing up for the liberal point of view in a very effective way,'' Hatch says.
\
To be sure, Daschle has benefited from low expectations. Mitchell, his predecessor, was considered a giant who helped engineer a Democratic takeover of the Senate when Ronald Reagan was president.
\
``That's part of the dynamic going on here. He was a back-bencher who everybody assumed couldn't fill the big shoes,'' says Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution.
\
But Daschle also benefited from Mitchell's example of judicious speech, Hess says.
\
Like Mitchell, he has a knack for making liberal positions sound moderate and reasonable, particularly for TV cameras and reporters, Hess says.
\
``His manner is relatively low-key. That can be effective in a town that's used to shouting.''

\
MENLO PARK, Calif. - People around the world envy us our wealth. They wish they could heat, air-condition, refrigerate, travel and do all the things that we do.
\
But now that a war in the oil-rich Middle East is upon us, some people - including USA TODAY's editorial board - are proposing that we trade those advantages for a national energy policy.
\
It won't work.
\
Wherever politicians have directed energy resources - as they have in Czechoslovakia, Poland and other nations - consumers have suffered.
\
Where energy markets have operated freely - as they have in the USA - energy has been cheap and abundant. The only energy problems we have suffered came about as a result of temporary but disastrous periods of energy controls and disappeared as soon as those controls were lifted.
\
President Carter's price controls in 1977 brought gas lines in 1979.
\
It's also wrong to say that U.S. energy is too cheap or that we use too much. Lower prices are good, not bad, and they'll keep falling if we don't get in the way.
\
The average cost of electricity and coal in real terms has fallen by more than a factor of five in the last 70 years and continues to fall. In the last 20 years, estimated coal and oil reserves have tripled and are expected to continue growing as new technologies uncover new supplies and add new efficiency.
\
As long as markets operate without hindrance, energy will grow cheaper and more plentiful than it is today.
\
Nor will an energy policy help the environment.
\
Alternative fuel technologies, according to emissions expert Don Stedman of the University of Denver, do not produce cleaner engines. Some actually increase pollutants.
\
Furthermore, an economy crippled by higher energy prices will be less able to deal with legitimate environmental challenges.
\
Wartime emotions have contributed to bumper-sticker thinking, leading many to use U.S. involvement in the war as justification for an energy policy.
\
We are not fighting this war to make oil cheaper. The fact that England, an oil-exporting country, is equally involved should have put such a simplistic notion to rest.
\
But nations, historically, have often done very stupid things while disconcerted by wars.
\
We can't afford to make that mistake.
\
We are in recession.
\
It would be very stupid to add the burden of a gas tax - the real goal of an energy policy - to the burdens already borne by financially strained U.S. taxpayers.
\
Would you rather have a gas tax? Or would you rather continue to heat, air- condition and travel as you do now?
\
The answer should be obvious.

123," Extremists threaten payday option\ The June 9 letter ""Cap 'misery',"" which argued for a 36 percent APR cap on payday loans, was not based on important facts. Payday loans are short-term, usually taken for only two weeks, not annual loans.\ A 390 percent APR on a payday loan is a nonsensical, disingenuous metric used by extremists to cloud the debate. To reach this number, a two-week loan would have to be ""rolled over"" 26 times.\ Extremists may hurt the very people they claim they're trying to help by advocating to eliminate an available credit option for the consumers they purport to represent. Nearly all banks and credit unions do not provide temporary credit through small-dollar, short- term loans.\ Cash advance stores provide reasonable Virginians with a well- regulated option, responsibly delivered for meeting unexpected expenses. Legislators should not take that option away from Virginians.\ Martin Ray\ District Director of Operations, Check 'n Go,\ Newport News\ True patriotism\ We should be prudent in the manner in which we apply our patriotism, remembering that patriotism is love of country, not love of government. While the former may be well deserved, the latter may not.\ You can be a patriot and still object to the government's actions. Our government has become so large and all-encompassing that authoritative management of its functions and operations has become impracticable, if not impossible.\ It is the same with our state and local governments as well. Their ever-increasing size has brought with it a self-serving arrogance that has resulted in their lies, their cheating, their hoodwinking, their evasiveness, their dishonesty and their unresponsiveness to all but their own internal fancies, as well as their totalitarianism, which has caused their injecting themselves into every facet of our lives and controlling our every action.\ They have become self-indulgent entities serving themselves, rather than serving the public.\ We have Frankensteins of our own making. Monsters that only we can ""unmake,"" by questioning their actions and their cliche-ridden pronouncements and demanding that they serve the desires of the majority and not the bleating demands of minority factions.\ Our only weapons are our voices and our votes.

As for using Huey helicopters in the failed Iranian hostage attempt, they were RH53D Sea Stallions with the only similarity being that both are rotary-wing aircraft.\ The one thing I do remember about the Carter presidency was high unemployment and an almost 20 percent interest rate. As for privatizing Social Security, maybe he would like the government to control 88 percent of his IRA.\ But Marshell is right about one thing. George Bush's amnesty immigration plan has got to go. See, the right and the left can agree on some things.\ Mike Batkins\ Carrollton\ Blame Williams\ Our governor, Tim Kaine, and elected state officials didn't have the guts to do what is needed in passing a statewide gas tax. The May 31 editorial ""Happy birthday,"" about how special interest groups' donations are influencing our politicians, was a great eye opener. The May 31 editorial ""Another 'no',"" about Poquoson's rejection of the transportation authority and the comments ""something beats nothing"" and ""the best interests of Hampton Roads are served by approval of the authority"" is wrong, wrong, wrong. You don't buy rotten fish and hope they will turn fresh later.\ Sen. Marty Williams was the chairman of the state Senate Transportation Committee that brought this piece of garbage to Hampton Roads. The $200 million for transportation that he says he's made available to us is our tax money. Why should we pay for all our regional transportation needs and then part of everyone else's through our state taxes? We shouldn't. Who pays for the road improvements from Williamsburg to Richmond and on to the western part of the state? We do.\ Do we citizens have a chance with all the political back- scratching going on?\ David Kundis\ Newport News\ Listen, representatives!\ The Republican Party in the 1st Senate District spoke loud and clear in the GOP election held on June 12. No taxation without representation!\ If you want to serve as the Senate representative for the 1st District, you had better pay attention to what the voters do and do not want. Three cases in point:\ The region's taxpayers rejected the 2002 transportation authority referendum by nearly a 2-1 margin. Sen. Marty Williams did not listen.\ Williams voted for one of the biggest tax increases this state has experienced in recent years when he supported Gov. Mark Warner's 2004 tax package, which resulted in the state accumulating a huge surplus of funds at taxpayers' expense. Williams did not listen then, either.\ In 2007 Williams, as chairman of the state Senate's Transportation Committee, championed the passage of legislation that would implement an unelected transportation authority with taxing powers for regional transportation improvements. But this time Marty and his legislative cohorts decided not to let taxpayers vote on it, instead having the 12 local governments decide its outcome. Williams failed to listen yet again.\ Three strikes and he's out. Transportation funding is and should remain a statewide function, not a regional function, one supported by all taxpayers of Virginia. The voters of the 1st District want their state representatives to ensure they, as taxpayers, are treated fairly and equally when it comes to taxes and other state funding issues.\ Ron Fowler\ Newport News\ No longer The Jungle\ Regarding Gene Magruder's letter, ""Smithfield workers,"" June 15, about Joe Luter IV and Smithfield Packing's current employee issues with union representation. Luter, like his dad before him, knows his operation, literally from the ground floor and up. Luter has worked in just about every department within the Smithfield organization.\ As a current member of the meat industry (over 30 years) and former Smithfield employee, I can speak with authority about the employees and conditions of the Smithfield plants, especially when compared to others. It is a difficult work environment (it's the meat business), but Smithfield goes the extra mile in protecting its workers, which includes the use of the latest technology in ergonomics.\ Is it perfect? Of course not. But, Smithfield is (by industry standards) a very employee friendly and responsible corporate company and is a great organization to have as a community neighbor.\ Magruder, please read Upton Sinclair's novel ""The Jungle"" for a real picture of what the meat industry was like. We can thank the Luters and Smithfield for the positive changes necessary in the industry.\ Bob Tschirhart\ Gloucester *"
124,"Low-income households will be hit the hardest by new taxes created in Gov. Bob McDonnell's signature transportation law, according to a report released Thursday by The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis.\The study, which analyzes the funding mechanisms of the law, says people who don't drive will also pay a disproportionate share of the tax revenues generated by it. \""The basic crux of why low-income people are going to pay more is because the transportation legislation is made up of a regressive set of sales and excise taxes,"" said Michael Cassidy, president of the Commonwealth Institute, a Richmond-based think tank. \""On average a median income household income in Virginia, making about $51,000 will be paying $80 more per year. About 0.2 percent of their income,"" Cassidy said. \""People earning less than $21,000 are going to pay three to six times more than people at the top of the income bracket,"" he said. \Cassidy said for households in Hampton Roads, the cost to the median household will be over $150 a year with the additional regional taxes. \The transportation bill raises the sales tax from 5 percent to 6 percent in Hampton Roads. It also replaces the state's long-held 17.5 cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline with a 3.5 percent wholesale tax. \The Commonwealth Institute study recommends legislators taking several steps to alleviate the additional taxes on lower income households, including tax rebates or an earned income tax refund. \Vinod Agarwal, an economist at Old Dominion University, said the new law shifts costs of funding transportation to people who don't use automobiles. \""Right now if you don't have a car, you're not paying for the gas tax. But now with the sales tax everyone will pay,"" Agarwal said. \""That will affect the lower-income people more than it will affect the higher-income people. The lower-income people tend to spend more of their income on consumption. Lower-end people will end up paying a larger portion of their income."" \Agarwal said while there will be some change in spending habits in households making $30,000 or less, most of the taxable purchases they make will remain the same. ""These people are still going to be buying those things,"" he said. \Jesse Richman, who is a political scientist at ODU, said additional tax rebates are unlikely to be passed in the coming year, especially if it affects the amount of revenue dedicated for road funding. \He pointed to the long struggle for additional revenues for transportation in the state. \""It's very challenging in the political environment in the state of Virginia,"" Richman said."
125,"Depending on who is queried, highway tolls may be the answer to Virginia's transportation funding problems, a component of a broader solution or an indicator of the coming apocalypse.\The fervor that frequently accompanies discussions of how to pay for road upkeep and new construction might make it seem like this is a new issue, but Virginia has a long history of funding crises, and use of tolls to pay for needed infrastructure dates at least to 1772. \At that time, the Virginia legislature moved forward what is considered the first toll road in America -- a mountain highway between Jennings Gap and Warm Springs, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation's ""A History of Roads in Virginia."" The road was financed with 300 pounds advanced by the colony and 900 pounds generated by a lottery -- a price tag that equals about $1,800 using today's sterling-to-dollar exchange rates. \To understand just how much things have changed, consider the approximate $43-per-mile cost of the 41-mile Mountain Road with the approximate $36.3-million-per-mile it will cost for the U.S. 460 toll road between Suffolk and Petersburg that VDOT is planning to build using a private construction consortium. \But even back then, at a price that would barely buy a 10-year-old used car in today's marketplace, transportation funding was an issue that had to be addressed. And, unlike in today's political environment, it was addressed. \The problem has become even more pronounced in recent years, due to the economic downturn that forced about $1 billion to be cut annually from the transportation budget. \""That really hurt,"" said Aubrey Layne, the Hampton Roads representative on the Commonwealth Transportation Board. ""That's what made this transportation funding crisis so acute. Because it goes back to we weren't raising taxes before because things were good. You don't need to raise them. Now, you can't raise them because things are bad and you can't afford to. \""My point is, when the hell can you raise them? There is never a good time,"" Layne said. ""It goes back to the fact that it was never supposed to be based on that. It was supposed to be based on the needs of the commonwealth and we would adjust them (taxes) to that."" \Many leaders and transportation-related officials are hopeful the General Assembly will address the funding problems during its upcoming session that starts Wednesday. But given 2013 is an election year for many lawmakers, there is also a strong possibility the issue could be passed over again as in past years. \EARLY FUNDING \The late 1700s and much of the 1800s were marked by the development of many turnpikes, the historic account states, noting that Thomas Jefferson considered toll financing a means of building needed highway infrastructure that was too complex or costly for counties to handle.. \Jefferson is cited as saying: ""If the stream be such as to require a bridge of regular workmanship, the county employs workmen to build it at the expense of the whole county. If it be too great for the county, application is made to the General Assembly, who authorizes individuals to build it and to take a fixed toll from all passengers, or gives sanction to such other propositions as to them appear reasonable."" \By the early 1900s, the General Assembly decided to regulate motor-vehicle use and require registration at a cost of $5 or $10 per auto, depending on horsepower. The fees -- $21,656 was collected the first year -- were to be paid into the state treasury as a special fund to be spent on improving main roads, the VDOT historical account states. \Adequately funding transportation has grown progressively more difficult since then. \MODERN PROBLEMS \The 1970s brought oil embargoes and gasoline shortages that threatened the economy and diminished the buying power of the state gas tax. In 1976, tolls were removed from the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel on the same day the span's second tube opened. It was also at this time that the General Assembly mandated that transportation maintenance needs -- and associated funding -- take precedence over new construction. \Ongoing budget concerns bled into the 1980s as Virginia struggled to match federal aid and maintain the nation's third-largest highway system after North Carolina and Texas. In 1980, the General Assembly approved a 2-cents-per-gallon hike in the motor-fuel tax -- a move that provided an annual increase of about $576 million for the state highway program. The legislature was able to generate another $263 in additional funding in 1982 by enacting an oil excise tax and other highway user fees and increasing motor-vehicle registration costs. \""The answer to the transportation crisis of the mid-1980s clearly was to find a new and stable revenue source,"" according to the VDOT history of Virginia roads. ""Some thought that explosive growth in areas like Northern Virginia and Tidewater made the 'pay-as-you-go' method of financing highway construction obsolete; urbanization had occurred too quickly for road construction to keep pace, particularly in light of the revenue decline and increased costs seen throughout the '70s."" \That's important context given the current funding crisis that has been building since the General Assembly last raised the state gas tax, which continues to serve as a primary funding mechanism for transportation infrastructure. \Virginia lawmakers raised the gas tax in 1986 to 17.5 cents per gallon. Because they didn't index for inflation, it remains the same in 2013 but with significantly less buying power due to better vehicle fuel efficiency, the advent of alternative-fuel vehicles (such as electric and natural gas) that don't pay the tax, higher construction costs and more demanding construction standards. \""We need to take a fundamental look at our funding needs,"" said state Del. Chris Stolle, of Virginia Beach. ""Nothing gets to the store without going over our roads (even online purchases)."" \MOVING FORWARD \Stolle, who has proposed a referendum to decide whether to raise the sales tax 1 percent to fund Hampton Roads transportation projects, said the current gas tax has the effective buying power of about 8 cents due to inflation. He added that he believes that raising the per-gallon fee is not a good solution because it is ""a tax of decreasing return."" \Even so, it is still the primary source of transportation funding for most of the country. \""We are the third-largest road network in the country in terms of a little over 57,000 center-lane miles,"" Layne said. ""We're slightly behind Texas and North Carolina. North Carolina is number two with about 59,000 center-lane miles. But Virginia is 40th in the collection of state fuel taxes. All but 10 states collect more than us, and we're third."" \The funding disparity in how Virginia and North Carolina handle their respective highway systems is acutely apparent to anyone who has ever driven across the border and experienced the smoother ride on the highways of Virginia's southern neighbor. \Layne noted that despite the nearly 15-cents-per-gallon difference between Virginia's and North Carolina's gas taxes, fuel prices at the pump have remained remarkably close. A five-year analysis of gas prices in the two states, using gasbuddy.com data, shows only marginal differences. In fact, gasoline prices for Jan. 2 (for regular unleaded) averaged $3.24 in Virginia and $3.31 in North Carolina, according to gasbuddy.com. The national average on the same day was $3.26, according to the fuel analysis site. \Data available from the North Carolina Department of Revenue, which sets the gas rate every six months, shows the state has adjusted its motor-fuels tax rate (up or down) 43 times since 1986 when it was raised to 14 cents per gallon. On three occasions -- in 1986, 1989 and 1992 -- the department also included a percentage tax on the average wholesale price of gasoline. As of Dec. 31, 2012, the tax rate was 37.5 cents per gallon. \""North Carolina, over the past 10 years, even though it collects almost double the state fuel tax that we do, their gasoline has averaged about a nickel more,"" Layne said. ""So, it's not even a one-for-one hit back to the taxpayers."" \Conversely, in Virginia, 25 years after the last gas tax increase, the state is raiding the highway construction trust fund to the tune of about $500 million each year just to maintain existing infrastructure. After a year of borrowing to help fund a slew of new transportation projects -- including the Midtown Tunnel megaproject and construction of the 55-mile U.S. 460 toll road -- all available money is now committed. \By 2017, Virginia will have no construction funds left or the ability to match federal grants, and highway upkeep will be further strained unless new, and sustainable, revenue sources are identified and approved by the General Assembly. \Dwight Farmer, director of the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization, said it is ""a unique time in history to do infrastructure projects"" due to the unprecedented low cost of capital and competitiveness of construction bidding. \Farmer said he believes the ultimate solution involves funding transportation as a utility, with enterprise accounts and associated fees, just like electricity, natural gas, cable or water/sewer. \""Why are we still operating transportation as a public utility with a tax-revenue mentality while others operate with a business model?,"" he asked. ""Transportation is the only utility left with an archaic taxing system. \""We would never tolerate coming home and flipping on the cable and getting trash on the screen waiting for a good signal or hitting the switch and waiting two hours for lights,"" Farmer continued. ""But we are willing as a society to wait two to eight miles before we can get through (congestion)."" \PHOTOS ONLINE \See more pictures from the Daily Press archive of transportation projects at dailypress.com."

CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;See info box at end of text
\
President Clinton's proposed energy tax will increase energy prices an average of about 6%, costing typical households an extra $10 per month by 1997, according to government and analyst estimates.
\
""It will stimulate some consumers to increase their energy efficiency and thereby save energy,"" says Howard Geller, head of the Washington-based American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
\
The Clinton administration is promoting the plan as fair to taxpayers, regardless of income or geography.
\
Households earning less than $30,000 a year, for example, would have their tax burdens offset by tax credits, home energy assistance and food stamps. And typical households in the urban northeast, where home heating costs are high, have lesser commuting distances and greater access to mass transit.
\
The Energy Department says Clinton's plan would weatherize 62,500 low-income homes this year and 500,000 homes by 1997 and promote the use of clean-burning natural gas for electric power.
\
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary says the tax ""will have long-term benefits for all Americans"" by promoting efficiency, helping the environment and boosting the economy.
\
But the petroleum industry calls the measure tantamount to a gasoline tax, which Clinton campaigned against as unnecessary.
\
The tax ""would seriously harm economic recovery and be a job-killer on a mammoth scale,"" says Charles DiBona, head of the American Petroleum Institute. He estimates 600,000 jobs will be lost and the nation's gross domestic product cut by $170 billion over five years.
\
DiBona says poorer families will be hit hardest by the gas tax. He points to a recent Congressional Budget Office study that found households with $10,000 to $20,000 annual income spend twice as much on gasoline as those earning $50,000.
\
Clinton's plan would devote more money to mass transit and high-speed rail than in past years.
\
Also going up: jet and diesel fuel, which will push up the price of airline tickets and most consumer goods that are transported to markets by trucks or trains.
\
The disparties in habits and lifestyles among taxpayers when it comes to energy use might mean Clinton's tax will ""promote class warfare,"" says University of Denver tax professor Richard Leaman.
\
He also expects utilities to levy a double hit to the middle-class because of the tax, ""passing on a rate increase plus a little bit more.""
\
How energy tax would affect you President Clinton's plan to increase energy taxes will raise the cost of heating and lighting your home and driving your car. A look at the average annual increase, by region:

WASHINGTON; See related story: 06A
\
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bob Dole was more than a little irritated as he stood before the Internal Revenue Service Building Tuesday, demanding to know when Democrats would allow a vote on repealing a portion of the gas tax.
\
``It's going to happen one of these days. Why not do it today?'' the Republican Senate leader asked at a news conference.
\
But Dole already knew the answer to his question, in just two words: Tom Daschle.
\
Over the past year, Daschle, leader of the Senate Democrats, has emerged as the chief nemesis of Dole and Senate Republicans. Working with a minority band -- 47 Democrats to the 53 Republicans -- Daschle has set up roadblocks for Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, at every turn.
\
Tuesday, Daschle was using Senate rules to ensure that Democrats got a vote on their plan to increase the minimum wage before Dole gets a vote on his plan to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax -- or anything else.
\
Furious Republicans such as Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah called Daschle's parliamentary jockeying ``pathetic'' and ``a two-bit game.'' But Daschle said he had ``no choice'' but to stall until the Republicans allowed Democrats a vote.
\
As the battles heat up, no one seems more surprised at Daschle's performance than Senate Democrats themselves.
\
Daschle won his minority leader's job 15 months ago by just one vote when Democrats were still reeling from the GOP's 1994 landslide.
\
The South Dakotan, 48, was an unknown quantity then. He had spent eight years in the Senate but never chaired a committee or subcommittee. He was best known as protege of George Mitchell, D-Maine, then majority leader.
\
Half the Senate Democrats thought Daschle was too mild-mannered and inexperienced to stand up to an opponent like Dole. Others said uniting Democrats was impossible.
\
Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn joked at the time that Daschle would ``need an Army division and one Air Force wing to unite the Democrats.''
\
Now those doubts seem to have evaporated. Democrats have stood together on issues ranging from opposing the balanced budget amendment and GOP reforms of Medicaid and Medicare to crusading for the minimum wage increase.
\
``Tom has done a very good job of developing consensus,'' says Democratic National Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, whom Daschle beat for the leadership post.
\
Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., no fan of the Democrat's delaying tactics, says he realized that Daschle was having an effectwhen Dole went to Daschle and complained that every time he tried to get a bill passed, it got loaded up and stalled with unrelated amendments.
\
According to Simpson, Daschle looked at the Senate majority leader and said, `Welcome to the Senate, Sen. Dole.' ``Boy, I never heard him talk like that before,'' Simpson says.
\
Daschle has worked in government most of his adult life. At the end of a three-year Air Force tour in 1972, he landed a Washington job as aide to South Dakota Sen. James Abourezk.
\
He served four terms in the House before winning his Senate seat in 1986.
\
Prairie-plain, Daschle often moves through Capitol Hill corridors unrecognized by lines of tourists looking for famous faces -- or at least a politician moving with a large retinue of aides.
\
But Daschle seems to like it that way. After winning his post, he vowed that his main job would be to ``consult with every major player in our caucus'' behind the scenes before going to the Senate floor or to reporters to talk about the issues.
\
He emphasizes that style in his weekly strategy lunch sessions with Democrats, saying little until he hears out the group. ``Some people mistake listening for being very quiet. He listens,'' says Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt.
\
``He listens and brings people together. And he's not backing down.'' Daschle also is careful to let other, more high-profile members take the spotlight. He deferred to Massachusetts' Ted Kennedy to lead the fight for an increase in the minimum wage. Kennedy leads the debate and news conferences; Daschle lines up votes.
\
Daschle sketched out the filibuster strategy that forced Dole to slow the Senate to a crawl. By blocking Senate action on a popular immigration reform bill, Dole finally conceded that he had no alternative but to satisfy Democrats and assure them that there would be a vote on the minimum wage at some point.
\
That maneuvering infuriated Republican leaders in both the House and Senate, who oppose the minimum wage increase.
\
Daschle is ``throwing sand in the gears'' of the Senate's legislative machine, House majority leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, complained on TV.
\
Armey has a point. As minority leader, Daschle's main role has been as an obstructionist. While Democrats seldom get the votes to pass their own legislation, Daschle usually can block Republican measures by holding together at least 41 Democrats -- the number needed to block ``cloture,'' which limits debate and guarantees a vote on the merits of the legislation.
\
Armey says Daschle is clearly waging warfare daily on behalf of President Clinton's re-election campaign. ``Can Bob Dole handle the obstructionism of Sen. Daschle?'' he asks. ``I don't know''
\
Daschle shrugs off the criticism, promising that Democrats ``absolutely'' will keep the pressure on, fine-tuning the strategy in weekly meetings with the White House as the campaign intensifies.
\
Increasing the minimum wage ``is only one piece of our (economic) security agenda along with health, pensions and crime control. And then there's education and the environment,'' he said in an interview in his office.
\
That ability to focus and carefully sell the Democrats agenda are two of the characteristics most often cited by senators on both sides of the aisle as reasons for Daschle's success as leader.
\
``He's certainly standing up for the liberal point of view in a very effective way,'' Hatch says.
\
To be sure, Daschle has benefited from low expectations. Mitchell, his predecessor, was considered a giant who helped engineer a Democratic takeover of the Senate when Ronald Reagan was president.
\
``That's part of the dynamic going on here. He was a back-bencher who everybody assumed couldn't fill the big shoes,'' says congressional expert Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution.
\
But Daschle also benefited from Mitchell's example of judicious speech, Hess says.
\
Like Mitchell, he displays a knack for making liberal positions sound moderate and reasonable -- particularly for TV cameras and reporters, Hess says.
\
``His manner is relatively low-key. That can be effective in a town that's used to shouting.''

128," In the barrage of charges and countercharges that passes for Virginia's U.S. Senate race, the issues that Virginians say concern them the most are discussed the least. Obscured by the talk of nude massages and lying to Congress is the fact that these three candidates - Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb, Republican Oliver L. North and independent J. Marshall Coleman - offer Virginia distinct ideological choices on a host of social issues. From North's ""Agenda for Change,"" ""The Robb Record"" and Coleman's ""Letter to the People of Virginia,"" a sampling of their views:\ THE ISSUES\ CRIME/DRUGS\ Robb - Voted for the Crime Bill that will pay for more police and prison cells and expands use of death penalty in federal cases. Believes more drug education and treatment programs are needed and calls for tougher sentences for drug dealing.\ North - Would have opposed Crime Bill because it spent too much on crime-prevention programs. Calls for tougher sentences for drug dealing; wants to focus on flow of drugs into U.S. from other countries.\ Coleman - Would have opposed Crime Bill because it spent too much on crime-prevention programs. Calls for sanctions against countries that do not cut cocaine smuggling into U.S. Says first bill he'll introduce would ensure criminal evidence is not barred from trial on technical violations by police.\ EDUCATION/SCHOOL CHOICE\ Robb - Favors public school choice, but not the use of vouchers and tax credits to pay for private-school educations.\ North - Supports tuition tax credits for parents who send kids to private school.\ Coleman - Supports using tax credits or vouchers to help pay for private-school educations.\ DEFENSE\ Robb - Supported President Clinton's spending cuts, but would cut no further. Supported use of military force in Haiti and Persian Gulf.\ North - Opposes pending and future cuts in defense spending. Would restrict use of military as global police force; opposed Haiti invasion.\ Coleman - Believes military downsizing needed, but opposes any further cuts in defense spending. Would restrict use of military forces in peacekeeping and nation-building missions.\ GUN CONTROL\ Robb - Supports a national ban on the sale of assault-style weapons.\ North - Opposes all gun controls; endorsed by the National Rifle Association.\ Coleman - Supports a ban on assault-style weapons and the use of instant background checks for gun buyers.\ GAYS IN THE MILITARY\ Robb - Favors allowing gays to serve in the military.\ North - Says gays should be banned from military.\ Coleman - Supports President Clinton's ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy.\ ABORTION\ Robb - Supports abortion rights as defined in the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling. Co-sponsored Freedom of Choice Act and legislation barring protesters from blocking abortion clinic doors.\ North - Opposes abortion in all cases except rape, incest and when the mother's life in endangered.\ Coleman - Has changed positions over the years. Says he's personally opposed, but would not seek to change current laws that allow it.\ BUDGET\ Robb - Supports giving the president a line-item veto. Favors a constitutional amendment requiring budgets to be balanced. Favors caps on spending and entitlements. Supported a 50-cents gas tax increase, but lost his seat on the Budget Committee for supporting deeper spending cuts.\ North - Supports line-item veto and balanced-budget amendment.\ Coleman - Supports line-item veto and balanced-budget amendment. Would require a three-fifths vote, rather than a simple majority, to enact tax increases.\ HEALTH CARE\ Robb - Favors reform, but did not support President Clinton's entire package. Favors increasing funding for breast cancer research and comprehensive maternal and child health care.\ North - Favors reform, but called President Clinton's now-defunct overhaul plan too bureaucratic.\ Coleman - Favors reform, but says universal coverage is not a realistic short-term goal. Would allow insurance to follow workers who leave a job and would restrict insurance companies from excluding people with pre-existing conditions. Opposes employer mandates.\ ENVIRONMENT\ Robb - Supports stricter regulation of above-ground oil tanks and continued governmental support for Chesapeake Bay clean-up activities. Opposes new funding for nuclear energy projects and supports use of alternative vehicle fuels.\ North - Opposes any environmental protections that would limit property owner rights. Favors requiring all new environmental regulations to include an economic impact statement.\ Coleman - Believes environmental policy should be balanced by economic concerns. Opposes the current application of the Endangered Species Act.\ SOCIAL SECURITY\ Robb - Supports applying a means test to wealthier recipients after they have received all of the money they and their employers paid into the system plus interest.\ North - Has suggested that contributions to the program can be made voluntary for future generations.\ Coleman - Opposes any changes or the use of means testing because it is ""an insurance program, not a welfare program."""
129," Like a musician welcoming fans at a backstage party, Jesse Jackson emerged from his hotel room at the Omni early Friday wearing a white terry cloth robe, greeted a few Baptist ministers and charmingly kissed their wives' hands.\ Only minutes before, the Rev. Jackson had delivered an amen- arousing sermon at a late-night service of the 93rd Baptist Convention of Virginia. His voice howled through the convention hall until after midnight as he reminded the 800 black conventioners about their African heritage and their chance to make an impact in an election year when three candidates are sparring for their vote.\ Clanging tambourines, the raised hands of elderly women and the flashing of cameras welcomed the message as well as the man whose celebrity status to this Bible-toting, African-American audience is akin to the screams of teen-agers at a Michael Jackson concert.\ As a non-candidate this campaign season, Jackson is hard at work selling his vision to the public, Democratic hopeful Gov. Bill Clinton and independent candidate Ross Perot.\ His all-encompassing plan to rebuild and revitalize America is one that would complement Clinton's new $50 billion program, albeit a somewhat adulterated version, he said. But it could also be adopted whole-heartedly by Perot, he said.\ That's why he hasn't backed Clinton over Perot yet: he's still waiting for an answer. It's a message he's willing to take to an audience of thousands or anyone who will listen.\ And that's what he did in the early Friday morning hours.\ With little more than a few hours sleep since he returned from a five-day visit to Africa, Jackson had his guests whisked away at 1 a.m., kicked out his guards, propped up his bare feet on a glass coffee table and stumped for an audience of one Daily Press reporter.\ ""I am campaigning to change the course of history,"" he said modestly as he sank down in a velvet sofa.\ Jackson, who ran for the presidency as a Democrat in 1984 and strove for the vice-presidential spot on the Democratic ticket in 1988, dodged questions about his loyalty to the party in 1992.\ ""To me the issue is not who is on the ticket but where it is going,"" he said as he munched on warm cheese and crackers. ""My loyalty is to the man who has a plan to change the economic ills of our society.""\ Jackson promised to endorse either Perot or Clinton at some point after the Democratic Convention but the ""burden is on the candidate.""\ ""I'm a Democrat but with more and more people I'm becoming an independent,"" he offered.\ ""Perot is a force to be reckoned with,"" he added.\ ""He has taken substantial risk to bring back Americans from foreign battlefields and jails. I have respect for him,"" he said.\ Jackson said Perot and Clinton share many of the same stances: favoring a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion, keeping jobs in America and industrial growth.\ When asked whether Perot, the Texas billionaire, could relate to the middle-class, Jackson explained that ""Perot comes from common origins. Bush was born with a spoon in his mouth.""\ But Jackson says the campaign has centered too much on personalities instead of seriously examining how to create jobs, raise education standards and decrease urban violence.\ ""Candidates should be debating welfare instead of questioning Sister Souljah and Willie Horton or some other diversion,"" he said. ""We have to talk about real plans for real people.""\ He compares his strategy to that of the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s.\ ""Neither party had a plan to get us from the back of the bus. We had the plan to leave. The oppressed always have to have a plan.""\ Jackson's economic revolution was composed two weeks ago in the Rainbow Coalition's three-day convention in Washington, D.C., where Clinton's speech bashing rap singer Sister Souljah was the most memorable outcome to most citizens.\ Sister Souljah's comments to a newspaper that blacks should stop killing blacks for a week and kill whites instead were taken by Clinton as an endorsement for murder. Souljah says she was trying to emphasize how people diminish black deaths but not white murders.\ Jackson says more than a squabble over Sister Souljah was accomplished at the convention. A plan was devised centered on using an estimated $3 trillion currently accrued in workers pension funds to reinvest and retrain defense workers. Americans would construct new roads and build a national high speed railroad system. Another $500 billion could be raised through a 5-cent gas tax. The revenues from the new infrastructure would provide a sizable return for the pensions.\ The Rainbow Coalition vision tackled America's every squalid corner, he explained, and even outlined a system of lowering crime by having first-time offenders serve time working with churches instead of learning a life of crime from the inside of a jail cell.\ The plan proposes converting military bases to training facilities where defense and other displaced workers could be taught other skills such as road and bridge building.\ ""People who can build ships can build trains,"" Jackson said of Newport News shipyard workers.\ By building high-tech transit trains, whole corridors of the country could be connected in a matter of hours. For example, he said, a highspeed train from Norfolk to Washington could deliver passengers in minutes instead of hours and is better for the environment, he said.\ Urban areas of the country would be rebuilt through low-interest loans similar to those the U.S. gave Poland and Russia to rebuild their countries. These loans would also be used to stimulate new businesses and farms.\ ""Our biggest reason to rebuild Europe was to create new markets for our businesses. Why not create new markets in Norfolk or Portsmouth?"" he asked.\ Aside from criticizing Bush and Vice President ""Old Potato Dan Quayle,"" Jackson repeatedly slammed the Republican response to needs overseas and not at home. ""Europe and Japan can afford their own defense. There's no one after them, and we need the money.""\ And Jackson knows just where the money would be used: scholarships and better pay for better teachers.\ He says he knows what he is offering is somewhat radical. ""What I'm doing is high risk. It's for real, but it's not fun.""\ He says the whole idea came out of the Los Angeles riots when it became obvious that the country needed to rebuild its inner cities and put people back to work.\ Jackson dismissed a popular explanation for the riots that says black youth do not have positive role models and only have drug dealers to imitate.\ ""What these people need are the same things that all other people need: prenatal care, Head Start programs, internship training and college scholarships,"" he said.\ If people do not have a stake in something, they are going to have little concern about its demise, he said."

131," Tolls on I-264?\ Because money for roads is in such short supply in Richmond, Virginia Beach has embarked on a study to find out whether tolls on its main street -- better known as Interstate 264 -- could pay for all the work the highway needs.\ You'd think that such civic initiative would be met with applause from the crowd in the Capitol, which just agreed on a budget that includes everything but the highway money Virginians really need.\ But no.\ Some House Republicans have already told the Beach that tolls on I-264 are out of the question, so don't even ask.\ ""It's ludicrous,"" said Del. John Welch III, R-Virginia Beach. ""People are OK with tolls being a part of a new road, and some people can accept a gas tax increase, but no one is accepting tolls on existing roads. I will tell you that it is dead on arrival. We will never put tolls on I-264.""\ Never is an awfully long time to live with the Witchduck Road exchange. Not to mention all the other off- and on-ramps ... where traffic stacks up dangerously on the shoulder for a quarter-mile or more.\ Beach Republicans shouldn't be so hasty in dismissing potential solutions. Several of them were swept into office a decade ago on assurances that the quarter toll on the then-Virginia Beach Expressway was no longer necessary because they would make sure the state would maintain the road. That's a promise that remains unkept. ...\ Predicting Richmond's next move is impossible, but any real transportation solution involves a huge amount of money, hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\ And a big chunk of that, like it or not, is going to have to come in the form of tolls. Pretty much all over Hampton Roads, at all the existing water crossings, and on plenty of existing roads. It makes no more sense to oppose tolls on a highway that's already paid for than to insist you're not going to repair your car after you've paid off the loan.\ Welcome to the future of transportation funding in Hampton Roads.\ There remains a chance that a statewide solution may arrive during a special session of the General Assembly this year, but don't bet on it. ...\ Lawmakers like Welch -- and he's certainly not alone among local Republicans -- can scream and yell all they want about it, but the fact remains that Richmond's failure for years to fund a transportation solution has forced municipalities to consider desperate measures, among them tolls on Main Street.\ -- The Virginian-Pilot\ Playing the privacy game\ Virginia is taking up arms in America's war on privacy. Unfortunately, lawmakers chose to fight for the wrong side. In an environment of ever-expanding federal monitoring, the commonwealth has its own plans to track innocent people.\ The General Assembly's much-ballyhooed crackdown on sex offenders included a couple of little-noticed provisions that turn every new college student and many motorists into potential criminal suspects.\ Starting this year, public and private colleges and universities must submit to state police the names and Social Security numbers of the students they accept. The Department of Motor Vehicles must do the same for anyone seeking a new license or change of address. ...\ Now police will have access to large pools of data for tracking sex offenders. ...\ Even if Virginia can show more respect for the nation's fundamental principles than the president, students and motorists should still worry whether their data will be safe. Theft of personal data has been rampant lately. Entrusting more to police only increases opportunities for accidental loss.\ -- Roanoke Times\ 'Our enemies'\ Newly elected senators and congressmen attend orientation sessions to learn the mores of congressional life. According to Capitol Hill's lusty lore, the advice includes observations regarding relationships between the House and the Senate.\ During the '50s more than one idealistic Democrat reported the newcomers were told that while Republicans were their opponents, the Senate was their enemy. Surely the Senate returned the compliment.\ This year Virginia endured yet another budget fiasco. The state Senate and House of Delegates went into record-setting overtime before reaching a compromise. Throughout the ordeal the chambers engaged in dueling press releases. The Senate denounced the House; the House denounced the Senate.\ Both chambers are controlled by the same party -- in this case, the Republicans.\ When Virginia's new state legislators report for duty after the 2007 elections, perhaps they, too, will need instructions in how their ""enemies"" are not partisan but institutional.\ -- Richmond Times-Dispatch *"
132," Congress is preparing to go on a highway spending spree that could funnel more than $1.5 billion in new federal aid to Virginia over the next six years.\ But finding a way to pay for it in an election year will be no easy task.\ House and Senate leaders have made reauthorization of federal highway and mass transit programs a top legislative priority this year, although President Bush failed to push for the measure in his State of the Union address.\ In Hampton Roads, increased federal transportation money has long been sought to fund a third bridge-tunnel crossing and the continued widening of Interstate 64. Virginia received about $693 million in federal highway aid last year -- an amount that would be nearly doubled by 2009, under the most generous of several funding formulas under review.\ That plan hinges on increasing the federal gas tax for the first time since 1993, according to the House Transportation Committee. The tax, now 18.4 cents a gallon, would be indexed to the rate of inflation, said committee spokesman Steve Hansen.\ Whether a Republican-controlled House and Senate would favor raising the gas tax as they campaign for re-election remains unclear. The Senate Finance Committee tentatively plans to consider the matter Wednesday.\ With funding uncertain, so too is the size of the road and transit package.\ Bush offered up a six-year, $215 billion program last summer that was promptly declared dead on arrival. Lawmakers complained it was not big enough to address a backlog of road construction needs and begin to ease congestion.\ The House Transportation Committee countered with a $375 billion package that assumes a gas-tax increase.\ Under that plan, Virginia would get as much as $6.1 billion for highways over the next six years, compared to the nearly $4.3 billion the state got in the last six years.\ Last week, after months of delay, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee settled on its own funding formula that appears to strike a middle ground.\ The Senate package, briefed to committee members in secret, costs about $255 billion. While it contemplates no hike in the gas tax, the source of funding has yet to be decided, a committee aide said.\ Even before the package was made public, committee members hailed the measure because of its promise for increased aid to their states.\ ""We must do all we can to reduce congestion in our urban areas and increase access and mobility in our rural areas,"" said Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., who was briefed on the plan in a closed-door session Wednesday. ""This extra funding will help us get there.""\ Warner said Virginia would receive $5.92 billion in highway aid over the next six years. While that is about $200 million less than the House plan, it nonetheless represents a projected 38 percent increase in funding from the previous six years, unadjusted for inflation.\ In the game of give and take among states competing for federal road money, Virginia has long been a ""donor"" state -- giving more in federal taxes than it gets from Washington in highway aid.\ But the state made up ground in 1998 -- the last time the highway bill was rewritten -- and this year's plan promises to help Virginia come close to breaking even.\ This year, for example, Virginia will get a 93.4 percent return on its contributions, up from 90.5 percent last year.\ Both the House and Senate plan calls for that return to increase steadily to 95 percent by 2009.\ The more generous House package has the bipartisan backing of the top four leaders of the House Transportation Committee. But the fate of the measure rests largely with the House Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for funding it.\ That committee has not yet scheduled a meeting on the bill, although congressional leaders are pressing to bring the measure to the full House and Senate in early February.\ Supporters say the costly package is needed to relieve congestion, improve highway safety and help stimulate the economy.\ More than 42,000 Americans are killed each year on the nation's highways. Nearly a third of all fatal crashes are caused by substandard roads and roadside hazards, according to figures cited by the House Transportation Committee.\ The committee claims its bill would produce and sustain 1.7 million new jobs over the next six years because of the increase in road construction work.\ ""Our bill would be a major economic stimulus to the country,"" Hansen said.\ Virginia jobs related to the bill would grow from about 41,400 this year to 67,900 by 2009, committee figures show.\ David Lerman can be reached at (202) 824-8224 or by e-mail at dlerman@tribune.com"
133," Road bonds\ State interest, not self-interest, should rule policy\ Legislators from Northern Virginia and Southwest Virginia are forming a politically powerful coalition to push their regions' road needs to the top of the state's priority list. A proposal that has enough votes to pass in the Senate and House of Delegates would free those regions of the state's traditional pay-as-you-go road financing policy. Only Gov. Gilmore can say no.\ The problem being addressed in Northern Virginia is not new. The region is choking on its own traffic. Estimates say it would take $1 billion a year for 20 years to meet the road needs in Virginia's D.C. suburbs. Northern Virginia has been willing to pay, but its requests for special taxing authority for roads have been denied.\ By contrast, Southwest Virginia is promoting a $1.7 billion improvement to Route 58 along the state's southern border to open up territory - to bring traffic where none exists today.\ Neither region wants to wait for the state's 17.5-cent gasoline tax to generate enough revenue to fund their projects. So the legislators from the two regions are pushing through a bond package that would give $104 million - a drop in the bucket, really - to each region. The bonds in this case would be repaid out of future gas tax revenues, taking that money out of the normal budgeting process of the Department of Transportation.\ Everything about this is a bad idea, from the politicians usurping VDOT's role in determining road construction priorities to giving up the current funding policy without any sense of what the public wants.\ For the short term, Virginia should take Northern Virginia's first suggestion - give them a regional increase in the gas tax and spend the money on their road needs.\ For the long term, the state should recognize that the $2.1 billion from the current gas tax is not enough to fund all that VDOT does.\ Three options are borrowing - and yes, that has to be paid back out of future revenue - raising the gas tax or supplementing the highway budget from the general fund.\ Frankly, none of those have great appeal, but the growth that Virginia is experiencing makes the status quo with roads unacceptable. But it's also unacceptable to change a decades-old policy based on a coalition of self-interest instead of state interest.\ Gilmore should veto the road bond package.\ SOL report cards\ Parents can help improve their kids' schools\ Junk mail. Phone bill. Junk mail. Letter from Uncle Jimmy. Junk mail. SOL report card. Junk .... Hey, wait a minute! Don't throw that out, thinking it's just another offer for a home equity loan.\ As part of the reforms associated with the new Standards of Learning, parents - for the first time - are about to get a detailed account of how their child's school is performing. From accreditation ratings to pupil attendance and the number of violent school incidents, parents will get a snapshot of how the school is doing on the SOLs, what the classroom environment is like and where the school needs to improve.\ These initial report cards will also show their child's individual SOL performance. Only 39 of 1,800 schools in the state passed the first round of SOL tests, and it stands to reason that these first report cards will reveal woeful scores.\ Don't panic. Take these scores as a baseline. At least 70 percent of the students in each school must pass the standardized tests, or the school will risk losing state accreditation in the 2006-2007 school year. There's time to fix this problem.\ Parents can do two things. They can compare and contrast schools within individual school divisions. They also can use the report cards to become more involved with the schools. Could their kids' school use more hall monitors? Class parents? After-school tutoring?\ The SOL report cards can be serious guides for adults who want to improve learning throughout Virginia - and right down the block.\ Proportion\ Soviet emigre pawnbroker has perspective\ Alex Gartsman knows there are worse fates than being told he can't open a pawn shop near Ivy Farms.\ Like being a Jew under Soviet communism.\ Like starting over, learning a new language, new customs and even a new way to make a living.\ ""No hard feelings,"" Gartsman said last week when the Newport News City Council sided with Ivy Farms residents who opposed his bid to open a pawn shop in a defunct Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant.\ Gartsman, who operates Langley Pawn in Hampton, learned the business from his first job in this country, after the local Jewish community sponsored his immigration from the Soviet Union almost 10 years ago. Where he learned diplomacy is another question, but he was very accommodating in his discussions with the neighbors - he'd sell no guns or other weapons, for example.\ In any cases, compare Gartsman's gracious reaction with the rage and rant of the typical modern loser. Maybe it comes from his training as a professional violinist, or maybe from the difficult trek from his native Ukraine.\ But this is a man with a sense of proportion."
134,"Where the newspaper stands\ There are no easy answers, no painless solutions to two of the nation's most significant problems: dependence on foreign oil and the environmental damage caused by our sometimes profligate consumption of oil.\ Ethanol, a fuel made from plants, addresses the first problem, because it replaces some gasoline derived from petroleum. That's welcome.\ And it can help with the second problem, by cutting down on the greenhouse gases caused by burning fossil fuels.\ But when ethanol is made from corn, it substitutes one set of problems - the toll that growing and processing corn takes on the environment - for another.\ That's why there is much controversy over a proposed ethanol production plant in Chesapeake, because it would lead farmers in Virginia and other states whose waters flow into the Chesapeake Bay to plant more corn.\ Corn can be hard on Mother Nature. It requires a lot of fertilizer, and allows a lot of fertilizer to run off with rainwater. In the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, runoff fertilizer is a major source of pollution that feeds algae blooms, which rob the water - and the creatures in it - of life-sustaining oxygen.\ And corn-based ethanol has other downsides: It takes a lot of energy (much of it supplied by oil) to produce corn and refine it into a fuel additive.\ The Chesapeake plant would be a corn hog, and the company pitching it promises to buy as much corn as possible from Virginia.\ Even without that, agriculture experts expect farmers in Virginia and the five other states that feed into the bay to plant half a million more acres of corn, as they respond to higher prices fueled by ethanol demand.\ That's not good news for Virginia's waters. Especially not when progress in improving water quality is so slow, and a healthy bay seems to be such an elusive goal. There are ways to cut back on corn's polluting qualities, but implementing them will take money away from other water-quality needs. For that reason, decision- makers should consider devising some sort of fee on ethanol plants - the equivalent of tipping fees on trash, which help cover the cost of making sure landfills are safe - to offset, at least partially, the polluting power of corn production.\ In the absence of easy answers, we have to no choice but to pursue the more difficult, but more promising, solutions.\ One has to be increasing the fuel efficiency of vehicles. One way to get there is through regulation, but Congress has been loath to go this route, because of heavy pressure from automobile makers.\ But there's another route to better gas mileage: hiking the gas tax sufficiently that the price of gasoline applies some natural, marketplace brakes to consumption. And there's an upside: That tax could generate money for a variety of needs, from upgrading our vulnerable road and bridge infrastructure to improving air and water quality.\ There are other solutions. Biofuels can be made from crops, such as sugar cane and grasses, that cause less environmental damage than corn. That will require reconfiguring farm subsidies, but it's doable.\ So is encouraging communities that offer satisfying, convenient ways of living with less driving - if we pay careful attention to how land-use decisions are made and what kind of development is rewarded by state and local governments.\ So is changing the incentive structure to encourage nuclear and renewable forms of energy and discourage polluting plants that burn fossil fuels.\ And even, perhaps, crafting some system of pollution caps and credits, like that used with power plants, that sets limits on agricultural pollution and offers incentives to clean up. A farmer who switches to a less-polluting crop could earn a credit, which he could sell to a farmer who wants to go with a more-polluting crop like corn.\ These are not easy answers, but they're the ones that hold out hope."
135," ""With his election year call for a $1,500 education tax credit, President Clinton yesterday upped the ante in what is shaping up as a bipartisan bidding war on tax cuts."" - The Washington Post.\ President Clinton's positions on taxes are as consistent as a knuckleball. He is now in a tax-cut mode, but then so is Sen. Bob ""Roll Back the Gas Tax"" Dole. The strategy is that the man who proposes the most attractive tax cut - attractive meaning the one that appeals to the most voters - will win the election and with it the honor of explaining after the election why the tax cut wasn't such a hot idea after all.\ The following proposals are offered, then, in the spirit of the times:\ * A $1,500 tax credit for people who ride their bicycles to work. Cyclists reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, reduce pollution, reduce highway congestion and improve their health, thereby reducing the need for spending on health care and, with that, the chances that Clinton will come up with any more wild ideas for health care reform. The last thing the United States needs is to encourage gas consumption, which is what Dole's gas tax rollback would do.\ * A $500 tax credit for vegetarians. A tax credit would encourage more people to become vegetarians. The more vegetarians there are, the less demand there will be for meat, which will lower the price of meat, which will be great for those of us who love hamburgers.\ * A $1,500 tax credit for cattlemen. This will be necessary to help compensate them for the income loss that they will suffer because of the government policy discouraging meat consumption.\ * A $500 tax credit for people who use no power tools to remove leaves from their lawns. This credit would have a multiplicity of benefits. Using a rake is good exercise. The environment would be enhanced by a reduction in noise pollution and energy consumption.\ * A $500 tax credit for people who can show proof that they voted in every election in which they were eligible to vote during the tax year. What better way to enhance citizenship?\ * A $1,500 tax credit for people who listen to Rush Limbaugh, with the money to be provided only as a direct payment for tuition to any college or community college. The idea, of course, is that people who listen to Limbaugh need to go back to school.\ * A $1,500 annual tax credit for people who, having been accepted to a law school, instead take teaching jobs in public school systems. The credit would be good for as long as they teach. After all, if you want to use tax policy to influence behavior, it makes sense to encourage talented people to teach rather than contribute to the glut of lawyers filing lawsuits over spilled coffee. This would probably do more to improve education in the United States than Clinton's tax credit for college. It assumes, of course, that people accepted to law school are talented, an assumption that deserves to be challenged.\ * A $500 tax credit for people who don't own televisions. They should be rewarded for using their time well, which they are more likely to be doing if they don't have a TV.\ To offset the loss of revenue resulting from these tax changes, the United States could simply extort the money from weaker nations. After all, if we want more government services than we're willing to pay for, why borrow from our children with deficit spending when we can simply take the cash from, say, Canada or Saudi Arabia.\ I admit, some of these ideas are pretty silly, but some of them make more sense than what Dole and Clinton are offering. And they are sure to offer more before Election Day gets here.\ Todd is associate editor of the editorial page."
136," Suggested detours\ On the highway to better roads, look for alternative routes\ ""In today's political environment,"" former Gov. Gerald L. Baliles wrote last August, ""it is difficult for some to recognize the obvious: Transportation projects are built with either taxes or tolls -- or both. One cannot be against taxes and tolls and be in favor of transportation investments. Money is required.""\ That is indeed the proposition before the Virginia General Assembly. New money for roads. Will the legislature provide it or not? The Senate says yes. The House says no. There it sits.\ ""Today, in my judgment, because we have failed to replenish the transportation fund during the last decade, the gas tax now cannot be raised high enough to meet the state's needs,"" Baliles went on to say. ""Virginia's gas tax is the 41st lowest in the nation, but a penny increase in the gas tax would yield less than $50 million; an increase of five cents would raise some $250 million. That kind of money would not come close to addressing the cost of a major project in Hampton Roads or Northern Virginia. The impact, indeed, would be minimal.""\ Baliles' alternative centered on new tolling. Virginia would have to get federal approval (doable), then it could establish 38 tolling locations on the state's 1,118 miles of interstate roads. A suggested toll of 85 cents (with breaks for local commuters) would generate $1 billion a year or thereabouts.\ It's an interesting idea, entirely workable, but it didn't catch fire among the legislators. Well, maybe they should look at it again, since the current proposals do appear to be seriously stalled.\ For good measure, in the spirit of breaking the present impasse, how about stealing an idea from the United Kingdom (site of merry ol' traffic jams aplenty) and actually reduce the gas tax in favor of greater tolling authority?\ That would be, like, a tradeoff. A compromise. In the tradition of democracy and getting something done.\ A nationwide survey in the U.K. found that more than two-thirds of motorists support nationwide congestion charging, via new tolling, but only if there is an equivalent reduction in other motoring taxes. Perhaps drivers here might view favorably a similar approach.\ Another idea:\ Last week, the Virginia Department of Transportation announced that it reached an agreement-in-principle with Australia-based toll- road operator Transurban to sign a 99-year, $522 million lease of the Pocahontas Parkway, the privately funded, but underused, road connecting Henrico and Chesterfield counties across the James River.\ That's real money, and Transurban will improve the road with a connector/extension to the Richmond airport -- a deal that looks good for everyone and certainly helps validate Speaker of the House Bill Howell's noisy enthusiasm for public-private approaches to transportation improvements.\ So why not give Howell what he wants and pursue these ventures with more vigor and determination? Why not even reverse the recently announced plan to fund a rail line out to Dulles airport using the proceeds of the Dulles Toll Road?\ Gov. Timothy M. Kaine cut that deal and Howell hates it. Howell wants to sell the Dulles Toll Road to the highest bidder (there were four active bids before Kaine stepped in) to see what Virginia can get for the road.\ Fine. Kaine gives; Virginia gets. We move ahead. Compromise. Got it?\ Besides, the rail line out to Dulles, at an estimated cost of $4 billion (and growing) is rapidly beginning to look like a money pit.\ The tradeoff with Howell would require from him a hard commitment to drawing some lines on who gets to participate in these negotiations. There are too many rumors of back-room involvement by state legislators and other state officials, via assorted law firms and developers, on the moneymaking end of these private-public deals.\ Sorry, but you get to make the laws or make money. Trying to overlap the two only raises questions of whose interests are really being served. One good conflict-of-interest scandal could easily sink the growing potential for public-private transportation initiatives.\ Given present realities -- senators and delegates occasionally arriving in Richmond only to glare at each other, trade insults and go home -- something has to give. The above is meant to offer some suggestions on potential compromise.\ Don't like those suggestions? Then come up with something better. But come up with something. Doing nothing on transportation -- an all-too-real threat, at the moment -- is no way to get on with the future. *\ Chalk, please\ In Charlottesville, a 'working' monument to free speech\ In an age when the Internet provides an electronic town hall available to hundreds of millions worldwide to exchange opinions, the installation of a blackboard dedicated to free speech in front of the City Hall of a mid-sized Virginia community has to be seen as a bit of a gimmick. But in the case of the ""free-speech monument"" on the downtown mall in Charlottesville, it's a gimmick that will be conveying more than one message.\ In the home of the University of Virginia, also dubbed Mr. Jefferson's University for its founder, the monument is a tangible reminder of the rights spelled out in the First Amendment to the Constitution. These in turn were modeled on George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which also gave voice to parts of the Declaration of Independence.\ Speaker's Corner in London's Hyde Park has long celebrated the right of free speech and assembly (the latter only granted in 1872 in the United Kingdom) and the importance of public debate and dissent in a democracy. Still, Charlottesville's tablets -- two large, long blackboards with chalk provided -- are all the more fitting to their location, in that some have described Jefferson as ""contributing his pen rather than his voice"" to the cause of liberty.\ Here's the fun part: The blackboards' position in front of City Hall will serve to bring residents' messages directly to their elected officials as they go about doing the people's business. A living monument, if you will.\ Credit the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression for the funding of this day-to-day reminder of our precious right to say just exactly what's on our minds. *"
137,"Destinations & Diversions; See also sidebar on 2D.\ NEGRIL, Jamaica -- On a sun-drenched day in late May, a pretty, petite 29-year-old New Yorker exited the guarded gates of her sprawling, fortresslike hotel here and vanished.\ That Claudia Kirschhoch was an assistant editor for Frommer's Travel Guides visiting the island on a junket sponsored by Sandals resorts, that she had concerned parents who sounded the alarm when she failed to return home June 1, that she left behind her passport, cash and credit cards in her hotel room, all fueled a storm of speculation. Regardless, police and private searches, hundreds of phone tips, a $50,000 reward and reams of publicity have yet to yield an answer three months later.\ In the wake of the mystery, Jamaica's battered image has taken another hit.\ The island's volatility frequently grabs headlines. In 1999, riots over gas tax increases sparked a State Department travel advisory (one of two security-related warnings about the island in a decade). Violence, which some believe has become a way of life for this nation of 2.5 million, claimed 848 lives in 1999. (Jamaica's murder rate is about five times that of the United States.) And crimes against tourists, ranging from robberies to possible foul play in Kirschhoch's disappearance, have honed Jamaica's reputation as a dangerous place.\ Whether the attention is warranted -- indeed, whether Jamaica's troubled image is based on perception or reality -- depends on whom you talk to. On an island of extremes, opinions run hot and cold but never lukewarm.\ Of all the Caribbean islands, there are few as scenically and culturally rich as Jamaica. From its early tourism days as a playground for the wealthy and famous, including Errol Flynn, Ian Fleming and Noel Coward, to its present incarnation as a mass-market destination of all-inclusive resorts, small guesthouses and luxe villas, it has drawn millions of people seeking sun, relaxation and adventure.\ But while tourist arrivals have increased steadily over the past decade, stays are shorter than at any time since 1987. Hotel occupancy rates last year hovered around 56%.\ Travel agents say the island offers good value and myriad options, but it can be a hard sell.\ ""I like Jamaica, and I always give clients the option. But a lot of people are adamant about not wanting to go there,"" says Jim Aguerinos of Perfect Honeymoons & Holidays in Tysons Corner, Va. ""It's getting better, but it's still a place (about which) someone will always throw their 2 cents in when someone's thinking about going. They'll say, 'My uncle went there and got robbed.' Or 'My brother went there, and someone wanted him to buy drugs.' And pretty soon, a wallet lifted from the beach grows into a story about a tourist being chased with a machete.""\ Still, Jamaica remains one of the top three Caribbean destinations for Americans (along with Cancun and the Bahamas). Tourism is a billion-dollar industry that supplies more than half the nation's gross foreign exchange earnings.\ More than 1.2 million tourists vacationed in Jamaica last year, and 800,000 others visited via cruise ships. A Ritz-Carlton hotel, in a conspicuous show of confidence, opens today near Montego Bay. And resort growth is slowly pushing its way from the popular developments on the north and west coasts to the quieter south coast.\ But despite the island's popularity, a survey by a U.S. consulting firm last year that ranked Americans' perceptions of eight sun destinations placed Jamaica dead last in seven of 16 categories, including safety and cleanliness. In relaying the results, the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper reported that Americans perceive Jamaicans as ""the most lazy, dishonest, unresponsive, unreliable, threatening, surly and hostile"" people among those of the eight warm-weather spots.\ It's an in-your-face place\ Negative perceptions aren't new. In the 1980s, focus group participants, asked to attribute female characteristics to islands, likened Jamaica to ""a slightly dangerous (but nevertheless tantalizing) slut you wouldn't take to the country club,"" says Marcella Martinez, a Jamaican-born publicist in New York who worked for the Jamaica Tourist Board at the time.\ Why the dramatic reactions?\ ""It's a dramatic place. In terms of scenery, music, the variety,"" she says. ""Everything is upfront. It's in your face.""\ Which is precisely what many love about the place. Jamaica can be a hassle, but it's never dull, and it's certainly never contrived.\ ""Jamaica has tremendous energy and diversity. It's easy to find a piece of every island in the Caribbean here,"" says Jamaican Gordon ""Butch"" Stewart, chairman of Sandals resorts. ""We've had a bad history of inner-city (violence). But the biggest complaint from people who go to other islands is that (those islands) lack energy.""\ Christopher Baker, author of several Caribbean guidebooks, agrees. ""It's easy to find places in the Caribbean where the culture is like marshmallow,"" he says. ""There's nothing marshmallow about Jamaica. It's all sharp edges.""\ Tourism officials say they have made strides in curbing annoyances, most notably the often relentless hustling by street sellers. Penalties for ""aggressive selling"" in the principal tourist areas of Montego Bay, Ocho Rios and Negril were increased to fines of up to $2,500 or nine months in jail. Officials concede convictions are difficult to get, but they say the threat has been a deterrent.\ They add that reported crimes against tourists, which account for a tiny fraction of the offenses on the island, dropped to 161 last year (from a high of 510 in 1993). The incidents ranged from petty theft to armed robbery.\ A little common sense on the part of tourists would prevent many of those cases, says Harry Knowles, a consultant to the Jamaica Tourist Board. ""Every town has a wrong side of the tracks. If everyone who traveled took the same precautions they took at home, there wouldn't be many problems.""\ Stepped-up police bike patrols to complement foot patrols in busy tourist areas have further reduced harassment, Knowles says.\ Still, to stroll down Montego Bay's commercial ""Hip Strip"" or through Ocho Rios' crowded streets or along the powdery expanse of Negril's 7-mile-long beach is to walk a gantlet of purveyors of wooden carvings, guide services, hair braiding, glass-bottom boat rides, ""ganja"" (marijuana) and coke (not the diet kind).\ On a quiet road snaking west to Negril, a tourist is surprised to find a man on the pavement waving what appears to be a wooden carving. When she slows to avoid hitting him, he approaches the car window, clutching two fat brown marijuana ""buds"" and a pitch of ""Only $30 U.S.!""\ At a beachfront hotel in Negril, a security guard approaches a male guest. ""You want a Jamaican girl?"" he asks. ""Actually, I'd rather have coffee,"" the guest says. It's 7 a.m.\ If the hustlers come on strong, it's because tourists have nurtured that behavior, say some involved in the tourism sector. Touts wouldn't be hustling if there weren't a demand for what they sell. On the other side of the fence, tourists bring their own offensive behavior. Toni Allen, an American of Jamaican descent who lives near Ocho Rios, reacted in horrified dismay recently when she saw a tourist waving a $10 bill at her daughter in exchange for a photo of the girl.\ Some keep coming back\ But Jamaica aficionados who vacation here year after year take the hustle in stride. Among them is Wayne Lawson, who traded St. Barts, St. John and St. Thomas in favor of Jamaica eight years ago.\ ""We happen to like the people a lot,"" says the executive director of the Ohio Arts Council, who rents a villa with friends once or twice a year. ""There are people who don't understand it. They'll say, 'I went eight years ago and had a terrible time.' That's like saying you went to New York eight years ago, got mugged and won't ever go back. You're missing a lot of culture.""\ Linda Smith, who runs a villa-rental business, agrees that the irrepressible spirit of the Jamaican people is what lured her to the island and is what keeps her doing business here. The U.S. press, she says, does ""a hatchet job"" on Jamaica. ""You see headlines saying 'Island of Crime' when it's drug lords in Kingston fighting against each other 150 miles away from the (touristed) north coast.""\ Likewise, Liz Roberts, an American artist who moved to the island a decade ago, grows frustrated when she hears the latest trouble-in- paradise stories. She is dining at a small seaside restaurant in Ocho Rios with two other American residents of the island, and the talk grows animated as they discuss the fallout generated by Kirschhoch's disappearance.\ ""You can't take these isolated incidents and generalize them to all of Jamaica,"" Roberts says. ""These things could happen in Miami, anywhere. People come here for two weeks, and they make the mistake of thinking people are stupid and they can get away with anything. It's an island, not a theme park.""\ But about half the tourists (a higher percentage than on any other Caribbean island) seek a safe, controlled environment in one of Jamaica's 48 all-inclusive resorts -- the theme parks of the lodging industry.\ At Sandals Dunn's River Resort, couples (mostly honeymooners this time of year) cavort on the beach, but relatively few venture outside the gates on their own. Nikki Hilderley, a honeymooning fourth-grade teacher from Ann Arbor, Mich., sips a gin-and-tonic at the beach bar and declares she has no plans to leave the grounds, save for an escorted outing or two. ""There's really no reason to leave.""\ A few guests, such as Frank Walters, a Washington, D.C., school system employee, rent cars to take independent excursions.\ ""I don't want to be secluded. I don't like being talked to in U.S. dollars,"" he says the day after venturing out to a nighttime reggae concert 50 miles away in Montego Bay. ""So we figured out how to stay (at an all-inclusive) and make it local. You just use your common sense and inquisitiveness."""
138," Is it just me, or are the presidential candidates going out of their way not to talk about oil? Given the high price of crude, given the growing vulnerability of the global oil system, and given that many voters believe that Iraq is at least a little bit about oil, you'd expect to see energy policy at the center of the campaign. Yet aside from a few early jabs, there's been no substantive debate about our obsolete energy system, skyrocketing consumption or total uncertainty as to where we're going to get all the oil we will need 10 years from now.\ Lefties and conspiracy cranks blame this silence on Big Oil and Coal, whose influence, we're told, is so pervasive that no politician dares even mention the E-word. Although there's some truth in that notion, the main reason is far less complex -- and more discouraging: Voters simply don't care.\ For starters, energy crises simply aren't as painful as they used to be. We're not only wealthier than we were during the 1973-to- 1974 oil embargo but, as a society, more energy efficient. That means energy's hit on our wallets is smaller. For every dollar of disposable income, Americans spend less than 2.5 cents on gasoline - - too little, apparently, to make us change our energy habits. Despite record gas prices in 2004, consumption was up 1 percent over 2003. Sales of gas-guzzling SUVs and pickup trucks grew by 8.3 percent.\ But there's more at play here than pocketbook economics. Even with falling relative costs, most Americans know that our oil- dominated energy system isn't running smoothly. We know that oil and other fossil fuels harm the environment. We know we're importing more oil every year and thus relying more on a global system that, as Iraq demonstrates daily, is wide open to political strife. Above all, we know our energy habits aren't exactly prudent. How many of us were truly shocked by reports that our cars are less fuel- efficient each year, or that, since 1980, the number of miles we drive has more than doubled, even as population grew just 17 percent?\ The trouble is, awareness isn't the same as action. Even if we know our energy system is in trouble, we're largely unwilling to change our ways, mainly because we believe that ""smart"" energy policy means giving up our lifestyle.\ When politicians correctly declare that America needs a new energy policy, we picture ourselves driving tiny cars; riding crowded, smelly buses; and, generally, living not like Americans but Europeans, or worse. And that's a prospect that doesn't play well in Peoria.\ The Bush administration figured this out early. When he unveiled his boss' new national energy policy in 2001, Vice President Dick Cheney openly ridiculed ""conservation"" while extolling plans to boost oil production and thus sustain the American ""way of life."" And although President Bush did eventually promise fuel cells and a hydrogen economy, that was mainly to distract us from the far more practical step of raising efficiency in existing cars.\ By contrast, Sen. John F. Kerry was a bit slower on the uptake. This spring, Kerry tried to nail Bush for his oil industry ties. But White House strategists shrewdly countered by harping on Kerry's support for a gas tax increase 10 years ago. Voters, it turns out, are far more scared of a higher gasoline tax than of political cronyism.\ Put another way, energy policy rarely wins you votes, but it surely can lose them for you -- a lesson even Kerry seems to have finally grasped. After proposing in June an intriguing new program to boost efficiency -- with heavy incentives for consumers who buy fuel-efficient cars and funding to help Detroit build smarter vehicles -- Kerry has been fairly quiet on the issue of energy.\ Indeed, despite the fact that our energy system is just as obsolete, just as prone to collapse and just as in need of upgrading as it was before the campaign, chances are that energy will soon disappear entirely as a political issue.\ It may reemerge, but not until some new disruption sends prices into the stratosphere, threatens the economy and gets the voters sufficiently riled. Then, politicians might be willing to talk about energy. Unless, of course, it happens in an election year.\ Roberts is the author of ""The End of Oil"" (Houghton Mifflin, 2004). *"
139," Imagine this scenario 20 years from now: There is no third crossing of Hampton Roads harbor. Traffic keeps the speed limit on Interstate 64 below 45 mph for much of the day. Two-thirds of all local road projects determined to be necessary as far back as 1997 remain unbuilt, nothing but wishful thinking for miles and miles of frustrated drivers.\ It's not such an imaginary future, say local and state planners, politicians and business leaders. It's exactly what will happen unless Virginia can find literally billions of dollars of new revenue for the state's transportation network.\ Don't tell that to Virginia's two gubernatorial candidates. Democrat Don Beyer and his Republican competitor, Jim Gilmore, have spent much of the political season this year touting their optimistic predictions of how much money economic growth will funnel into the state over the next few years. They've both gone so far as to propose drastically easing the burden of the personal property tax, pledging at the same time that they will be able to maintain the basic government services such as education and law enforcement that the tax helps pay for.\ What the candidates talk about far less expansively is broadening government services, something an increasingly vocal group of critics say will be necessary on several fronts for Virginia's students to get good jobs, for its families to lead safe lives, and for its businesses to flourish.\ Transportation is just one of many areas of need the critics mention, but it's one getting a lot of attention lately, thanks to a particularly bleak report out last month on how many roads are needed and how little money there will be to pay for them.\ ""Poor transportation leads companies to make decisions to go other places,"" said Alan Merten, president of George Mason University and chairman of the Northern Virginia Roundtable, a consortium of business leaders that has criticized both gubernatorial candidates for proposing tax reductions. ""Employees of companies believe in high quality of life, and an extensive and awkward commute is a deterrent to that. People don't want to spend hours in their cars.""\ According to a report produced in August for a General Assembly panel studying the state's transportation needs, that's exactly what will happen if more money isn't found soon to spend on transportation. Virtually every conceivable type of transportation infrastructure already is underfunded, the report says - and the problem will only get worse.\ Interstate highways need to be widened; bridges need to be built; public transit systems should be expanded in both urban and rural parts of Virginia. New connector roads are considered necessary near Richmond, around Washington and in Chesapeake. In Hampton Roads, more than $12 billion will be needed for road construction over the next 20 years - a sizable chunk of the $47 billion needed across Virginia. And yet less than half that amount will be available if no new money is found, the report says.\ ""There would absolutely be no new Hampton Roads crossing,"" said Dwight Farmer, director of transportation for the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission and the principal author of the statewide report. ""We probably wouldn't finish the widenings on 64 on the Peninsula. On the Southside, there would be no midtown tunnel. Basically, two-thirds of what's out there won't get built.""\ The last time Virginia probed so deeply into its transportation needs was more than a decade ago, under then-Gov. Gerald L. Baliles. What frightens some leaders today is that the picture wasn't as grim then, yet it prompted the General Assembly to approve three tax increases - 2.5 percentage points on the state gasoline tax, a half- point on the sales tax and one point on the vehicle titling tax.\ To say that some kind of a highway-dedicated tax increase would come in handy today is rather an understatement, Farmer said. According to his report, it would take another 41-cent increase of the gas tax to fund all the unmet road needs of the next 20 years. ""That's how big this problem is,"" he said.\ ""One is almost tempted to say, `We'll just adjourn and let our children take care of it,' "" Del. William P. Robinson Jr., a Democrat from Norfolk who chairs the Commission on the Future of Transportation in Virginia, said last month upon hearing Farmer's dire presentation.\ And so it is all the more troubling, say a growing number of leaders, that the two men running for governor have spent much of their time pledging not to raise taxes - and downplaying the need for more government services.\ ""These are not nice-to-haves or wants,"" Hampton Mayor James L. Eason said recently. ""These have been documented by state transportation people. And we can't do it ourselves. You would hope that there would be leaders on the state level who would support us.""\ On the contrary, retorts Gilmore, state leadership needs to restrain itself and not spend too much of the public's money. And Gilmore questioned just how necessary Farmer's list of needs really is.\ ""I believe that everybody in the Commonwealth, including members of the press, ought to take a close look at that report instead of taking it at face value,"" Gilmore said. ""Let's see how they created their numbers and how they created their demands.""\ Gilmore also has turned to the national debate over how federal gasoline tax revenue is divided among the states as a potential solution to the state's transit woes.\ Currently, Virginia gets back 79 cents' worth of highway funding for every dollar it sends to Washington in gas tax, while a number of other states, many of them in the Northeast, receive more than they pay.\ ""We need to make sure that we get back the federal gas tax,"" Gilmore said, echoing the position of two fellow Republicans, Sen. John Warner and Gov. George Allen. ""It would come in the tens of millions if not the hundreds of millions and would allow us to do the work that we haven't been able to do.""\ The trouble is, say transportation officials, even if Virginia got most of that revenue back, it wouldn't amount to much more than $150 million - far short of the $1.5 billion annual shortfall that already exists between what the state needs for construction and what it can actually afford to build. According to Farmer, that gap will reach $3 billion by 2015. Short of a massive overhaul of how highways are paid for, it will remain up to Virginia to close the bulk of the gap.\ ""The biggest source of road money in Virginia is Virginia,"" said George Homewood, a former planning director for York County who has followed the debate over federal funding formulas.\ Like Gilmore, Beyer advocates a greater return on what Virginia pays in federal gas tax. But he qualifies that support by saying ""that's not a complete answer,"" agreeing with the notion that state- level solutions are needed when it comes to transportation.\ Also, Beyer provides other answers on how to move people around. He would like to see the private sector play a greater role building new roads; he wants to encourage more telecommuting; and he wants smarter planning of new development to curb the growth of suburban sprawl.\ For example, Beyer said, a proposal to build another highway loop around Northern Virginia is a good one - but there are good and bad ways to build it.\ ""There is already a great deal of congestion outside the Beltway, and a new road could help alleviate that congestion,"" Beyer said. ""But we don't need to build it through farmland,"" which simply opens more land up to more development, he said.\ The true transportation test for the two candidates could be coming this month, when the Commission on the Future of Transportation is supposed to produce a recommendation for the General Assembly. If the recommendation includes a proposal to raise taxes, the gubernatorial candidates will be under more pressure than ever to explain why they think that's not necessary.\ ""I believe we do need a tax increase,"" Newport News Mayor Joe Frank said recently. ""You can look at opinion polls and set your policy based on popular opinion - nobody wants a tax increase; I don't want a tax increase. But there are true needs out there. I'm not suggesting that every project needs to be funded. But I'm also not proposing that state policy be based on wishful thinking.""\ ASK THE CANDIDATES\ Q: For 40 years, we've been building interstates and highways. High-speed rail can carry thousands of people at less cost and a lot faster cars. What's your plan for public transportation in Hampton Roads? - Thelma Hill, Newport News\ Jim Gilmore responds:\ A: ""A top priority of my plan to keep Virginia's economy moving forward ... is my absolute commitment to the Third Crossing, connecting Newport News to Norfolk. A third tunnel ... will significantly alleviate traffic congestion in Hampton Roads. As governor, I will work closely with Senator Warner and Virginia's powerful congressional delegation to address the needs of Hampton Roads.\ ""I intend to examine building a light rail system for the Tidewater area. The Tidewater Transportation District Commission's recent award of a design and engineering grant to plan the rail line linking Norfolk and Virginia Beach should help to illuminate all of the factors that are involved in successful public transport.\ ""I also believe that many of our transportation problem areas can be addressed by making better use of existing facilities. Fixing structural trouble spots, cracking down on aggressive drivers, and removing the burdensome property tax on cars and trucks, thereby allowing Virginians to purchase more efficient vehicles, are all policy initiatives which will take place in the Gilmore administration.""\ Don Beyer responds:\ A: ""I will demand Virginia's fair share of federal funding for transportation. Virginia currently only receives 84 cents on the dollar. I support the Streamlined Transportation Efficiency Program for the 21st century, or STEP 21 initiative, that would guarantee that Virginia would receive at least 95 cents for every dollar we send to Washington.\ ""I will develop the first comprehensive plan to coordinate roads, rail, ports, airports, and public transportation, which will make every transportation dollar count.\ ""As we carefully consider our transportation opportunities, we must consider the benefits of light rail.\ ""I will work with Virginia's congressional delegation to secure additional funding to complete the study.\ ""I will support the Hampton Roads port's major expansion [financed by bonds], which will double its capacity by 2010 and create hundreds of new jobs.""\ HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE CANDIDATES?\ Ever wish politicians would answer your questions?

140,"When the Virginian Pilot, Bob McDonnell's ""hometown"" newspaper, endorses his opponent, it is time for Virginians to sit up and take notice. Here are a few of the issues to consider:\1. Education: Creigh Deeds wants to raise teachers' salaries to the national average. McDonnell opposes raising teachers' salaries and is against funding smaller class size that would improve education.\2. Transportation: Deeds is willing to admit that raising the gas tax might be necessary to help pay for crucial transportation improvements. McDonnell advocates taking money from education, health care and law enforcement.\3. Clean water: Deeds wrote legislation to reduce runoff and wants new standards to improve water quality. McDonnell voted against programs that would control water pollution, as well as closing landfills that pollute ground water.\4. Green space: Deeds created the Land Conservation Tax Credit that preserved thousands of acres of green space. McDonnell voted against a bond referendum that would fund park and recreational facilities; he has taken more money from developers than any other industry and supported a developer who wanted to build on 180 acres of wetlands.\5. Clean energy: Among other things, Deeds has sponsored and supported legislation supporting green business; he is in favor of creating green jobs. McDonnell's energy plan was described by the Roanoke Times as ""far more suited to the 1950s than today."" He voted against tax incentives for energy-efficient appliances.\6. Coal/offshore drilling: Deeds is concerned about the environmental impact of mountaintop mining and supports offshore drilling only if it can be done without harming the environment. McDonnell opposes pollution control equipment for coal-fired power plans and supports offshore drilling as a way to pay for his transportation plan.\7. Choice: Deeds is pro-choice and wants Virginians to have access to comprehensive, affordable reproductive health care. McDonnell opposes a woman's right to choose and says abortion should be made illegal, even in the case of rape or incest.\For me, the alternative is clear. Creigh Deeds might not be as smooth-talking as his opponent, but he's a real person, not a slick candidate who will promise you anything to get elected on Nov. 3.\NANCY CARTER CRUMP Staunton"
141," The debate over Virginia's tax system expanded Monday to include another major player: the Senate's chief budget writer, who wants a more massive overhaul than Gov. Mark R. Warner has proposed.\ Sen. John H. Chichester, R-Stafford, wants to raise the general sales tax, the gasoline excise tax, cigarette taxes and the vehicle registration fee. The wealthy would pay more income taxes. Upper- income elderly people would lose a significant tax break.\ What Chichester's plan pays for is equally dramatic.\ It would eliminate the car tax in 2005 on the first $20,000 of a vehicle's value, a major promise made in 1998 that has stalled because of the recession.\ It would pump more money into public schools, providing funding for elementary art, music and physical education teachers, more planning time for teachers, technology training and help for schools in poor areas.\ It would eliminate the critical-care waiting list for mentally retarded people -- a vulnerable population who are literally a heartbeat away from trouble. Many are full-grown ""children"" being cared for by aging parents.\ It would increase funding for water quality and the environment, and it would funnel more money to the rainy day fund. The latter move is considered important for Virginia to keep its top AAA bond rating, a seal of approval from Wall Street that makes it less expensive to borrow money and easier to attract businesses from other states.\ Finally, it addresses transportation in a major way -- a net increase of $725 million per year that Chichester says is needed to put Virginia's crumbling highway network back on the right course.\ Chichester, who chairs the Finance Committee, said the state must take advantage of the economic recovery.\ ""I think we need to be aggressive, especially in a new economy,"" he said at a morning press briefing, ""a new economy that's seen renewal, that's beginning to move back.""\ Chichester's plan is more massive than Warner's on its face, costing more and giving back more. It represents the voice of the GOP's more moderate wing, one that says lawmakers must make sizeable investments in education and other basics to avoid falling behind other states.\ It is sure to clash with more conservative, anti-tax Republicans who say a tax increase is precisely the wrong medicine.\ This view, which is more prominent in the House of Delegates, says lawmakers should rein in government spending, keep a lid on taxes and allow the economy to thrive. That would help business owners and the poor alike.\ House Speaker William J. Howell holds this view. Howell could not be reached for comment Monday.\ Warner said he hadn't seen all the details of Chichester's plan, but his office would analyze it over the coming days. The Democratic governor is more philosophically aligned with the John Chichesters of the Republican Party.\ ""I think it is another attempt to put a solution on the table,"" said Warner, ""and I welcome it. I welcome other plans so we can have a full debate. These are debates about solutions as opposed to some of the critics who have simply said no. No is not an answer in this debate.""\ There are several important differences between Chichester's plan and that proposed by the governor.\ Chichester's plan raises more money -- $2.5 billion in 2006 as opposed to Warner's $541 million that same year. The senator's plan offers quicker tax relief, phasing out the car tax next year. Warner's plan would fully eliminate the tax in 2008.\ Warner isn't proposing a gas tax increase, although he's not ruling out supporting one.\ Warner has one higher income tax bracket for the wealthy while Chichester has two. Both plans increase personal exemptions and standard deductions. Both phase out the elderly tax deduction for wealthier senior citizens, although there are differences in the details.\ Generally, one of the biggest differences is in transportation. Warner wants to stabilize Virginia's highway budget while Chichester wants to increase it.\ Chichester said the increased gas tax, registration fees and other measures would increase the cost of owning and operating a vehicle, on the average, by about $107 a year.\ Later in the day, Warner and Chichester appeared at a fund- raiser for the Foundation for Virginia, which will mount a campaign to rally support for education funding.\ Chaired by CNU President Paul S. Trible Jr., the foundation attracted 700 people for a downtown lunch gathering and was expected to raise between $550,000 and $600,000. It was a bipartisan gathering that included several Republican lawmakers, including Del. James H. Dillard II, R-Fairfax.\ Dillard said he hadn't seen Chichester's plan, but he welcomed a proposal to increase investment.\ ""I think,"" he said, ""there's a certain point where, if you just say no, it will hurt the party.""\ DETAILS OF CHICHESTER'S PLAN\ Here are some major components of the tax changes proposed Monday by Sen. John H. Chichester:\ INCOME TAX\ * Increases personal exemption from $800 to $1,000. Increases standard deduction from $3,000 to $3,500 for single filers and from $5,000 to $7,000 for joint filers.\ * Adds upper income brackets of 6.25 percent for taxable income between $100,000 and $150,000, 6.5 percent for taxable income over $150,000\ * Phases out a tax preference for some taxpayers age 62 and above. It reduces their tax break dollar for dollar as incomes rise above $40,000 for single filers. Taxpayers already 62 or above would not be affected by this measure.\ TRANSPORTATION-RELATED\ * Gas tax goes from 17.5 cents to 20.5 cents\ * Diesel tax goes from 16 cents to 20.5 cents\ * Title tax goes from 3 percent to 5.5 percent of the sales price, although the tax would no longer apply to trade-in value.\ * Raises vehicle registration fee by $10\ OTHER TAXES\ * Eliminates the car tax for personal-use vehicles valued up to $20,000, effective next year\ * Eliminates the estate tax\ * No longer requires businesses to submit sales tax receipts one month ahead of schedule.\ SALES TAXES\ * Raises the general sales tax from 4.5 cents to 5.5 cents on the dollar\ * Reduces the sales tax on food from 4 cents to 2 cents\ NEW FUNDING\ * Additional money targeted for public schools\ * Requires annual deposits to the Water Quality Improvement Fund and the Virginia Land Conservation Fund\ * Eliminates the critical-care waiting list for mentally retarded people who need help\ * Replenishes the rainy day fund\ * Provides $400 million to avoid further cuts in core government services"
142,"Adams for change\I am writing in response to the Sept. 23 article about the Hampton sheriff candidate forum. I appreciate coverage of this forum and the election as a whole. The position of sheriff is an important one, and voters deserve information that will help them make an informed decision at the poll.\Sheriff B.J. Roberts' remark that Jim Adams is ""running against the things he had an opportunity to help with"" is laughable. And these ""things,"" staff morale and responsible spending among them, are not easy fixes. Even with Adams' input, they would require the long-term attention of the sheriff to develop and oversee improvement plans.\And so Adams is not running against past grievances, but for his chance to lead the Hampton sheriff's office in such a way that empowers the staff to contribute ideas and opinions. He sees a need for change and is pursuing the course that will allow his voice to be heard.\Stacy Adams\Norfolk\Snake's head\It seems that on every level of government our elected officials are following their own agendas at the expense of the voters who supported them.\A perfect example is in the York District of Gloucester County, where Teresa Altemus, at the head of the ""Gang of Four,"" attempted to hijack the Board of Supervisors and remake it in her image. She has used her pack of lawyers to beat up on the voters while making a mockery of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Altemus has made it crystal clear how elected officials have made it impossible to remove them from office by any other means than the vote.\That said, November is fast coming, and Gloucester can take back its government by cutting the head off the snake to let the other three know their time is coming as well. You can fool some people all of the time, all the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time.\R.J. Glaser\Williamsburg\Borden's integrity\Previous to and on Jan. 2, 2008, actions were taken by some members of the Gloucester Board of Supervisors that were inappropriate and appeared to be vindictive. These actions have negatively impacted and compromised the governing of the county and created among its citizens an atmosphere of anger and mistrust.\The voters of York District now have an opportunity to begin to rectify this untenable situation.\Carter Borden's generous offer to serve on this board involves personal sacrifice and no personal ambition. His integrity and honesty are in no way questionable.\I urge support for Borden's candidacy as the welfare of York District and the welfare of Gloucester County are one and the same.\George R. Hayes\Gloucester Point\Pay the piper\No one wants to raise taxes. Everyone wants to allow individuals and families to keep what they earn, especially those in the middle- and lower-income categories, especially in times of recession and high unemployment. Further, any hint of a tax increase is a political ""third rail,"" especially in Virginia. Candidates suggest it at their peril.\Fully aware of that, Creigh Deeds nonetheless leaves on the table a possible increase in Virginia's gas tax. In the long run that will help our economy and environment with less dependence on foreign oil and lower harmful emissions. But in the short run there will be major economic benefits from less congestion on our roads and a transportation infrastructure in good repair. Commerce requires it.\According to the American Petroleum Institute (July 2009), on state gasoline taxes Virginia ranks 40th. Our gas tax is nearly 50 percent below the national average. People who oppose any tax increase at all may be pleased, but they cannot then complain about congestion, crumbling roads and bridges and closed rest areas. Increasing the gas tax by a penny per year for nine years would still leave us below the current national average.\Starving transportation, stealing money from our children's education and selling liquor stores for short-term road patches is, to be generous, a failure of leadership. We have to pay the piper. Now. We can't afford to kick this can down an already crumbling road. That may appease a party's base, but it will not appease the piper. Opponents of reliable funding for transportation leave all of us in peril. Deeds, Jody Wagner and Steve Shannon are real leaders, risking the ""third rail"" for the good of the commonwealth.\Tom Goodale\Lanexa\McDonnell's vision\Creigh Deeds has turned in desperation to smear tactics in a last-ditch effort to gain ground. Every ad run on television and radio has to do with negative content toward Bob McDonnell (often with little or no facts to support them). Deeds may be better served to tell everyone what he will do rather than what he claims McDonnell has done.\McDonnell has clear-cut opinions, visions and plans to solve our problems. Are they all the correct solutions? Maybe not, but at least he's not afraid to state his positions. Deeds represents the type of leadership we now have on the national level. This is not what Virginia needs during these troubled financial times.\On Election Day, show up and vote for McDonnell, a man not afraid to tell us what he believes in, not smear his opponent.\Ken Lewis\Newport News\Deeds' platform?\I would like Creigh Deeds to give us some idea of what he would do for Virginia if elected. So far, his only motivation seems to be to make us believe Bob McDonnell will do some bad things to hurt women. Deeds should give us information on what he would do if elected.\Ed Fly\Hampton\Turning back clock\I have worked since I was a 16-year-old teenager. I worked my way through college. I worked for a major airline for more than 24 years, until it went into bankruptcy in 1989.\So for 31 years, up until 1989, I was a ""working woman."" Taking care of my own bills, getting married and helping provide, along with my husband, for our two children.\Now I see that the Republican candidate for governor wrote a thesis in 1989 that ""working women are a detriment to society."" By 1989 women had made many gains: the right to vote, advancement in the work place and running for public office. But we had politicians here in Virginia who wanted to turn back the clock on women.\Even as a state delegate Bob McDonnell sponsored 35 bills to block women from having the right to choose and make personal medical decisions and to outlaw birth control. These bills were against grown, working women.\Now McDonnell's thesis has appeared, and he refuses to tell us if he has changed his backward ideas.\I am shocked, dismayed and angry that someone, especially a candidate for governor, is trying to take women back to the dark ages.\As governor, McDonnell's prime accomplishments would be turning back the clock on women's accomplishments and taking away the hard-fought progress we have achieved.\Linda G. Brooks\Newport News"
143," Amendment will create lawsuit bonanza\ The second paragraph of ballot question #1, the proposed ""Marriage Amendment"" to our state constitution, states: ""the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage.""\ In a 13-page opinion, Virginia Attorney General Robert McDonnell argues that it would not negatively affect property rights, wills, advance medical directives (living wills), shared equity agreements, group insurance policies or application of domestic violence laws to unmarried couples.\ Many legal scholars and jurists disagree, including Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a conservative Virginian, whose recent essay against the amendment cautions voters to ""leave constitutions alone."" (""Hands off constitutions,"" Washington Post, Sept. 5.)\ McDonnell's comments on rights ""inherent"" in marriage suggest that the amendment is meant to undermine guardianship or custody arrangements for children of unmarried couples and to deny unmarried couples the right to privately purchase family insurance against accident or illness, or to benefit from other family plans and benefits.\ Such distinctions do not benefit society as a whole, and they are clearly discriminatory. Given previous court decisions asserting constitutional rights to equal protection, the proposed amendment is unlikely to survive judicial review. However, once enacted, Virginia will be obliged to defend the amendment, spending years and countless dollars on legal proceedings.\ Those who framed the amendment claim that it is necessary to protect Virginia's statutory definition of marriage against ""activist"" judges. However, as Wilkinson points out, passage of this amendment will invite judicial interpretation of virtually every aspect of private agreements among unmarried individuals.\ I urge every voter to read the fine print of the proposed amendment, consider its moral, legal and financial implications and vote ""no"" on ballot question #1 on Nov. 7.\ Christine Faia\ Williamsburg *\ Raise tax on gas\ It mystifies me that our legislature cannot agree on how the state should finance our road system. Those who use them should pay for them. Those who use them most should pay more. If one chooses to drive a low-mileage vehicle, that is their choice, but do not expect others to subsidize that choice.\ We all are responsible for the whole state. Common sense tells me, as do those I have discussed the problem with, that increasing the gas tax is the way to go, dedicating the increase to road repair and construction. This does not require tollbooth construction (or added bureaucracy and toll collectors). It involves adjusting the price at the pumps, which we all know can be readily done. If the present road tax is not so dedicated, it should be.\ Our latest experience with high cost-per-gallon has shown that we will not be devastated by a gas tax increase. Perhaps some positives might even occur, such as driving more fuel-efficient cars and trucks, continuing to be thoughtful in how we run errands, maybe even using public transportation.\ I would hope our representatives will look at the mess we are headed toward (and already have in many areas) and return to Richmond next session and come to an agreement that makes sense. Some will have to explain to unrealistic constituents that a change of mind was in their best interests.\ Raise the money by taxing the users of the roads. Raise the gas tax across the whole state of Virginia.\ Joyce Goodrich\ Newport News\ Unconstitutional\ I am writing to address the Marshall/Newman amendment that will be on the November ballot. The proposed amendment to the Virginia state constitution would keep same-sex couples from acquiring the same benefits as heterosexual, married couples.\ Despite the current legislation, people feel the need to further restrict these couples' rights by adding it to the state constitution.\ I believe that there should be no laws against same-sex marriage, whether on a state or national level. Under the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment, the government must treat everyone equally, regardless of race, gender, religion, etc. The states are prohibited from discrimination, or from allowing one group of people to do a certain activity, but not another group.\ Passing this amendment disallowing same-sex marriage is unequal treatment and therefore is unconstitutional.\ Ashley Burford\ Gloucester\ All wrong on Davis\ I disagree with George Coussoulos' Sept. 28 letter, ""Davis' limitations."" He believes that elimination of the estate tax is wrong because the wealthy are wealthy and for no other reason. The fact that these people have already paid federal tax on this money is immaterial. He believes that taxing them again is not patently unfair once they are dead.\ He also finds fault with Rep. Jo Ann Davis voting against increasing the requirements of the C.A.F.E. Act (Corporate Average Fuel Economy). It is one thing to mandate an average figure. It is a whole different ballgame to achieve it. As an area service manager for the Chevrolet Motor Division of General Motors for 28 years, I know firsthand the problems and cost. These are things the ""pie-in-the-sky"" theorists don't understand; everything has a price.\ I agree that the search for alternate fuels is a good idea. Hydrogen is a good example, if someone can come up with a way to keep it from being so explosive if a car has an accident.\ And then there is the matter of stem-cell research. This should be a privately funded program. Anytime the government gets involved in such a program, costs go sky high. It takes at least 10 times as many people doing the work for the government as it would for private enterprise to get the same results. The government at the same time should not control the number of stem- cell chains available.\ Coussoulos also makes a point that Davis is not an ""independent thinker."" After seeing his independent thinking, thank God she is not. She sure has my vote and my wife's to counter his and his wife's.\ W. D. McClure\ Urbanna\ Foley repercussions\ In the wake of the latest scandal to rock the Republican mother ship, I'm weary of the accusations that Democrats are gleefully politicizing the bad news. Of course we are all (I hope) appalled when anyone of any party uses public office to turn their power- struck young assistants into personal play-toys. Add to that the complicit protection offered to the predator rather than the victims, and the parent in all of us will go straight for the jugular. But the wider impact of the scandal comes from a deeper, cumulative outrage at the moral bankruptcy of this Congress and administration.\ The self-described ""party of values"" has been given pass after pass for its deceit, incompetence and corruption in conducting the Iraq war, for its relentless fear-mongering, for its neglect of the needs of all but the wealthiest Americans, for its failure to protect the environment, for its favors to big oil and big money, for alienating our allies around the world. The consequences will reverberate for generations to come.\ For those of us who have felt disenfranchised, then ignored, then betrayed by our government, the loosening of this right-wing stranglehold indeed gives us new energy. Forgive us for daring to hope that accountability is just around the corner.\ Elizabeth W. Wilkins\ Yorktown *"

Accompanying stories:Bigger share of bill too much for states, localities;Suggestions for clearing congested highways, skies
\
Samuel Skinner, 51, is secretary of transportation. Last week, the Bush administration unveiled its transportation policy, which will concentrate federal highway dollars on roads ``of national significance.'' It also shifts to states and localities a greater share of the cost of building and maintaining highways. Skinner was interviewed about the new policy by USA TODAY's editorial board.
\
USA TODAY: The nation's travelers have trouble getting around on congested, polluted freeways, across old bridges and in crowded skies. How will your new transportation policy change this?
\
SKINNER: The states now have in black and white a good indication of where the administration stands on a number of issues, which, heretofore, has been either uncertain or a little fuzzy. So any state legislature that says, ``Well, we'll wait for the federal government to do it before we take on our share of the responsibility'' has got to get the message that the federal government is not going to be the panacea to everybody's solutions in transportation.
\
USA TODAY: State and local officials would have to come up with new ideas on how to raise the money. How do you suggest they might do that?
\
SKINNER: They've done a lot already. Had we raised the federal gas tax a couple years ago, we would have basically pre-empted the rights of the states to raise the gas taxes and other user fees. We didn't pre-empt the states, and 18 states last year attempted to raise the gas tax and most were successful. I think 33 states have raised their gas tax in the last two years, or developed some other kind of fund for transportation system financing. And they're going to now have the flexibility to even be more creative in what they want to do.
\
USA TODAY: How should they go about being more creative?
\
SKINNER: Toll roads are a good example. There's no reason we can't have a toll road tied into an interstate with a different type of funding than we've had before. One pleasant surprise I have had is that the private sector is willing to invest in transportation - whether it be the private sector toll road in Virginia, or the high-speed rail link between Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, or the ``maglev'' [magnetically levitated! link between the airport in Orlando and DisneyWorld.
\
USA TODAY: Even with some private funding, state and local officials will have to raise a lot of money. Will the public accept that?
\
SKINNER: Several polls show that if you say, ``I am going to raise money and I can assure you it's going to go to improve the quality of transportation,'' they'll pay for it. The best example is the toll road they opened in Illinois recently. It is above expectations slightly, even though the overall traffic of the system is down.
\
USA TODAY: Why is it so popular?
\
SKINNER: People are saving as much as 40 minutes each way on the trip to and from work. And they're willing to pay for that. So the concept of state and local user fees is one that works, and people are willing to pay. Productivity is too important to them.
\
USA TODAY: Would this plan help reduce pollution of the environment that comes from gas-burning vehicles?
\
SKINNER: Obviously, if we reduce congestion, that, in itself, is going to be a major conservation and environmental effort. All you have to do is go to California and look at the Los Angeles area. A good portion of the environmental pollution is caused by the fact that these people are on the Harbor and the Santa Ana freeways, and everything, for 30 minutes to an hour, is spewing toxics off the exhaust. We also think mass transit facilities that really make sense are going to help. High-speed rail corridors will also have an impact.
\
USA TODAY: What does the plan offer to those who are afraid to drive over the nation's many unsafe bridges?
\
SKINNER: We are pushing forward on a very aggressive program to rebuild the nation's transportation infrastructure, and calling upon the private sector and the states to participate.
\
USA TODAY: Will that approach work?
\
SKINNER: We will be successful if our budgets and the budgets of the states, as well as private-sector involvement, reflect what it's going to take to do it. We've identified the problem. We haven't solved the problem.
\
USA TODAY: The recent rail crash in Philadelphia, where the driver tested positive for cocaine, although the accident was blamed on mechanical problems, raises the issue of drug testing. In what stage is the program?
\
SKINNER: I have been told by knowledgeable people in the transportation industry that, in some segments, there's a very high usage of drugs and we've got to do something about it. We passed and put into law at the end of last year our random drug testing policy, which contains random testing, post- accident testing and pre-employment screening. And those components are different programs for each agency that we have.
\
USA TODAY: Does the program include testing for alcohol as well as for drug use?
\
SKINNER: No. We're looking toward coming up with a rule as it relates to alcohol. It's much more complex than drugs because it is very difficult to detect alcohol in the system on a random basis. We don't have a test that says, ``This person is an alcoholic and was drunk five hours ago when he operated that vehicle.''
\
USA TODAY: What's ahead for Amtrak?
\
SKINNER: We continue to believe that Amtrak should move toward self- sufficiency, that users should pay for the Amtrak system. And that if we want to help Amtrak, we should get rid of some of the disparities that exist that make it very inefficient because of what I call the archaic work rules, as well as some of the insurance requirements and things that make it a very inefficient, labor-intensive system.
\
USA TODAY: How are you going to accomplish that?
\
SKINNER: I've ordered a complete review of passenger rail and the role it should play, including high-speed rail. I anticipate that which is going to be done in conjunction with the transportation research board will be done sometime late this summer or early fall.
\
USA TODAY: Do you see any point at which airline reregulation might become necessary?
\
SKINNER: We're not going to let that happen. I don't foresee that as a reasonable possibility. I never say never, but almost, almost, almost never.
\
USA TODAY: A big concern of motorists is truck safety. Are you making any progress there?
\
SKINNER: All of us who drive recognize that could be a very real problem. We're having our highway traffic safety summit in Chicago in April, where we'll have the top law enforcement official from every state highway patrol in the country present, along with 25 chiefs of police and 25 sheriffs who have major traffic law enforcement responsibilities, along with all of the traffic safety groups. We'll have an open, frank discussion and come up with good recommendations on highway safety.
\
USA TODAY: Why haven't you looked at charging heavy trucks more money for using the roads?
\
SKINNER: We've got a trucking industry we deregulated several years ago. It is working well. We have very little intrastate deregulation. Most of that is still regulated. These companies are really fighting right now to make deregulation work. They have 50 state reporting requirements that they have to go through. So if you operate a truck in interstate commerce, you've got to file 50 state returns. We need a more uniform approach to that. So with all of that, we weren't ready, really, to totally redo how we're going to assess user fees. But that doesn't mean we're not going to take a look at that.

146," U.S. Sen. Charles S. Robb, D-Va., endorsed the idea of a 40-cent hike in the federal gasoline tax Thursday, saying the move would reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, prod automakers to make more fuel efficient cars and help clean up the environment.\ Robb said the measure could be made politically palatable with across-the-board tax credits using money generated by the fuel tax.\ Speaking at William and Mary's Marshall-Wythe School of Law, Robb called the tax ""the closest we'll ever come"" to a silver bullet for cutting the country's ""precarious over-reliance on Middle Eastern oil.""\ ""We owe it to those who fought,"" in the Gulf War, Robb said, to find other sources of energy. Although he described Operation Desert Storm as a war to free Kuwait, the ex-governor of Virginia said, ""we wouldn't have put 500,000 troops in the Gulf if Saudi Arabia's main export were kiwis.""\ Robb outlined a plan that would phase in the 40-cent-per-gallon tax increase on gas over a three-year period - a nickel increase in the first month and a penny increase every month after that. That new money would then be handed back to consumers at the end of the year in the form of a tax rebate.\ Robb said although he'd prefer to use the money to reduce the federal deficit, the tax-credit plan was needed to sway public opinion. He estimated the rebate for a married couple would be about $430 a year when the tax was in full effect.\ ""We would not increase the net taxes on the average family,"" Robb said. ""The conservation tax would simply shift the place where they pay their taxes - from the paycheck to the pump.""\ Robb laid out a domino effect of benefits he said the new tax might create. If drivers felt the pinch, they might use mass transit more, reducing pollutants in the air. Automakers would be pressured to design higher mileage cars, and alternative fuels would become more attractive. From a national security standpoint, he said, less use means less dependence on a volatile region of the world.\ ""Ignoring any plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,"" he said, ""would be irresponsible.""\ Robb said an increase in the gas tax has been kicked around the Capitol for some time. This year, he said, he hopes the issue finds life in the energy or finance committees. He stopped short of saying he would introduce legislation for the tax, but said if no one else raises the issue, he would ""table something to get the discussion started."""
147," ROAD COOPERATION WISE\ Say you're heading south down Norfolk's Hampton Boulevard. You pass through the Midtown Tunnel into Portsmouth and want to head west. The best route is the Western Freeway, but to get to it you must creep more than a mile through residential areas, making numerous turns and stopping at lights. Going the reverse direction, from the highway to the tunnel, is just as hard.\ What's badly needed is a highway between the two, to be called the Pinners Point Connector. It would lighten traffic in historic Portsmouth neighborhoods, provide easier truck access to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal and tie the Midtown Tunnel to the growing suburban areas of Churchland, Western Branch and Suffolk.\ In a move unique in Virginia history, two cities have each committed money to build a highway that runs through only one of the cities. Norfolk has committed $500,000 a year for five years, and Portsmouth $1 million a year for the same period.\ It was an eye-opener when one city, recognizing the regional need for a connector, contributed highway funds to another city. It also was a milestone on the area's road toward regional cooperation.\ Norfolk wasn't being altruistic; it was being wise. ""Access is critical to Norfolk, said Bob Fischbach, government programs director for the city.\ Most of the rest of the cost of the connector would come from $23 million in regional funds committed by the Hampton Roads Mayors and Chairs, $32 million from the state and $55 million to be raised by tolls over as few as seven years.\ Although Hampton Roads is hardly sprinting toward regionalism, it is moving in that direction, and none too soon.\ - The Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk\ LISTEN TO LOCAL BOARDS\ From his first day in office, Gov. George Allen has portrayed the federal government as an enemy occupying force.\ He has said, time and time again, that the decisions affecting people's lives are best made at the local and state level.\ Lately, he's been battling the federal government over Goals 2000, an education program that would distribute $6.7 million to schools throughout Virginia.\ The governor is blocking distribution of the money, claiming that the paperwork that accompanies the program is too burdensome.\ He says the program is an example of federal meddling in local affairs.\ But at last count, 92 of Virginia's 134 school districts have said they want Gov. Allen to accept the Goals 2000 funding.\ The same position has been adopted by the Virginia School Boards Association, the Virginia Education Association, The Virginia Association of School Superintendents and the Virginia Association of Counties.\ Those are local government officials saying they want their local governments to get the money.\ Gov. Allen isn't practicing what he preaches.\ - Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star\ DOLE: THE RIGHT THING\ Bob Dole's surprise announcement that he is resigning from the U.S. Senate as of June 11 after 27 years there may have been a result of political calculus, but it also could serve the nation's best interests.\ The same opinion polls that find many Americans wary of Dole's candidacy also find them weary of Washington gridlock. The government shutdowns during the federal budget impasse exacerbated these worries. So, to the extent that the recent gridlock has been aggravated by presidential politics - and especially by the unprecedented situation in which a congressional leader of one party is challenging a sitting president of another - Dole's resignation removes an impediment to action.\ As for politics, resigning from the Senate obviously frees Dole from his official duties so that he may devote more time to jump- starting his struggling presidential campaign. He has a lock on the GOP nomination, but polls show him badly trailing President Clinton - and ""guilt by association"" with GOP ideologues in Congress hasn't helped Dole define who he is.\ Being free to campaign is no small matter. Three times in the past 20 years, presidential candidates of one party have unseated presidents of the other: In 1976 Jimmy Carter ousted Gerald Ford; in 1980 Ronald Reagan beat Carter; and in 1992 Clinton beat George Bush. Candidates Carter, Reagan, and Clinton - all ex-governors - had left office prior to their successful campaigns.\ Now this World War II military hero can devote himself wholeheartedly to pursuing what many of his admirers perceive as his last real chance to lead the country he loves.\ - Miami (Fla.) Herald\ THE FAA'S CHALLENGE\ Since 109 people were killed Saturday in the crash of a ValuJet passenger jet in the Florida Everglades, U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena has tried hard to reassure nervous travelers that America's airlines and federal regulators are doing all they can to put safety first. But a series of mishaps involving ValuJet planes and other new no-frills airlines is raising hard questions about the ability of start-up companies to deliver maximum safety along with minimum fares.\ Pena's statements certainly have not calmed all air travelers. Among those who appear to be unconvinced is Mary Fackler Schiavo, a high-ranking Transportation Department official quoted this week in Newsweek magazine as expressing concern about the nation's air safety system. Citing ""serious deficiencies in airline inspections, parts and training and in the air traffic control system,"" Schiavo declares that she would not use ""marginal airlines"" for business travel and would avoid ValuJet because of recent safety problems.\ Not yet 3 years old, ValuJet, like Southwest airlines, has built a strong business by offering cut-rate fares with minimal service. But the Atlanta-based carrier has drawn heightened scrutiny from federal aviation authorities for problems with its aging planes. A number of its DC-9s have been involved in troubling incidents.\ Even so, some in the airline industry point out, the safety record of U.S. passenger carriers overall is considered the best in the world.\ It will be some time before investigators pin down the cause of Saturday's tragedy. Whatever the outcome of that probe, problems at ValuJet and other start-up companies such as Kiwi International Air Lines and Leisure Air will present the Federal Aviation Administration with a serious challenge in the near term.\ - Los Angeles Times\ FREE DISNEY ADS\ Synergy. It's the magic word babbled by media moguls and their hangers-on whenever huge media companies merge - thereby increasing the concentration of power in the information business.\ The new corporate giant, they solemnly assure us, will be so much more than the sum of its parts, because of the many ways those parts can enhance one another.\ Synergy, huh? Judging by what's up on ""TGIF,"" ABC's Friday night lineup of sitcoms for kids, you can find ""synergy"" in the dictionary right next to ""shameless.""\ ABC, you may recall, was bought last year by Disney Corp., amid many hosannas to the deal's potential for creative cross- pollination.\ But the early fruits of the Disney-ABC collaboration on ""TGIF"" have a dismal taste. Guess what the characters on two of the shows, ""Boy Meets World"" and ""Step by Step,"" have spent the last two episodes doing? Going to Disney World and, what a surprise, exclaiming endlessly about the wonders therein. The shows are nothing more than program-length ads for the theme park. For the odious ""Step by Step,"" that's almost a step up. But ""Boy Meets World"" has been a charming show that doesn't deserve such debasement. Obviously, Disney's idea of cross-pollination has much less to do with real creativity than with cross-marketing even more relentlessly, if that's possible, its synthetic wares.\ If this is typical of the new media synergy, it may be time to stock up on good novels.\ - Philadelphia Inquirer\ KEEP THE TAX\ The campaign by congressional Republicans to repeal the 1993 gas- tax hike is fiscally and environmentally shortsighted.\ The sooner their efforts to get political mileage out of the issue run out of gas, the better.\ No one likes paying more for gasoline, the cost of which has risen about 20 cents a gallon since February. But repealing President Clinton's 4.3-cent-per gallon surcharge would be a mistake.\ Lowering gas prices only encourages people to drive more, which increases consumption, pollution and our dependence of fossil fuels.\ Efforts to conserve fuel - by purchasing cars that get high gas mileage, car pooling and riding bicycles and buses - have unfortunately taken a back seat to convenience. Rising gas prices that jolt us into rethinking our transportation habits are, to a certain degree, beneficial.\ And let's not forget that the 4.3-cents-per-gallon tax - which raised the overall tax on gas to 18.3 cents per gallon - was instituted to help cut the federal deficit - a worthwhile cause.\ Repealing the tax will require finding another source of revenue to replace the estimated $30 billion to $35 billion that will be lost over seven years. Republicans have suggested selling off broadcast frequencies and cutting Energy Department travel expenses to offset the impact on the budget this year.\ The administration estimates the gas-tax cut would save the average American less than $30 a year. That savings seems meager when weighed against the impact the proposed tax cut would have on the environment and federal budget.\ Republicans should stop using the ill-advised gas-tax cut to fuel their political machinery.\ - The Bellingham (Wash.) Herald"
148," Republican candidate David Sisk on Tuesday attacked Del. George Grayson's record for helping business. Grayson responded that his support for the environment and resistance to the business lobby has created that perception.\ The exchange took place at a forum sponsored by the Williamsburg Area Chamber of Commerce. Del. Shirley F. Cooper, D-York, and her Republican challenger, Jo Ann S. Davis, also answered questions.\ Sisk, whose candidacy for the 97th District House of Delegates seat was endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said the Democratic incumbent is consistently rated low by business organizations and lobbying groups.\ ""As a businessman, I think this is completely unacceptable,"" said Sisk, a James City County supervisor. ""Our businesses deserve better, and our district deserves better.""\ Sisk cited a report from Virginia Free, a nonpartisan firm that does research for business and industry. When considering voting records and business lobbyist evaluations, Grayson earned a 38 on a 100-point scale, with 100 being pro-business.\ Sisk compared that to state Sen. Thomas K. Norment Jr., R-James City, who scored 85, and Del. Alan A. Diamonstein, D-Newport News, who scored 78.\ Grayson, D-James City, said he protects the environment and won't kowtow to big business. He said he alienated some companies by opposing a bill, which failed, preventing local governments from requiring tree ordinances. He said he may have alienated the small business group by supporting a bill requiring two employees in convenience stores at all times.\ Grayson instead sought to focus his message on education, mental health and the environment.\ ""This campaign has focused too much on `who shot John?' and not enough on the issues,"" Grayson said in his opening remarks.\ Another issue that hit home for the audience was the business, professional and occupational license tax. Sisk said he would support basing the tax on net profits, not on total sales or receipts.\ Grayson said he voted to streamline the way the tax is imposed but he couldn't support eliminating it.\ ""I'd like to tell you I support repealing a lot of taxation in the Commonwealth,"" Grayson said. ""But the fact remains that we are 46th when it comes to taxes as a percentage of income.""\ Grayson said all revenue will be important as the area tries to pave its way out of a $3 billion road construction backlog. Grayson said public/private partnerships and light rail systems are part of the answer, but he wouldn't promise he wouldn't raise taxes to help.\ Sisk said the state's economy is growing, and tax money from the prosperity would help pay for road projects. He proposed a regional group to argue for state and federal money. He also said Grayson voted to cut $250 million from the state transportation budget in 1991.\ Grayson said road congestion, if nothing is done about it, can actually slow economic growth. He disputed Sisk's claim that he had cut the transportation budget, saying the money comes from the gas tax and is a fund that can't be touched by the General Assembly.\ ""We have to look at all options,"" Grayson said. ""I think it's irresponsible for an elected official to say `I would never vote for a tax increase.' ""\ In his closing remarks, Sisk said he can do more for business and voters than the 23-year incumbent has.\ ""It is apparent that our delegate's voting record on business issues is out of step with our senator, the Peninsula and the concerns and interests of the people in this room,"" Sisk said.\ Grayson said his office is there for help when people, including businesses, need it.\ ""When the Winery, Go-Karts Plus or Colonial Downs come to me and ask for my support, I give it with every ounce of breath in my body,"" Grayson said. ""I think the business community knows that and has drawn upon it even if they aren't going to vote for me."""

Imagine being allowed to shower only every other day - the day depending on whether your address ended in an odd or even number, because there wasn't enough water.
\
Imagine parking your car in front of the grocery store and sleeping in it overnight to make sure you were the first in line the next morning, because there wasn't enough food.
\
Imagine being restricted to one bank visit each week and being allowed only a $25 withdrawal, because there wasn't enough cash to accommodate everyone.
\
Sounds silly and disconcerting at the same time.
\
Let's go back to the future.
\
The year was 1973. The Arab nations - angry with U.S. support for Israel - had imposed a total ban on oil to us. For five months, many of the USA's 124 million drivers took turns filling their gas tanks on odd or even days, slept in their cars and settled for less fuel. Many of the comforts of life we'd taken for granted were suddenly taken away. It made us angry and it made us consider better ways.
\
Among them: conserving energy, alternative sources, lower speed limits, gas-tax hikes and offshore oil drilling.
\
But the oil glut of the 1980s let us off the hook and, as the urgency dissipated, so did our concern.
\
Now, however, disturbing signs are again on the horizon, and President Bush in the next few weeks is expected to make the difficult decision of whether to allow new oil drilling off the USA's coastlines for the first time in eight years.
\
Opponents, including the writer across the page, say offshore drilling will lead to more oil spills, more tanker traffic and accidents, and more destruction to our environment.
\
There's no question the environment is a top priority.
\
There's no question fears of oil spills are real, conjuring up images of black goo lapping on once-pristine shores.
\
There's also no question we need to wean ourselves from dependency on foreign oil and look for more domestic sources. One of those sources is from offshore oil exploration. But, as Bush has indicated in the past, ``environmentally sensitive'' areas must be exempt. Only small areas where the likelihood of oil is high should be considered. And all steps to protect the environment must be taken.
\
Why drill now? We need the oil.
\
- U.S. reliance on foreign oil has grown from 36% in 1973 to 45% in 1990. Energy experts predict foreign imports will grow to 65% by the mid- 1990s.
\
- Domestic oil consumption is growing - 2.5% to 3% since the mid-1980s. But domestic oil production is falling rapidly - a 6.8% drop from 1988 to 1989 alone.
\
- Oil imports widen our trade deficit and can give other countries leverage over our foreign policy.
\
Drilling is safe. A 1985 study shows oil from tanker accidents accounts for 45% of water pollution, city and industrial waste 36%, and oil from offshore drilling 2%. Ninety percent of imported oil is transported by tanker; 95% of offshore oil is brought in through pipelines.
\
But offshore oil drilling isn't the only answer. We also must develop a sound national energy policy, find better ways to conserve, and look for alternative sources.
\
It's time we began investing in the future, rather than waiting for the past to once again sneak up on us.

THE EDITORIAL PAGE; LETTERS; Congress shouldn't change the rules for financing disaster relief in the middle of a disaster, USA TODAY said Monday in an editorial. Readers said:
\
We must provide flood relief funds for the Midwest, but we also must remember that any day could bring another unexpected disaster somewhere else. How long can we continue providing money for these disasters without paying for it?
\
I am outraged at those who allowed unrelated items in the flood-relief bill. We taxpayers are fed up with the ""pork-barrel"" bills.
\
Congress is not listening now, but I'm sure it will hear us loud and clear in 1994. Pat Kuniewicz St. Marys, Ohio
\
Checkoff for disasters
\
I favor a checkoff or an income tax surcharge to pay for flood or disaster relief.
\
Some natural disasters lately have been so overwhelming that it's almost impossible for local or state agencies to deal with them.
\
If we can spread the risk, or spread the help among the widest possible segment of the population, it would make it easier for everyone. Ronald Albers Evansville, Ind.
\
Aid cost in perspective
\
Of course, it is necessary for the federal government to come to the aid of those struck by the flood disaster. The cost to us may amount to $5 billion, maybe more. While $5 billion is a huge, singular financial undertaking, it is but three-tenths of 1% of the estimated annual federal budget of $1.5 trillion.
\
Rather than, as usual, throwing this obligation to the winds of deficit financing, Congress must search out reprogramming options in appropriations of lesser priorities. To do otherwise raises further serious doubts as to its willingness to reduce the deficit later after raising taxes now. Jack Patton Merritt Island, Fla.
\
Budget like a family
\
I agree with what some members of Congress are trying to do - to find money to pay for the flood disaster aid before they commit to it.
\
If you have a disaster in your home, you fix it. But there is a time when you sit down and try to figure out how you're going to pay for it, what is going to have to be cut back and who is going to have to work extra.
\
I don't think Congress should be any different. Earl Huffman Bellevue, Neb.
\
Gas tax won't hurt U.S.
\
An increase in the gasoline tax would be good for our country, and I encourage people to support it.
\
Contrary to some claims, an increased gasoline tax would have only a minimal, temporary impact on the economy. There are several reasons for this: Transportation costs are a small part of the total cost of goods. We use energy very inefficiently, so price increases can be offset by modest conservation. And much of our energy use is discretionary.
\
In the short term, the consumer will pay slightly more for gasoline, but the price increase can be offset by modest improvements in fuel efficiency. The government would still receive revenues from the tax. The only parties losing out would be the oil companies.
\
Public health and the environment would benefit, since increased efficiency means less pollution from the manufacture and use of petroleum products.
\
Our inefficient use of energy hurts both the economy and the environment. We use twice as much energy per capita as the Japanese and most Europeans, and lag behind them in finding ways to reduce our oil dependence, mostly because gasoline is so cheap. A 9 cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax is a modest first step in the right direction. James Brucker Los Angeles, Calif.

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION '92
\
What the Democrats believe in, based on the 8,000-word platform that convention delegates approved Tuesday:
\
ABORTION: We ``stand behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, regardless of ability to pay. . . The goal ... must be to make abortion less necessary, not more difficult or more dangerous.''
\
CITIES: ``Only a robust economy will revitalize our cities.'' Calls for community development banks, national public works investment and incentives for pension funds to invest in urban projects. Vows to crack down on housing discrimination.
\
CRIME: Calls for a ``reasonable'' waiting period for handgun-buyers, community service and boot camps for first-time offenders; attacks Republican ``leniency'' on white-collar crime.
\
DEFENSE: Promises ``economic conversion'' plans to offset layoffs as defense budget is cut. Vows to maintain ``survivable'' nuclear force and troops in South Korea ``as long as North Korea presents a threat.''
\
DEFICIT: Calls for ``fair and shared sacrifice of all Americans for the common good,'' but offers few specifics. Would ``control soaring health-care costs,'' cut federal administrative costs by 3% annually, and limit budget increases to growth rate of the average paycheck.
\
EDUCATION: ``We oppose the Bush administration's efforts to bankrupt the public school system ... through private school vouchers.'' Vows to make college ``affordable to all students ... regardless of family incomes ... Goverments must ensure that teachers' pay measures up to their decisive role in children's lives.''

ENVIRONMENT: ``We reject the Republican myth that energy efficiency and environmental protection are enemies of economic growth.'' Vows to protect old-growth forests and wetlands and oppose new offshore oil drilling. Promises a civilian conservation corps.
\
FOREIGN POLICY: Calls for foreign aid to be targeted at democracies, not tyrants. Calls for swifter action to help former communist nations; maintain sanctions on South Africa until ``full accommodation'' with black majority. In Middle East, should not ``encourage one side to believe that it will deliver unilateral concessions from the other.'' HEALTH CARE: ``All Americans should have universal access to quality, affordable health care - not as a privilege but as a right.'' Promises, without specifics ``tough controls on health costs,'' and to ``cover all Americans regardless of pre-existing conditions.'' Will implement recommendations of the National Commission on AIDS. TAXES: ``We will relieve the tax burden on middle-class Americans by forcing the rich to pay their fair share. We will provide ... tax relief to families with children.''

152,"For complete text of graphics see newspaper or microfilm\ HAMPTON ROADS TAX REFERENDUM\ The ballot question\ ""Shall an additional sales and use tax of one percent be imposed in Isle of Wight County, James City County, York County, the City of Chesapeake, the City of Hampton, the City of Newport News, the City of Norfolk, the City of Poquoson, the City of Portsmouth, the City of Suffolk, the City of Virginia Beach, and the City of Williamsburg, with the revenues to be used solely for regional transportation projects and programs as specified in Chapter 853 of the Acts of Assembly of 2002?""\ Hampton Roads voters have a chance to do something about clogged tunnels and the summertime parking lots on Interstate 64 on Tuesday, but it comes at a price.\ To build another bridge-tunnel, widen I-64 and build an alternative to that highway, voters must decide whether they're willing to raise the sales tax in the region from 4.5 cents to 5.5 cents.\ It would be one of the largest road-building projects in the region's history.\ Proponents say some critical highways and tunnels need to be built if the region is to compete with other East Coast areas. Without the projects, they say, gridlock will consume area highways, keep commuters away from their families longer each day and deter other people from moving here.\ Critics have said we already pay enough taxes. If these projects are critical, they say, lawmakers need to figure out how to pay for them without pawning the decision off on voters.\ Opponents also have raised questions about the governmental body that would control the money, the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission. They've said it can't be trusted. And they say voters shouldn't believe that the tax will be taken off the books anytime in the future.\ The folks pushing for the tax increase -- a group of civic and business leaders known as the Yes Campaign -- will have spent nearly $2 million by Tuesday. Their opponents, the kNOw Campaign, will have spent a small fraction of that.\ Nonetheless, the spirited campaign has sometimes been muddied by misinformation. Below are questions and answers designed to allow voters to make an educated decision before going to the polls on Tuesday.\ Q. Who gets to vote?\ A. Registered voters in Newport News, Hampton, Poquoson, Williamsburg, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Chesapeake and Portsmouth as well as James City, York and Isle of Wight counties.\ Q. Who would pay the tax?\ A. Anyone who shops in those 12 localities.\ Q. What would the tax apply to?\ A. Retail sales. That means clothes, school supplies, furniture, hotel rooms and meals at restaurants. The tax would not apply to prescription drugs, most food sold at grocery stores, cars or gasoline.\ Q. What are the six transportation projects the tax would pay for?\ A. Building the Third Crossing; widening Interstate 64 from Bland Boulevard to New Kent County; adding another tube to the Midtown Tunnel, and bringing it up to four lanes; upgrading Route 460; building the Southeastern Parkway; and making some mass transit improvements.\ Q. What will all that cost?\ A. Planners say the price tag should be $7.7 billion. The law would limit borrowing to $5.9 billion, but there is no overall spending cap.\ Q. What will the interest on the bonds cost?\ A. That's tricky to calculate at this point, but an analysis by Salomon Smith Barney shows the region could pay as much in interest as it will for construction.\ Q. What is the Third Crossing?\ A. Essentially, it would be another bridge-tunnel across Hampton Roads. It would widen one part of the Monitor-Merimac Memorial Bridge Tunnel to eight lanes and another part to six lanes. A spur would extend to Norfolk near the naval base and another into Portsmouth at Craney Island. Extra lanes would be added to I-664 on the Peninsula and in South Hampton Roads.\ Q. What does upgrading Route 460 mean?\ A. Plans are not yet finalized for this project, but officials say they want a limited-access highway -- something like an interstate -- in Isle of Wight County and Suffolk. In eastern Suffolk, that likely would mean minor changes to the existing road. Elsewhere it could mean paving an entirely new road or building bypasses around busy stretches. It's designed to provide an alternative to I-64 for motorists entering or leaving South Hampton Roads.\ Q. What is the Southeastern Parkway?\ A. It would be a new highway in southern Virginia Beach. It would connect I-264 at Oceana Naval Air Station with I-64 in Chesapeake. It's designed, in part, to alleviate traffic on I-264.\ Q. Where will I-64 be widened?\ A. Extra lanes would be added in each direction so that it's at least six lanes all the way to the New Kent County line. In addition, the existing HOV lanes would be extended to Williamsburg.\ Q. What work will be done at the Midtown Tunnel?\ A. Another tube will be added to expand it from two to four lanes. Also, the Martin Luther King Freeway will be extended to better connect the tunnel with I-264.\ Q. What's the construction already in progress near the tunnel?\ A. That's the Pinners Point connector. It will connect Route 164, the Western Freeway, to the tunnel and allow drivers to bypass Port Norfolk. It's being paid for from the state's traditional road- building fund.\ Q. What mass-transit improvements will be made?\ A. Nobody knows. The law allowing the referendum defines mass transit as passenger rail, Maglev and bus services. Officials say there are no specific plans yet.\ Based on plans developed in the past, the money likely would go toward some sort of commuter rail lines on the Peninsula and in Norfolk, probably light rail. But the referendum would provide only $200 million for mass transit, which is not nearly enough to develop a commuter rail system.\ Q. Are officials limited to spending $200 million on mass transit?\ A. No. The law does not place a cap on spending for mass transit. And because of the vague definition for how the money must be spent, it's possible that state officials later could say they are obligated to spend millions more than $200 million on mass transit.\ Q. Who will decide how the money will be spent?\ A. The Hampton Roads Planning District Commission.\ Q. What is the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission?\ A. A 44-member panel that studies issues like the economy, environment and transportation in Hampton Roads. The 44 members are all city council members, county supervisors, city managers or county administrators. City councils and boards of supervisors appoint the members.\ Q. What is the role of the HRPDC in the referendum?\ A. The planning district commission has done most of the research and planning for the six projects. More important, it would control the money raised by the new tax. The commission also is responsible for construction of the projects.\ Q. Will the Virginia Department of Transportation build the roads?\ A. Maybe. The planning district commission will be able to hire VDOT to build the roads. Or it could bypass VDOT and simply hire contractors to do the work. Those decisions have not yet been made.\ Q. Can the HRPDC decide to further raise the tax in the future?\ A. No. It does not have taxing power.\ Q. When would the tax increase begin?\ A. July 1, 2003.\ Q. When would the tax go away?\ A. After the projects are all built and paid for, which would probably be at least 35 years.\ Q. The planning district commission is not directly elected by the voters, so how do we know the commission won't misuse the money?\ A. Many of the members are elected officials in cities and counties throughout the region. Plus, Gov. Mark Warner issued an executive order creating an audit panel that's designed to ensure the money is spent properly.\ Q. When will construction start?\ A. Work will begin right away on planning and acquiring land. Dirt will begin moving within a few years.\ Q. When will the projects be finished?\ A. Planners say all the projects will be complete within 20 years.\ Q. In what order will the projects be built?\ A. Officials say there will be no need to prioritize the projects. All of them will be built as quickly as possible. Some of the projects are closer to being ready for construction than others. For example, the first phase of the Third Crossing -- a spur from the Monitor-Merimac Memorial Bridge Tunnel into Norfolk -- could be finished in six or seven years. On the other extreme, that spur might open before planning is complete on Route 460.\ Q. What alternatives are being mentioned?\ A. None.\ Q. Why not impose tolls rather than raise the sales tax?\ A. Tolls as high as $2 would have to be placed on the James River Bridge and each of the bridge-tunnels to pay for the Third Crossing alone. If tolls were placed on the Third Crossing alone, they would need to be about $13 one way.\ Q. Why not raise the gas tax?\ A. To raise the necessary amount of money, the gas tax would have to go up about 22 cents. Plus, Wall Street analysts say interest would be higher because the gas tax is not as stable as the sales tax.\ Q. Wouldn't a statewide tax increase be fairer?\ A. Not necessarily. Under the current formula for distributing road-building money statewide, Hampton Roads gets back about 85 cents of every dollar collected in the region.\ Q. How will the roads get built if voters reject the referendum?\ A. They won't. At least probably not for many years. Lawmakers say the state simply doesn't have the money.\ Q. Why doesn't the General Assembly just reprioritize state spending?\ A. The state is having serious budget problems. Earlier this year, Gov. Warner and the General Assembly had to close a $3.8 billion shortfall in the budget proposed by former Gov. Jim Gilmore. Now Warner is in the midst of slashing another $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the already lowered budget. Thousands of workers are being laid off. There isn't $7.7 billion to shuffle around, Warner says.\ Q. Why did the General Assembly put this before voters?\ A. The sense among lawmakers was that there was no way a majority of the Republican-controlled legislature would vote for an outright tax increase.\ Q. Why should I vote for it?\ A. Advocates say the six road projects are vital to fighting congestion, improving the quality of life in Hampton Roads and promoting the region as an economic hub.\ Q. Will it reduce congestion or simply keep things from getting worse?\ A. Planners say in the short term it could make getting across the water easier, but in the long term they acknowledge it only will keep highways around here from resembling the Washington, D.C., Beltway.\ Q. How will it help the economy of the region?\ A. The five highway projects in the referendum constitute a network of roads that make it easier to get goods into and out of the region. That would allow the ports to thrive. Plus, by keeping down the amount of time commuters spend on the roads, businesses are more likely to relocate to the region.\ Q. Why should I vote against it?\ A. Critics say Hampton Roads would have the highest sales tax in the state. They also say this is not a decision that voters should be forced to make, that state lawmakers get paid to decide these issues.\ Q. Who's pushing for the tax increase?\ A. Business leaders. They've formed a group called the Yes Campaign to encourage people to vote for the referendum.\ Q. How much is the Yes Campaign spending?\ A. They had raised about $1.8 million by about 10 days ago.\ Q. Where's that money coming from?\ A. The Hampton Roads Ports Association wrote the biggest check, for $100,000. Banks, construction firms, car dealers, hospitals and law firms also are signing checks of $25,000 and up.\ Q. Who's fighting the referendum?\ A. There are several groups that are only somewhat coordinated in their efforts to stop the tax increase. On the Peninsula, the leading group is the kNOw Campaign. On the Southside, the Virginia Beach Taxpayer's Alliance has done most of the work. A third group, the Committee Opposing Sales Taxes for Transportation, is working on both sides of the water.\ Q. How much are the opponents spending?\ A. A tiny amount compared to the proponents. The three opposition groups combined have raised about $45,000. Paul Jost, the former congressional candidate, has given $11,000.\ ELECTION GUIDE ONLINE\ Check out our election guide online at http://www. dailypress.com/election for candidate profiles, archived stories about the transportation sales tax referendum, the state's voting history by district, and more.

153,"Published correction ran Thursday, July 20, 2000. A map on Wednesday's front page incorrectly showed Routes 143 (Jefferson Avenue in Newport News) and 164 (Western Freeway in Portsmouth) as federal highways. Both are state highways.\ State officials will make an important decision this week on the proposed Hampton Roads Third Crossing: Where best to put it.\ Members of the Commonwealth Transportation Board will meet today in Richmond to hear an update on the long-running project. They'll meet again Thursday to formally endorse a location.\ Construction of the third crossing remains years away, but this week's action is still important. Once the board approves the location, the Virginia Department of Transportation can start working on the design.\ ""It's a critical decision,"" said VDOT spokesman Andy Farmer, ""because by picking out the location you really determine the key design features.""\ It remains to be seen which alternative gets the nod. In 1997, regional leaders studying the third crossing endorsed a plan to double the Monitor- Merrimac Bridge-Tunnel and add connections to Craney Island and Norfolk. The Commonwealth Transportation Board gave that alternative its early endorsement. Officials started working on the next step: assessing the impact to the environment.\ But even though a preferred location was on the table, regulations still required them to consider other alternatives - including doing nothing.\ So when the board meets today and Thursday, it will consider four alternatives, including the one approved in 1997. Farmer said VDOT will recommend the 1997 plan, but he stressed that board members have the final say. The board is the policy-making arm of VDOT, similar to a board of directors of a corporation. The governor appoints its members.\ One planning official said he expected the board to endorse the Monitor-Merrimac alternative because it is the most cost-effective, it can be built in stages, and local leaders want it. Art Collins, executive director of the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, said: ""I think we're realistically well beyond the choosing-of- alternatives phase.""\ But he quickly added: ""It's never over until it's over.""\ The four lanes of the Monitor-Merrimac connect Suffolk and downtown Newport News. The project would expand the bridge-tunnel from four to eight lanes and build additional lanes for some type of mass transit.\ Should the board choose this alternative, it would cost about $2.7 billion, according to current estimates. Collins said the design cost is normally 10 percent of the project cost, and that works out to $270 million. By comparison, the General Assembly this year committed $75 million for the project design.\ So even before supporters start looking for the billions needed to build the crossing, they'll need to come up with tens of millions more just for the design. Local transportation planners have supported bridge tolls and a gas tax hike to help pay for all of Tidewater's priority transportation projects, not just the third crossing.\ Sen. Marty Williams, R-Newport News, sits on the new Hampton Roads Third Crossing Bridge-Tunnel Commission, which meets for the first time next week. Williams, who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee, said the commission's job is to expedite construction of a third crossing.\ When it comes to finding more money, he said he hopes federal officials realize the third crossing is in Uncle Sam's best interest, especially considering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\ Wherever it goes and however much it costs, Collins said it's easy to make a case for a third crossing to supplement the Monitor- Merrimac and the Hampton Roads bridge-tunnels. Collins said those two arteries were designed to handle between 75,000 and 80,000 vehicles a day. Last month, the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel logged 100,000 vehicles a day, Collins said, and it routinely handles more than 90,000.\ Hugh Lessig can be reached at 804-644-7123 or by e-mail at hlessig@dailypress.com."

THE CLINTON-DOLE DEBATE
\
Excerpts from Sunday night's presidential debate between President Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole:
\
PRESIDENT CLINTON: I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Sen. Dole and his record of public service, and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults. . . .
\
Four years ago, you took me on faith. Now, there's a record: 10.5 million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare roles, a strong America at peace. We are better off than we were four years ago. Let's keep it going.
\
We cut the deficit by 60%. Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now, let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies and buying a home.
\
We passed Family and Medical Leave, now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the workforce. We passed 100,000 police, the Assault Weapons Ban, the Brady bill. Now, let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.
\
We passed welfare reform, now let's move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every 8 year old will be able to read, every 12-year- old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st century, and I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.
\
BOB DOLE: I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and independents.
\
I have three very special people with me. My wife, Elizabeth, my daughter, Robin, who's never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa, from New York, who along with Ollie Manninen helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.
\
I've learned from them that people do have tough times. And sometimes you can't go it alone. And that's what America's all about. I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses, a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kelikian. And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us.
\
America's the greatest place on the face of the earth. Now I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. You worry about the . . . safety of your children and the quality of education.
\
But even more importantly, you worry about the future, and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had. And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight. . . .
\
Now I'm a plain-speaking man, and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them. It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time.
\
Role of federal government
\
CLINTON: I believe the federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. . . .
\
I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady bill, the Assault Weapons Ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All these are programs that Sen. Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.
\
I've worked hard to help families inpart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.
\
DOLE: I think the basic difference is . . . I trust the people. The president trusts the government. Go back and look at the health care plan that he wanted to impose on the American people -- one-seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies, a cost of $1.5 trillion.
\
Don't forget that. That happened in 1993. A tax increase that taxed everybody in America, not just the rich. . . . You got your Social Security taxes increased. We had a BTU tax turn into a $35 billion gas tax. A $265 billion tax increase. I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card around in my pocket called the 10th Amendment. Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.
\
CLINTON: I trust the people. We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives. But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries. I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick. Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents. But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st century.
\
Comparison to four years ago
\
DOLE: He inherited a growth of 4.7, 4.8%. Now it's down to about 2.4%. We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. We've got stagnant wages. In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2%. Men's wages haven't gone up -- gone down. So we have stagnation. We have the highest foreign debt in history. . . .
\
Are you better off? . . . Are the American people? They're working harder and higher -- harder and paying more taxes. For the first time in history, you pay about 40% of what you earn, more than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined, for taxes under this administration.
\
They talk about family income being up. . . . It's up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family and one works to pay taxes for the government. We're going to give them a tax so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.
\
CLINTON: We have 10.5 million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s, wages are going up for the first time in a decade, we have record numbers of new small businesses, we had the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. . . . We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.
\
The average family's income has gone up over $1,600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago. Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to better off still?
\
Medicare reform
\
CLINTON: Since Sen. Dole's been a candidate he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in . . . in 1965. . . . Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich, cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums, because doctors could have charged them more . . .under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.
\
And now, with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Sen. Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair Sen. D'Amato says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.
\
Now my balanced budget plan adds 10 years to the life of the Medicare trust fund. Ten years. And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.
\
DOLE: I looked back at the vote on Medicare in 1965. We had a program called Elder Care that also provided drugs and was means-tested so that people who needed medical attention received it. I thought it was a good program. But I've supported Medicare ever since.. . .
\
We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did with Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security. . . . And we can do it again if we take politics out of it. Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think it's time to have a truce.
\
CLINTON: I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this. And I appreciate what Sen. Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission. . . . My balanced budget plan puts 10 years on the Medicare. We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.
\
Dole 15% tax cut
\
DOLE: This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut. Fifteen percent . . . let's take a family making $30,000 a year. That's $1,261. . . . People watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer. It may be three or four months of mortgage payments.
\
This economic package is . . . a six point package. First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way. We lost by one vote. It's balancing the budget by the year 2002. It's the tax cut, cutting capital gains 50%, so you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.
\
It's estate tax relief. It's a $500 per child tax credit. It's about litigation reform. Now that the president gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision.
\
CLINTON: Well, here's the problem . . . It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit, which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans and small business loans.
\
It's not good to raise the deficit. We've worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on 9 million people, and in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.. . . So, it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, health care and home buying which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional Budget Office, that's the right way to go.
\
DOLE: The president wants to increase spending 20% over the next six years. I want to increase spending 14%. That's how simple it is. I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families. We're talking about six percentage points over six years. And with that money, you give it back to working people.
\
Influence of political donors
\
CLINTON: Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not. The senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the Product Liability Bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about. I actually wanted to sign that bill and I told . . . the Congress -- exactly what kind of bill I would sign.
\
Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all. But I thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits. But they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.
\
But generally, I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. I've done a lot of things that were controversial -- my economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.
\
Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run. That's what I've tried to do, and that's what I will continue to do as president.
\
DOLE: How does he avoid conflict? Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers. When I look at the trial lawyers and you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up $2 million to $4 million.
\
And organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts $35 million into the pot. Now, if these aren't special interests, then I've got a lot to learn . . .
\
But it seems to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits, and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage. You're putting a lot of businesspeople out of business. Small businessmen and small business women who paid 705/8 of your . . . $265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.
\
I said that one day, and Pat Moynihan, the Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it -- the largest tax increase in the history of the world.
\
CLINTON: Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago. I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.
\
Secondly, Sen. Dole's had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money. But it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who are subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing and sales of tobacco to children.
\
And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come in to the halls of Congress, into the rooms and rewrite the environmental laws. That's what Speaker Gingrich and Sen. Dole did, not me.
\
DOLE: That's not true.
\
CLINTON: So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues, instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.
\
I think Sen. Dole and I just honestly disagree.
\
DOLE: I think it's very difficult. Let's be honest about it. That's why we need campaign finance reform. I've suggested . . . we have a commission on campaign finance reform. They sent it to Congress and we have to vote it up or down, that's how it works. We're never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want to better advantage themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work. . . .
\
I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes, and I've had a consistent record ever since 1965. . . .
\
It took three and a half years -- it wasn't until election year, Mr. President, you ever thought about stopping smoking.
\
What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141%, or marijuana, cocaine up 166%. I mean it seems to me that you have a selective memory. And you know, mine doesn't work that way so I just want to try to correct it as we go along.
"
155," Getting there\ Which crossing is better depends on whose interests prevail\ What seems clear -- and clearer every time you end up sitting on an approach, waiting to creep through a tunnel -- is that the region needs additional capacity crossing Hampton Roads. The question is, what's the best way to do it?\ The route anointed by the group of local elected officials charged with nailing down the region's transportation plan is the one called the third crossing. It takes the western route, widening I-664 and adding a tunnel that connects to I-564 in Norfolk and to Portsmouth. It's moving ahead, with private firms interested in a partnership already submitting proposals.\ But some Hampton officials are arguing for adding capacity to the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.\ Having both is unlikely, given the reality of fiscal life in Virginia. The regional transportation plan put the third crossing price tag at $4.5 billion, widening the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel at $2.7 billion. At the moment, financing even one is problematic. Even with tolls, some public money will be required, and there's no clear plan to raise it. Voters rejected the transportation referendum that included third-crossing funds, and the General Assembly has been acting as if transportation isn't even on its list of responsibilities.\ But back to the issue of which crossing it should be.\ Hampton officials are right on one count: For most Peninsula residents heading to Norfolk or Virginia Beach, the HRBT is a straighter shot. Same for Norfolk and Virginia Beach residents heading to the Peninsula and points west.\ But there are other considerations:\ * Deciding which projects will get scarce money requires weighing many needs, many constituencies, many localities. The needs of commuters, of the military, and of tourists heading to the beach must be balanced, for example, with the need to support the ports so vital to the region's economy. The third crossing may not be ideal for Hampton residents heading out, but it will be a boon in Norfolk and Portsmouth, by getting a lot of trucks -- the ones that haul containers that arrive and depart by ship -- off local roads.\ * There are lots of priorities to juggle, and that juggling is done by elected officials in a political environment in which ""What do we need?"" is followed by ""Let's make a deal."" Expanding HRBT may be high on Hampton's agenda, but folks in Virginia Beach and Chesapeake are pushing for the Southeastern Parkway and Greenbelt. It won a $1.4 billion spot in the official transportation plan, enough to buy a nice chunk of tunnel. But in this case, the golden ring was won by folks who care more about getting across Virginia Beach than about getting to the Peninsula.\ * With much of the region's growth in its western reaches, the I- 664 connection may be best for interests in Chesapeake and Suffolk. That, of course, raises the smart-growth conundrum: Will adding road capacity to developing areas encourage sprawl or just follow it?\ * Adding lane capacity isn't a panacea. It fills up surprisingly quickly, as faster travel time invites more trips. Sooner than people expect, congestion returns, bringing its delays, accidents and pollution.\ * And that is why no matter where the crossing is, it must include capacity for mass transit, the kind that is so convenient and attractive it can pry die-hard drivers out of their cars.\ * The discussion has got to include how we'll pay for it. Tolls, gas tax, other sources? In the absence of an answer, nobody's going anywhere.\ Something good can come out of the questions coming out of Hampton if they open the issue up for wider discussion. It could prompt advocates for the western third crossing to do a better job of making the case for why that, and not expanding the HRBT, is the best alternative.\ And it could stimulate public exploration of the issues that are behind the need to connect the Peninsula and South Hampton Roads: What does it mean to function as a region? What kind of growth do we want and where? Are the benefits of operating as a large and seamless entity -- the appeal to employers, the access to jobs and a richer array of entertainment and medical and educational and commercial resources -- worth the price for the roads and bridges and tunnels that will make our connections flow more smoothly? *\ What's for lunch?\ W-JCC schools need a serving of food safety\ Yuck.\ Among the 58 critical violations of food safety regulations in the cafeterias of Williamsburg/James City County school in the last year were the following:\ * Mouse droppings in storeroom and mop room (Berkeley Middle School, Sept. 22, 2004)\ * Employees handling food with bare hands (Lafayette High School, May 14, 2004)\ * Chicken nuggets at improper temperature (Matthew Whaley Elementary School, Sept. 16, 2004)\ * Dirty can opener (Jamestown High School, Jan. 8, 2004)\ * Unwrapped or uncovered food in the serving line with dirty fan blowing over food (Norge Elementary, May 10, 2004)\ * Dead pests in kitchen corner behind ice machine, cockroach droppings in storage room (Stonehouse Elementary, Sept. 27, 2004)\ Williamsburg and James City County take pride, with cause, in their schools. But there's no pride to be taken in the finding that in the last year, those schools racked up, on average, 4.8 critical violations of food regulations. That's the kind, says the state health department, that if ""left uncorrected, are more likely than other violations to directly contribute to food contamination, illness or environmental degradation."" By contrast, Hampton schools had an average of 2.3 critical violations each and York County schools a mere 0.4 each.\ So what's the problem? And where's the fix?\ Among the choices: Management. Management. And management. Everything else -- employee training, supervision, procedures, equipment, maintenance -- at some level comes back to management. Someone is ultimately responsible for making sure that all those things are taken care of in school cafeterias. So the place to begin is with the individual in charge of food service; the people who have daily contact with each cafeteria -- principals and site managers -- have some accounting to do, too.\ The school system, surprised to learn about the extent of the problem, is tackling it with dispatch. Already in the works are additional inspections, both in-house and through the health department, and a hard look at procedures to try to figure out how this situation developed and how to fix it.\ An occasional violation is one thing; a pattern across many schools and many inspections is another. Then again, the fact that 12 out of 17 York County schools were cited for zero critical violations last year shows that they can be avoided altogether.\ Going to school can be, at various times, exhilarating, enlightening, challenging, even, truth be told, boring. But it should not be hazardous to children's health. *\ ONLINE REPORTS\ Inspection reports for school cafeterias -- and restaurants -- are available online (search by locality): www.vdh.state.va.us/ restaurant"
156," A little more than 100 years ago, Charles Cunningham Boycott immortalized himself by being nasty. Boycott was a British land agent in Ireland whose enforcement of rent collection enraged Irish tenants so much that they refused to associate with him.\ Last week, in locations across the United States, a number of people refused to associate with Exxon. They participated in a one- day boycott of the oil company to protest the massive oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound.\ It was called the opening shot in a ""war of words and actions"" against Exxon, and Ralph Nader urged on the protesters: ""Americans can take action now by voting with their steering wheel and dollars against all Exxon products.""\ That's true enough. As powerful as Exxon is, the American consumer is more powerful. You could say, in fact, that the consumer is all powerful. So powerful that some companies are willing to send men and equipment into hostile environments all over the globe in order to satisfy the consumer's lust for oil.\ Exxon is one of those companies. Is it more or less responsible than, say, Texaco? You might be able to trust your car to the man who wears the star, but can you be sure that a ship carrying crude oil for Texaco doesn't have a drunk for a captain? Had the accident involved a ship carrying oil for Mobil, would Mobil have done a better job of responding to the environmental catastrophe that followed? How do these companies compare on the scale of environmental sensitivity?\ Beats me. For all I know, Exxon could be the best of the lot.\ There's also the question of who's really being punished by a boycott, whether it's a one-day affair or a continuing effort. Most of Exxon's stations are independently operated. Boycotting them will hurt Exxon, but it will also hurt your neighbor who works there. Who will it hurt the most? Exxon can sell its crude oil to another refiner, and its ships and wells will keep making money. But can your neighbor get another job?\ Of course it's easy to rationalize yourself into paralysis. All those extenuating circumstances are like an oil slick mucking up the water. They help cover up more selfish concerns such as, for me, the fact that Exxon has opened a new station at the end of my street. If I were to forgo that convenience and join in any future boycotts of Exxon, wouldn't I actually be hurting the environment by driving farther than necessary to buy gasoline?\ But at some point, the rationalization has to stop and you have to act. A boycott is a simple way to show your displeasure, and if enough people participate it can be deadly effective. Exxon made a mistake. Let's be sure it's a mistake the company regrets. Let's send Exxon a message so loud and clear that other oil companies will hear it, too. All right! Let's boycott Exxon.\ Oops! I feel a fit of rationalization-induced paralysis coming on. What happens if next week tankers belonging to a half-dozen other oil companies ram into reefs as they rush to meet the increased demand they're enjoying because of the boycott against Exxon? Do they get boycotted, too? I mean, we don't want to carry this thing too far. If we boycott all the oil companies, we won't be able to buy any gas and then, heaven forbid, we might have to ride Pentran buses to work.\ Now most of us might be willing to sacrifice Exxon for the purity of Prince William Sound, but you'd have a hard time filling an outhouse with people willing to sacrifice their automobiles for the cause.\ Let's face it: The gooey, yucky, nasty truth is that we're perfectly willing to destroy the Prince William Sounds of the world for our automobiles. If we weren't, we would never have tolerated the Reagan administration's decision to allow reduced gasoline efficiency standards for cars. Not only do we love our cars, we love them with big, muscular engines.\ If we cared about the Prince William Sounds of the world, we'd have a reasonable gas tax that would discourage consumption while providing financing for energy research. We'd use public transportation. We'd live close to our jobs instead of driving 50 miles a day to go to and from work.\ Isn't it remarkable that a country that now pretends to care about Prince William Sound has tolerated a reduction in federal spending on solar research from $578 million in 1980 to $103 million in 1988? Isn't it amazing that we're willing to send young men to die in the Persian Gulf to protect foreign oil sources, but we're not willing to ride three or four in a car to cut our gasoline consumption?\ Poor Charles Cunningham Boycott. Irish laborers wouldn't work for him. His mail disappeared. He couldn't get accommodations when he traveled. Eventually, he returned to England.\ But a boycott of Exxon? Somehow, I just don't think it or any other oil company has much to worry about.\ * Jesse E. Todd Jr. is associate editor of the Daily Press editorial page."
157," Where are we going?\ Looking for a reason to be optimistic about transportation\ The newspaper over in Roanoke noted this week that Virginia ""needs a massive update of its transportation system."" Their most visible, pressing problem is Interstate 81, known not affectionately as ""NAFTA Highway."" That's a reference to all the truck traffic hauling goods between the Northeast and the Southwest, to go eventually out of the country -- trade stimulated by the North American Free Trade Agreement.\ The newspaper over in Norfolk noted this week that ""the Virginia Department of Transportation has essentially run out of money for major new highway projects in Hampton Roads."" This is not new information, but it bears repeating -- over and over again -- because the state appears poised to do: nothing. Meanwhile, avoid Interstate 64 if you can, especially the bridge-tunnel.\ When the General Assembly convenes in January, lawmakers will have their eyes firmly fixed on the calendar: Nov. 8, 2005. That's Election Day for the House of Delegates and for governor. So what are the chances of the incumbent lawmakers coming up with a whopping tax increase to pay for transportation projects? (Provide your own answer.)\ The Republicans who were forward-looking enough to support a tax increase earlier this year to support education and other key services are already under strident attack from anti-tax members of their own party, their faces pasted on ""Least Wanted"" posters. And the failure of the 2002 regional transportation referendums is still a talking point. So it's difficult to see any momentum building for a transportation initiative. Lt. Gov. Tim Kaine, who wants to follow Mark Warner as governor, notes that Virginia's gas tax, 17.5 cents per gallon, is 41st in the nation and hasn't been raised since 1987. And then he puts it bluntly: ""I cannot and will not support asking people to pay more when there is no guarantee their money will be used for well-planned and cost-effective transportation projects."" And he's the Democrat.\ While not wanting to conclude that what we have here is a disaster for Virginia, it's hard to discern where, exactly, one should look for a glimmer of optimism.\ Better land use policies? Why, yes. Of course. Encourage people to live closer to urban job centers, to reduce commuting. Already, the urban residential market is booming in some cities. But will the real estate and development interests who hold such sway over lawmakers jump on that bandwagon?\ Investment in rail? Absolutely. To help get freight off the interstates. But lawmakers killed an effort to establish a state rail authority, similar to the Virginia Port Authority. Such an authority would provide a funding mechanism for rail improvements, and it seems an essential ingredient in an effective transportation strategy. Will the General Assembly approve such an authority in its next session?\ Tolls? They're almost certainly part of the solution, but just part. And there are political barriers to be overcome before that most direct form of user fee can be imposed. Can you imagine anyone running for public office on a platform of, ""I'm for tolls""?\ Better mass transit? Of course. But where will the millions and millions (OK, billions) of dollars come from to construct a truly seamless mass transit system? Hampton Roads Transit needs a massive infusion of local tax dollars simply to hold its own. Rail must be part of the picture -- another reason to have a state rail authority.\ The questions await answers, and all the answers, whether anyone likes it or not, require additional money. *\ Thinking green\ Environmental studies should be central to all education\ Along with teaching young people to understand the world, a university has an obligation to equip them with an appreciation of the consequences for that world of the choices they will make and the actions they will take. When it comes to the natural world, that means sensitizing students to the implications of the ways we live and the ways we use land, energy and resources.\ When learning takes place in a setting that reflects a commitment to protecting the earth and demonstrates sound environmental choices, it is bound to be more effective.\ The new engineering and computational sciences building at Old Dominion University, dedicated last Sunday, offers such a setting. The building earned the seal of approval from a group called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, which recognizes buildings that meet its standards for being environmentally friendly. It's the first higher education building in Virginia to earn the certification.\ And it's the result of thinking green -- and trying to teach students to think green, too. In the new building, they'll be surrounded by design features and materials that reflect a conscious effort to reduce the building's drain on the environment. Water- thrifty plumbing systems, drought-tolerant plants and efficient landscape irrigation systems will cut down on water consumption. Rainwater will be collected on the roof and filtered through rock and plant gardens. Recycled, salvaged and rapidly renewable materials were used in construction, and the building will be stingy with energy, with lots of insulation and special windows that let in light but keep out heat. And it's designed to encourage its inhabitants to make earth-friendly decisions, too: It includes bicycle storage and recharging stations for alternative-fuel vehicles.\ This isn't ODU's first move toward becoming a greener university. It has pushed recycling, purchased electric vehicles, and made water quality a priority in campus projects. It has been a leader in using technology to reach students -- and to reduce the time, energy and air quality sacrificed to commuting.\ ODU has also committed to making environmental issues part of every student's education. Beginning next spring, all freshmen and some transfer students will take a global environment course that explores issues ranging from population growth to environmental justice, sustainable development to global warming. The involvement of many disciplines -- exploring scientific, philosophical, economic, political, educational, health and social aspects -- takes the study of the environment out of the science halls and makes it obvious that environmental issues are a concern for everyone, a concern that touches every aspect of life on Earth. The course will take a decidedly global point of view.\ Given the pace, scale and ominous consequences of the environmental change mankind has set in motion on this planet, it is obvious that one of the most important jobs of this generation is to prepare the next to safeguard the world they will inherit and then pass on to the next generation. The study of environmental issues should be part of every education, from pre-school through college. *"

THE CLINTON-DOLE DEBATE
\
Excerpts from Sunday night's debate between President Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole:
\
PRESIDENT CLINTON: I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service, and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.
\
Four years ago, I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all and an American community where everybody has a role to play.
\
I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people have the tools to make the most of their own lives. Four years ago, you took me on faith.
\
Now, there's a record: 10.5 million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare roles, a strong America at peace.
\
We are better off than we were four years ago. Let's keep it going.
\
We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now, let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies and buying a home.
\
We passed Family and Medical Leave; now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the workforce. We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady bill. Now, let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.
\
We passed welfare reform; now let's move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every 8-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st century, and I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.
\
BOB DOLE: Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words and thank the people of Hartford, the commission and all those out there who may be listening or watching. It's a great honor for me to be here, standing here as the Republican nominee. I've very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and independents.
\
I have three very special people with me. My wife, Elizabeth, my daughter Robin, who's never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa, from New York, who along with Ollie Manninen helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.
\
I've learned from them that people do have tough times. And sometimes you can't go it alone. And that's what America's all about. I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses, a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kelikian. And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.
\
America's the greatest place on the face of the Earth. Now I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. You worry about the quality and the safety of your children and the quality of education.
\
But even more importantly, you worry about the future, and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had. And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight. Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.
\
Now I'm a plain-speaking man, and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them. It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time. And again, I'm honored to be here this evening.
\
Role of federal government
\
CLINTON: I believe that the federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives That to me is the key. And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole. For example, we have reduced the size of the federal government to its smallest size in 30 years. We've reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.
\
But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.
\
I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.
\
I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believe that they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.
\
DOLE: I think the basic difference is . . . trust the people. The president trusts the government.
\
Go back and look at the health-care plan that he wanted to impose on the American people -- one-seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies, a cost of $1.5 trillion.
\
Don't forget that. That happened in 1993. A tax increase that taxed everybody in America, not just the rich. . . . You got your Social Security taxes increased. We had a BTU tax turn into a $35 billion gas tax. A $265 billion tax increase.
\
I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card around in my pocket called the 10th Amendment. Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.
\
CLINTON: I trust the people. We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives. But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries. I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick. Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents. But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st century.
\
Comparison to four years ago
\
DOLE: (Clinton) inherited a growth of 4.7, 4.8%. Now it's down to about 2.4%. We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. We've got stagnant wages. In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2%. Men's wages haven't gone up -- gone down. So we have stagnation. We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off? . . . Are the American people? They're working harder and harder and paying more taxes.
\
For the first time in history, you pay about 40% of what you earn, more than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined, for taxes under this administration.
\
They talk about family income being up. . . . It's up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family and one works to pay taxes for the government. We're going to give them a tax so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.
\
CLINTON: We have 10.5 million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s; wages are going up for the first time in a decade; we have record numbers of new small businesses; we had the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. . . . We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.
\
The average family's income has gone up over $1,600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago. Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to better off still.
\
DOLE: We asked the people who are viewing tonight: Are you better off than you were four years ago? . . . Are you working harder to put food on the table to feed your children? Are your children getting better education? Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America. Crime has gone down, but it's because the mayors, like Rudy Giuliani, where one-third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.
\
Medicare reform
\
CLINTON: Since Senator Dole's been a candidate he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965. . . . Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums, because doctors could have charged them more . . .under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.
\
And now, with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.
\
Now my balanced budget plan adds 10 years to the life of the Medicare trust fund. Ten years. And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.
\
DOLE: Well, I must say, I looked back at the vote on Medicare in 1965. We had a program called Elder Care that also provided drugs and was means-tested so that people who needed medical attention received it. I thought it was a good program. But I've supported Medicare ever since. In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, she said: ``Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare. Don't cut it.'' I wouldn't violate anything my mother said. . . .
\
We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did with Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security. . . . And we can do it again if we take politics out of it. Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think it's time to have a truce.
\
CLINTON: I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this. And I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission. But it won't be possible to do if his tax scheme passes, because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed. . . . My balanced budget plan puts 10 years on the Medicare. We ought to do that; then we can have a commission.
\
Dole's 15% tax cut
\
DOLE: This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut. Fifteen percent . . . let's take a family making $30,000 a year. That's $1,261. . . . People watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer. It may be three or four months of mortgage payments.
\
This economic package is about families, but it's a six-point package. First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way. We lost by one vote. It's balancing the budget by the year 2002. It's the tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent, so you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.
\
It's estate tax relief. It's a $500-per-child tax credit. It's about litigation reform. Now that the president gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision.
\
CLINTON: Well, here's the problem: . . . It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit, which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans and small-business loans.
\
It's not good to raise the deficit. We've worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on 9 million people, and in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.
\
So, it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, health care and home buying which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional Budget Office -- that's the right way to go.
\
DOLE: The president wants to increase spending 20% over the next six years. I want to increase spending 14%. That's how simple it is. I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families. We're talking about 6 percentage points over six years. And with that money, you give it back to working people. You also provide opportunity scholarships so low-income parents will have the same choice that other have in sending their children to better schools.
\
Influence of political donors
\
CLINTON: Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not. The senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the Product Liability Bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about. I actually wanted to sign that bill and I told . . . the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.
\
Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all. But I thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits. But they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.
\
But generally, I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. I've done a lot of things that were controversial -- my economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.
\
Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run. That's what I've tried to do, and that's what I will continue to do as president.
\
DOLE: How does he avoid conflict? Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers. When I look at the trial lawyers and you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up $2 million to $4 million.
\
And organized labor comes to Washington, D.C., and puts $35 million into the pot. Now, if these aren't special interests, then I've got a lot to learn . . . and I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.

159,"Sidebar to Nancy Cook's story, `The state of the governor', April 2, 1989.\ Here is an item-by-item comparison of what Baliles promised in 1985, and what he has done.\ THE ENVIRONMENT\ Goal: Spend more on the clean-up of the Chesapeake Bay.\ Action: Money for bay projects increased from $17.2 million in the 1984-86 budget, passed before Baliles took office, to $43 million in 1986-1988 and $55 million in current 1988-90 budget.\ Goal: Develop comprehensive statewide plan for Virginia's water needs.\ Action: Finished comprehensive plan begun by Gov. Charles S. Robb that outlines state water needs through 2030. It identifies areas that will face water shortages or have outdated water treatment plants, as well as identifying potential sources of water.\ Goal: Add to state's ""wilderness areas,"" where no development, road construction or cutting of trees is allowed.\ Action: Spent $1.5 million in 1988 to acquire new wilderness areas.\ Goal: Preservation of more historical sites.\ Action: Department of Historic Resources created this year to identify sites worthy of preservation and coordinate preservation efforts.\ Goal: Identify and clean up toxic and hazardous waste sites and plan for handling waste in the future.\ Action: Created Department of Waste Management, increased spending to identify and clean up hazardous and toxic waste from $2.16 million and 35 employees in 1986 to $4.41 millon and 60 employees currently. Other actions:\ New laws ban use of phos- phate detergent in Virginia and certain toxic paints on marine vessels.\ Baliles signed an agreement with Maryland, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia to protect the bay and pushed through the legislature the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act, which will lead to regulations on building along shorelines and in other environmentally sensitive areas.\ PRISONS\ Goal: New state-of-the-art security systems in prisons.\ Action: Security systems are state-of-the-art in new prisons, not in previously built ones.\ Goal: Expand existing prisons rather than build new ones.\ Action: Has begun construction of two prisons, as well as expanding existing facilities. The new prisons, in Buchanan County and Greensville, will cost about $160 million.\ Goal: Expand work opportunities for non-violent prison inmates and strive to ensure those jobs are meaningful and productive.\ Action: Corrections authorities say they have been unable to expand opportunities because of influx of prisoners.\ Goal: Expand work release and a program that puts non-violent offenders to work rather than in jail.\ Action: They have not been expanded.\ Promise: Develop a mental health treatment program for prisoners.\ Action: Marion Corrections Center was made a licensed state psychiatric facility.\ Other accomplishments:\ Began no-read/no-release program, which denies parole to inmates who cannot read.\ Began efforts to close the state penitentiary in Richmond, which is slated to shut down this year.\ Lowest escape record in history, with only 3.6 inmates per 1,000 escaping in 1988.\ LAW ENFORCEMENT\ Goal: Lowering the point at which a driver is presumed to be under the influence of alcohol from 0.15percent blood-alcohol content to 0.10percent.\ Action: Law passed in 1986.\ Goal: Create state drug information clearing house, where data on all persons convicted of drug-related crimes in Virginia is recorded for use by prosecutors and police.\ Action: Created through the State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

More hearsay evidence is also permitted.\ Goal: Make murder of a child under 18 during an abduction for illicit purposes a crime punishable by death.\ Action: Law passed, but victims must be under 12.\ Goal: A support program for victims and witnesses of crimes in every jurisdiction in the state.\ Action: Number of programs increased, but not to every jurisdiction. Also, more money has been provided for programs.\ Goal: A ""Son of Sam"" provision to ensure felons cannot cash in on their crimes by profiting from books or broadcast accounts.\ Action: Bill never introduced.\ Goal: Anti-racketeering statue, similar to federal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act, providing prosecutors with expanded options for combating criminal activity.\ Result: Not introduced, but state has broadened laws requiring forfeiture of assets owned by drug dealers.\ EDUCATION\ Goal: To raise teachers' salaries to the national average.\ Result: Difference in salaries has narrowed from $2,108 in 1985 to $291 now, according to the state Education Department. Baliles' aides say Virginia will reach the national average of $29,614 before he leaves office.\ Goal: Provide local governments the full cost of meeting the state's Standards of Quality for education, a state-mandated list of minimum standards for all public schools.\ Result: Achieved in Baliles' first year.\ Goal: Establish statewide elementary guidance program.\ Result: Guidance programs expanded from 46 to 80 school divisions, with 500 counselors. The state has 139 school divisions. By this fall, all elementary schools must have one guidance counselor for every 500 students.\ Goal: Renewed emphasis on literacy.\ Action: First Lady Jeanne Baliles has promoted this issue, while additional state money has been spent on literacy programs.\ Goal: Expand use of magnet schools.\ Result: State has five special magnet schools, including New Horizons in Hampton, plus summer programs.\ Goal: Computer literacy for all students.\ Result: Initiatives include equipping every middle school with at least one computer.\ Goal: Expand preschool programs for disadvantated children.\ Result: 1989 legislation creates a council to coordinate by 1995 the state's proposed preschool programs for all disadvantaged 4-year- olds. The council also will serve as a clearinghouse for information on day care programs.\ Other accomplishments:\ Thanks partly to magnet schools in such foreign languages as Russian and Chinese, Virginia is tied for the No. 1 spot in the country for percentage of secondary students taking a foreign language.\ TRANSPORTATION\ Goal: Explore new ways to finance state highway projects, have sweeping review of all Virginia's transportation needs, with appointment of special panel.\ Result: Panel was created. Resulted in special legislative session in 1986, during which several taxes were increased to raise about $1 billion each year for 12 years for all aspects of transportation, from road construction to ports and airports. Under construction are 752 projects.\ Goal: Change in highway spending formula to give urban areas more money.\ Result: Formula changed.\ Goal: More money for Metrorail subway system in Northern Virginia.\ Result: Money increased through new taxes.\ Other accomplishments:\ Reorganized state highway and transportation department.\ ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\ Goal: Divide office of Secretary of Commerce and Resources into separate cabinet offices, one responsible for economic development agencies and the other responsible for conservation agencies.\ Result: Split in 1986, creating cabinet level Secretary of Natural Resources and Secretary of Economic Development.\ Goal: Add additional urban enterprise zones, which give special tax breaks to attract jobs and business to economically distressed areas.\ Result: Zones increased from 12 to 15, with four more to be added this year. Plus, several federally designated zones would become state zones.\ Goal: Coordinate university/ industry research and development projects.\ Result: Primarily organized through the Center for Innovation and Technology, which coordinates research projects at Virginia colleges that could attract business to Virginia. The center is also responsible for coordinating projects that would boost Virginia's space industry.\ Goal: Restore the state agriculture industry to prominence.\ Result: Reorganized Agriculture Department, restructured marketing strategies, marketed goods on overseas trips and provided grants to help businesses and colleges study diversification. Alex Hamilton, a spokesperson for the Virginia Farm Bureau, says it is too soon to say if Baliles' efforts will pay off.\ Goal: Aggressively pursue international markets for Virginia's projects.\ Result: Went on seven overseas trade missions to promote Virginia's products and more are planned for this year.\ Results: relocation of the German-based Wella Corp. from New Jersey to Virginia; increased sales of Virginia soybeans to Japan; increased businesses attracted to the port of Hampton Roads, his aides say. Created the Virginia Department of World Trade.\ Goal: Create small business section in the secretary of economic development's office to obtain federal contracts.\ Result: Not done yet, but he plans to hire a person in 1989.\ Goal: Establish regional domestic offices around the country to market Virginia goods.\ Result: Not done. State decided it was less costly to keep its workers in-state and make out-of-state trips. Marketing associates were increased from eight to 10 in Richmond, while an additional associate was placed at the Center for Innovative Technology to cover the Washington, D.C., market.\ Other accomplishments:\ Budgeted $100,000 for Communities in Action to help specific small, rural areas attract business.\ TAXES:\ Goal: No tax increases.\ Result: Backed raising sales tax by half a penny, raising gas tax by two cents and vehicular titling tax by 1 percent to improve highways, ports and other transportation facilities.\ In 1989, proposed giving local government authority to add 1 percent to the state income tax to raise money for roads. Legislature limited the option to Norfolk and several Northern Virginia localities.\ Changed state income tax code to offset windfall of up to $200 million a year state would have received due to federal tax revisions. Changes in state code benefited mostly low and middle- income workers.\ A one-time credit of up to $35 per dependent on state tax returns filed in 1990 was approved this year, also to offset windfall from federal tax revisions.\ STATE GOVERNMENT\ Goal: Not to increase size of state government.\ Result: Full-time positions authorized have grown from 90,803 in January 1986 to 98,932 as of January 1989. Another 3,300 positions are being added in budget covering the fiscal year ending in 1990, including those hired by the state Lottery Department. That department, approved by the voters, was just one of several new agencies or departments created by Baliles.\ Goal: Create an efficiency in government commission.\ Result: Commission was created and proposed numerous ways to cut paperwork.\ Goal: Incentive pay to reward state employees.\ Result: Incentive pay plan created.\ SOCIAL PROGRAMS\ Goal: Increase number of for-profit and non-profit child care providers and establish task force on child care.\ Result: Task force established, produced blueprint for corporate day care. Also increased state aid to help low-income workers pay for day care.\ Goal: Increase Aid to Dependent Children payments to 50 percent of cost of living.\ Result: Proposal rejected by General Assembly. Legislature put more money in employment training programs for welfare recipients.\ Goal: Improve child support collection.\ Result: Change in system resulted in payment delays in 1986 and 1987 to hundreds of mothers and a court order against the state to correct the problem. The problems forced the state to eventually dump its computer system.\ State laws governing child support collection were over hauled in 1988, making it easier to collect from delinquent parents. For fiscal year 1988, Virginia collected $87 million in child support, 26.5 percent more than in 1987. That exceeded a goal for the state set by the federal Family Support Administration.\ Goal: Appoint task force to identify federal programs for elderly and designate a member of governor's staff to work with older citizens.\ Result: Both were done.\ Goal: Continue program of taking mentally disabled people out of state institutions and caring for them in the community.\ Result: Population of state mental institutions is now 5,867, compared with 6,364 before Baliles took office. People cared for by community based program has increased from 212,392 to 264,296, or 24.4 percent.\ Local community service boards were provided nearly $100 million in the 1988-90 budget to care for people released from institutions. That's an increase of 30 percent since Baliles took office. Community service boards are locally based agencies that coordinate out- patient services and treatment programs for the mentally ill. Also increased money for shelter workshops for mentally disabled and physically disabled persons. Community based programs increased by about 52,000.\ Goal: More spending on mentally ill.\ Result: Spending to care for the mentally ill, mentally retarded and people with alcohol and drug problems has increased 27.7 percent, from $753.4 million to $962 million.\ The National Alliance for Mentally Ill last year cited Virginia as one of six most improved states in care for the mentally ill. The state went from 38th to 23rd nationally.\ Other accomplishments:\ Pumped millions into Medicaid and increased programs to prevent infant mortality."
160," Come on down\ Hampton History Museum has a big story to tell\ Hampton's claim to fame is a mouthful: It's ""the oldest continuous English-speaking settlement in America."" That makes for a lot of history, and now Hampton has a spanking new place to tell its story.\ The new Hampton History Museum opens Saturday. Some are already saying it may be one of the best local history museums around.\ But this isn't just the history of one town. What makes the story of Hampton so interesting is that it intersects with many of the watershed events of our nation's history, from the arrival of colonists and the first Africans, through a raft of wars, right up into the space age, when the Mercury astronauts trained here. It's a history that weaves together many strands and peoples: the original Indians, English settlers and enslaved Africans, and all of their descendants.\ The museum begins at the beginning, when Hampton was home to the Kecoughtan Indians. Because digs in the downtown area have unearthed so many archaeological finds -- many of which are on display -- Hampton is a great place to learn about town life in the colonial era. In one of the galleries, visitors pass through a ship's hold and learn about the transatlantic trade that fueled the colony's growth, as ships set out from Hampton laden with Virginia's bountiful tobacco and returned with the manufactured goods the colonists needed.\ The bane of sailors, of course, was pirates. Sure to be a hit with kids is a depiction of a (fabricated) head of Blackbeard, who terrorized shipping until he was killed off North Carolina by a Royal Navy detachment that set out from Hampton. They impaled his head on a pike on the Hampton River shore, a primitive but unmistakable warning to others who might be inclined to piracy. Fast forward through the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 -- in both of which Hampton saw action -- to the Civil War, and a gallery that considers the decision by local Confederates to burn their town rather than cede it to the Union forces occupying Fort Monroe.\ The ""Crabtown"" gallery explores the rise and fall of the seafood industries that dominated Hampton's waterfront and economy -- and gave it its distinctive scent -- into the 20th century. A final gallery brings the story into today. A large space for changing exhibits will give visitors a reason to come back again and again.\ Visitors will enjoy a combination of large-scale environments that create a vivid sense of history and a wealth of artifacts, the real stuff of history. Sure to be a favorite is the museum's treasure trove of photographs that preserve people and moments from the past -- from bathers at Buckroe Beach, decked out in head-to- toe bathing costumes, to steamers pulled up at the old landing at the foot of Victoria Boulevard.\ Hampton has been waiting a long time for the right place to showcase its rich history. The new museum is a reality because a group of stalwart Hamptonians refused to give up on their dream of a museum that does justice to a town that is, as they do like to boast, ""the oldest continuous English speaking settlement in America."" They planned and dreamed and pried money out of the city and state and their fellow citizens. Now, city officials hope the new museum will add to the mix of attractions that will draw more visitors to downtown.\ The new museum makes the trip worthwhile.\ HAMPTON HISTORY MUSEUM\ 102 Old Hampton Lane\ Call 727-1610 for information\ Who you gonna call?\ For transportation solutions, it's not Jim Gilmore\ The name of the group is the Coalition for Innovative Transportation Solutions.\ So far, so good.\ But now -- that didn't take long, did it? -- we get to the traffic jam, the tollbooth, the gridlock.\ The co-chairman of the new group is Jim Gilmore, as in former Gov. Jim Gilmore, as in the same Jim Gilmore whose transportation policy earned him the handle ""Governor Gridlock.""\ Yes, Gilmore will help steer a group financed by transportation consulting firms and oil companies that make asphalt. Seems they want to build some roads. Could be a good idea, but in going to Gilmore for help, it's hard to take this group seriously.\ ""In a time of limited budgets,"" Gilmore told The Washington Post, ""there have to be more innovative and creative ways to build.""\ Well, he should know about limited budgets, having helped limit Virginia's budget by cutting the car tax. (Hey, for those who don't like general taxes but are willing to put up with user fees -- fees paid by people who use a specific service -- isn't the car tax the ultimate user fee? If you want to use the road, pay the associated user fees -- car tax, gas tax, tolls. But then we Virginians want to eliminate the car tax; we won't raise the gas tax; and we refuse to implement tolls. And then we complain about traffic jams. Go figure.)\ Gilmore also went on record as opposing the fall transportation referendums, which were all about trying to do something innovative to build roads. (Innovative as in getting around the roadblock to construction put in place by the General Assembly's failure to provide adequate transportation funding.)\ Here's what state Sen. Kenneth W. Stolle, a fellow Republican, said about Gilmore at the time: ""Gilmore just doesn't have any credibility on transportation issues. The transportation department, VDOT, has never been worse than when Gilmore left office.""\ True words. Somebody needs to phone it in to the folks with the Coalition for Innovative Transportation Solutions."
161," The price of gasoline has increased as much as 15 cents since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and no one is expecting it to do anything but continue going up. This is despite the fact that the United States has enough oil stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to offset the loss of supplies from Kuwait and Iraq for up to 10 months.\ The rising prices demonstrate a lost opportunity and prove one of the arguments for a higher federal gasoline tax. The opportunity came in 1986, when the average price of gasoline reached its lowest point of the decade, slightly more than 93 cents per gallon. In 1981, it had peaked at $1.35 a gallon. In 1982, Americans spent nearly 4 percent of their disposable personal income on oil and gasoline. Last year that figure was only 2.2 percent.\ Clearly, Americans are not being impoverished by energy prices, and clearly they could have afforded a higher tax on gasoline throughout much of the '80s, a decade now recognized for its consumption binge.\ A higher gas tax would have brought the federal government immense revenue. The money could have been used to ease the deficit crunch, or directed back into transportation where it could have perhaps prevented the infrastructure crisis so many urban areas face today.\ The higher price for gasoline would have encouraged conservation, making Americans less dependent on foreign oil, and the environment would also have benefited.\ But, and here's the point that's pertinent today, the tax could have been imposed on a sliding scale that would have allowed it to be reduced during a crisis to help ease the impact of any sudden, short- term increases in prices. This would have given energy prices a little more stability, something consumers would appreciate right now.\ As it is, consumers are hearing oil companies justify current price in creases by saying they're necessary to prevent panic buying. That's like lighting a match to find out where a gas leak is.\ Hindsight is not a commodity much in demand, but if the present Middle East crisis can be resolved and prices at the pump settle back down, perhaps the Bush administration - recently freed from its self- imposed ""no new taxes"" bondage - will see the wisdom of a higher gas tax.\ A little self-restraint - in the form of a higher gasoline tax - can have its rewards."
162,"Today's debate: Deficit spending; Our view: Popular proposal would drive the nation deeper into debt.\ Today's debate: Deficit spending\ Our view: Popular proposal would drive the nation deeper into debt.\ Even U.S. senators who consider themselves ""fiscal conservatives"" boast they are ""big spenders"" when local highway construction projects are involved. And they have a lot to crow about back home this week -- $318 billion to be precise.\ That is the cost of the six-year highway and mass transit bill the Senate passed last Thursday before embarking on a 10-day holiday recess. Lawmakers are quick to point out that the measure, nearly 50% bigger than an expiring public works program, will create jobs, relieve congestion and boost economic activity in every state.\ What they don't say is that the federal gasoline tax earmarked to fund such projects covers only 62 cents of every highway dollar they plan to spend. The government would have to borrow the remaining $122 billion -- on top of a record $521 billion in debt it expects to incur this year.\ Such profligacy belies recent pledges by government leaders to rein in the runaway spending that has driven the national debt past $4 trillion -- the equivalent of $36,000 for each U.S. household. If Congress and the Bush administration want to show they are serious about reducing the federal deficit, they could start here by either cutting highway spending or raising the gasoline tax to cover the full cost of the measure.\ Instead, the Senate bill uses accounting gimmicks to hide the red ink.\ Lawmakers are resisting a less-expensive plan the administration backs that still could increase the deficit by as much as $60 billion. Yet the administration and Republican leaders in Congress both rule out any increase in gasoline taxes to fund new transportation projects.\ While senior members of the House Transportation Committee want a more costly $375 billion highway package, at least they propose to pay for it through a 5-cents-a-gallon hike in the gas tax, now 18.4 cents. They argue that the gas tax hasn't been raised since 1993 and that an extra nickel merely would reflect higher inflation.\ President Bush has threatened to veto any bill that includes a tax increase or a price tag bigger than the $256 billion transportation package he is pushing.\ But after more than three years in office, he has yet to use his veto in spite of lawmakers' irresponsible spending. No president since the 19th century has gone as long without using the tool the Constitution gives him to block congressional excess.\ Defenders of the Senate legislation claim highway improvements are long overdue. They say poor road conditions cause 35% of the 43,000 vehicle fatalities each year, and traffic congestion costs the nation $70 billion in wasted fuel and productivity. Backers also say the bill could create 2.7 million jobs.\ Beyond the safety and economic arguments they cite, politicians know highway spending is a winning issue in an election year. Already, the road-building lobby has advertised how much money each member could take home under the House proposal.\ Any benefits worth passing now should be worth financing now, too, instead of imposing on future generations to foot the costs. If Congress is unwilling to exercise fiscal restraint on its own, Bush can show belated leadership by vetoing legislation that doesn't pay for itself.\ Promising new roads without providing a responsible plan to pay for them takes motorists -- and taxpayers -- for a ride.\ TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE\ Something for everyone\ Every state would get $1 billion or more from the Senate's $318 billion highway bill.

163,"Deliverance\The seeds of our economic debacle were certainly sown before the current administration. The utter collapse of our banking and financial institutions were avoidable years ago when Congress went on its extended sabbatical.\Purely and simply, the constraints, oversights and regulations that were in place were not enforced. The housing bubble, buoyed by irresponsible sub-prime loans to high-risk individuals, was just too good to rein in. Even Alan Greenspan admitted that he had always expected the financial and banking industry to act in its own best interests without rigorous regulation and oversight.\Just recently, President George W. Bush decided to infuse the union-strapped auto moguls, cart-before-the-horse-wise, with billions earmarked for the financial community so the Big Three could avoid bankruptcy this month, no doubt including exorbitant provisions for their ineffective executives, despite their condescending offers to work for a dollar each during 2009.\To compound the outrage, Bush inserted a sentence into the Troubled Asset Relief Program law that enables the continuation of excessive executive pay and benefits of targeted firms which do not intend to sell their troubled assets to the government in an auction. In other words, a flagrant circumvention of the intent of TARP.\Again, where was Congress which had either tabled or disapproved the multibillion handouts to the auto moguls? On the bright side, what the executives don't receive in public largesse may eventually filter down to the economy in small droplets.\Moreover, Bush and Congress couldn't have done it all alone. It's politics, special interests, trickle-down, and carte blanche to the plutocrats and titans of industry everywhere. Counting down to deliverance!\Lewis Williams\Williamsburg\When will it end?\The Democratic-controlled government tells us to drive less to help save the environment. The Republicans tell us to drive less to use less foreign oil. So, after sky-high gas prices, the American public does just what our government asks us to do. Now that we have changed our driving habits, they are trying to raise the federal gas tax by 50 cents, and they are asking the state governments to do the same because they are not making enough money. When will it end?\America voted for ""change,"" but I have a feeling it will be business as usual, and lately the government's business is take, take, take from the middle class and spend, spend, spend on everyone else. If they need more gas tax to pay for more road projects, like Interstate 64 through Hampton, I would rather drive on dirt.\Michael Cooper\Seaford\Protect yourself\I have not been an advocate for gun ownership for self protection in the past, but I have changed my mind. The rampage of burglaries and other crimes in southeast Newport News is awful in the extreme. Families should not have to live in fear, but they are. The Newport News police have not been able to stop these terrible crimes, and I believe it is time for citizens to arm and protect themselves. Everyone has the right to protect their families, their property and indeed their own safety.\If I lived in that area, or if my neighborhood were attacked as the southeast has been, I would buy the best firearm that I could afford. These thugs would not be breaking into homes with impunity if they knew they may face an armed resident. This is a war, and the enemy must not win.\J.E. Taylor\Newport News"
164,"Virginia Senate: 6th District The Daily Press brings the candidates directly to you, the voters - both online and in print. Our reporters posed questions to candidates about the issues that affect you - from the funding of roads to county growth. These are their responses, as they submitted them.\ Q: Many people think that the General Assembly should change the so-called abusive driver fees that were included in the 2007 transportation plan. What other provisions of that plan, if any, would you favor reconsidering when the legislature returns in 2008?\ A: The abuser fees must be fixed as soon as possible. I will co- sponsor legislation this January that makes sure that out-of-state drivers pay these fees. I am committed to ensuring the abuser fees are fair and apply to all drivers. I support repealing many of the abuser fees except for those that apply to drunk drivers and the most dangerous driving offenses. These tough-on-drunk-driver fees will help make our communities safer. The General Assembly never proposed excluding out-of-state drivers from abuser fees. The Transportation Plan passed by the General Assembly at the end of the session included out-of-state drivers, and many of the Senate Democrats voted against it. In fact, 14 Democratic Senators and 22 Democratic Delegates only voted for the Transportation Bill and the Abusive Driver Fees after out-of-state drivers were removed from the bill by Governor Kaine in the Veto Session. An additional change I support is removing the grantor's tax increase from the regional transportation plan.\ Q: How should the state pay for road construction?\ A: I am committed to improving both our regional and our statewide transportation plans. The primary means for paying for state road construction has been the gas tax and a small part of the sales tax. Our new transportation plan includes additional sources of income. We also need to look at using more public-private partnerships, and we need to reform VDOT to make it more efficient. The good news is that the transportation funds raised by the new HRTA stay in our community. Our new regional plan brings $200 million a year in new additional road money to the region to reduce traffic, improve road safety, promote economic growth, and greatly improve hurricane evacuation. These plans are the most significant investment in our transportation system in decades.\ Q: The Virginia Tech tragedy has sparked a debate over care for the troubled mentally ill. What changes to Virginia's mental health system would you support in the wake of the April 16th tragedy?\ A: We need to do all we can to help those who suffer from mental illness. Mental illness is a brain disorder that can be treated through medication and therapy. It is imperative that we strengthen Virginia's mental health system. I strongly support additional funding for community treatment facilities that will provide high quality care. These programs have proven effective in getting people treated and employed. I have consistently supported increases in funding for mental health services. I am also a supporter of the Mental Health Court docket in the Norfolk court system which has proven effective in facilitating treatment for those who suffer from mental illness.\ Q: What will be your personal top legislative priority in 2008?\ A: As your Senator, I have eight years experience working to ensure better schools, safer neighborhoods, lower taxes, and a cleaner environment. As a result of our hard work, Virginia has been rated the ""Best Managed State in America."" As I did in 2007, I will again in 2008 serve as the chief sponsor of a constitutional amendment to allow localities to lower your real estate taxes by 20 percent. People should not be taxed out of their homes. As a state senator whose children attend public schools, I will work to improve our schools through high academic standards and higher teacher salaries. I will also work to increase funding for the clean-up of the Chesapeake Bay, building upon our recent record investment made toward cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. I will also work diligently to ensure that illegal immigrants do not receive instate tuition at Virginia universities and colleges, and other taxpayer-funded benefits.\ Q: Do you support an expansion of preschool as proposed by Gov. Tim Kaine?\ A: As your Senator and a parent whose children attend our public schools, I am committed to making sure every child has an opportunity to receive a high quality education. I support providing additional funds for the expansion of pre-school programs, and especially for those that help our at-risk 4-year-olds. Virginia has a proven record of leading the country in implementing high standards in education. Our successes were recently recognized by Education Week, which stated that children born in Virginia have a better chance of success in life than those born in any other state in America. Expanding access to high-quality education is always a high priority for me.\ Q: What are some areas in which the state can cut spending to fund other priorities?\ A: As your Senator, I have worked hard to ensure that our tax dollars are effectively used to help ensure better schools, safer neighborhoods, and a cleaner Chesapeake Bay. I will continue to support our welfare reform programs which save tax dollars by getting people back to work and off welfare. I will also work to save taxpayer dollars by working to ensure that illegal immigrants do not receive instate tuition at Virginia universities and colleges, and other taxpayer funded government benefits such as Medicare and Medicaid.\ Nick Rerras\ Party: Republican\ Address: P.O.

165,"Energy efficient cars have benefits, primarily to the environment. But there's a downside, too: They throw a wrench into transportation funding.\For decades, the primary way money was raised for roads, bridges and tunnels was by tying a tax to gasoline and diesel fuel. The advantages are obvious: It connects the amount a vehicle owner contributes toward roads to how much he uses those roads. Vehicles that don't get out a lot don't get as many fill-ups as the road warriors. Vehicles that log a lot of miles on asphalt buy more gas and pay more tax.\That worked well when the ideal family vacation was to ""See the USA in your Chevrolet."" But fuel efficiency has become more of a priority in car design and car buyer decision-making since those happy days.\Further cutting into gas tax collections are hybrids, which use as much road but don't consume as much petroleum. And now come vehicles that won't use any gas and won't pay anything, by way of gas taxes, for the bridges they cross and the interstate ramps they coast down.\The result is that gas tax collections are no longer adequate to build and maintain the road structure that American commerce and our way of life require. Even with adjustments - ship more freight by rail, build more developments where people, at least hypothetically, drive less and walk more - we still need to deal with an imbalance between funds available and funds needed.\Raising the per-gallon tax is one option - one Virginia should definitely move on, since its state tax has lost much of its buying power since it was last adjusted, in 1986. That will help top up the road-building coffers, but it won't address the issue of fairness, or making sure all vehicles contribute in proportion to their use of roads.\Another option is a tax based on miles driven. But short of odometer police, who invite cheating, that requires some device that tracks how much a vehicle travels. That gives the heebie-jeebies to anyone who has concerns about privacy and is leery of government's inclination to overreach into private lives - and, as we're reminded by the latest hints of federal surveillance of citizens in the absence of any terrorism connection, we should always be leery.\Which leaves us needing something to tie taxes to, something that vehicles that drive a lot need more of and those that drive less use less of. Presto: tires.\The more you drive, the quicker you go through tires and the more of them you buy. So why not a road-financing mechanism that's added on, as an excise tax, to the purchase of tires?\That way we could collect money to repair and build the roads those tires, and the vehicles they're attached to, roll down. But they could go when and where they want and nobody in an official capacity would be keeping track.\This would have to be accompanied by another money-raising option: tolls. Yes, they're inevitable - and fair. They shift the burden of paying for a road to those who use it; truckers pass the burden on to shippers and ultimately it gets passed on to the consumers of goods that travel by road, as it should. For a state like Virginia that maintains a transportation infrastructure in part to accommodate tourists, it's essential to capture some road money from out-of-state visitors, who may not buy much gas and likely don't buy tires here. Gov. Bob McDonnell has suggested charging tolls at the border with North Carolina. Yes, indeed, but toll booths also need to go up at the northern and western borders.\Conservation, tolls and reasonable usage taxes: It will take a variety of mechanisms to raise the money for the roads, bridges and tunnels we need. What makes sense is an approach that makes all users pay as they go."
166," WASHINGTON -- The energy crunch that President Bush will address this week is poised to become the domestic equivalent of the spy plane standoff with China: his first real test and a potential political crisis.\ For the president and Republicans in Congress, the stakes are high. With gas prices soaring and blackouts rolling through California, the public expects action. Bush raised expectations by blasting his Democratic rival on the issue during the presidential campaign, speaking of an energy ""crisis"" and naming his vice president to head a task force just four days into his presidency.\ But by eschewing most quick fixes and proposing some controversial solutions, Bush risks fueling the type of backlash that helped oust former president Jimmy Carter after the oil shocks of the late 1970s.\ Already, the early soundings about what Bush's energy task force will recommend Thursday have inflamed conservation groups. Democrats question Bush and Vice President Cheney on their commitment to the environment and their links to corporate interests. One reason: Bush's early career as an oilman and Cheney's most recent job as CEO of Halliburton Co., a worldwide engineering and construction company for the petroleum industry.\ ""It's a difficult set of issues,"" Cheney said in an interview with USA TODAY. ""There's a lot of controversies that surround them. (But) to some extent, it should be easier to get people to pay attention because they are now increasingly faced with daily evidence that we do have a problem.""\ Even Republicans warn that, if the problem defies solution, Bush will get blamed. ""He's in charge,"" says Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ""Most people are not going to hear a lot about how we got here. They know they've got $2 gas and maybe $3 gas and ask, 'What is the president going to do about it?' ""\ The administration has an ambitious wish list: up to 1,900 new electric power plants in the next 20 years, 38,000 miles of new natural-gas pipelines, more electricity transmission lines and an increase in oil refining capacity.\ At a news conference Friday, Bush said the high price of gas ""concerns me a lot"" and that passing his proposed tax cut would be the best way to respond quickly. ""What this nation needs to do is build more refining capacity,"" he said, with the government encouraging long-term capital formation and offering regulatory relief.\ Surveys show the public is wary, however. A USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll last week found that although 94% believe the nation faces a serious energy problem, they favor conservation over production. Investment in renewable energy sources had twice as much support as increasing nuclear power. And 57% opposed the proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling.\ Cheney and other administration officials say Bush will say in a speech Thursday that the energy problem took more than a decade to develop, and that solving it also will take time. Technological innovations make the old energy-vs.-environment debate obsolete, he will say. He won't say it's necessary for Americans to turn down their thermostats in winter and don Carteresque cardigans. ""Some think that conservation means doing without,"" Bush said Saturday. ""That does not have to be the case.""\ But energy policy can be a tough sell. Ask Greg Schneiders, a White House adviser to Carter, the one-term president who compared the 1970s energy crisis to the ""moral equivalent of war"" and proposed conservation and price controls.\ ""Carter felt . . . that it would be politically doable to come up with a solution that wouldn't make too many people massively unhappy,"" Schneiders recalls. In the end, ""we got gas lines and voter rage.""\ How we got here\ Unlike in the 1970s, today's energy woes don't stem from a lack of supply. The world's known oil reserves are growing as Russia and the Caspian Sea region open to foreign investment. The U.S. has enough natural gas to fulfill its growing demand for several decades, not counting huge gas reserves in Canada and Mexico. The United States has among the largest coal reserves in the world, and that fuel generates more than half the nation's electricity.\ ""This is not a natural-resource problem,"" says Ken Lay, chairman of natural-gas giant Enron. ""Our resource base is virtually unlimited.""\ Instead, the problem arises from bottlenecks. Increased competition has forced companies to reduce excess capacity at refineries and pipelines. In the past, that capacity provided a margin of error if facilities had to be shut down for emergencies or maintenance. Now when pipelines and refineries are closed for the switch to summer gasoline blends, prices soar. In California, routine maintenance of power plants can send electricity prices skyrocketing.\ A decade of rock-bottom gasoline prices in the 1990s depressed investment in energy exploration. Squabbling between state and local governments, and between energy companies, stymied pipeline construction. Political instability and sanctions curtailed investment in oil fields abroad.\ Those constraints -- and soaring demand from gas-guzzling sport- utility vehicles, a growing world economy and an energy-intensive high-tech industry -- have created what the non-partisan Council on Foreign Relations calls an ""energy sector in critical condition.""\ Even so, industry officials say most problems in the energy- supply system stem from economic factors, not regulation or government action. In some areas, economic factors will be an impediment to Bush's solutions. Steven Miller, chief executive of Shell Oil Co., says profit margins are so slim on domestic refining operations that it makes no sense to expand capacity, especially since there is plenty of oil refinery capacity abroad. Bush's proposed regulatory relief may help existing refineries work better but won't entice Shell to expand, he says.\ In other areas, the market is beginning to respond.\ When natural gas prices plunged during the 1990s, the number of drilling rigs operating in the continental United States and the Gulf of Mexico fell by about half to 450. Now that gas prices have skyrocketed, the number of drilling rigs is nearing a record 1,000. Once new supplies of natural gas begin to reach the market, prices should begin to fall.\ Similarly, California's electricity woes stem partly from a lack of generating capacity. In the 1990s, private investment in power plants was frozen by uncertainty about deregulation and the future of electricity markets. Now high prices and increasingly free electricity markets have led to a resurgence in construction plans.\ But waiting for the market to respond isn't easy. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., bemoans the rising monthly natural-gas bill for his home in Yorkville, Ill.: from $278 in December 1999 to $780 a year later, the result of higher prices and colder weather. ""It's a crucial situation, especially in the Midwest,"" he says.\ Focusing on the future\ Bush will argue that the nation needs a comprehensive energy policy to ensure that adequate steps are taken for supplies now and in the future. The administration will propose:\ * Opening federally protected lands, including Alaska's wildlife refuge, to oil exploration.\ * Encouraging the development of energy-efficient vehicles, appliances and building technologies through tax credits, regulatory standards and new federal funding for research.\ * Giving the right of eminent domain to federal regulators so they can force the sale of private property to ease construction of electric power lines.\ * Easing regulations to promote expansion of oil refineries, construction of electric power plants and extension of oil and gas pipelines.\ * Offering federal funds to help utilities upgrade aging nuclear reactors and extend operating licenses.\ Administration officials don't plan to impose short-term regulatory fixes or force changes in consumer behavior through mandates, such as higher auto fuel-efficiency standards. Bush's proposed budget for 2002 would slash funds for energy-efficiency research on the grounds that industry can handle such costs.\ Some in Congress would go further. They want to temporarily reduce the federal gasoline tax, now 18.4 cents a gallon, or encourage federal regulators to cap wholesale energy prices in California. But the administration is reluctant to reduce the gas tax, which is used to finance road construction. And Bush has reminded aides that his opposition to Carter's price controls on natural gas helped prompt him to make his first bid for public office, an unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978.\ At Friday's news conference, Bush expressed empathy for hard- pressed motorists and said he was ""open-minded for any suggestion somebody may have."" But he didn't offer support for any of the measures being touted in Congress to offer immediate relief.\ ""It takes a couple of years to build a power plant,"" Cheney said in the interview. ""You can't do that overnight. There's no way short- term to manufacture kilowatts. You can take some conservation steps . . . but basically what we focused on here is the long term.""\ California nightmare?\ That may be fine for Bush; he won't run for re-election until 2004. But a third of the Senate and all House members face voters next year, and Democrats need to pick up just six House seats to wrest control from the GOP. Some Republicans have warned the White House that a long, hot summer of energy woes will create political problems, particularly if they must defend long-term gain in the face of short-term pain.\ ""Listen, presidents, whether things are good or bad, get the credit or blame,"" Bush acknowledged Friday. ""I understand that.""\ The president begins a public-relations drive this week. In his radio address Saturday, after Cheney was criticized for seeming to dismiss conservation, Bush outlined some of the task force's recommendations on conservation, including support for a temporary tax credit to encourage the purchase of energy-efficient hybrid-fuel cars. Today, the White House hosts labor leaders for a preview of the plan in the hope of enlisting their support for exploration and production increases, which would create jobs. On Wednesday, Bush will preside over a Cabinet meeting to receive the report. He leaves Thursday on a two-day trip to Minnesota, Iowa and Pennsylvania to sell it. First stop: a power plant in St. Paul, where innovative technology produces low-cost heat.\ But Bush isn't the only one talking about the energy crunch. Environmental groups plan a coordinated attack on his plan this week. Democrats in Congress last week held press conferences outlining their own solutions and bashing Bush. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., charges the president has ""a policy of aggressive indifference to the problems he himself has identified.""\ Political sensitivities are highest in California, where the crisis is now being felt most acutely. Embattled Democratic Gov. Gray Davis accuses the White House of doing too little to help. Democrats are targeting four of the state's GOP House members as vulnerable.\ ""Republicans here are quite concerned at the White House's perceived lack of empathy and lack of action,"" says Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a professor at Graduate University in Claremont, Calif. A continued energy crisis in California could cause economic repercussions nationwide, she says. ""If California's economy tanks, most likely the Western region's economies tank, and the national economy tanks,"" Jeffe says. ""Then you will see a real political risk involved for the Republican Party and George W. Bush.""\ Contributing: Kathy Kiely\ TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE\ Public view of solutions to U.S. energy problems\ A USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll last week asked what measures should be taken to respond to the nation's energy problems.

167," The wages of sin are death. The taxes aren't as high, but we can change that. The General Assembly is considering raising the so- called sin taxes on beer and tobacco, but a broader view - and more money - is needed. This is true on the federal level as well as the state.\ Taxes, in addition to raising money, also give government a way to influence behavior. Assume doughnut consumption is too high. A special tax on doughnuts would raise their price, thereby reducing consumption. Maybe. If people are addicted to doughnuts, they will buy them anyway, but there's still more tax revenue. Or, a black market in doughnuts could develop, cutting demand for the more expensive, taxed doughnuts.\ Still, a tax wisely applied could increase government revenue while also improving the health of the general population by reducing doughnut consumption.\ Another advantage of sin taxes has been demonstrated recently: They provide an alternative revenue source for politicians too scared to suggest raising general taxes.\ Sure, folks who profit from the manufacture and sale of sin don't want higher taxes on their products, but the average voter isn't likely to make a big public stink over the fact that he smokes or drinks so heavily that he can't afford to pay more in taxes on a six- pack of sin.\ Still, sin taxes as currently defined can't provide enough money to do all the things that government needs to do. But the solution is simple: create an additional sin tax.\ This means finding a product associated with harmful behavior and then taxing it. Consider, then, not a tax on doughnuts, but a tax on gasoline. True, it's already taxed. But that isn't thought of as a sin tax, and there is great resistance to raising it. Redefine it as a sin tax, and the politicians will have something they can support.\ As a candidate for a sin tax, gasoline is perfect. Its primary use is as a fuel for cars, and think of the damage the automobile has done to American society:\ * It has destroyed our downtowns by enabling people to move out to the suburbs and beyond.\ * It is heavily responsible for our reliance on oil from the Middle East and the costs associated with protecting access to that oil. As Sen. Charles Robb has said, ""We wouldn't have put 500,000 troops in the Gulf if Saudi Arabia's main export were kiwis.""\ * Our trade deficit is caused in part by the need to import oil.\ * Much of the damage done to our environment is due to emissions from automobiles. Also, there are environmental costs associated with getting oil out of the ground, refined and to the service station.\ Society could blame gasoline at least partly for teen-age pregnancy - we all know what goes on in automobiles - skinned knuckles that come from trying to fix cars, lost productivity caused by traffic jams and long commutes, and the huge costs of maintaining interstates and other highways. The list could go on and on.\ Robb has endorsed a 40-cent increase in the federal gas tax, but not to increase revenue. No, he would give the money back in a rebate, the hope being that the public will accept the plan because there's no overall increase in its tax burden, and in the process the higher price at the pump would prod certain changes in society, such as the production of more fuel-efficient cars. He wants to use the tax to alter behavior.\ But the rebate is a weird gimmick. Let's just label the gas tax a sin tax and then raise it along with the others. People might support that, and we'd all be better off.\ * Jesse E. Todd Jr. is associate editor of the editorial page."
168," Vote Yes\ As a member of the York County Board of Supervisors and the current chair of the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, I would like to share a few thoughts for consideration by the citizens of this region as the Nov. 5 transportation referendum vote nears. First and foremost, this vote is about congestion and our future quality of life.\ A bit of history may be helpful.\ Some argue that it is the state's responsibility to fund these six needed projects. The fact is, however, that the state has never participated in paying for major facilities in this region. The Hampton Roads Bridge- Tunnel; James River Bridge; Virginia Beach Expressway (Interstate 264); three crossings of the Elizabeth River between Norfolk and Portsmouth, and the Coleman Bridge, Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel and Chesapeake Expressway to North Carolina, were and are all being paid for with special taxes outside the state funding formula.\ Others have suggested a statewide increase in the gas tax to pay for these needed projects. Unfortunately, it would require an increase of 21 cents above the current 17.5 cents, to pay for the Hampton Roads projects.\ Does anyone honestly think that state legislators representing other areas of Virginia, not faced with our congestion problems, are really going to vote for that level of gas-tax increase for our benefit?\ Some have also suggested that tolls be used especially on the Third Crossing.\ Here are the facts: As a stand-alone facility, the Third Crossing would require a toll of about $13 each way. This arrangement would never get financed. The investment bankers would not risk lending money for a facility with such a prohibitively high toll and with two free facilities (the HRBT and Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge- Tunnel) on either side.\ Regarding the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission: This organization has been serving the interests of our local governments since 1969. It is managed entirely by locally elected officials and chief administrative officers from the 16 communities that comprise the commission.\ The projects included in the referendum are part of the region's approved long-range transportation plan that passed all the appropriate air-quality tests. The HRPDC is staffed with professional engineers and planners with advanced degrees and professional certifications.\ All the financial audits have been clean. Although some have alleged that the HRPDC is not qualified to manage these projects, the fact of the matter is that the HRPDC plans and prioritizes funding for more than $100 million in transportation projects every year as part of the development of the Transportation Improvement Program.\ The HRPDC planned and developed a $133 million Resource Recovery Program now administered by the Southeastern Public Service Authority of Virginia and the $62 million Hampton Roads Regional Jail. The HRPDC is capable of this task.\ I am often asked what will Hampton Roads be like if this referendum does not pass. It's difficult to look into the future, but let's look back for a moment. Just consider what your daily activities, your job, your cultural and recreational life and your safety would be like if the Crossings of Hampton Roads did not exist; if the James River and Coleman bridges did not exist, if the Virginia Beach Expressway and Elizabeth River crossings did not exist. Imagine how limited employment and educational opportunities would be without these facilities we now take for granted.\ Remember what it was like to drive Route 168 in Chesapeake into North Carolina before that expressway was built with tolls.\ A generation ago, decision-makers looked to the future, saw a need and made the tough decisions to fund these and the other projects we use every day. Please be mindful of this legacy. It is this generation's turn to step up for our children and their children.\ Is a 1-cent increase in the sales tax too much to invest in their future? For this region to be competitive in the coming years and have a quality of life not filled with the struggles, risks and inconveniences that come from hours of daily congestion, we, too, must be willing to plan for the future.\ We can have an exciting and productive future, but it will not come from standing by and doing nothing or blaming others. This referendum will allow us to shape our future, to manage where growth will take place and to create an economic environment that will provide opportunity for our children.\ I urge all citizens of Hampton Roads to become informed on the benefits of these projects and to join with leaders from business, labor, the military, chambers of commerce, civic leagues, public safety and many others in voting for the transportation and other referendums on the Nov. 5 ballot.\ Noll is a member of the York County Board of Supervisors."
169," ALL ABOARD\ An important early step has been taken in the development of a light rail system in Hampton Roads. The Tidewater Transportation District Commission has endorsed construction of a $376 million system that would link Norfolk and Virginia Beach on existing railroad tracks paralleling Interstate 264 and Route 44 between downtown Norfolk and the oceanfront. Many layers of approval and funding remain to be satisfied, but the project is alive for the moment.\ This southside development is important to the Peninsula because this first link being discussed might someday - well into the 21st century - be tied into similar light rail routes on the Peninsula. Highway traffic patterns on the Peninsula make it clear that transportation options will be needed. Imagine being able to take the train from Williamsburg to Virginia Beach, for either work or a day's recreation. An exciting possibility.\ SOUND THINKING\ People constantly complain about government, saying it's intrusive or bloated, but they're also constantly asking government to do something for them. Bring in economic development. Protect the environment. Spend less money. Take on projects that cost more money. The contradiction is both amusing and frustrating.\ And so we are pleased to see a bipartisan effort asking private citizens, non-profit organizations and businesses to work together to undertake a task that is typically assigned to government: protecting green space.\ The effort is being promoted by state Sen. Thomas K. Norment Jr., R-Williamsburg, and Del. George W. Grayson, D-James City. They are suggesting formation of a group to complement the government efforts aimed at preserving the aesthetic values of the Williamsburg area. Their idea looks good to us, and we hope there is sufficient interest to move it forward.\ A GREEN PASTURE\ Charles Peters, editor in chief of The Washington Monthly, keeps a sharp eye on the goings-on in the nation's capital. In the May issue of his magazine, Peters reports:\ ""If the members of Congress who are retiring at the end of this year attain their normal life expectancy, 29 will receive more than $1 million in pension payments from the taxpayers. ... The champions will be Sen. William Cohen at $3.4 million and Rep. Pat Schroeder, who should be helped by feminine longevity to amass a grand total of $4.2 million.""\ Isn't this a little too generous?\ GAS ON THE FIRE\ We continue to hope that market forces will bring the price of gasoline back down before the panderers in Washington repeal the 4.3- cent increase in the gas tax that President Clinton pushed through three years ago.\ Gas prices, even during the current spike, remain low when adjusted for inflation. And they are low compared with the prices in other nations: more than $4 a gallon in France, Germany and Japan.\ The comparatively low price in the United States contributes to energy gluttony, environmental degradation, poor transportation policy and dependence on foreign supplies. Federal and state taxes average less than 30 percent of the price of a gallon of gas in the United States, 50 to 80 percent in other nations. Cutting the gas tax is a political gimmick that is going to hurt this country.\ AN EXCEPTION\ While we generally support higher entrance fees for federal parks, the Smithsonian Institution's decision not to impose admission fees for the museum complex in Washington, D.C., is welcome. The Smithsonian is, truly, America's museum, and we think its doors should remain open to all who come to the capital.\ LETTERS WELCOME\ At Daily Press reader forums, we have tried to educate the public that we value letters to the editor that reflect a range of viewpoints. Still we receive missives such as a recent letter with the writer's P.S. that ""I ... challenge you not to `reject' it because it is too long, brutally honest, doesn't support your views, or any other reason.""\ Let us be clear: We have no problems with ""brutally honest"" or unsupportive letters. Disagreement is good for the public discourse. We do edit letters for length for two reasons: The longer a piece of writing is, the less chance it has of holding the reader's attention, and publishing shorter letters makes room for more letters - and viewpoints.\ As for ""any other reason,"" we do reserve the right to ""challenge"" letters that make unsubstantiated or libelous claims such as, hypothetically, that something in the public water system causes AIDS or that some public official is on the take. In sum, letter writers, stick to the facts, try to be short and feel free to espouse whatever political cause you choose.\ LIMITATIONS OF FAME\ The toy kingdom of professional sports has suffered some painful intrusions by the real world in recent weeks. In baseball Hall of Famer Rod Carew lost an 18-year-old daughter to leukemia, and two top players were diagnosed this week with serious ailments, Brett Butler with throat cancer and David Cone with an aneurysm in the vicinity of his pitching arm.\ These players' fortunes and good health insurance ensure the best care money can buy, but neither money nor fame makes anyone invincible. The best picture is that the brave faces Carew, Butler and Cone have put on their predicaments provide inspiration to other people undergoing similar struggles."
170,"WASHINGTON - Top Democratic congressional leaders cast aside a brewing showdown over presidential oversight Monday and pitched President Donald Trump on a ""big and bold"" infrastructure bill ahead of a White House meeting on the issue, insisting there are ""significant majorities in both the House and Senate"" ready to act.\House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are set to meet Trump on Tuesday, joined by other leading Democrats. In a letter sent Monday, the pair asked Trump to entertain infrastructure legislation with ""substantial, new and real revenue"" - as opposed to previous GOP plans that have focused on using smaller amounts of public money to leverage private investments. They did not specify a dollar figure for the package, though many have discussed $1 trillion as a bare minimum.\Paying for such an investment is the major challenge, and potential revenue sources all carry political risks. Lawmakers from both parties have discussed increasing the federal gas tax for the first time since 1993, but Democrats are eyeing a rollback of the Republican tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017.\A Democratic official close to Schumer said the Senate leader would not consider a gas tax hike - which would be a disproportionate burden on working-class voters - unless Republicans consider undoing some of their tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity.\""We look forward to hearing your ideas on how to pay for this package to ensure that it is big and bold enough to meet our country's needs,"" the leaders wrote to Trump on Monday.\Pelosi and Schumer also said any infrastructure bill must address ""clean energy and resiliency priorities"" and expand ""beyond transportation and into broadband, water, energy, schools, housing and other initiatives."" They also call for ""strong Buy America, labor, and women, veteran and minority-owned business protections.""\The Democratic leaders' emphasis on bipartisanship comes at a time when relations between the White House and congressional Democrats could hardly be worse, with Trump determined to resist virtually every effort on Capitol Hill to investigate and check his administration. For instance, Attorney General William Barr's scheduled testimony this week before the House Judiciary Committee is in question amid a dispute over the format of the hearing.\But Pelosi and Schumer have insisted on making legislative entreaties to Trump - particularly on the issues of infrastructure and prescription drug pricing, where they see a path to a bipartisan deal.\Regarding infrastructure, the two wrote Monday: ""This bipartisanship is a reflection of the American people's recognition of the need to rebuild our infrastructure to promote commerce, create jobs, advance public health with clean air and clean water, and make our transportation systems safer - indeed, to improve the quality of life of all Americans.""\Reversing any part of the 2017 tax law could be a red line for Trump and congressional Republicans, who consider the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the crowning legislative accomplishment of the administration. Undoing the cuts, some fear, could undermine a strong economy.\Democrats, meanwhile, see that revenue as crucial to any deal, and any Republican willingness to engage in that conversation stands to be an early indicator of whether Tuesday's talks are fruitful.\White House officials on Monday played down the prospect of a breakthrough at the meeting.\National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow told reporters Monday the meeting would be ""a good sit-down, a good discussion,"" but the administration would not be pitching Democrats on any specific infrastructure proposal.\Press secretary Sarah Sanders suggested the meeting could touch on topics far afield from infrastructure.\""Look, the primary purpose of that meeting is to discuss infrastructure, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised at all if immigration comes up,"" she said Monday on Fox News. ""It's a major problem in this country, and so far Democrats have refused to acknowledge it and address it.""\The House Democrats expected to join Pelosi at the meeting include Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland; Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina; Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico; Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio of Oregon; and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts.\The Senate Democrats set to join Schumer are Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois; Assistant Minority Leader Patty Murray of Washington; Democratic Policy and Communications Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan; Thomas Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee; and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.\Credit: By Mike DeBonis - The Washington Post\Caption: Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are scheduled to meet with President Trump on Tuesday.\Andrew Harnik/Associated press"
171," The morning after\ With the thrill of victory comes the smell of reality\ To the winners, congratulations. First prize is trying to figure out what to do with Virginia's budget. (Which means second prize must be trying to figure out what to do with Iraq's budget.)\ Lest any of the men and women elected to the General Assembly on Tuesday be wondering -- ""What now?"" -- here's a quick assessment of the quandary that awaits them in the legislative session that begins in January:\ * The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission is not the tool of some alien intruder; it is the General Assembly's watchdog agency. And it is barking. So either shoot the dog, muzzle it or heed its warning.\ In no area is the bark louder than public education. Basically, the state is not meeting its financial obligations -- it's not paying its fair share of the cost of elementary and secondary education based on the state's own formula, and that is forcing localities to pay a greater share to pick up the slack. And because localities get more than half of their revenue from real estate taxes, the state's failure is a direct contributor to soaring real estate tax bills. (And get this, there will be multiple bills introduced in the next session aimed at capping the amount that localities can increase real estate taxes. The people who introduce these bills will look you in the eye and say they want Virginia to have first-rate schools.)\ The state needs to pay more of the tab for public education. That's the proper way to take pressure off of local taxpayers, not by imposing artificial caps on a local taxing authority.\ * Gosh, you get the kid out of high school and whaddya know, she wants to go to college. Surprise! She's not alone. The State Council of Higher Education estimates an additional 30,000 Virginia high school grads will want to attend a state-supported college or university by 2010. And this influx over current enrollment will be into a system that (no surprise here, sadly) isn't getting sufficient support from state tax dollars. One result of that is higher tuition. Another is more students in classes. Another is that more and more faculty will be employed part time. And yet another is that state schools will increasingly turn to out-of-state students, who pay the full costs of their education. And that means your kid might find it a little harder to get into college than you had anticipated. But don't worry, there's always a private college or university, with tuition of about $20 gazillion per semester.\ * Moving right down the list, we come to transportation. Twenty years ago, Virginia increased its sales tax by a half-cent to help pay for roads. That was the last time any significant action was taken to address highway funding. Since then, because of inflation and better fuel efficiency, the primary transportation taxes have lost about 40 percent of their buying power. And, of course, construction costs have gone up, the number of cars has increased, the number of miles traveled has increased. A greater share of road money goes to debt service, and more and more must be used for maintenance rather than new construction. Virginia's gas tax, by the way, is 17.5 cents per gallon, which ranks it about 40th. (In both North Carolina and Maryland the tax is more than a nickel higher.)\ * Congressional studies suggest Medicaid spending will increase at roughly 8.5 percent a year over the next decade. Right now, Medicaid spending takes up about 12 percent of the state's general fund budget. It works out to an anticipated need for an additional $300 million -- just for the next biennium.\ No need to talk about the environment here. And there are other infrastructure needs -- substantial, in fact, if you assume the state wants to keep its public buildings from falling down. There's public safety, which means the costs of housing prisoners and the increased security needs related to the threat of terrorism. So deciding how to deal with this host of problems ought to be sufficient to keep the lawmakers occupied -- although no doubt some of them will find the will and the way to muck about in places they don't belong. These tasks would be daunting enough if there were some agreement at the top, so to speak, about how to go about solving them. But the other day, Speaker of the House William Howell made it clear he will oppose any tax reform plan that increases taxes. This seems to put him at odds with the governor, although what exactly the governor will propose remains something of a mystery.\ So our lawmakers, freshmen and veterans, will head off to Richmond with lack of clarity about how to solve the state's problems. But the problems are big enough that only the willfully blind won't see them.\ College housing\ Williamsburg controversy confirms need for more dorms\ Where's the best place for college students? On campus.\ But at William and Mary and many other schools, there are more students than dorm space. That leaves hundreds renting space in the Williamsburg area.\ There's an inherent conflict between the lifestyles of students and their would-be neighbors. College students are notoriously nocturnal, and their comings and goings and noise spill into the wee hours. They're also notoriously social, and many pursue with single- minded delight the opportunity to revel in sociability free of parental constraints. The out-fall of that pursuit -- parties, traffic -- collides with what their elders want: well-maintained neighborhoods, peace and quiet. Coexistence necessitates compromises, but when neighborhoods are shared, the nonstudents often feel like they do most of the compromising.\ That's why the best thing for Williamsburg is to expand the availability of living space in the one place designed with students' lifestyles in mind: the college campus.\ The importance of William and Mary's plan to build new dorms along Jamestown Road has been reaffirmed, once again, by the controversy over a proposal to create a special zoning district for high-density student housing, fronting on Richmond Road. While it's unfortunate that the dorms will sacrifice much of Barksdale Field's open space, the college is doing the right thing: It is confining expansion to the campus footprint, it has chosen the best available site and a sensitive design, and it is undertaking a move that will strengthen the college and the experience it provides for students.\ The Barksdale dorms won't add much capacity, but will, mostly, relocate students now exiled to off-campus locales. But a case could be made for still more dorms, financed by income from room fees.\ Still, the city must address the pressure to accommodate students without jeopardizing neighborhoods or the effort to reverse Richmond Road's descent into blight -- and address it in the Comprehensive Plan.\ The student housing district -- which the Planning Commission rejected -- now goes to the City Council. Predictably, it will be assailed by neighbors trying to protect their community, and supported by those who believe that designated student apartments will reduce pressure on adjacent residential areas.\ In the long run the best thing Williamsburg can do to safeguard its special corner of the world is: support the college's efforts to provide on campus the amenities, including dormitories, that students need, and to resist pressures to increase the number of students."
172," The House voted Thursday to replace the nation's 59-year-old policy for housing the poor in largely federally funded projects with block grants giving more power to local officials.\ The Clinton administration said it would oppose the Republican- written bill unless changes are made to assure that public housing remains affordable for the most impoverished.\ Nonetheless, 91 House Democrats joined all but four House Republicans to pass the measure by a 315-107 vote.\ Democrats said the plan would increase rents for the poor and turn many of them out into the streets; majority Republicans said the changes would help rid the nation's largest cities of crumbling and crime-ridden housing projects.\ ""This bill begins the process of strengthening communities,"" said Rep. Rick Lazio, a New York Republican. ""We're getting back to local involvement, local flexibility.""\ Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros commended the House for endorsing changes he said President Clinton had put in place, but he said supporters of the bill were ""wrong to allow rents to be raised on the working poor and to deny scarce federal housing aid to families most in need.""\ The Senate passed a less sweeping public housing overhaul plan in January, and negotiators from the two houses would have to work out the differences.\ Under the House bill, the country's 3,400 local public housing authorities would be closed and replaced with new agencies with more autonomy. The government would divide $6.3 billion in block grants among them in each of the next five years.\ GAS TAX CLEARS HURDLE. A proposed rollback of gasoline taxes to help motorists cope with soaring prices cleared a key House committee Thursday, and Republican leaders said they expect final action before Memorial Day.\ The House Ways and Means Committee advanced legislation that would suspend the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax for seven months, despite warnings by Democratic lawmakers that oil companies, not consumers, are most likely to benefit.\ House Speaker News Gingrich, R-Ga., told reporters that he expects the full House to vote on the tax measure within two weeks and that it has wide support.\ The 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax was approved in 1993 on top of an existing 14-cent-a-gallon levy as part of a broader deficit reduction effort championed by Clinton and Democrats who were then the majority in Congress. Not a single Republican lawmaker voted for it.\ But Democrats on the panel repeatedly raised concern over whether the savings will make it to the consumer.\ `MEGAN'S LAW' SENT TO CLINTON. Congress moved Thursday to heighten public scrutiny of convicted sex offenders in a bill requiring local officials to release information on their whereabouts.\ The legislation was passed by voice vote late Thursday in the Senate and sent to President Clinton for his expected signature. The House passed the bill Tuesday night on a 418-0 vote.\ The measure adds new teeth to a 1994 law that required states to alert local law enforcement officials when convicted sex offenders are released from prison. Under the new measure, police would have to notify the public when offenders deemed dangerous move into their neighborhoods.\ States that fail to comply with notification requirements may lose federal aid under the bill. Attorney General Janet Reno has endorsed the bill and Clinton is expected to sign it.\ LIMITING LAWSUITS. The House on Thursday sustained President Clinton's veto of a bill limiting damage awards in lawsuits over faulty products.\ The vote was 258-163 in favor of overriding Clinton's objections - 23 votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed to enact a law over the president's veto. Local lawmakers split on the vote. Reps. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Newport News, and Norman Sisisky, D- Petersburg, voted to override the veto. Reps. Robert C. Scott, D- Newport News, and Owen B. Pickett, D-Virginia Beach, vote to sustain the veto.\ Limiting monetary awards for damages has been a major goal of manufacturers and businesses for 13 years. Consumer groups and lawyers representing people who claim to have been harmed by faulty products have just as adamantly opposed any such limitations.\ MINIMUM WAGE. Emerging from a meeting with House leaders, moderate Republicans said Thursday that a floor vote on a minimum wage increase could come within two weeks.\ The battle over the minimum wage has been intensifying in both chambers of Congress. President Clinton has said he would sign a gas- tax repeal only in tandem with legislation raising the $4.25 minimum wage.\ After meeting with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., told reporters ""the leadership feels the House is entitled to a vote.""\ ""The leadership is more than willing to have a vote in the next two weeks on the issue,"" Shays said.\ BUDGET ADVANCES. President Clinton warily lauded Republicans Thursday for edging toward his fiscal priorities as the Senate Budget Committee completed a new GOP budget-balancing plan and the House budget panel neared approval of a similar measure.\ Amid verbal fusillades fired by lawmakers of both parties, the Senate Budget Committee approved an election-year blueprint for fiscal 1997 that pledged $122 billion in tax cuts and about $700 billion in savings, enough to end annual federal deficits by 2002. The party-line vote was 13-11, and approval by the House budget panel was expected later in the evening.\ As in last year's stalemated budget duel with Clinton, Republicans would trim taxes and rein spending for Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and scores of other domestic programs more deeply than the president wants. But eager to defuse Democratic accusations that they were again heartlessly axing programs for the elderly, children, the poor and the environment, Republicans moderated some of their proposals - and talked about it.\ The congressional budget does not need Clinton's signature and is a nonbinding guide for later legislation that will make tax and spending changes. But it is a crucial political document, since it allows Republicans to banner their vision of government.\ HOW THEY VOTED\ Here is how local lawmakers voted on the housing bill:\ * Herbert H. Bateman, R-Newport News: Yes\ * Owen B. Pickett, D-Virginia Beach: Yes\ * Robert C. Scott, D-Newport News: Yes\ * Norman Sisisky, D-Petersburg: Yes"

The blunder I am referring to was Garrett's decision to buy property not at all suited for his intended purposes.\ It now seems Garrett is seeking exceptions and/or variances to the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act to rectify his snafu. Could it be that the only thing that will help Garrett overcome his multimillion-dollar error is if he is excused from having to abide by the same rules and regulations, and elongated processes, so many others with waterfront property have had to endure? Garrett simply bought the wrong property for what he wants to do; this opinion is shared by many in the public trust familiar with the intended project's site.\ In my nine years here I have personally ""ridden out"" all the major storms and nor'easters our locality has endured during that time, including Hurricane Isabel. Those storms have been nothing compared to the 18 months or so Garrett has been here. I invested here knowing full well the dangers of Mother Nature but did so realizing that the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act would help limit my risk. I have had debris on my property after storms from three previous owners; however, the amount of structure Garrett wants to build, combined with a marina's worth of vessels, cannot be accommodated without severe damage to my house and its surroundings.\ Perhaps it is time for Garrett to accept the reality of the environment in which he has chosen to live and thereby find peace with his neighbors.\ Tim McCulloch\ Yorktown *\ Guns and teens\ I am very disturbed regarding recent accounts of a teenager attacking the police station in Chantilly, Va. (""Police search home of teenager who killed detective at station,"" May 11). It would be interesting to hear what the parents have to say about all of the weapons found in the home of this teenager. What were they thinking? Knives hidden in cushions, guns laid out in various rooms and suicidal thoughts in a notebook, not to mention all of the weapons found on the body of the teenager when he was shot and killed.\ As a parent of a mentally disturbed teenager, would one have allowed these weapons to be in one's home, and as a friend would one have not spoken with someone in authority about the threats he had been making for over a year?\ Too many guns are within reach of far too many teenagers. One detective dead, one police officer dead, and a third wounded, all because of those who did not believe a mentally disturbed person was capable of such an act. When is it going to stop? Why are there so many guns readily available to teenagers?\ Anne Warthan\ Newport News\ NN real estate taxes\ I find it interesting that the Newport News tax assessments came out after the May 2 elections for mayor and the City Council. I think the elections should have been held after tax assessments were sent out. I do appreciate the fact that the council lowered the tax rate by 4 cents even though my personal real estate taxes still increased by over 28 percent.\ I feel that this increased tax burden is totally unreasonable. Most people's incomes are not increasing by 28 percent. Our council needs to find other financial solutions for its out-of-date retirement programs and budget issues rather than dumping its financial burdens on the Newport News taxpayers.\ We are blessed that our real estate is more valuable; however, we should not be forced to move because the City Council is not sensitive to the increased financial pressures felt by the Newport News taxpayers.\ Please join me in taking the attitude of the Chesapeake voters: The council members will either vote to lower the tax rate to a reasonable level or they will lose their seats in the next election to someone else who will.\ Jim Cumming\ Newport News\ No more taxes\ Funding for transportation is a problem; however, I take issue with the opinion that new taxes are the correct answer to that problem.\ For 15 years I have lived in Hampton and York County while I have worked in downtown Newport News, and the only time I sit in traffic for any extended amount of time is when I go through the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel. The problem is not city roads; it is the highways and their users.\ Road construction and maintenance are paid for, in varying percentages, by federal, state and local funding, which means that we are already paying for roads with portions of our real estate, personal property, sales and income taxes. Flat taxes on goods and services, like the proposed gas tax, tend to be regressive because percentage-wise they take more of the payer's income as his or her income decreases. This is the opposite effect of a progressive tax, such as income taxes that percentage-wise increase as the payer's income rises.\ The proposed gas tax will result in our paying every time we drive, even just around the corner for milk, to further subsidize the highways. The effect of the tax would be to take more money from those on fixed and limited incomes than those of greater means. Seniors, for instance, will be paying even though they may rarely use the highways and will pay more than those of higher incomes that use them every day.\ Senators, please do not increase the tax burden on our fixed- and limited-income citizens again.\ Kimberly S. Powell\ Hampton\ Poor planning\ I am somewhat disturbed by the apparent haphazard manner in which the refurbishment work is being done at Buckroe Beach. The work is progressing at a pace similar to that of the Mercury Boulevard and Interstate 64 project.\ A new sidewalk was installed, and then they decided to dig up the area for a fire hydrant. By doing the work in this sequence, the new sidewalk was cracked and had to be removed and replaced. Trees and shrubs were delivered to the site before they were ready to be planted; now quite a few of them are dead from lack of water while a sprinkler system is in the process of being installed. Better planning would have eliminated this waste of taxpayers' money.\ Roddy Bryan\ Hampton *"
174," STATE'S DUNLOP RESPONDS\ Your recent editorial about air permits was disconcerting, primarily because of its unintentional misleading of the public regarding Virginia's Title V air permit program. I say unintentional because I am quite certain you based your opinion on ""news stories"" you assumed to be accurate. They were not.\ May I supply some facts to this story?\ The Allen administration did not fight the Environmental Protection Agency in court over the Title V air pollution paperwork program; we fought for the right of Virginians to decide who was going to make the rules for Virginia courts. We thought, and still do, that Virginians should make the rules for Virginia courts. EPA can make the rules for federal courts if they wish to - and they do. The General Assembly reversed its long-held position on this issue in 1996. Gov. Allen not only signed the change, but strengthened it before he signed it.\ Virginia's Title V program remains essentially unchanged from the program we proposed in 1994. Only minor ""fixes"" were suggested. In the meantime, our Title V program has been designed, application forms have been prepared and put on the Department of Environmental Quality Web site for companies to use, training of permit managers, engineers and inspectors in DEQ regional offices has occurred, and outreach to the regulated community is well under way. In other words Virginia's program was launched and EPA approval was a bureaucratic formality, albeit a necessary one.\ Meantime, air quality has improved, right? Didn't Hampton Roads just get re-designated? Isn't Richmond's re-designation out for comment? The Allen administration is fighting hard for the citizens of Virginia - and winning for the people and for the environment. We know you don't agree with us, but please, just the facts will do.\ Becky Norton Dunlop\ Secretary of Natural Resources\ Richmond\ RAISE GAS TAX\ Reference John Matthews' June 26 letter, ""Highway tolls inefficient,"" on the ill-advised and expensive proposed tolls to finance the construction of a new bridge-tunnel:\ He hit the nail on the head. The cost of tolls would probably exceed the cost of the tunnel, in the long run. Consider the thousands to build toll facilities at the proposed four locations, the wages of hundreds of personnel necessary to operate this system, the interest paid on the bonds and the costs of floating the bonds, as well as cost of collecting tolls and the Fastoll installations.\ The logical method of raising funds is to raise the gas tax now so that the monies raised during the interim will be available for construction 15 or 20 years from now. This plan would eliminate all of the excessive costs of the illogical plan previously put forth.\ Also, why are the Tidewater communities always expected to have tolls on almost every vital link to our highway system? Gloucester and York counties have twice been saddled with tolls for a bridge across the York River. Virginia Beach had tolls on an intercity highway and also paid for an HOV lane that was a fiscal failure, and all of the cities of Hampton Roads have paid dearly for connections from one city to the other. Was the Harrison Bridge tolled? Was the lightly used six- and eight-lane Richmond ring road, Interstate 295, tolled? Of course not.\ So, wake up and use the tax facilities already in place. Don't establish another wasteful bureaucracy to collect tolls.\ Walter Stubbs\ Woods Cross Roads\ DAVID AND GOLIATH\ I just can't resist the obvious analogy of David and Goliath to the Southern Baptist-Disney controversy. Here was a puny teen-ager facing off against a giant of a man. No one expected him to win. Not the enemy. Certainly not Goliath. And not even his family and friends. The only one who believed was the one doing the battle - the one who mattered. David believed that he would be victorious because Goliath was not fighting just the Israelites. He was fighting against the Lord.\ The giant Philistine taunted David as he said to him, ""Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks? Come here and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!"" That's been a big part of the argument by those saying the Southern Baptists don't stand a chance of even hurting Disney, let alone making any significant difference by their boycott. Disney is the all-powerful giant and the SBC is the annoying little, pesky gnat that just won't go away, even for its own good.\ But it isn't over till it's over. ""David said to the Philistine, `You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, who you have defied. This day the Lord will hand you over to me. ... I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel ... for the battle is the Lord's, and He will give all of you into our hands' "" (1 Sam. 17:43- 47).\ I'm sure many of you are thinking, ""This guy thinks God is on his side."" You are right. I do believe that God is on the side of morality and purity and right acting. But what I believe is not even the point. Let's just watch what happens. If the giant loses, we will know, won't we?\ Jim Moynihan, pastor\ Grafton Baptist Church\ York County\ LICENSING USELESS\ Why does Jim Gilmore, a conservative, keep trying to appeal to the teachers union in his TV ads? He says he will hire 4,000 new teachers with the extra revenue. Why not let the people of Virginia keep the money instead of throwing it away to the union whores? Better yet, give it to private, unlicensed teachers, who turn out pupils who can read and write. Most teachers licensed in Virginia could not even pass the core battery of the N.T.E. That's why it was replaced.\ My advice to Gilmore would be to visit more local public schools from York County to Norfolk. Most pupils are three and four grades behind private schools. The teachers are licensed, which means nothing.\ Richard McCormick II\ Hampton"
175," DEFENDING `THE PLEDGE'\ Reference Jim Spencer's Feb. 4 column, ""Kids will learn to love pledge - or else"":\ Spencer misses the mark again. God forbid we should make the little darlings do anything they don't want, including repeating the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" to the flag of the United States of America. Perhaps, had he given it some thought, that is exactly what is wrong with today's schools.\ We hear frightening stories of substitute teachers, lack of respect and discipline, but Spencer goes right along defending student anarchy. If it takes an act of the state legislature to make the kids toe the line, so be it. It certainly appears that between the local school boards' inability to enforce discipline and the ACLU's constant defense of some ""rights,"" there seems to be a great deal of time spent on matters other than learning.\ That a child is required to learn his times tables, the rules for adding and subtracting, spelling and punctuation is too much for some because learning has not been a required subject. Maybe the 15 to 20 seconds of compliance while repeating something well worthwhile will instill some feeling of authority. Whether Spencer likes it or not, allegiance to this flag should be taken more seriously than something about which to write in a column when he can't find a better subject.\ It is the ""liberty and justice for all"" part that Spencer evidently would separate from the pledging part, which requires a commitment. It is the pledging part that achieved the liberty and justice, lest he forget, as it appears he has forgotten.\ If we require our children do nothing, they will do exactly that. Nothing.\ Bert Wisner\ Williamsburg\ NO REASON TO YIELD\ Reference the Feb. 3 Associated Press article ""Gay minister to try again to meet with Robertson"":\ This is a local and continuing story of a ""gay minister"" who has been harassing 700 Club founder Pat Robertson. This minister believes, probably rightly, that Robertson doesn't speak kindly toward homosexuals. He has visited the Christian Broadcasting Network center to torment Robertson about it and has won a stint in the Virginia Beach City Jail for his efforts. He now is to try again after his release.\ But why should Robertson not send this guy packing back to his clandestine church from whence he came? Certainly, the Bible contains passages where it clearly condemns this filthy act performed by homosexuals and states that it is an abomination to God, and God is what the church is all about. Further, the church has in the past 30 years received so many liberal shock attacks that there are few left that can be called truly houses of worship. Many have installed ""female ministers."" Others follow different paths into the ways of the world and will reap what that sows.\ Robertson, who represents the church and whose ministry has sustained so many, must not yield and take the route that not only pains the church further but eventually will destroy it.\ Thomas P. Chandler\ Yorktown\ FIGHTING BACK\ Reference R.W. Staples' Feb. 5 letter, ""Cable complaint"":\ I agree with his assessment 100 percent. Warner Cable was way too expensive as it was without the letter of increase we received. I was so angered that we dropped all we had except basic cable.\ I urge everyone to drop to basic in retaliation for their price gouging and iron-fisted services.\ We are now saving for a satellite dish, as many others are doing.\ Patrice Wolfe\ Poquoson\ BUS SERVICE ESSENTIAL\ Reference Rick Tetreault's Feb. 2 letter, ""Tighten bus service"":\ Tetreault has the right idea when he uses economic analysis to declare ""legislation to increase the gas tax 2 cents per gallon is not necessary.""\ Shrewd management, including ""cutting routes that are not cost effective,"" can cut costs to Tidewater Regional Transit, he states. Let supply and demand rule. No doubt, consultants around the country would echo his advice to the company: Downsize for efficiency.\ Tetreault's mistake lies in his assumption that TRT's bottom line is the most important factor. This problem extends beyond the books of any one company. We must consider what is good for our community. Can our community bear the cost of decreased bus services?\ The government long ago recognized that certain industries are vital to diverse members of an area. It granted individual companies monopolistic rights to service an area, based on their promise to service the entire area. Among those industries are telecommunications and transportation. TRT must continue to fulfill its obligation, but it may need some help.\ Can this community bear to eliminate affordable bus lines that our brethren rely upon to get to work and to the store? How will a decreased bus service affect the decisions of other people wishing to enter and strengthen our community? We are being asked to help our neighbors stand on their own feet now, rather than pay the price of economic decline in the future.\ The gas tax is not merely a reaction to problems we face today but shows long-term thinking for tomorrow. By supporting it, we will encourage the use of public transportation over gas-guzzling private vehicles. In the process, we will make a decision that benefits people most of us haven't even thought of. Save more of our environment today, that our children may enjoy it tomorrow.\ Neil Rosenblatt\ Williamsburg\ SCHOOL HELPED\ Thanks to staff members at Beachside Alternative School for the fine work they are doing.\ My son came to them with an indifferent attitude. He did not care to learn or study, and his grades were D's and F's.\ After only one semester at Beachside, he made the honor roll and transferred to Bethel High School. My thanks to school staff members and in particular, the guidance counselor, whom thankfully I never got to know as well as I did my son's counselor at his last school, because my son no longer got into trouble.\ I wish I could do more to acknowledge the important job you have and how very well you do what you do.\ Patsy Campbell\ Hampton\ THANKS FOR HARD WORK\ On Feb. 3-5 I was without power for 47 hours. As uncomfortable as I was I thought of the men from Virginia Power, the Poquoson Police Department and the firefighters and rescue squad who were out there in the storm working long hours to restore our power. I thank each and every one of you and pray that God will bless you.\ Ruth M. Wade\ Poquoson"

177,"
Jack Wilson is out of a job.
\
After 19 years of teaching math and social studies in Weymouth, Mass., Wilson - Norfolk County's 1990 Teacher of the Year - is unemployed for the first time, one victim of the rash of budget deficits plaguing millions in at least half the states.
\
``It's been a discouraging, depressing year for a lot of us,'' says Wilson, among 111 of the town's 600 teachers laid off after residents overwhelmingly rejected a $250 tax increase to bail out the school district. It was the heaviest voter turnout since John F. Kennedy was elected president.
\
True, Massachusetts labors under one of the nation's largest budget deficits. But with states across the USA grappling with financial shortfalls - and looking at hiking taxes on everything from income to liquor - people from New York to California will be paying the price. Add President Bush's reversal on his ``no new taxes'' pledge, and nothing is certain this year but service cutbacks and higher taxes:
\
- In New Jersey, more than 4,000 angry taxpayers Sunday protested the state's cure for a $550 million budget deficit: a massive, $2.8 billion tax increase - including a sales tax hike from 6% to 7% that extends to liquor, cigarettes, soaps and even toilet paper - pushed through by freshman Democratic Gov. James Florio.
\
- In California, traffic gridlock finally got to voters. Last month, they agreed to double the state's gas tax to pay for highway improvements.
\
- In Vermont, residents involved in civil suits - including people who want a divorce - have had to wait six months for their cases to be heard because the Supreme Court cut the courts budget and imposed a moratorium on non-criminal trials.
\
- In Kansas, 1,000 residents stormed the governor's office last fall, protesting a sharp increase in property tax bills - the result of the first state reassessment in 20 years.
\
- In North Carolina, state mental health employees are working double shifts and weekends, thanks to a state-mandated hiring freeze to help make up a $336 million shortfall.
\
``States are making it through 1990 by the skin of their teeth,'' says Marcia Howard of the National Association of State Budget Officers.
\
The public isn't sympathetic.
\
``Recall! Recall! Florio Must Go!'' New Jersey protesters shouted at last week's rally, throwing newly taxed toilet paper on the capitol steps. Florio, who campaigned saying there'd be no need for new taxes, won't face an immediate test - he's not up for re-election for three years.
\
But Kansas voters are so upset by the new, higher property taxes that they're vowing to throw out all the incumbents in the next election.
\
``We've got taxes in some areas that jumped 500%,'' says Jim Mayer, executive vice president of the Kansas Association of Realtors. ``And on top of that, the state's busted. They've spent every dime we've got. Some small business people are going to have to shut down.''
\
Tom Porter might be one of them. Property taxes on the small dog kennel he owns near Kansas City jumped from $543 a year to $10,800 after the reassessment.
\
After unsuccessfully appealing the assessment three times to the county, Porter hired a lawyer. Now he's appealing to the state.
\
``That's the only hope I have,'' says Porter, 62. If he loses again, ``I'll have to close it.''
\
Republican Gov. Mike Hayden might be forced to close shop, too. He now faces both a tough August primary and Democratic competition in the fall.
\
North Carolina's budget woes have tested the patience of thousands of state employees, now straining under a statewide hiring freeze.
\
``There certainly is anxiety about this,'' says Jim Woodall, director of Caswell Center, the USA's 14th largest center for the developmentally disabled, in Kinston, N.C.
\
Woodall says the 120 vacancies at the center mean its 1,680 staffers, who often have to deal with ``very traumatic and unusual behavior patterns,'' are working ``double shifts, overtime and (facing) additional demands on staff already in a high stress, high burnout environment.''
\
Bob Berlam, head of the State Employees Association of North Carolina, which represents 53,000 of 90,000 workers, says he worries about efforts to reduce the workforce.
\
``The taboo word is taxes and instead of addressing the problem by finding new revenues, they've decided to go into the budgets and cut,'' says Berlam.
\
In another effort to reduce the budget shortfall, North Carolina also angered employees by issuing their final June paychecks on Monday, July 2 - one day after the fiscal year ended - rather than on Friday, June 29. The measure allowed the state to transfer about $200 million into the 1991 fiscal year budget to help ``solve'' the 1990 deficit.
\
Howard, of the budget officers association, says that type of maneuvering, which has become commonplace, ``just keeps pushing the problem forward'' because by the end of 1991, the state will again likely be short that $200 million.
\
Though California voters helped out by approving the gas tax, for every state like California ``you're going to find another one or two on the other side of the coin,'' says Corina Eckl of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
\
And when voters won't pass new taxes, not only do cities and towns have to cut key programs, they are unable to save for the future, warns a National League of Cities report out this week. The report says two-thirds of the USA's cities and towns are less able to meet their financial needs than they were a year ago.
\
``What this means for hometown America is that, at a time when we should be investing in our future, we are not even keeping up,'' says NLC's Donald Borut.
\
North Dakota is one example.
\
Voters there rejected a one-year sales tax hike - to 6% from 5% - that would have raised $42 million for education. Last spring, the state cut schools by $31 million and laid off more than 300 teachers.
\
Rebecca Donovan, head librarian in Hazen, N.D., lost her dream job - and her hopes of getting it back were dashed by voters. With two kids and a husband who earns a modest salary at the National Parks Service, Donovan is worried. ``We're looking at a 50% cut in income. I've got to get a job for the fall.''
\
Still, not every state faces fiscal bad news. Some states, like Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, have seen dramatic growth and revenue increases. State spending there is on the rise.
\
But the problems faced in New England, where slow growth has made the financial burden heaviest, are increasingly common. Massive state budget deficits there are attributed to rising unemployment rates, unrealistically high revenue projections, and slowing growth in population and personal income.
\
``That fiscal instability is spreading to other regions,'' says a March survey by the budget officer association.
\
Warns Howard: ``The far west should worry. Like New England, they could see the same thing happen. There's no reason for them to expect to be immune.''
"
178," Paying higher taxes and building more roads are at the heart of this fall's transportation-tax referendum, but advocates for the measure say that it's about much more.\ They say that it's about bringing the communities on the Peninsula closer to the cities of South Hampton Roads.\ That it's about making it easier for truckers and tourists to reach the ports and vacation destinations that make the Hampton Roads area distinctive.\ But most of all, they say that it's about ensuring a decent quality of life for years to come.\ ""This is not just about the people who make the commute across the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel every day,"" said state Sen. Frank Wagner, a Virginia Beach Republican who runs a small shipyard in Newport News. ""This is about the economy and who's going to want to come here.\ ""The alternative is not an area I want to live in. Or at least, it would be a lot more aggravating area to live in.""\ Wagner is part of a sophisticated, well-financed organization -- The Yes Campaign -- that's emerged as the leading proponent of the proposed tax increase.\ Business and political leaders -- Republicans and Democrats -- dominate the group's membership. They say passage of the proposal will send a message that the Hampton Roads area is willing to invest in its future.\ If the highways aren't built, they say, gridlock will become more common. And if employees are forced to spend hours in their cars getting to and from work, then quality of life in the region will suffer. That could prompt big employers to move jobs to other markets and dissuade other companies from moving to this area.\ Coming and going along with jobs are things like sporting events and concerts.\ Supporters have broadened their message in recent months to include issues of public safety.\ They say the added roads will get more cars out of the region in a hurry the next time that a hurricane targets the Virginia coast. And the roads are necessary for a strong national defense. As a military hub, thousands of sailors and soldiers need unclogged highways to reach their bases and get to and from Washington, D.C.\ Opponents of the proposal are less well-organized but equally passionate.\ Some adamantly oppose any tax increase. Others fear that added highways will lead to more uncontrolled growth that would further damage the region's fra-gile environment and drive up costs for schools and other local government services.\ Still others fight the process, saying it's the wrong tax to target for road construction or even that voters shouldn't decide this issue at all.\ ""The way they're doing it is totally out of whack,"" said state Del. Tom Gear, a Hampton Republican who's one of only a few legislators fighting the tax.\ Road building is a state responsibility, Gear said. Also, he said, it's wrong to give an unelected group -- the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission -- the authority to spend this money.\ Earlier this year, state Sen. Marty Williams, R-Newport News, teamed with Democratic Gov. Mark R. Warner to persuade the General Assembly to place the proposal on the ballot.\ After going back and forth among the gasoline tax, the sales tax or tolls, the General Assembly narrowly approved the sales-tax proposal, which asks voters to raise the sales tax in the region from 4.5 cents to 5.5 cents on the dollar.\ The increase is expected to raise enough money to complete $7.7 billion of construction on five highway projects and improvements to the region's mass- transit systems. The tax will go away when the projects are paid for, which could take more than 50 years.\ Critics say the actual cost for these projects will be much more than $7.7 billion by the time construction is completed.\ ""The costs never go down. They always go up,"" said Patrick McSweeney, a former chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia who's trying to coordinate the scattered opposition to the proposal.\ The centerpiece of the five road and tunnel projects is the ""Third Crossing"" -- a $4 billion bridge- tunnel from Newport News to Portsmouth and the naval base in Norfolk.\ But advocates stress that the five projects are linked and say all are of equal importance.\ ""If you build the Third Crossing without widening (Interstate) 64, you get people across Hampton Roads, but you have a traffic jam on the Peninsula,"" said Art Collins, executive director of the Planning District Commission.\ So widening I-64 between Newport News and Williamsburg also is on the list, as is upgrading Route 460 in Isle of Wight and Suffolk. That's designed to ease pressure on I-64.\ Also among the projects is widening the Midtown Tunnel between Portsmouth and Norfolk, in an effort to ease traffic in the nearby Downtown Tunnel.\ And in Virginia Beach, a highway called the Southeastern Parkway would be built to provide an alternative to Interstate 264 and make it easier to reach Route 460 in Suffolk.\ It's the equivalent of building the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel, the tunnels across the Elizabeth River and I-264 all at once, advocates say: Decades ago, leaders had the vision to build those for this generation. And it was primarily area residents who paid the tolls that built those roads and tunnels.\ The focus of debate in the next two months shouldn't be about taxes or spending money, advocates say, but rather about what life will be like 20 years from now if these roads don't get built.\ ""When you spend money, it's one time, and it's gone,"" Wagner said. ""When you invest, there's a return in the future.\ ""We consider this an investment.""\ Terry Scanlon can be reached at 247-7821 or by e-mail at tscanlon@dailypress.com\ REFERENDUM Q&A\ Q: Who gets to vote?\ A: Registered voters in Newport News, Hampton, Poquoson, York County, Williamsburg, James City County, Isle of Wight County, Suffolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, Norfolk and Virginia Beach.\ Q: Politicians are elected to make these decisions. Why are they passing that responsibility on to voters?\ A: Advocates of the tax increase say there is little, if any, chance that the General Assembly would approve an outright tax increase. This is viewed as the best way to begin raising the $7.7 billion needed for the five highway projects and undefined mass transit improvements.\ Q: Why increase the sales tax? Why not tolls or the gas tax?\ A: A seemingly small increase in the sales tax, say one penny on the dollar, is believed to be more acceptable to voters than tolls or an increase in the gas tax, which would have to add 22 cents to every gallon to raise the same amount of money.\ Q: The Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel doesn't seem to be that busy. Why do we need another bridge- tunnel?\ A: Regional planners say that within 10 years, the Monitor- Merrimac will be as busy as the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel is today.\ TRANSPORTATION TAX REFERENDUM\ On Nov. 5, voters throughout Hampton Roads will decide whether to raise the sales tax in the region from 4.5 cents to 5.5 cents on the dollar to pay for five major highway projects and some mass transit improvements. Each Sunday until Election Day, the Daily Press will examine some of the key issues in the referendum."
179," Looking to 2005\ Our editorial agenda for the coming year\ EDUCATION\ Of all the institutions that both anchor and propel the kind of community we want, education is king. With great schools, we can attain a nurturing society, a vibrant culture and a prosperous economy. Without them, there is scant hope.\ Education is the topic at hand, not training. Public education has a subtler and bigger job than just preparing young people to run tomorrow's business, treat tomorrow's sick and build tomorrow's homes. Certainly, training is important and the economic implications of public education are enormous. But the fundamental purpose of education is to teach young people to think, so that they can understand the world and solve problems we can't even foresee today. And it is to pass on to the next generation our cultural patrimony, with all its diverse roots and strands, so that the body of beauty and knowledge that humanity has amassed is preserved and, if we do a good job of those who will inherit it, enriched.\ To fulfill its function, education must meet two standards: It must be universal and it must be of high quality.\ * Universal means that all young people participate in the benefits of education. Even with compulsory attendance, free public schools and vast amounts of money spent, that is not the case, not in America and not in this area. One child in four fails to get the full measure of education that society deems the minimum. These dropouts are only the end stage of an educational system that is far from universal, in which the outcomes are very different for different groups of children. By every measure and at every level, from readiness for kindergarten to graduation from college, a wide education gap persists, and progress to close it is agonizingly slow. The cruel reality is that usually the factor that determines whether a child flourishes or fails isn't ability, but the circumstances of birth.\ The danger of this two-track system, of educational haves and have-nots sorted by race and class, is that it entrenches a self- perpetuating underclass that creates a drag on the economy and a threat to the peace and order of civic life. Closing it will require skill, resources, imagination and commitment on the part of educators, backed up by support and hands-on help from families and communities. It will require broader access to quality preschool, to reach and teach children before they fall behind. None of those things is likely to materialize until the public -- in particular leaders in communities whose children get the short end of the educational stick -- starts demanding improvement and pledging to help make it happen.\ And what of life after high school? Of 100 students who enter ninth grade in Virginia, only 20 will end up earning a bachelor's degree. The onus is on high schools and community colleges to make sure they are equipped with the skills the economy needs. With a public school system that increasingly reflects a college- preparatory focus, career education gets short shrift, and so do employers. Even on that college-bound path, the going is rough: At least one-fifth of Virginia high school graduates who go to college find out they aren't adequately prepared and need remedial work, and many never complete their degrees.\ * High-quality education means, at its heart, quality teachers. Putting a truly good teacher in every classroom will require changes to make the profession attractive to the kind of people it needs, changes such as incentives for great performance (in the form of pay and advancement), policies and parents that refuse to tolerate disruptive behavior, and assurances that the status of the job will be safeguarded by weeding out indifferent teachers.\ If we want quality schools, we have to give them the resources, leaders, and freedom from bureaucratic strangleholds they need to do their job, the most important job in a democratic society.\ THE ENVIRONMENT\ The environment is one of those things you can ignore for one more day, one more year. There will still be air tomorrow -- although more people will have died or been sickened from breathing it. There will still be water in streams and rivers and the bay -- but marine life will still be struggling to survive the destruction of habitats and the addition of pollution. There will be as much land in Virginia -- but more asphalt, less forest, more sprawl and less beauty.\ Yes, you can put off ending and repairing the damage people inflict on the environment. But not indefinitely, and delay may make the problem more severe and the solution more expensive.\ Virginia is one of the most abundantly blessed of states when it comes to natural resources -- but at the bottom of the heap in funding for the environment and conservation. It has made lofty pledges to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and the waterways that flow into it -- but failed to come up with the money or, in many cases, the legal framework to do the job.\ In 2005, Virginia will have the opportunity and the obligation to act on three environmental issues it has been sweeping under the regulatory and budgetary rug for too long.\ * The first is air. Virginia must slash smokestack emissions -- of mercury and other toxins, of pollution that causes smog, acid rain and a host of other problems. It can't take refuge in recent movement by the Environmental Protection Agency in this direction, because the EPA is moving way too slowly, postponing the effective date of improvements so far into the future that it will be a long time before any benefits are reaped. In the meantime, thousands of Virginians will be sickened and die from the dirty emissions from coal-fired power plants and other industries.\ * The second is water. In 2005, Virginia will have an opportunity to take a very positive, long-overdue step, and reduce nitrogen discharges, particularly from sewage treatment plants and agriculture. Excess nitrogen is one of the major problems confounding Virginia's waterways and the bay. The state will also be called on in 2005 to move more aggressively to regulate the menhaden fishery and to protect the Chesapeake Bay from the threatened, unilateral effort on Maryland's part to introduce Asian oysters before questions about the risks they pose have been answered.\ * The third is land. Every once-rural, now-booming locality should act -- now -- to protect environmentally and aesthetically significant green space. They can buy land or development rights. But delay, and they will never be able to reclaim woods cut down and ways of life elbowed out to make way for development. Conservation will safeguard some corners of green, but development will proceed. That's why smart land-use planning is essential to make sure it goes forth in ways that mitigate the effect of sprawl on water, air, land and that special blend of geography and tradition that are the heritage of Virginia's once-quiet corners.\ THE SOCIAL CONTRACT\ ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""\ That's 52 words worth keeping in mind. The preamble to the U.S. Constitution is an elegant expression of the social contract that binds our nation. Here's a crude example of one application:\ When you're driving down the street and you come to a traffic light, and the one directed toward your lane is green, you proceed, comfortable in knowing that those in the perpendicular lane with a red light will stop. If that were not the case, then we'd all stop at every intersection every time.\ Then again, maybe you're not so comfortable going through that green light, given how many people run red lights these days.\ You see, they're not just breaking a traffic law and putting lives and property at risk. They're breaking a fundamental compact of society, an agreement that allows individuals great freedom to pursue their unique interests, in exchange for giving up the right to do whatever it is they feel like doing at any given moment. It's about mutual preservation, mutual advantage.\ Nearly a half-century ago John F. Kennedy spoke of the social contract: ""Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.""\ Such language is not especially fashionable in civic life today. The talk is of tax breaks, of the threat to individual privacy if cameras are used to catch people running red lights, of the ""burden"" that government imposes on citizens. As a society, we are hardly inclined to ask government to look after the other fellow. In fact, at times we even seem to resent giving government the resources to look out for me, myself and I. Hence the insufficiency of funds for public safety and transportation, never mind how stingy Virginia is when it comes to providing medical care for the poor.\ Perhaps the winds are shifting. The slight increase in the state sales tax, agreed to by the General Assembly last year, is evidence of such change. 2005 will offer ample opportunity to weigh whether that action was a fluke or a trend. When issues are weighed -- transportation, Medicaid, education and many others -- will the rhetoric that prevails in the legislature this winter and on the campaign trail in the fall be the rhetoric of crass self-interest? Let's hope for -- let's insist upon -- something broader, something more ennobling.\ ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\ When it comes to economic development, it's all in the mix.\ The goal is to generate and sustain the right mix of jobs. The right kind, in the right quantity, for every segment of society. Enough so people who don't pursue advanced education can find secure jobs -- with adequate benefits, ideally. Enough so well-educated people, with stellar credentials and ambitions and options to match, see a future here. The region has done well for the former, with lots of jobs in retail, hospitality and distribution, but falls short at the high end, in managerial, professional and executive jobs.\ That mix of jobs must also be mixed across industries. Regions that once hoped to ride the high-tech wave into economic nirvana have learned the same lesson that Hampton Roads knows so well about the perils of depending too heavily on defense-related industry: Economic eggs are less vulnerable to the rough ride of the economic roller coaster when they're distributed among many sectors of the economy.\ The best mix is also a blend of new and old. The economic development apparatus works to attract new employers, at the same time making sure the conditions and assistance are in place to help local businesses prosper and grow.\ Achieving the right mix of jobs requires the right mix of incentives. Tax policies play a decisive role. Financial incentives, paid out of public dollars, can make a winning hand in the brutal competition to snare a prospect.\ No one is going to bite on those incentives unless a region offers the right mix of amenities. Some involve infrastructure: Here our port and rail access is a plus, the congestion on our highways increasingly a negative. We're strong on natural beauty, sometimes weak in our track record for protecting it. We can take pride in our cultural amenities, but not in the puny public support they get.\ Education ranks high among the amenities that can make or break an economic development deal. Employers are drawn to locations where schools turn out the kind of employees they want -- skilled or not, go-getters or content to settle for low-wage, low-hope jobs. It's our choice. Companies that employ professionals and executives must locate in areas with schools good enough to satisfy demanding employees. Some employers need strong university research programs; some count on community colleges. Some can be swayed by work-force development resources that will keep their employees up to date and the company competitive.\ Attaining the right economic mix requires aggressive economic development agencies, a strong commitment to education, and state and local officials who make decisions with an eye to their implication for Virginia's and the region's business appeal.\ HEALTH CARE\ Health care in crisis? From the evening news and politicians on the stump and the sticker shock at the pharmacy, it would appear so.\ As fits any crisis in which dollars figure significantly, there are problems on both the demand and supply sides. And there is much that can be done to fix them.\ There's the rising demand for health care that's paid for with public dollars. The huge bill for the Medicare prescription plan will soon start coming due. In Virginia, Medicaid threatens to overwhelm the state budget. And there are fundamental problems with Medicaid and Medicare, which pay providers only a portion of the cost of caring for their patients. Someone has to make up the difference. So when you pay a doctor or your insurance company pays your hospital bill, part of the money goes to cover unreimbursed care for Medicaid and Medicare patients and the uninsured.\ On the supply side, this is shrinking the number of practitioners. It affects Medicaid and Medicare patients: Lots of doctors won't take them, making the burden heavier for those who do. It affects other patients, too. In Hampton Roads a critical shortage looms in some specialties, including neurosurgery, because, compared with other parts of the state and other states, local doctors and hospitals receive less from Medicaid, Medicare and insurers for providing the same care. So why would a doctor want to come here and earn less, particularly one with top-notch credentials and prospects to match? Fixing reimbursement problems should be a priority for our representatives in both Richmond and Washington.\ Dollars are having another effect on supply, through the impact of malpractice insurance premiums which, in turn, reflect the size of settlements some juries are handing out. Even doctors who are claim-free face huge premium increases, huge enough to force some out of specialties we need, like obstetrics. That's reason enough for the state to revisit tort reform and recalibrate the balance between patients' right to justice and the public's need for doctors.\ Most of today's health-care proposals just rearrange the deck chairs. The ship is still heading full speed ahead into the iceberg of unsupportable health-care costs. Health savings accounts, changing Medicaid eligibility, incentives for businesses to insure workers -- they just shift costs.\ A better strategy is to steer around the iceberg, to control the factors behind soaring costs. In addition to the tactics outlined above, Virginia can, for example, drive pharmaceutical costs down through hard-nosed negotiating with manufacturers of those drugs that the state buys in bulk for jails, detention centers and Medicaid. Then it can let citizens take advantage of those low prices -- other states have figured out how. Congress should lift its ban on Medicare undertaking similar cost-saving negotiations.\ Long-term, shrinking the iceberg is essential. That means getting serious about prevention, especially aimed at children. Programs to prevent obesity, promote good nutrition and fitness, and cut down on smoking and automobile accidents can help put the brakes on big drivers of health-care demand such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and head injuries. It's a big job, one in which laws, land- use policies, school lunch programs and education all play a role. But it offers more hope than just standing on the observation deck, waiting for the collision.\ QUALITY OF LIFE\ Some concepts are harder to get at than others. ""Quality of life"" falls into that category. Perhaps that's because while there would be broad agreement on the factors to be considered in deciding, ""Here's where I want to live,"" we would, as individuals, have widely divergent opinions about what priority to give those factors.\ Do you have family and friends in a community?\ Do you have a good job with possibilities for advancement or further education?\ Do you think the schools are good and the streets are safe?\ And speaking of streets, can you actually get from Point A to Point B with some certainty about the amount of time and effort involved?\ Are the air and water clean?\ These are all issues that involve quality of life, but there are others we'll try to keep a focus on in 2005.\ * Neighborhoods, and what comes with them. Variety works to our advantage, and the Peninsula has long had strong suburban-style neighborhoods with a variety of price ranges. Except that we've been a little short in the high end. That's why development around Endview in Newport News is welcome. That's why redevelopment down on the waterfront in the East End is welcome. More expensive homes mean more tax revenue for the locality, but the value goes far beyond that. These are the kind of homes that draw -- and retain -- successful people: people who demand quality services, people with disposable income to support other economic activity, people to serve on community and civic boards.\ We've also been short on middle- and upper-income housing within an urban setting. That's why the success of Port Warwick in Newport News is so satisfying, and why the plans for luxury apartments and condos in downtown Hampton are so exciting. These neighborhoods help create and support the kind of amenities and opportunities that define vibrant urban living: restaurants, the arts, independently owned shops, streets filled with people working, shopping, relaxing, some of whom might live right around the corner or atop the store you're in.\ * Aesthetics. Nobody likes ugly. And it's gratifying that local governments as well as private groups express concern about making our byways pleasing to the eye. Public sculpture. Sign ordinances. Strong code enforcement. Requirements for setbacks and landscaped buffers. Appropriate zoning along major thoroughfares. All are important tools for communities where the residents and the leadership understand the destructive effects of visual blight.\ * All the rest. History. We have it in abundance. Parks. We have them in abundance. Water. It defines us. Museums and theaters for live performances. Too many to praise within just a 40-minute drive, or less, of downtown Newport News and Hampton. These are some of our strengths. We should play to them, promote them and protect them.\ REGIONALISM\ Regionalism is something public officials talk about. Citizens don't. But they live it.\ If asked where they're from, who would answer, ""Hampton Roads""? There isn't even a good word for that elusive identity (Hampton Roadsians?). Roots and self-definitions are purely local: People view themselves as residents of Williamsburg (even if they live out in the county) or Hampton or Smithfield or York County.\ But we live regional lives. That York County resident may work in Newport News. That Williamsburg resident crosses the city line to shop. Those Hamptonians head to Virginia Beach to work on their tans or to Norfolk to catch a ball game.\ Our lives don't stop at municipal boundaries. Homes, jobs, doctors, favorite stores and theaters, friends and relatives can cut a wide swath of geography.\ Making those multi-jurisdictional lives work will depend, at some point, on citizens picking up on the vision if not the rhetoric of those region-talking public officials. It will depend on starting to think like they live: regionally.\ Thinking regionally means paying attention to decisions, organizations and ways of doing things so they make connections among localities easier and don't put them in the position of working in isolation from or, at worst, against each other.\ Take state tax policy, for example. It makes it so hard for localities to raise money that it encourages them to do things like try to steal business from each other, adding more retail capacity than the region needs. So long as one locality wins, it cares little that another one loses. Virginia mandates dysfunction.\ Many public services, from water and sewer to mass transit and jails, work more efficiently on a regional scale. More probably should. Higher education, transportation planning and health care are, by their nature, regional.\ We're making progress. If all goes well, 2005 will see the merger of the area's two economic development authorities, so the two sides of Hampton Roads can team up to attract new businesses instead of competing against each other.\ Regionalism isn't an issue to be considered in isolation. It's a way of living and governing and thinking. It is part and parcel of every other issue discussed on these two pages. And it will be key to whether Hampton Roads -- or Hampton or James City County or Poquoson -- is successful in addressing those issues.\ TRANSPORTATION\ No space will be spent here offering evidence of the state's transportation problem. Those who do not believe the problem exists occupy a part of the space-time continuum with which we cannot communicate.\ Transportation will not be ""fixed"" in 2005. The problem is too deep to address in a single legislative season. Realistically, one can hope that the transportation agenda put forth by Gov. Mark Warner last month will clear the General Assembly without any rhetorical airbags deploying. Although it's possible, just possible, that because of the growing resentment among their constituents about the sorry state of Virginia's highways and the even sorrier state of Virginia's transportation outlook, that lawmakers will ""do something"" in addition to Warner's modest, stopgap proposals.\ But do what? Rather than speculate, here's an outline for some of the steps that need to be taken. Some can be taken this year. Some will require more time. And anyone hoping for instant gratification will be disappointed. (Of course, that's one of the reasons it's so hard to build momentum for transportation improvements: They require effort now for results later.) It will be years before even the earliest changes pay off in more efficient movement of people and goods, less wasted time and energy. But even the longest journey begins ...\ * More money. Sorry. There's not enough money to keep existing roads and bridges in repair and undertake the projects needed in a growing state. The gas tax ought to be raised, at least to a level on par with surrounding states. But that won't be enough, and here's where some creativity is needed -- and a clear understanding of what mechanisms for paying for transportation are acceptable to Virginians. Taxes that are most closely linked to the service they provide seem to meet less resistance. That would mean greater use of tolls, which are more manageable because of technology. Don't think of tolls simply in terms of going under a tunnel; think tolls for using expressways or convenience lanes or tolls for taking the interstate from Newport News to Richmond.\ What about taxing cars based on how many miles they are driven in a year and how much they weigh? Mileage equates to use; weight equates to damage to the roadway. The idea probably won't fly with the legislature, but something beats nothing.\ You'll hear a lot about public-private roads. Good idea -- but they're financed by loans, repaid by tolls, and probably require some tax money up front in addition to the tolls.\ Still, there are lots of ideas. Virginia has to find one, or, more likely, some combination, and put it to work.\ * The mix. It's not just about roads and cars. It will take years to build better mass transit and years for some urban areas to reach density levels where mass transit is more viable. Still, places like the core cities in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia can't move people around without more and better transit. In some places, rail will be a part of that transit, linking, one would hope, with the eventual arrival of high-speed rail. And here is a challenge: more effectively involving the privately owned rail companies in Virginia with transportation planning. From a public policy perspective, rail is abused and neglected. There must be a significant change in that relationship.\ * Land use. We can't afford to keep doing what we've been doing. Instead of trying to make it easier to commute by building more and more roads, state policy should aim to encourage urban living. By greater investment in mass transit. Perhaps by offering creative tax incentives for single-family home ownership in some target areas. By insisting on a more equitable relationship between city government and state government, so that urban areas have the resources to deal with problems that contribute to and feed off suburban flight. And by more effectively tying the benefits (public tax revenue and private profit) of growth to the costs of growth: the need for more schools, more roads, more services.\ Already, the market is pointing the direction: greater demand for urban redevelopment and residential living. If public land-use policy piggybacks on that market momentum, it can -- down the road - - make life better for everyone by bringing home and work closer together. *"
180,"Published correction ran Monday, October 8, 2001. A response by gubernatorial candidate Mark Warner to the question ""Do you support so-called 'primary enforcement' of seat belts, which would allow police to stop motorists based solely on the suspicion that they are not wearing seat belts?"" was incomplete in Sunday's front section. Warner's complete response is: ""As the father of three daughters who will start driving far too soon, I know safety should be our goal. I'll do whatever I can to keep them safe, and seat belts improve safety."" (Text corrected.)\ The candidates for governor have battled in recent weeks about who has the best strategy for easing congestion on Virginia's highways.\ Republican Mark L. Earley accuses his Democratic opponent Mark R. Warner of wanting to raise taxes. Warner says he wants to let the people speak through referendum.\ What neither man says is that both of their plans would fall far short of paying the state's bill for building roads.\ State transportation officials say Virginia needs to spend more than $82 billion in the next 20 years just to build new highways. According to a separate study, the six major projects in Hampton Roads alone are estimated to cost more than $7 billion.\ The state plans to spend about $1.7 billion this year on road construction. Warner wants to boost that in the next four years by $2.25 billion. Earley says he'll offer an extra $1.8 billion.\ ""I'm not familiar with either one of their plans, but if it's $2 billion, we're still far short of paying for the six-project package,"" said James L. Eason, president of the Hampton Roads Partnership.\ For the most part, Warner and Earley offer similar plans to improve the state's transportation network.\ Both spending plans rely heavily on borrowing.\ Both men say mass transportation systems need to be developed in the state's most populated areas, and they want high-speed rail lines to run down the Peninsula from Richmond.\ Both candidates advocate telecommuting -- people working at home with a computer -- and assimilating more advanced technologies in road building.\ Except for the referendum, the only major difference between the Warner and Earley transportation plans is Warner's strident calls for overhauling the Department of Transportation.\ He cites construction delays on Interstate 64 and other budget- busting ventures as evidence of fundamental flaws within the agency.\ ""There is a classic case of a need for a business turnaround,"" Warner said.\ Widening I-64 from Richmond to Newport News is one of the six top priorities identified by the Hampton Roads Partnership. The others are:\ * Converting Route 460 into an interstate-style highway.\ * Building another bridge-tunnel across Hampton Roads.\ * Widening the Midtown Tunnel in Portsmouth and its feeder roads.\ * Building the Southeastern Parkway in Chesapeake and Virginia Beach.\ * Developing some sort of regional rail system.\ The $7 billion list is daunting, but badly needed, local leaders say. The upgraded road and rail network would not only ease traffic and relieve stress for motorists, but it would also help the region attract and retain companies, they say.\ State officials have not figured out how to pay for expensive wish lists like that -- lists that exist in every region of the state. And the price tags are expected to grow, even if they began construction today. For example, the Third Crossing is priced at $2.4 billion, but area leaders say inflation will likely bump that up to roughly $4 billion over the more than decade of construction.\ Neither candidate promises to complete any of the six projects, but they both include at least one of them in a longer list of projects from throughout the state that they say would be priorities.\ ""If the state is unable to meet that responsibility, then regions should be given the ability to do so,"" said Eason. ""The problem is so large in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia that it can't be addressed on a statewide basis.""\ And that's the primary difference between Earley's proposal and Warner's.\ Warner wants a referendum on the ballot in Northern Virginia, and perhaps in Hampton Roads, that would allow voters to decide whether to raise their own taxes to pay for major transportation projects.\ Earley opposes that, and said recently, ""In these economic times I'd veto that bill in a heartbeat.""\ Earley has pounced on Warner's support for the referendum. Earley says Warner wants to raise taxes by $900 million. Actually, Warner's proposal applies only to Northern Virginia and it would raise only $130 million, which would be used to borrow the $900 million.\ Some business leaders, mostly from Northern Virginia, have trumpeted the tax increase as a necessary evil to keep commuters and commerce moving. But Dale Masten, the president of the Virginia Retail Merchants Association, says his 240 members are ""adamantly opposed"" to regional tax referendums. Primarily, because it would disrupt the state's uniform tax code and make tax collection more difficult for businesses, he said.\ ""While our trucks use that transportation corridor, we didn't create that whole problem. It seems they're trying to fix it on the backs of retailers,"" Masten said.\ THE CANDIDATES AT A GLANCE\ Mark Warner\ The Democrat offers spending $2.25 billion on transportation.\ * A one-half-cent sales-tax increase in Northern Virginia would generate enough money to pay for $900 million in bonds. Voters would have to approve the tax increase.\ * Borrow $750 million and reserve future federal funds to pay it back.\ * Dedicate $416 million from the state's tax on insurance premiums to road construction.\ * Lobby Congress for an extra $100 million.\ * Save at least $25 million by reducing cost overruns at the Department of Transportation.\ Mark Earley\ The Republican offers spending $1.8 billion on transportation.\ * Borrow $1 billion using a portion of the insurance premiums tax.\ * Borrow $750 million and reserve future federal funds to pay it back.\ * Lobby Congress for at least an extra $100 million.\ ASK THE CANDIDATES\ Reader question for Mark L. Earley and Mark R. Warner:\ Q: How do you feel about English only as our official language?\ Earley: I believe American citizenship has value and therefore our common language has great value, too. I also know, from my time in the Philippines, that bilingual and multilingual citizens are a great cultural and economic resource for Virginia, and we should continue to focus our efforts on preserving their heritage while stressing English immersion.\ Warner: State law already designates English as Virginia's official language. In an increasingly global economy, English is becoming more and more the language of commerce. We need to do everything we can to help students learn English quickly, so that they can compete in the global marketplace. That's why I support English-as-a- second-language programs in schools.\ * Tell us your questions about roads, education, taxes, crime, the environment, jobs, state finances and other issues.

Please leave your name and telephone number in case we need to clarify your question.\ IN THEIR OWN WORDS\ The following are excerpts from questionnaires sent by the Daily Press to gubernatorial candidates Mark L. Earley and Mark R. Warner.\ Do you support a referendum that would allow Hampton Roads voters to decide how to pay for the Third Crossing and other major transportation projects?\ Earley: The last thing that we ought to do in this economy, to the people who need jobs, to working families, to seniors on fixed incomes, to all sorts of people facing financial uncertainty, is jack up their taxes during this time of economic distress. I oppose raising taxes, but have made it clear that I will work with the legislature and not prejudge their priorities.\ Warner: Yes. The state should not stand in the way when a region seeks, by referendum, to move its transportation priorities forward.\ How do you believe such projects should be paid for?\ Earley: Virginia is in the low-debt elite among states. No business looking to invest in its future would pass up the low- interest capital that is available to us because of our steady fiscal management ? especially with a weakening national economy. I have put forward a specific plan to invest nearly $2 billion in our transportation needs without raising taxes.\ Warner: A number of different approaches have been proposed. I support giving local leaders greater authority to make specific proposals and then craft a referendum to let voters make such decisions. While I trust the voters to decide ... my own support for the referendum would depend on whether it is truly representative of the region ... and on whether VDOT has been sufficiently reformed to make sure that our transportation funds are invested wisely.\ Do you support placing tolls on the two existing tunnels crossing Hampton Roads as well as the Third Crossing?\ Earley: I do not believe we should levy tolls simply as a way to raise revenue, but they are appropriate, particularly for projects like the Third Crossing, if it were to be part of a public-private partnership, like Route 168 in Chesapeake.\ Warner: See my answer to the referendum question.\ Do you support establishing a regional sales tax to pay for transportation projects?\ Earley: No. I do not think, that in these times of economic uncertainty, we should be relying on a sales tax increase to pay for anything. With a bipartisan consensus finally emerging in Congress in favor of more tax relief to boost the economy, Virginia leaders should be looking for ways to stimulate our economy -- not increase family tax burdens.\ Warner: See my answer to the referendum question.\ Do you support raising the gas tax in Hampton Roads to pay for transportation projects?\ Earley: No, Hampton Roads in particular is very sensitive to large-scale troop deployments and the possibility for gas and oil price increases, I would not support increasing the gas tax, thereby increasing the tax burden on Virginia families.\ Warner: See my answer to the referendum question.\ Do you support the so-called photo-red legislation, which would allow localities to use cameras to catch motorists who run red lights?\ Earley: No, I do not believe that photo-red legislation is the least intrusive means for catching motorists who run red lights. We must always ensure that we strike the appropriate balance between effective traffic enforcement and citizen privacy.\ Warner: Yes. This is an important tool to help our law enforcement officers keep our roads safe, and it's already being used successfully in other parts of Virginia.\ Do you support so-called ""primary enforcement"" of seat belts, which would allow police to stop motorists based solely on the suspicion that they are not wearing seat belts?\ Earley: No, the seat-belt law that we now have on the books is sufficient. It should be complied with and enforced. Police should be allowed to concentrate on stopping more serious crimes and traffic offenses, such as drunk driving, reckless driving, and speeding.\ Warner: As the father of three daughters who will start driving far too soon, I know safety should be our goal. I'll do whatever I can to keep them safe, and seat belts improve safety.\ Terry Scanlon can be reached at 247-7821 or by e-mail at tscanlon@dailypress.com"
181," Envisioning 2004\ Six areas that will command our attention\ There is much to grapple with in the coming year, but here today we address a half-dozen topics that are especially important. These are issues that the Editorial Board will return to repeatedly in 2004, because they are so integral to efforts to build a better future.\ EDUCATION\ Education is basic -- not as in back to basics, but as in basic to the durability and vigor of the community. Education is the bedrock -- of democratic government, of a region's ability to attract the employers that will make it prosper, of whether smart, capable people can find the jobs and ways of life that make them want to live in a community.\ Education isn't just K-12. It starts earlier and continues forever.\ Scientists are documenting what teachers have long known -- that children's early experiences largely script out how ready they are for learning and how well they do in school. Mightily as schools strive to overcome early deficits -- and they can and must overcome them -- it's more effective to prevent deficits with education that begins early. Government must be joined by community and civic groups to make early childhood education more available and truly educational.\ Quantum improvement in the quality of early education will put the community far ahead as it faces the next challenge: restoring equity to K-12 public education. Many schools are proud of their improving pass rates on Standards of Learning tests. But often that pride masks a problem with enormous consequences: the wide, persistent gap between black and white students in academic performance. Inequality can be a wedge, fracturing social unity and undermining economic prosperity. Schools must commit to closing the gap. Communities must hold their schools accountable and join in as partners in shoring up democracy's most fundamental institution.\ And after high school? For tomorrow's graduates, the question looms: Will Virginia's colleges offer quality education, or will the repeated failure of the state to provide adequate funding drive them into mediocrity? Or force tuition so high only the rich can attend? Will Virginians allow that to happen, or will they demand that the quality of the state's colleges and universities not be compromised?\ For students whose route to the workplace doesn't go by way of college, career and technical education is critical. But it has been overlooked in the pursuit of SOL-driven reform. High schools, in partnership with businesses and two-year colleges, must train students for good jobs. Along with work-force development agencies, they must take the point in fueling economic growth with programs that help employers retrain workers to stay competitive and help employees shift careers as the economy evolves.\ Education doesn't just allow an individual or a community to fulfill its potential. Education defines, and redefines, that potential. For the better. For citizens. For employees and employers. For people who hunger to learn and grow.\ As a community, we must be relentless in our advocacy, through word and deed, for the best education, the best schools, the best future.\ ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\ Economic development boils down to one big thing: jobs. Localities compete to attract businesses because they bring jobs.\ Businesses take their jobs to the environment they find most appealing. That's not necessarily the bargain basement, the place with the lowest tax rate. It's the place that offers a well- prepared work force and resources ready to help with retraining so businesses can adapt to changes in their markets. It's the place with a road system that is a help, not a hindrance. And, perhaps the biggest challenge, the place with a way of life that attracts the kind of workers that will make a business successful.\ The kind of workers and jobs this area has been attracting are concentrated at the lower end of the wage scale, in warehousing, retail and call centers. There have been flurries in manufacturing, in which jobs can be great when they last -- as those at Siemens and Canon have -- and a disappointment when they don't, as Gateway and John Deere survivors know so well. The area's work force is heavy on defense, government and tourism, but those aren't economic waves the area can ride into a prosperous future.\ In economic development, no locality can be an island. The area's economic health will depend on what happens in its cities, for a vibrant region cannot flourish around a decaying core. Cities are critical in attracting higher-end jobs.\ Unfortunately, the economic development decisions made by localities can be distorted by state fiscal policies that offload services onto local government but withhold the money to fund them. That's the circumstance behind Hampton's choice of a strategy focused on the Power Plant and convention center. It is designed to bring in tax dollars, but the jobs it creates will be mostly low wage, and that can drive down average home values and increase the demand for government-funded services.\ What's in short supply throughout Hampton Roads are the professional, executive and managerial jobs that offer higher salaries, that appeal to ambitious, educated young people. There are pockets at universities, NASA, the Jefferson Lab and a few high- tech manufacturing and corporate presences, but otherwise such jobs are few and far between.\ Hence the brain drain, the net loss in a desirable population group: college-educated young adults. The brains Hampton Roads is losing are flocking to other cities, drawn by an interesting mix of housing, culture and entertainment and a concentration of like- minded folks.\ This lively urbanity has more appeal to a young set than the direction growth takes in this area: large suburban developments.\ The problem, and the solution, is ultimately one of expectations. As a region, we need to aim higher. This area has too much going for it to settle for low-wage, low-skill jobs and the loss of our brightest people to other communities.\ REGIONALISM\ What's in a name?\ When it's ""regionalism,"" the moniker can be something of an ogre. To some, it conjures up the specter of more layers of government or of greater government control.\ But regionalism isn't a bureaucratic wolf threatening to swallow local government's familiar powers. No politically sane person is proposing regional government.\ Regionalism is just a smarter way of thinking about things and doing things. It makes sense when it uses money more efficiently, delivers better services, or improves the quality of life.\ * Regionalism can be a practical way for localities to band together to serve citizens. Newport News Waterworks, which covers much of the Peninsula, takes a regional approach to water supply. The Hampton Roads Sanitation District Commission handles sewage treatment area-wide. The geography of ""region"" varies: Some services lend themselves to a region confined to the Peninsula; some should take in locales across the James and York rivers; some should incorporate all of Hampton Roads. Sometimes, the scale of a proposed venture is not right. When that's the case and, for example, the bigger hitters of south Hampton Roads put us at a disadvantage, the Peninsula is right to decline to play.\ * Regionalism is the only way to attract businesses and jobs. When prospects start to assess the opportunities and costs of an area, regional factors -- from the caliber of the work force to the efficiency of transportation -- are the initial decision-makers. Only after a region passes the first cut does a prospect start evaluating individual locales. When localities compete with each other instead of touting their collective appeal, they work against success.\ * Regionalism is a way of thinking. Hampton Roads does itself a favor by promoting the idea -- among residents, the corporate world, tourists -- that it is a diverse but coherent entity. For locals, it's not either/or, but both. We are residents of Hampton and Hampton Roads. Or Poquoson and Hampton Roads. Or Gloucester and Hampton Roads. And chances are we work, play, shop or travel in other localities ... all within Hampton Roads.\ * Regionalism has to be about roads. What's the point of having all the advantages of a region of 1.5 million people -- all the arts and educational resources, the jobs and recreational opportunities, the housing choices and medical facilities -- if you can't get there from here?\ What it gets down to is simple: Regionalism is about taking best advantage of our strengths. It's about overcoming barriers -- often imposed by outdated governmental organizations and policies -- to enjoying the multitude of opportunities offered by life in Hampton Roads.\ QUALITY OF LIFE\ Quality of life has to do with the look and feel of an area, with whether it's the kind of place that makes residents tell others, ""You'd like it here -- it's a great place to live.""\ A number of elements combine to shape the quality of life.\ * There's recreation, culture and entertainment, all the things that amuse and entertain and edify residents, in a mix that should be as varied as the population. For some, it's a good band on Saturday night, a well-run youth athletic league or a convenient boat ramp, a new art exhibit or a good opera season. Recreation, the arts, venues for entertainment, all warrant policy-makers' attention and public funding. The fact that the road system is increasingly an impediment to enjoying the resources throughout Hampton Roads is yet another argument for solving our transportation woes.\ * The environment can make you or break you. When it comes to a felicitous location, this area has good fortune in spades: miles of waterfront, woods and scenic views. But much of the water that surrounds us is compromised by pollution and sediment, and air quality is problematic. Meaningful progress will be made only when Virginia musters the political will to make it happen. But Virginia is loath to buckle down for the hard, expensive discipline of reducing the pollution spewed into its water and air by power plants and sewage-treatment plants, factories, agriculture and vehicles. Localities have a role, too: Tighten up on protecting wetlands, upgrade sewage treatment plants, and contain the galloping pace of sprawl.\ * Aesthetics can delight or drain the spirit. Graceful structures make it a pleasure to be out and about; banal architecture and dismal commercial districts constitute visual pollution and suggest a lack of regard for the activities that go on within. The antidote lies in policies that offer incentives to private enterprises to spruce up the quality of their public faces, and municipal building projects that are themselves inspirations. There are bright spots: private developments such as Port Warwick that make aesthetics a priority; buildings such as Christopher Newport University's new Ferguson Center for the Arts that convey pride of place; local policies aimed at eradicating the blight of vacant gas stations. Hampton is showcasing public art in its downtown. Around Williamsburg, the city and counties share the challenge of managing growth in a way that respects the extraordinary locale that is their nexus. Yet from Pembroke Avenue to Route 17, Richmond Road to Jefferson Avenue, there is much to be done to make the Peninsula's vistas easier on the eyes.\ TRANSPORTATION\ Can you get there from here? How long will it take?\ Increasingly, these questions are constraining the decisions Hampton Roads residents make about where to live and work, where to shop and play and go to school.\ When roads become obstacles to residents' willingness to take advantage of the region's wonderful array of amenities and opportunities, we have a problem.\ * Transportation is a funding problem. The state has failed to provide enough money for road maintenance and construction. The solution will require increasing the gas tax, but that won't be sufficient. For major projects, tolls may be necessary, as well as partnerships with private enterprises that build roads or tunnels and charge for their use.\ * Transportation is a credibility problem. Virginians don't much trust elected officials, collectively, to measure up to the job of providing the roads we need. Then there's the Virginia Department of Transportation. Its seemingly never-ending series of bungles, botches and bad jobs has undermined drivers' hope that their woes will be alleviated and taxpayers' confidence that their money will be well spent. VDOT must -- must, must, must -- tighten up its operations and improve its contracting procedures.\ * Transportation is an economic issue. Why would a business locate in an area where employees face morale-sapping commutes and, if they must be on the road for work, waste company time and money idling in traffic?\ * Transportation is a security problem. Who can cherish the delusion that any significant portion of Hampton Roads could be evacuated, although it is a logical target of terrorists and a natural target of hurricanes?\ * Transportation is a planning issue. Simply planning roads to accommodate a growing population is a sure path to sprawl. Growth itself must be managed, so sprawl doesn't fuel an insatiable, land- gobbling, environment-polluting hunger for roads.\ Congestion is inevitable in any urban area. What is intolerable in Hampton Roads isn't the inevitable, it's the uncertain.\ Will you make an appointment or a flight? You can plan around a trip that takes 30 minutes every day; it's the trip that takes 30 minutes one day and 90 the next that is maddening and, ultimately, too costly for the area's health.\ THE SOCIAL CONTRACT\ Something keeps us, if not on the same page, at least reading from the same book. Whether it's in the context of being an American, or a Virginian, or a proud native of Phoebus. Our diverse nation sticks together and moves forward.\ This ""something"" is the social contract, an idea you might not have thought much about since that political philosophy class you slept through in high school. Essentially, the social contract is the agreement among individuals that their collective interest in values that promote a stable society -- such as justice, opportunity, the rule of law -- trumps their individual self- interest.\ The American social contract, if it could be written down, would be the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and Mark Twain's ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" all rolled into one, along with a lot more. It's our cultural DNA, the basic building blocks of being an American. And if it breaks, America breaks. So does Virginia.\ So does Phoebus.\ All three work -- admittedly imperfectly -- because a poor child born in Phoebus can grow up to enjoy wealth and power. Because a child born to wealth and power can lose both.\ The social contract keeps the doors open. We can go in, or out, based on our ability, our ambition and, yes, our good fortune and the support of friends and family.\ But the doors start to close when power and influence and connection become more important than talent and hard work. The doors start to close when any group -- whether it's generational or racial or religious or gender-based -- wields excessive power and influence to the detriment of other groups.\ There might be nothing illegal about such behavior. But it can still sabotage justice, opportunity and the rule of law. It can still break the social contract.\ Focus this philosophical discussion on a recurring practical issue: When opportunity depends so much on education, doesn't the social contract require support for an effective school system? What does that mean in regard to teacher pay? School discipline? Taxes?\ The great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes said that taxes are what we pay for a civilized society. Yet so much rhetoric today can be characterized not simply as anti-tax, but as anti-government. Appeals to crass self-interest, not the interests citizens have in common, have become key ingredients of successful election campaigns.\ How often do we -- as Americans, as Virginians, as natives of Phoebus -- talk about political issues with friends and family in the broadest terms of what we owe our community, our state, our nation? How often do we view these issues through the prism of the social contract rather than the easy slogans of self-interest?\ We owe it to each other to have that kind of conversation more often."
182,"Obama's background concerns this voter\I have concerns about Obama's alliance with ACORN, the sub-prime extortionist and voter fraud group; Bill Ayers, a domestic terrorist; Louis Farrakhan; the Rev. Wright; and Obama's distributing millions of dollars to teach Chicago students social radicalism. The $1.6 million for Obama's first house, his sealed university thesis and records, his Islamic connections, acceptance of campaign contributions from Hamas and other terrorists and his endorsement by our enemies are red flags. Obama wouldn't be able to get security clearance for the high-level Federal job, and yet he is running for the highest office in the land.\Obama's plan to increase taxes and government spending, aided by the liberal Congress, will effectively kill what's left of the economy and free enterprise system. We are losing jobs largely because we have the highest corporate taxes (40 percent) in the world. At a time when Asian and European countries are lowering their corporate taxes (28 percent) to attract businesses, Obama wants to raise ours. He wants to add government entitlement programs when Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are already teetering on the edge. The loss of jobs from the loss of businesses, plus more entitlements, put us in more of a downward economical spiral. So who is going to pay for this? You are -- if you have a job or any income.\His foreign policy plans to weaken our military and defense when Russia and terrorism are threatening, to withdraw troops -- essentially handing Iraq to Iran and to betray Israel will leave us in extreme national danger.\Beware the seductive rhetoric and appealing ads; remember leaders like Hitler who come out of nowhere in turbulent periods to amass adoring crowds and wreak havoc. Amid worldwide Islamic terrorism and after 9-11, how can Americans even consider electing a president with radical and Islamic ties?\Even if we dismiss Obama's lack of experience and qualifications, we cannot ignore his radical-socialist, anti-American, terrorist connections that make a possible Obama presidency a national security threat. Until Obama, we have never had a major presidential candidate whose love of America was suspect.\McCain is far from a perfect candidate, and he is running a poor campaign. But he has experience, and we can trust his regard and love for this nation. We cannot say the same of Obama.\CATHERINE SELLERS\Churchville\Rasoul would be better steward of the land\Among the grave issues facing our great nation is the rapidly deteriorating condition of our natural environment. As reported in the pages of The News Leader, the people of this region have a deep concern about conservation and restoration of our heritage of land, water and air.\Unfortunately, these concerns are not reflected in the voting record of Congressman Bob Goodlatte. The nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters' just-released 2008 National Environmental Scorecard gives Mr. Goodlatte a score of zero (out of a possible 100). This performance is no aberration -- he got the same score in 2007. That is, Rep. Goodlatte took the position opposite the pro-environment option on every one of the 33 votes the LCV examined. For example, Congressman Goodlatte voted against:\* Eliminating exemptions for corporations from paying royalties on the oil and gas they take from federal offshore areas and using the resulting $14 billion revenue for research on alternative energy technology\* Tax credits for investment solar and other alternative energy sources, as well as energy conservation\* Against requiring federally funded to meet Green Building standards\* Over $12 billion need for repair of aging community sewage collection and treatment systems\These votes could be taken as those of a traditional conservative -- one who objects on principle to government spending and regulation of the marketplace. This conclusion is contradicted by Mr. Goodlatte's vote against stopping $40 million in federal subsidies for companies cutting virgin forest in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska.\Also of interest is Mr. Goodlatte's role in defending the current program of federal farm subsidies. In fact, as the highest ranking Republican on the House Agriculture Committee, he led the effort to block a bipartisan amendment to the 2007 Farm Bill that would have cut subsidies to large corporations and millionaire farmers and used the savings to increase support to smaller farm operations (like those in the Valley) for taking additional soil and water conservation measures.\Given the incumbent's dismal record, I'll be voting for Sam Rasoul (Democrat) in this election.\BILL PAINTER\Mint Spring\Temperament matters, elect Obama president\Over the past six months, we have had the opportunity to look closely at the candidates for president and assess their character, judgment, intelligence, temperament and ethics. We have the opportunity to judge them on their actions and achievements rather than only on a manufactured narrative of political consultants. In this period, only one man has clearly demonstrated the qualities of a president. That man is Barack Obama.\Sen. Obama has run a predominantly positive campaign, appealing to the hopes and intelligence of the voters. Long-time observers of political campaigns agree that this is the most impressive campaign they have ever seen -- brilliantly conceived and executed. He has demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the complex issues that face the country while also recognizing the human element. His policy positions are reasoned and likely to be effective. Confronting a Republican campaign of distortions and lies, he has remained stable, focused and concentrating on the real issues of our time. His key decisions, like selecting a VP, have been sober, with the good of the country in mind. At times, as in his speech on race, the power of his vision for a better America is tangible.\By contrast, Sen. McCain has run one of the most disgraceful, dishonorable and chaotic campaigns in recent memory. Almost entirely negative and often including flat-out lies about his opponent, the campaign has alienated even long-time friends and supporters like Colin Powell. His policy prescriptions have been deeply unserious, like the gas tax holiday, or stunts like the fake ""suspension"" of the campaign. Most disturbingly, in a time of unprecedented danger to the country, he has avoided even talking about the real issues, focusing instead on irrelevant diversions. He continues to support the Bush policies that have been so damaging. And in a stunningly irresponsible act, he selected the least qualified VP in U.S. history, entirely for political reasons. At every turn, McCain has demonstrated a temperament that is erratic, angry and reckless. By consistently putting country last, he does not deserve to be president.\It is time for America to choose. There is only one responsible choice. Barack Obama\JOHN GILLIES\Waynesboro"
183," Our agenda\ What will future here be like for today's 3-year- olds?\ Just as many individuals do, the Editorial Board of the Daily Press stops at the turn of each new year to ponder its priorities. In the themes and topics we choose to emphasize through the year, we want to reflect the values of the community we serve, while we challenge the community to apply those values.\ Too often, we all consider only the short-term impact of our decisions. This year we challenge ourselves and our readers to take a longer view.\ When you hear, for example, that the ozone layer will eventually be depleted or that pollution will kill the Chesapeake Bay fishery by some distant date, do you breathe a sigh of relief that you won't be alive to see it? Or do you worry about your child or grandchild?\ If we make the right decisions today on key issues - education, jobs, quality of life, health care, the environment, violence and crime - then we will do the right thing not only for our generation but also for generations to come. The right decisions are not always the least expensive or the most comfortable, and that's why they are difficult and controversial. But if you keep that 3-year-old's best interest in your heart, those decisions will be easier and more rewarding.\ Education\ Our future rests in the hands of our schools. Having an educated population and a trained, productive workforce is the solution to many of the social problems that vex us.\ * To take that first giant step, we have to improve what the schools start with. Children growing up in homes without parental instruction and socialization need early education so they can begin kindergarten and first grade on par with other children. Anything less simply recycles an underclass.\ * We also need to recognize that our teachers perform some of the most important jobs in our society and reward them accordingly. Paying teachers less than they can make in other professions is one factor in the current, and growing, teacher shortage. What we don't pay for teacher salaries today we will pay for prison guard salaries 10 years from now.\ * Virginia must continue in 2000 to sort out problems with the Standards of Learning. Frustrated educators are wrong to call on the State Board of Education to throw out the standards. But the board must continue to regard them as a work in progress and be flexible in meeting reasonable objections. This is particularly true as the schools continue to work newly required material into the curriculum.\ Here's the bottom line when it comes to making decisions about education: What will our schools be like when today's 3-year-old is your age?\ Jobs\ Education and economic independence are irrevocably linked. The best way to attract the high-tech industries that government leaders want is to provide a well-educated, well-trained work force.\ * For the long term, that begins with pre- schoolers. But it is also important that work- oriented programs such as those begun by Thomas Nelson Community College and William and Mary receive the support they need.\ * In terms of recruiting new employers, we must think as a region. Job benefits aren't limited to the city or county where an employer locates; neither are the dollars those employers pay their workers. In economic terms, city and county boundaries mean almost nothing on the Peninsula or even in Hampton Roads generally. Local leaders must work together to bring good jobs to the region, not just to their own jurisdiction.\ What will the local job market be when today's 3- year-old is your age?\ Quality of Life\ The Peninsula has so much to offer with its mild climate and myriad waterways, but people live happily in snowbound Buffalo and western deserts. Whether it's attracting new businesses or just enjoying life, a pleasant climate and water sports can't do it all.\ * We need to support the arts. That includes backing the proposed arts and cultural center at Christopher Newport University, fighting for state funding for the Virginia Living Museum, The Mariner's Museum and other local institutions, and generally making decisions that increase beauty, culture and knowledge in the community.\ * We need to support local government efforts to rein in sprawling growth, especially in what we have known as rural counties. That would preserve open space, a key ingredient in quality of life, and lower the cost of services by reducing the construction of utilities.\ Will people want to live here when today's 3- year-old is your age?\ Guns\ How many people have to die needlessly before today's gun enthusiasts realize a few non- threatening controls could save lives?\ * How can we justify not requiring trigger locks on guns that are accessible to children?\ * Common sense gun laws would include registering guns like cars and licensing gun owners like drivers.\ * Gun shows should be more strictly regulated to prevent purchases without checking a buyer's eligibility. Until it can ensure that no illegal purchases occur on its property, the Hampton Coliseum should stop hosting gun shows.\ How many of today's 3-year-olds will never live to be your age because they will die of a gunshot wound?\ Transportation\ One thing that will determine the future of our area is, in many ways, beyond local control: Transportation.\ * Can the General Assembly find the political courage to fund critically needed new roads - yes, even if it means raising the gas tax - or will it allow the state's most progressive urban areas to choke on their own growth?\ * Is it possible that, by doing so little itself to solve regional transportation problems, the state can actually mold Hampton Roads into a region working together to solve its own problems?\ When today's 3-year-olds are your age, will this be a thriving metropolis with a modern transportation system moving people efficiently from home to job to school to shopping? Will it be one big traffic snarl? Or will it be a ghost town, killed by its own shortsighted growth policies?\ Reservoir\ Another wrong decision could choke the region in another way: The Corps of Engineers and the city of Newport News should find a compromise that allows construction of a regional reservoir in King William County. Urban areas must have services and all of eastern Virginia is urbanizing. It would be shortsighted to give up the best remaining location for a regional reservoir. Opponents, while well intentioned, have based their arguments for the most part on emotion.\ Where will adequate water supplies be found when today's 3-year- old is your age?\ Mental health\ Gov. Gilmore's budget helps break mental health issues into long- term and short-term decisions.\ * Effective community programs are the long-term approach, but they are terribly underfunded. They have waiting lists for services. A generation of parents who have been caring for mentally retarded children is aging and losing the capacity to provide that care. Long- term solutions involve more money than Gilmore wants to provide.\ * In the short-term, Gilmore wants to close Eastern State Hospital in James City County and funnel money from the sale of the very desirable property into mental health care. Unfortunately, his administration has too few answers for too many questions about how that will happen. Virginians need to watch this political tinkering with mental health issues very carefully.\ Some of today's 3-year-olds will need mental health assistance when they are your age. Will Virginia be able to provide it, or will it put them on a waiting list?\ Vision\ Our vision is for a region where the quality of life is constantly improving with better schools, better jobs, a cleaner environment and more cultural opportunities. Decisions on these and other issues should be made with equal amounts of compassion and common sense.\ We will return to these issues throughout the year and invite our readers to join in the debate. And over and over, let's ask ourselves this question: What will our community be like when today's 3-year- olds are our age?"
184," POST TIME\ It took longer than Secretariat's sprint through the Triple Crown, but Colonial Downs finally has won the sweepstakes to become Virginia's first pari-mutuel track. The Virginia Jockey Club says it won't challenge the Virginia Court of Appeals ruling to uphold the Virginia Racing Commission's awarding of a license to the group planning to operate the New Kent track.\ The course has been as arduous as a steeplechase. When the commission chose New Kent in 1994, a competing entry filed an appeal. Last May a Richmond Circuit Court refused to overturn the commission. Last month the Appeals Court stood with the Circuit Court. This week Larry Framme, the attorney for the ""challengers, informed the commission that his clients will not take the case to the state Supremes. ""Further appeal would unduly prolong the process of opening Virginia's horse racing track,"" he explained, ""and could harm the Virginia horse industry.""\ The dropping of the appeal means work at the New Kent site can proceed without the uncertainty associated with a court case. Colonial Downs now has the field to itself.\ New Kent was - and is - the preferred location. It is accessible not only to Richmond and Tidewater but to much of Northern Virginia as well. Colonial Downs will complement Williamsburg and the Peninsula's other attractions. We applauded the commission's original decision, and we applaud the Jockey Club for accepting the appellate court's verdict.\ Post time approaches. The ponies soon will be running. And when the track announcer says, ""They're off!"" Colonial Downs will be the place to be.\ - Richmond Times-Dispatch\ ENVIRONMENT'S VICTORY\ After months of arguing that finally led to a long-delayed deal on the 1996 budget, President Clinton and congressional Republicans had one more item to wrangle about: Who won?\ Certainly, the Republicans achieved a significant roll-back of federal spending, cutting a number of programs and lowering expectations for the next fiscal year. But in the end, Clinton's determined resistance to numerous provisions that would have weakened environmental and natural resource protection produced solid gains.\ Of special interest to the Pacific Northwest, Clinton forced abandonment of Republican plans to continue the controversial timber rider into another fiscal year. The rider, attached to a previous appropriations bill, thus expires Sept. 30. It has freed salvage timber sales from lawsuits under environmental laws and also required the administration to proceed with dozens of old-growth sales where logging had been held up for environmental reasons after sales were completed.\ Elsewhere in the country, Clinton also fended off a moratorium on the listing of endangered and threatened species, elimination of Environmental Protection Agency jurisdiction over wetlands and a scheme to thwart implementation of a previous law establishing the Mojave Desert National Park. He reclaimed some of the money Congress had tried to cut from the EPA budget.\ Certainly, compared to where this Republican Congress started out, a clear winner from the months-long standoff was the environment.\ - The Oregonian, Portland\ SPARE THOSE TREES\ Some concerned members of Congress are attempting to repeal the timber salvage rider that passed as part of a massive recisions bill last year.\ The one-year rider has been a disaster, allowing the suspension of environmental laws in so-called ""salvage"" sales of timber.\ That free-for-all has allowed logging firms to clear-cut thousands of acres of old-growth trees and wildlife habitat that would have been protected under the Endangered Species Act.\ Not only that, the rider is costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. In one case, the Forest Service spent $300,000 preparing land for sale under the salvage rider. The timber rights were sold for a mere $28,000.\ President Clinton, who signed the bill under duress (it included emergency relief for victims of the Oklahoma City bombing), has urged Congress to repeal the rider, and several bills have been introduced to do that.\ But Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, has another idea. He has introduced a bill that would extend the most odious provisions indefinitely.\ Craig's bill would restrict the ability of the public to comment on or appeal salvage sales.\ This bill is an environmental nightmare waiting to happen. We hope other representatives work hard to kill Craig's bill and revoke the timber rider before any more damage is done.\ - The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette\ PRIMING POLITICAL PUMPS\ When Bill Clinton and the Democrat Congress rammed through the largest tax increase in history three years ago, it included a gasoline tax hike of 4.3 cents per gallon.\ At the time, few motorists noticed because pump price were going down anyway - and continued to go down after the tax was imposed.\ Democratic strategists were elated the higher tax was so well ""camouflaged"" that they virtually got a free ride.\ Well, times change. Soaring pump prices all this year are drawing public attention to - and renewed criticism of - the 1993 gas tax boost. Oil commodity inflation is like a large, new regressive tax that takes a heavy toll on all income groups.\ Senate Majority Leader and putative GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole, R-Kan., along with House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., are introducing legislation to repeal Clinton's pump-price hike.\ Not one Republican in either house of Congress voted for the '93 increase. Now that the GOP is in the majority the legislation should have clear sailing. Even some Democrats who voted for the hike will, in this election year, go along with the repeal.\ There could be no ""camouflaging"" of a presidential veto of a bill that would immediately bring escalating pump prices down more than 4 cents a gallon.\ - The Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle\ READ THE LABEL\ It's a buyer-beware world when it comes to food supplements.\ That's the sobering reality for everyone behind at least 15 deaths believed by federal authorities to be connected to popular herbal products containing a chemical known as ephedrine. The products are sold under such names as Ultimate Xyphoria and Herbal Ecstasy. The various products promise everything from increased energy to ""sexual euphoria.""\ Quite reasonably, the federal Food and Drug Administration is more interested in such documented effects as rapid or irregular heart beats.\ The FDA is moving aggressively and properly to do what it can to protect consumers. A 1994 federal law blocks the FDA from regulating herbal and any natural products marketed as food supplements, at least until it can establish harmful effects. To fill the gap, some scattered local actions have been undertaken, including a 1994 Ohio statute banning ephedrine products except by prescription.\ An FDA spokeswoman in Washington, D.C., says that because of a sizable number of problems, the agency is moving to require risk- warning labels of some sort on ephedrine products. And a potency limit also may be set.\ The federal law came about after a large-scale campaign by users and manufacturers of food supplements. The intent of removing possibly excessive federal regulation may be valid. But the law's actual effects bear careful watching.\ The surprise over deaths attributed to ""natural"" products suggests that much of the public hasn't been paying attention to the reality of potential danger. As any good guide book on the plant world will tell you, there are untold numbers of plants that pose dangers.\ Like we said, buyer beware.\ - The Herald, Everett, Wash.\ LIMIT HEALTH COVERAGE\ History shows the Law of the Unintended Consequences goes into effect virtually every time Congress tinkers with health care. That's why Americans should be worried about the Senate's latest venture into health care reform, a proposal to require insurers to provide the same coverage for mental illnesses as physical illnesses.\ The requirement on mental health coverage was recently added as an amendment to what's been described as a modest health care reform bill in the Senate. The bill was approved by a 100-0 vote, which indicates the Senate's famous deliberative tradition sometimes is much overrated.\ The House approved a health care reform bill that doesn't include the mandate on mental health benefits.\ Whatever one thinks of the additional Senate requirement, it certainly isn't a modest change in health policy. Most employee health plans impose restrictions and higher deductibles on mental health coverage that don't apply to other forms of medical care.\ The principal reason for this is that experience shows the costs of mental health claims quickly run out of control unless benefits are limited.\ The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposed change would increase health costs by ""tens of billions of dollars,"" resulting in cutbacks in overall health insurance coverage and reduced wages for workers. A law that produces higher health insurance premiums, reduced medical benefits and lower wages ultimately doesn't help anyone.\ That's why the issue of mental health coverage should be resolved in the private insurance market. Congress simply lacks the wisdom to dictate the terms of health care for all Americans.\ - The Greenville (S.C.) News"
185," WHY TOLLS?\ Why is it that every time a new highway is planned, or a bridge is to be constructed, our Transportation Department and administrators say we must have tolls?\ There are no tolls in North Carolina, Canada, England, Florida, etc. Why Virginia?

THE EDITORIAL PAGE;Today's debate is on GAS GUZZLERS and whether there are better ways to get fuel-efficient autos.;OUR VIEW:Automakers and Congress must find better ways to reduce oil dependency and pollution.
\
For the fourth straight year, new cars are guzzling gas at an increasing rate.
\
This year, new domestic and imported vehicles averaged 27.5 mpg, the auto industry's worst showing in fuel economy since the mid 1980s, according to numbers released this week.
\
That's bad news for the environment and for efforts to wean ourselves from foreign oil. Cars and light trucks consume 40% of our oil. Cities choke on emissions from vehicles, the major cause of smog.
\
The Senate is preparing this month to debate bills requiring automakers to increase their fleet averages from 34 mpg to as high as 40 mpg by 2001.
\
None of the measures, however, provides the vehicles the nation should pile into in the drive to achieve cleaner air and energy independence.
\
Standards imposed in the '70s helped improve fuel efficiency from 18 mpg in 1978 to a high of 28.6 in 1988.
\
Then, progress stalled.
\
The fuel standards worked because they coincided with an oil crisis and major price increases, which sent consumers in pursuit of smaller cars.
\
The trend switched direction in 1981, when gas cost 12 cents a mile. By 1990, it was about 5 cents. Although automakers were making the smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, we have been buying the biggies - encouraging them to make more.
\
Congress should try to put the brakes on that trend. The current approach is limited. We must explore other options: a gas tax, alternative fuels, a premium on gas-guzzlers, more public transportation and ride-sharing.
\
The auto industry argues that it has already been hard-hit and that new laws would increase unemployment and give foreign producers an unfair advantage.
\
Those concerns deserve a hearing, but Congress must not back away from a commitment to continue improvement in fuel efficiency:
\
- To reduce reliance on foreign oil.
\
- To slow the pace at which we are using up a finite resource.
\
- And to reduce pollution.
\
Our fuel-economy efforts are going in the wrong direction. Let's shift gears.

THE NATION
\
Wednesday marks the beginning for many of the thousands of new state and local laws and regulations that take effect.
\
Some of the more closely watched ones:
\
- Taxes: New increases include a gas tax hike in California, a $2-a-day surcharge on rented vehicles in Hawaii, a $2 tax on new tires in Texas, and a 30% increase in vehicle registration fees for most Indiana drivers.
\
- Family leave: President Bush says he will veto pending federal legislation, but new laws in California, Oregon and Hawaii will give workers the right to take time off without pay to care for new babies or sick relatives.
\
- Wages: The minimum wage in Iowa will increase to $4.65, exceeding the federal requirement of $4.25.
\
- Driving: A Michigan law will allow police to confiscate a driver's license as soon as a motorist suspected of being drunk fails or refuses a breath test.
\
- Smoking: New Hampshire joins 20 other states in prohibiting employers from firing or refusing to hire people who smoke off- duty. In California, it will be illegal to hand out sample cigarettes and other tobacco products in public.
\
- Guns: In Washington, D.C., dealers and manufacturers of assault weapons could be sued for damages by victims of assault weapons. In California, adult gun owners could be criminally liable if they leave a loaded gun near a child who subsequently kills or injures someone with it.
\
- Television: Commercials for children's television will be limited to 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays under new Federal Communications Commission regulations that were prompted by the Children's Television Act of 1990. Previously, there were no limits on commercials.
\
- Environment: To cut down on smog, all but one brand of charcoal lighter fluid will be banned in Los Angeles, and leaded gasoline will be banned throughout California.
\
- Ethics: In scandal-plagued South Carolina, politicians will have to disclose more about their business interests and dealings with lobbyists and take smaller campaign contributions. Twenty-seven politicians have pleaded guilty or been convicted of various influence-peddling crimes since 1990.

Ribbon Label:ASSESSING THE DEFICIT DEAL:3
\
U.S. auto-industry officials say a proposed 12-cents-a-gallon increase in the USA's gasoline tax might prompt some buyers to shift from large cars and trucks to smaller ones but won't cause a mass exodus from showrooms.
\
Analysts, however, fear that a gasoline-tax hike will be one more piece of bad news - on top of a series of economic blows - that will frighten car buyers further.
\
The proposal would raise the 9-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax 12 cents - 5 cents Dec. 1, a 2-cent energy tax Jan. 1, and another 5 cents July 1.
\
Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. officials, who've supported gasoline-tax hikes, backed the deficit-reduction package Monday and say they will try to get lawmakers to vote for it.
\
``We think it will be very, very tough (to win passage), but we also think it's inevitable, because there's no other policy alternative,'' says Chrysler lobbyist Robert Perkins.
\
He says Chrysler can build 700,000 more fuel-efficient cars equipped with four-cylinder engines per year than it currently produces if consumers demand them.
\
General Motors, which has strongly opposed gasoline taxes imposed solely as a deficit-fighting tool, still is studying the plan. But GM's support could be garnered because the package also calls for part of gasoline-tax revenues to be returned to states for highway projects - an idea GM has backed.
\
Even if overall sales totals don't change, a shift away from large cars and trucks could cut even more deeply into profits of the Big Three automakers, which were down 40% in the first half of 1990.
\
Analyst Michael Luckey of Luckey Consulting Group says buyers would barely notice a 10-cent tax hike in a healthy economy. ``In a weak environment, which we have now, the gas-tax hike will certainly have more of an impact,'' he says.
\
California psychologist Stanley Plog, a marketing consultant who tracks car-buyer confidence, thinks a deficit-fighting tax hike could cut already- slow U.S. auto sales by 5% to 10% in the next year.
\
The hike in itself won't dissuade buyers, ``but there are a lot of things to make people a lot more uncomfortable right now,'' he says.
\
Among them: worries about the economy, concern over the Iraq-Kuwait crisis and higher prices on 1991 cars and trucks.
\
Buyers most likely to be scared by a gasoline-tax hike include young, first-time homebuyers, retirees on fixed incomes and middle-level executives who are worried about corporate cutbacks, says Plog.
"
190," It's finally happened. Instead of continuing to repeat his ""no new taxes"" message and continuing to bury his head in the sand, President Bush has shown some budgetary leadership. Now he's saying ""never mind"" about the tax pledge he used as the cornerstone of his presidential campaign.\ His stunning reversal came in a statement that was designed to move budget negotiations from stalled to serious. ""It is clear to me that both the size of the deficit problem and the need for a package that can be enacted require all of the following."" Bush then called for reforms, cuts, reductions, incentives and ""tax revenue increases.""\ The turnabout has caused his fellow Republicans - many of whom are up for re-election this fall - to become apoplectic in the face of what they clearly regard as a defection by their leader.\ Still, Bush has done the right thing, even if it has been only after he was dragged kicking and screaming into a presidential posture on the country's deficit problems. Now he should show a little more leadership and name some of the specific revenue increases he finds acceptable.\ A good start would be a gas tax increase which would have the dual benefit of raising revenue and helping to protect the environment by reducing car use. The president also ought to consider pushing for an increase in the tobacco excise tax, which today is about half of what it was when it was instituted in 1951.\ Of course, as the president himself said, dealing with the nation's deficit problem will require a combination of strategies, not just tax increases. But it is a positive sign of considerable significance that for the first time in Bush's presidency, the strategies will now at least include the option of a hike in taxes."

No, we do not need a tax on gasoline.

\
No. It's unfair to tax people who have no comparable public transportation and have to use their cars. But first we have to deal with the high gasoline prices before we can do anything about a gasoline tax. It is unfair to even consider a gas tax right now until they level out this situation.

\
It's hard to come up with an answer because I could go either way. There are people who really need their cars, but there are also people who don't who should be taking public transportation. I don't worry too much about a gasoline tax. I use my car a lot, but if I have to take the bus, I will.
\
Jan Hildebrand, 65 Retired clerk Jackson, Mich.
\
I'm against it. A gasoline tax would hurt too many people, especially the elderly and the poor. It takes so much for people on limited incomes and working for minimum wage to live nowadays. Public transportation is not always available to all people. I can't depend on public transportation for everything.

192," NAVY MAY BE EXEMPT FROM LAW\ Three weeks after a federal judge barred the Energy Department from storing any more spent fuel from the Navy's nuclear-powered vessels at an atomic reservation in Idaho, the Senate Armed Services Committee Wednesday began considering a bill that would override the judge's order by exempting the Navy from one of the nation's leading environmental laws.\ The exemption, if enacted by Congress, would give the Navy broad discretion to transport, store and handle spent nuclear fuel in Idaho and elsewhere without the prior reviews that are mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act.\ Following the judge's ruling, two 114-ton casks of spent nuclear fuel on their way to Idaho were shipped back to Newport News Shipbuilding where they remain.\ The law, almost a quarter-century old, requires that any major federal action that could affect public health or the environment be first studied for those effects. Such a study by the Energy Department on its operations at the Idaho reservation is now under way but is not expected to be completed until 1995, at the earliest.\ CLINTON OKS GAS TAX\ WASHINGTON - Clinton administration officials Wednesday indicated that a motor fuels tax of 5.6 cents a gallon is an acceptable compromise between the House and Senate positions on an energy tax in the president's five-year economic plan.\ After a morning meeting with the House Democratic caucus, budget director Leon E. Panetta said there is a ""move toward the Senate number on an energy tax.""

He crawled 30 yards uphill to a bulldozer, drove a quarter mile to his truck, and maneuvered the standard transmission with his good leg and a hand until he reached a house 1+ miles away.\ SENATORS JOIN TO FORM ABORTION BLOC\ WASHINGTON - Five female Democratic senators vowed Wednesday to aggressively fight restrictions on abortion that are attached to federal appropriations bills.\ ""We have a special obligation to the women of the United States to take up for them when they have been pushed out or left out,"" said Sen.

193,"Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break. \A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects. \The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. \Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. \That's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is a bipartisan effort to raise revenue by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas. \The highway bill is likely to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired July 1. \Conservatives want to end the bank, but it enjoys the support of a supermajority in the U.S. Senate. \Supporters are likely to attach an amendment that would retroactively reauthorize the bank and send the measure to the House where opponents will try to strip the amendment. \Democrats on Capitol Hill have pushed for the Ex-Im bank to be reauthorized. \""As soon as we get back, the Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House (should) put this on the floor, and I am confident it would pass both houses,"" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said before the July Fourth break. \The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education. \The Senate has a bipartisan proposal authored by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. \House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline, R-Minn., hopes to advance his companion measure in the House after an effort in February was abandoned when conservatives said his bill did not go far enough to remove the federal government's role in setting state's education policy. \The legislation, a rewrite of President Bush's No Child Left Behind education law, is under close scrutiny from conservatives who came to see NCLB as intrusive and burdensome. \The Senate may try again to take up legislation that would overhaul the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed. \Congress may be thrust into the international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month. \This spring, Congress, led by Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., voted to give itself a role in reviewing -- and possibly rejecting -- any final Iran deal. \Corker recently told USA TODAY's Capital Download it was a ""strong possibility"" Congress could try to defeat an agreement if lawmakers believe it's a bad deal for the United States. \Then there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. \The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs. \The White House has threatened to veto spending bills at the current levels, while Republicans want to maintain austere spending levels set in a 2011 budget law. \The disagreement could push Congress and the White House toward another shutdown confrontation, probably in September.\Credit: Susan Davis, @DaviSusan, USA TODAY"
194,"Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked the advancement of a transportation bill, a piece of legislation that traditionally has enjoyed broad bipartisan support.\The vote was 52-44, short of the 60 needed to take up the bill.\""I don't know why everything we do has to be a fight,"" lamented Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the parties are close to an agreement on amendments that would be considered.\Last week, Republicans tried to tack on a measure that would have allowed employers, on religious grounds, to opt out of new federal rules requiring insurance companies to offer certain services, including contraceptive care.\Advancing the legislation in the Senate was seen as a crucial step, as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, struggled to corral votes in that chamber in the face of a backlash against federal spending.\Democratic leaders are portraying the standoff as another showdown led by right-flank conservatives.\""What we're seeing on the highway bill is a repeat of the payroll tax cut debate,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., referring to the recent battle to extend the reduction in Social Security payroll taxes for the rest of 2012. ""It's time for Republicans to stop letting the far right call the shots.""\Transportation bills have traditionally been among the most popular pieces of legislation, often passing with strong bipartisan support.\This year's efforts have been seen by supporters as crucial to boosting the nation's still-sluggish economy by saving or creating as many as 3 million jobs.\But detractors, particularly conservatives, are resisting the costs at a time when lawmakers are focused on deficit reduction. Though the legislation is a priority for Boehner, Republicans have been forced to rewrite their bill after a rebellion within their ranks over a variety of issues, including its five-year, $260 billion price tag.\""The bill before the Senate spends more than we can afford,"" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., wrote in an opinion piece Tuesday in The Washington Post. ""If we fail this small test, how will we ever pass a sweeping agreement to cut the deficit?""\Republicans in the Senate said Tuesday they had agreed to a ""reasonable"" list of amendments, according to a GOP leadership aide, but Democrats had not yet signed off on the deal.\A major challenge facing congressional leaders is to maintain the current level of funding for popular road projects without adding to the federal budget deficit.\Because consumers are buying more fuel-efficient cars, the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax isn't bringing in enough money to maintain current funding.\And with Congress ending the practice of lawmakers earmarking funds for pet projects, leaders have limited opportunities to dole out incentives to bring in votes. Earmarking helped win votes for bills in the past but sparked a public outcry after the last big transportation bill, in 2005, was filled with thousands of earmarks.\""Do any of you have any idea how difficult it is to do a transportation bill without earmarks?"" House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., said this year.\""It's a lot harder to win votes when you don't have goodies to pass out,"" Boehner recently acknowledged.\Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who as chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is leading the bill through the debate, recently told her colleagues that with support from organizations including labor unions and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ""There is no reason for us not to get this done.""\rsimon@tribune.com"

I support hybrids to be taxed lower but not be exempt from from paying their fair share of items such as road construction. \Tobias Janke \Newport News \The GA axed retail gasoline tax for a combination wholesale gasoline tax plus sales tax increase. Hybrid owners thus pay a fair share for road use, so the special hybrids assessment is unfair. If the GA had retained the retail gas tax and not increased the sales tax, I then would have seen the hybrid assessment as fair. \Michael Brown \James City County \No, it is not fair. They bought them at a significant additional expense to try to reduce the use of certain fossil fuels. That is no more than a slap in the face for trying to help save the environment. \Alan Duhon \Newport News \Hybrid vehicles impose the same wear and tear on our highways as internal combustion powered vehicles of the same weight, consequently they should pay the same amount in support of these highways. Since they pay less per mile traveled in gas taxes some other means of equitable funding should be formulated for highway construction and maintenance. \Ashton Haywood \Hampton \Under this illogical law, the owner of a 29 mpg Malibu hybrid will pay the $64 hybrid tax, while the owner of the 34 mpg Sentra won't. Hybrid owners already spend more for their cars and now will pay the increased sales tax on that extra expense. Heavy gas guzzlers do more road-damage than lightweight hybrids. \Ben Cuker \Hampton \No. It's illogical. But, of little import compared to 1) keeping the outdated funding formula that allocates funds where they're not needed and denies funds to areas of greatest need and 2) using vitally needed transportation funding as cover for increasing taxes for non-critical funding (40 percent estimated). \Joe Mann \James City County \One of our nation's goals is to use less petroleum. A fairer way to pay for highways: Virginia citizens pay a per mile, per pound, per vehicle, tax; out of state commercial vehicles purchase permits; put road use fees on traveler destination like theme parks, hotels, restaurants, etc. \Joe Blumber \Newport News"
196,"
Thursday's editorial misstated the amount of oil that would be saved if cars got 40 mpg. It should have read ""a million barrels a day."" Correction ran 10/19/90.
\
House Democrats struck a blow this week for oil sheiks, makers of gas- guzzlers, and for themselves.
\
They eliminated an increase in the gasoline tax from their deficit-cutting plan.
\
The move may get cheers on Main Street next month, when, thanks to Saddam Hussein, people will be paying $1.30 or more a gallon to drive to the voting booth. As one woman in Muncie, Ind., told USA TODAY last week, gasoline is ``like bread and milk for the working class.''
\
Her anger is understandable. But the shift away from gas taxes will also be cheered in Iraq and Iran, where our gas-guzzling habits are fuel for fanatic leaders.
\
Sooner of later, the USA must steer a safer course. It must put the brakes on sloppy budgets and oil dependence.
\
The gas tax is the only tax that strikes at both, while curbing air pollution and our trade deficit, too. Here's how:
\
The deficit: Each penny of tax raises $1 billion. The 9-cent tax increase favored by the Senate and the White House would raise $9 billion - almost a quarter of the new money sought for the first year of the plan.
\
The cost is $57 a year for the average driver with a car that gets 20 miles a gallon. That's not much, particularly if the tax is phased in after the Saddam Hussein problem, now costing 30 cents a gallon, is phased out.
\
Even a 50-cent tax would leave gas cheaper, after inflation, than it was during the oil shock of 1973. Raising all income tax rates by 2% would not raise as much money.
\
The environment: Higher prices will bring more fuel-efficient cars, just as they did after the oil shocks of the 1970s.
\
General Motors has an electric car in the works. At today's gas prices, it can't compete. At a higher price, it could. The result: Cleaner air. Cars cause half of air pollution.
\
An added benefit: If cars become more efficient, then people pay less to fill up the tank, negating the effect of the tax. The oil sheiks make up the loss.
\
Foreign oil: Despite the oil shocks, we're more likely to get oil today from Oman than Oklahoma. We import 50% of what we use. Our dependence is deepening.
\
While Saudi Arabia just discovered new supplies that will last until the 22nd Century, our supply is running out. Production in the lower 48 states peaked two decades ago, and Alaskan supplies now are running down.
\
Forty-mile-a-gallon cars would save a billion barrels of oil a day - slashing our trade imbalance and sheathing the oil weapon Saddam Hussein and others are so eager to wield.
\
Critics like the one writing across this page discount those benefits, choosing to focus on potential problems instead.
\
Those problems can be managed. Most important, income tax adjustments will be needed to compensate for the disproportionate impact of gas taxes on the poor.
\
The worriers should look instead to Japan and Germany, which hiked gas taxes years ago. Despite $3-a-gallon gas, their economies are growing faster than our own.
\
Gas taxes may not make Main Street happier. But they will help make it safer. Safer from smog. Safer from economic calamity. Safer from threats of tyrants like Saddam.
\
And that's far more important today than making it safer for your incumbent in Congress.

197,"Passenger train service between Richmond and Washington could become faster, thanks to a rail expansion project just south of Fredericksburg that's now getting some federal help.\Gov. Tim Kaine and U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters announced that federal money would help pay for an already-started project to help ease a choke point along the rail line in Spotsylvania County.\The project will build a 3-mile-long third track south of Fredericksburg, so faster trains can pass slower ones.\It will be the only location where a passenger train can overtake another train between Richmond and Alexandria, and it's expected to improve the on-time performance of passenger trains to 80 percent.\It's projected to cost $13 million and be ready for use by mid-2009.\The federal government will now pay $2 million of that, Kaine said. It will thus free up that amount of state money for use for other rail improvements.\Peters said improvements to the Richmond-Washington rail corridor would help provide ""a viable alternative to what seems like an always-clogged I-95 corridor.""\Taking the train right now can sometimes be fraught with delays, spent sitting on a train behind a slower freight train.\Eventually, Kaine said, ""you will be able to get quicker from downtown Richmond to Union Station (in Washington) on the train than you'll be able to drive from Leesburg in rush hour.""\Amtrak riders might see an immediate benefit next summer.\""The plan is to reduce freight interference with passenger trains in that area,"" said Cliff Black, Amtrak's chief of corporate communications.\The project is ""always welcome in what is becoming a more congested railroad environment,"" he said.\From September 2007 to August, 132,571 passengers rode Amtrak trains between Washington and Richmond. Ridership averages about 11,000 passengers a month between the cities.\It was unclear how the third track would directly affect Virginia Railway Express, or VRE, riders, unless Spotsylvania chooses to join the train service.\To offer service in Spotsylvania, VRE plans to make $19 million in track improvements over 8 miles from the Fredericksburg train station to the possible Spotsylvania station.\The 3.1 miles of third track is ""part of the link,"" said Mark Roeber, VRE's manager of public affairs and government relations. ""It does, in fact, get us started on three miles of that segment out to where they're looking at potentially putting a station.""\Spotsylvania County isn't expected to shoulder the cost of the track improvements. That cost will be shared by a combination of possible sources: VRE, state and federal money, and the owner of the tracks, CSX Corp.\The money going to the Spotsylvania project is part of $30 million in new federal money going to 15 rail projects around the nation, Peters said.\More dollars for rail are needed as gas prices rise, prompting more and more drivers to get off the road and onto a train.\Peters said new data showed that Americans drove 9.6 billion fewer miles in July than they did in July 2007 - a 3.6 percent drop.\Meanwhile, transit ridership is up 11 percent, Peters said, and Amtrak reported carrying more passengers in July than in any other month in its history.\More rail use is good, Peters and Kaine said, but the federal government must find new ways to pay for needed rail improvements.\Peters said that the government relied on federal gasoline taxes to finance rail and transit infrastructure and that with people driving less, those tax revenues were going down, which meant different sources were needed.\""The very way we finance these systems is at risk,"" Peters said. ""The way Americans are traveling is changing before our very eyes. It's time to diversity our antiquated transportation funding policies.""\Asked for specifics, Peters said private money could be used in conjunction with government dollars.\Kaine said relying on the gas tax, at either the federal or state level, was ""leaning on a revenue source that's running away even as you try to catch it."""
198,"Why would anyone tell Virginia voters a sliver of truth about taxes on the campaign trail?\Politicians are notorious for their quirky long-distance relationships with honesty. But when voters are buying what they're selling there's very little incentive for any Virginia political candidate to start talking too straight.\Today's Exhibits A and B are a pair of Democrats who ran for the governor's mansion - Mark R. Warner and Creigh Deeds. Here's what then-candidate Warner told his Republican opponent, Mark Earley, during a 2001 televised campaign debate moderated by the University of Virginia's Larry Sabato.\""Mark ... you've now said 13 times that I'm gonna raise taxes. You've got that one-trick pony. It's just not going to work,"" Warner said directly into the camera. ""The fact is that I will not raise your taxes.""\Three years later, Warner teamed with Republicans to raise Virginia's taxes to fill major budget holes. Warner left office with sky-high approval ratings and flirted briefly with a presidential run before easily capturing a U.S. Senate seat last year.\This year on the campaign trail came Exhibit B. Deeds actually had the audacity to say that if he won the governor's mansion he would sign a bill with tax increases to pay for road upgrades if the General Assembly sent him one.\""As a legislator, I have voted for a number of mechanisms to fund transportation, including a gas tax,"" Deeds wrote in the editorial that was published in late September. ""And I'll sign a bipartisan bill with a dedicated funding mechanism for transportation - even if it includes new taxes.""\Deeds refused to be pinned down on exactly what taxes he would and would not raise - and he struggled mightily to bridge the gap between advocating the dire need for funding to improve roads and dodging exactly how to pay for upgrades. The problem didn't look as serious when he didn't offer a solution, and Deeds never looked very serious when he pinpointed the predicament but had no fix.\In the end the Deeds campaign never recovered, buried under a barrage of video footage of his struggle to answer reporters' questions and campaign ads warning about tax increases.\Surely each election is distinct and the candidates' personalities played a role, along with a host of other policy issues. But on taxes, what lessons should aspiring political hopefuls take from Warner and Deeds?\Warner vowed not to raise taxes, got into office, kept his head down with spending cuts, earned the public's trust and then made the case for higher taxes. (It certainly helped that many Republicans had already begun to see the fiscal fallout from Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore's effort to do away with the car tax.) Deeds nodded and winked at advocates hoping for major investments in Virginia's overworked road system - and got crushed for his trouble.\We've gotten to the point in Virginia when just about everyone - especially in major urban areas - readily admits that the state needs more money to repair, maintain and build new roads in the near future. Congestion, especially in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia, hamstrings major businesses and tiny ones and saps time, energy and money out of families.\Which brings us to Gov.-elect Bob McDonnell, who spent the bulk of the campaign railing against any kind of tax increase for Virginians muddling through the worst economic environment since the 1930s.\""It is bad economic policy to increase taxes on Virginians, especially as they continue to struggle with the worst economy in generations,"" McDonnell said last week.\During the campaign, McDonnell laid out a lot of ways to get money for roads - selling state-run liquor stores, drilling for oil and gas offshore, tolling, linking port growth to local upgrades and using more public-private partnerships.\But in the aftermath of the campaign many analysts credited McDonnell with learning lessons from Warner - reach out to independents, stay focused and on message, avoid divisive social issues.\So if McDonnell used Warner's playbook to win the office, could he be preparing to use the Warner playbook in office?\Two things to keep in mind: McDonnell refused to sign the no-tax pledge and he didn't sign the letter drafted by other Republicans urging Gov. Timothy M. Kaine to prepare a state budget without tax increases.\Reach Payne at 247-4765 or kpayne@dailypress.com\POLITICS ONLINE\Stay up to date on Virginia politics and politicians online at ShadPlank.com."
199,"The inspiring words of President John F. Kennedy: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"" have become part of our American heritage. President Obama's call for volunteer energy to address many of our society's challenges reemphasizes this patriotic spirit of generosity.\The sentiment, however, is not shared by everyone. Milton Friedman, in his 1962 book ""Capitalism and Freedom,"" dismissed Kennedy's assertion of civic responsibility as ""... not worthy of the ideals of free men in a free society."" Friedman wrote: ""The free man will ask neither what his country can do for him, nor what he can do for his country.""\The two foregoing paragraphs illustrate two different perceptions of human nature and the obligations we humans owe to our fellows, families, communities, the nation that nurtured us, or the global brother and sisterhood. The questions to contemplate are: Does life thrive on rational cooperation or crude competition? On recognized mutuality or egocentricity? On measured benevolence or selfish greed?\Friedman's paradigm is a reflection of Ayn Rand's ""Objectivism"" which she calls a ""philosophy for living on earth."" Rand's novels ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"" celebrate the virtues of extreme egocentricity and self-centered greediness.\Rand considers politics as evil and government as the enemy of human freedom. Her literary hero John Galt proclaims: ""I swear -- by my life and love of it -- that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."" The recent ""tea party"" syndrome is equivalent to Friedman's paradigm and Rand's ravings.\Presidents Kennedy's and Obama's patriotic spirit of generosity paradigm is firmly supported by the teachings of all the world's major religions.\Jesus charges us to love our neighbors, to reach out to our human brothers and sisters with compassion and kindness. Matthew 25:31-46 outlines our responsibilities toward one another. The Letter of James, 2:14-18, emphasizes these same responsibilities. Both Judaism and Islam urge us to be charitable.\Our country thrives on mutuality and cooperation of enlightened citizens. Imagine our communities without the many altruistic, compassionate volunteers -- the doctors, nurses and other medical personnel who staff the free clinics, the hospital and hospice volunteers, youth coaches and scout leaders, the United Way, the churches and service clubs reaching out to those in need, the food banks and the volunteer fire and rescue services.\Hundreds of volunteers help maintain such national treasures as the Appalachian Trail, work in national parks and forests and help protect the environment.\Our nation and the world would be a much poorer place except for the many national and international volunteer efforts, nonprofit organizations and foundations. Habitat for Humanity and Doctors Without Borders bring hope for a better life to people around the globe.\The father of Edwin Hubble, America's best-known astronomer and whose name is enshrined in the space telescope, offered a succinct observation of the human condition: ""The best definition we have found for civilization is that civilized man does what is best for all, while the savage does what is best for himself.""\Unfortunately, too many of our citizens are unable to transcend the ""tea party"" syndrome. John Kenneth Galbraith observed long ago that ours is a country of private affluence and public poverty. People are willing to spend thousands of dollars on luxurious cars, but balk on paying an extra nickel of gas tax to fix our roads and maintain highway rest areas.\Why does it remain so difficult for our congressional politicians, who enjoy superb government health care, to share their good fortune with their constituents by creating a comprehensive health care program? Ability to pay cannot be the problem. Our nation has squandered billions on unnecessary and ill-conceived wars and tax cuts for the wealthy.\Comprehensive health care is a win/win situation. It would liberate hospitals, medical personnel and patients from being held hostage to health insurance and pharmaceutical bureaucrats. American corporations and businesses, no longer saddled with oppressive health insurance costs, would enjoy a new vitality in the domestic and international marketplaces.\ "

Among some of the adjectives used to describe the on-the-road habits of Thatcher Fields were modest and obsessive-compulsive (``Meet frugal Thatcher Fields,'' Business Travel Cover Story, Tuesday). Might I add another: plain dangerous?
\
As the driver of a tractor-trailer, I can assure Fields that ``drafting 18-wheelers, 40 or 50 feet'' is suicidal.
\
At 55 to 60 mph if, for any reason, the semi driver has to engage in an emergency braking maneuver, Fields and the micro-box Geo Metro he has rented, sans insurance, will be wedged under the rear of the trailer before he has even thought about moving his foot from the gas pedal to the brake.
\
The injuries caused by such an impact are likely to range from massive chest trauma to decapitation. Not a pretty sight, and certainly not worth the dubious savings of five miles per gallon that Fields claims to get.
\
It's far better to maintain a safe following distance and incur the cost of a little more gas, tax deductible, than to cause this kind of senseless mayhem on the highways.

V-chip hurts family values
\
The recently enacted telecommunications bill creates an unnatural alliance between the manufacturers of TV sets and the producers of TV programming.
\
It's anyone's guess -- and more than a little frightening -- how these industries will get together to set standards that will allow parents to ``block out'' programs that contain sex, violence or anything else that might cause social corrosion.
\
The V-chip actually promotes unhealthy family values. By relying on a transistor to do their parenting, too many adults will fall even more out of touch with their children. When families watch TV together and discuss the good, the bad and the ugly choices to be made, children can be taught media values within the context of their own homes. Even if some type of ``standard'' is established, who will teach a nation of parents to employ the technology? Kids will have V-chip codes broken and distributed through the Internet within hours of their introduction to the marketplace.
\
We also might see a boom in pirate TV stations that broadcast stuff that isn't ``coded.'' Certain provisions of the new telecommunications bill undoubtedly will go down in flames before a variety of U.S. courts, but not before a lot of harm is done to the First Amendment. ``Chilling effect'' doesn't begin to describe the fallout from this most harrowing betrayal by the Clinton White House.

Mother Nature knows best
\
The Grand Canyon experiment (``Artificial flood to refresh the Grand Canyon,'' News Cover Story, Monday) suggests that Homo sapiens may be ready to concede that we don't always know best.
\
Often with the best of intentions and at enormous taxpayer expense, we have altered river flows, filled marshes, clear-cut forests and introduced non-native species.
\
The United States is not alone. Other advanced countries have made many similar mistakes.
\
Eventually, such re-engineering of the natural environment usually creates more problems than it solves. Flooding, erosion and plummeting wildlife populations are among the results.
\
For example, after a massive project to drain the Florida Everglades, we have acknowledged our mistake and are now in the midst of a challenging restoration effort.
\
Similarly, here in the Northwest, plans are under way to tear down dams on the Olympic Peninsula's Elwha River and restore its once extraordinary salmon populations.

The bottom line: Mother Nature holds secrets we are only beginning to understand.

201,"Kenneth Blackwell, contributing editor, The New York Sun: ""America is in a worsening energy crisis, and the increasing consumer costs associated with it are wreaking economic havoc on American families. Tackling this crisis has fallen prey to presidential politics and looms large as a top-shelf issue in this fall's election. ... Barack Obama is proposing taxing the profits of oil companies while vigorously opposing any additional oil exploration and nuclear power. ... Enter John McCain. He advocates building dozens of new nuclear power plants, building new refineries, and now supports aggressive oil exploration on the American continent and other locations. That would be an enormous step in the right direction. This week he said that he would create a $300 million prize for any person or group that can create a battery for electric cars meeting the needs of the average driver."" \Investor's Business Daily, in an editorial: ""Democrats, in their never-ending search for scapegoats, have had a go at oil company CEOs, industry profits and now oil 'speculators.' They've looked everywhere but where they should -- in the mirror. The congressional hearings that kicked off Monday to look into speculative behavior in the markets produced all the usual finger-pointing about the doubling in oil prices over the past year to nearly $137 a barrel. Meanwhile, Obama, seeking to catch a political wave he can ride all the way to the presidency, has announced he'll 'crack down' on oil speculation by imposing new limits and regulations on oil traders in the futures markets. But as emotionally satisfying as going after speculators sounds, this will only make our current oil problem much worse."" \Timothy Eagan, blogger, The New York Times' Outposts: ""Consider the present dilemma: oil doubling over the last year, gas at $4.50 a gallon in places and the oversized influence of speculators in a market where few used to tread. Big investors are free to run up oil futures contracts thanks in part to former senator Phil Gramm. ... (M)arket manipulation seems obvious. Over the last five years, investment in index funds tied to commodities like energy and food has gone from $13 billion to $260 billion. At the same time, the prices of those commodities have risen 200%. Take away the excess speculators who are in the market purely for the ride, and oil prices could drop by half. That's the view of Michael W. Masters, a hedge fund manager who's been advising Congress this year. ... With five months to go, it looks like energy will dominate the presidential campaign. Nutty ideas will abound, from the gas tax holiday to $300 million prizes for wonder batteries."" \The Boston Globe, in an editorial: ""McCain has a reputation as a maverick and a conservationist, but neither was in evidence last week when the Republican presidential candidate endorsed more oil drilling off the U.S. coast. ... Maybe McCain doesn't mind lending his name to the oil industry's cynical efforts to scrap a wise policy, using sky-high gas prices as an excuse. Or maybe he really thinks more offshore drilling -- which would take a decade to yield even modest amounts of oil -- will bring prices down right now. Either way, McCain is disturbingly willing to sell out the marine environment to preserve an oil-guzzling status quo."" \Dana Goldstein, blogger, The American Prospect's Tapped: ""The Obama campaign is pushing McCain's support for offshore drilling very hard. ... Now Team Obama is highlighting this odd quote from McCain. ... 'Even though it may take some years, the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that I think is beneficial.' Sure, it would be nice, psychologically, to believe that the U.S. has a homegrown energy supply that would decrease our reliance on foreign oil. But drilling offshore would be environmentally disastrous and yield very little output. Investing in alternative energy and mass transit would have a far greater 'psychological impact,' don't you think?"""
202,"Congress is on break, but members are quick to point out that they aren't on vacation - or at least not just on vacation. They won't be doing business in Washington again till after Labor Day, but many use this time to get in touch with their constituents.\That's you. This particular Congress doesn't have much to show for itself, in terms of legislation passed, issues tackled or public respect. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, it has passed less legislation than any Congress in the last three decades (although given some of the laws bequeathed on us by Congress, less may be a blessing) - and a lot of its legislative accomplishments were meaningless, like setting aside National Corvette Day.\At any event, Congress has taken a break from its legislative travails, and many members are about in their districts. So this might be a good time to get the attention of your representative and senators and clarify what you'd like them to accomplish when they go back.\Here are a few starters:\* Pass appropriation bills for the next year, something Congress hasn't gotten around to, although the new fiscal year starts Oct. 1. If you're concerned about the huge deficit that political appetites and the war have combined to rack up - and you should be - make it clear that you want them to curtail overspending and come up with a plan for whittling down the crushing debt they've piled on taxpayers. It may help to suggest what you think are priorities and where you think cuts could be made.\* End the earmarks. A good place to begin on fiscal discipline: the vast pile of pork that members of Congress, including those from this area, tack onto legislation, thereby passing the bill for local projects to taxpayers across the nation and burdening you with paying for the tidbit some other member delivers to his district. The practice skims off way too much budgetary cream for dubious undertakings.\* Have meaningful discussion and develop a meaningful national energy policy - another critical ball Congress has dropped for years. And, please, no more proposals for ineffectual, inappropriate or deceptive tactics, like a windfall profits tax on oil companies, a gas-tax holiday or tapping the strategic petroleum reserve. Let them know you and your fellow voters are too smart to fall for simplistic solutions.\* Get serious about services for veterans, particularly those returning from the Middle East. Study after study has documented the incidence of traumatic brain injuries and psychological aftershocks due to the nature of this combat, and the inadequacy of the nation's mental and physical health services for veterans. This is a disgrace.\There are plenty of other issues that may be priorities to you: tax cuts and hikes, the housing and mortgage lending mess, aeronautics funding, the environment, reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, juvenile delinquency, Social Security, Medicare. And, heaven knows, the economy.\The rationale for this extended break from Washington is that it gives members of Congress a chance to touch base with constituents. Let the talk begin.\HOW TO REACH YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\* Rep. Rob Wittman (1st District):\(757) 874-6687\* Rep. Thelma Drake (2nd District):\(757) 497-6859\* Rep.

203," In a victory for Gov. George Allen, legislators working out a compromise incentives package for the Walt Disney Co. on Friday unveiled a $149 million package that gives Disney virtually everything Allen had promised the company.\ ""I'm not going to gloat,"" Allen said shortly after the agreement was announced. ""I'm glad they have come around to our way of thinking.""\ The package, designed to entice Disney to build an American- history theme park in Prince William County, will likely be approved by the conference committee this morning. The package will then go immediately to the full House and Senate for a final vote before today's adjournment of the General Assembly's 60-day session.\ Disney Vice President Mark Pacala said his company will be leaving its first encounter with the Virginia General Assembly satisfied.\ ""It's a good day,"" Pacala said. ""The Walt Disney Co. has an arrangement that works for us and is terrific for the state of Virginia.""\ Though legislators complained Allen's offers were too generous with Disney, they trimmed little from the $163 million package the governor proposed a few days before.\ The legislators' package includes $131 million for road improvements. The state also will pay $2.5 million to build a visitors center on the site, give Disney $1.8 million to help train workers and place $13 million into an advertising fund - which Disney will match. That fund will be used to promote the park and other state tourist attractions.\ Unlike the package Allen first proposed, the lawmakers avoid using general tax revenues to finance the entire package. Instead, they earmark gas tax revenues generated by the Disney project to pay the state's share of the cost. If that is not enough, they would tap money already allocated for other Northern Virginia road projects.\ Under the compromise, Disney would have to guarantee the debt on $49 million worth of roads that directly serve the Haymarket site on which the park is to be built. If the park does not generate $3.8 million a year in tax proceeds to pay off the debt, the company would have to pay the state the difference. Lawmakers sought the guarantee to safeguard taxpayers if the park fails.\ Lawmakers also proposed that Prince William County, rather than the state, pay for $10 million worth of signs directing people to the park. Legislators also eliminated the $4 million Disney wanted for relocating equipment to Virginia.\ ""It's virtually identical to what we proposed,"" Allen said. ""It's a secure deal, it's a solid deal.""\ In crafting the final package, legislators backed away from several provisions Disney had denounced as deal-killers. These included a House requirement that the package to be approved a second time later in the year and a Senate provision that required Disney to give the state between $5 million to $6 million a year to pay off part of the debt.\ Allen has made the Disney package a top priority in his debut session and the proposal has consumed the time of lawmakers. As negotiations progressed, key legislators complained publicly that Allen was overly generous with Disney and said they feared other companies relocating to Virginia now will seek similarly expensive deals from the state.\ Del. Clinton Miller, R-Shenandoah, one of the six lawmakers who worked out the compromise plan, said Allen started so high that it was difficult for legislators to pare it down to a more affordable range.\ ""When you deal in a political environment with that kind of fawning and acquiescence, you're putting yourself at a tremendous disadvantage,"" Miller said. ""That's what we did and that's how we started off this process.""\ House Majority Leader C. Richard Cranwell, D-Roanoke County, head of the conference committee, agreed, saying: ""The job of these conferees was made extremely difficult by the very ambitious position the administration had taken.""\ ""The administration wanted this project so badly,"" said House Speaker Thomas W. Moss Jr., D-Norfolk, ""that perhaps some of the negotiations were not done as well as they could have been.""\ Allen defended negotiations with Disney, saying the deal had to make economic sense to Disney or the company would move the park or invest its money in some other project. With a $650 million investment and 19,000 new jobs at stake, Virginia could not risk losing the Disney deal, he said.\ Opponents of the Disney deal from Northern Virginia said they are happier with the compromise plan than with Allen's original offer because the new package holds Disney accountable for some of the risks. Still, they said taxpayers would be left holding the bag if the park fails. Also, concerns about Disney-generated traffic in other parts of Northern Virginia are still unaddressed."

As a member of the Governor's Commission on Taxation in the 21st Century, I am working very hard to develop solutions to this imbalance.\ Pettitt: The state budget and the slowing economy. Virginia continues to be strong financially. Solving the 2002 Session budget problem will require a combination of spending freezes and, hopefully, gains in revenue to balance the budget. However, some areas of the budget have suffered too long and must be sheltered from these freezes.\ Rapp: The education of our young people. I support raising teacher salaries to the national average, an aggressive recruitment program to attract young people into the teaching profession, and protecting teachers who try to enforce discipline from frivolous lawsuits. Also, I support utilizing measurable standards to make our schools accountable to parents.\ Stermer: Elementary and secondary education are the keys to our future. We must work to provide educational choice to all students in Virginia, regardless of income. I support tuition tax credits and/ or vouchers to as many students as possible. We could have the best schools in the nation in just a few years.\ Do you support implementing the fifth year of the car-tax cut in 2002 regardless of the amount of state revenue growth? If not, please specify under what conditions the state should delay the final cut.\ Ashe: The terrorist attacks on September 11th caused our national and state economy to slow considerably. It is doubtful that Virginia will have the money to completely repeal the car tax next year. I support the complete elimination of the car tax as soon as financially prudent.\ Pettitt: I support the full and final phase out of the car-tax. However, we must have sufficient revenue growth to give Virginia taxpayers the tax relief we voted for in 1997 without undermining our ability to give our public safety personnel the equipment and training they need and our school teachers the pay raise they deserve right now.\ Rapp: I support the fifth year phase-out of the car tax under the conditions the bill was originally passed.\ Stermer: Per capita state spending has risen 91 percent over the past 10 years. It is said that it is not enough. I have a suspicion that if we were to raise per capita state spending by another 91 percent over the next 10 years, it would not be enough either. I support tax cuts and limits to spending growth.\ Do you support a referendum that would allow Hampton Roads voters to decide how to pay for the Third Crossing and other major transportation projects?\ Ashe: As a member of the Governor's Transportation Study Commission, I know that a local gas tax will not begin to solve our transportation problems -- a national and state approach is required. At a cost of over $4 billion dollars, the Third Crossing is not a regional project; it is a project of state and national importance.\ Pettitt: Yes. I would support the use of a voter referendum to give final approval to the construction and funding plan for the Third Crossing. Due to the sheer size and financial impact of this project and its long-term effects, I believe that a voter referendum would be extremely helpful in getting the public to support the final plans.\ Rapp: I support the idea of a referendum that is an advisory, non- binding one.\ Stermer: Along with Gary Reems, the Libertarian candidate for Lieutenant Governor, I support the concept of referendums. I support choice in how road costs are borne by users."
205,"Use existing funds\State Sen. Richard ""Dick"" Saslaw proposes to drop the sales tax on food, saving $50 a year for a family of four, to offset his proposed gas tax increase (average $42).\So why don't we just keep the food tax the way it is, and divert a half-cent to transportation so there's no tax increase.\Jay H. Everson\Williamsburg\Why drilling is bad\""Senate hopeful Warner offers plan on rising gas prices,"" June 19, mentioned a bill proposed to the Virginia state legislature by Virginia Beach Sen. Frank Wagner. The bill, which was defeated, would provide funding for the state's transportation trust from future revenues accrued from offshore drilling.\This plan is a bad idea for several reasons. Given current U.S oil consumption and the amount of oil available in the entire Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, the amount of oil gained would be a veritable ""drop in the bucket"" and would not have a significant impact on rising gas and energy prices. I find it ironic that the bill's proponents cite it as having huge economic benefits for the state and its energy consumers, while simultaneously ignoring the potentially disastrous consequences that drilling would have on coastal Virginia's crucial tourist economy.\Also, the bill's proponents have ignored or failed to take into account the fact that over 70 percent of the proposed drilling area lies directly within the Navy's Virginia Capes Operating Area, home to the Atlantic Fleet and a critically important Navy training ground. This push for drilling off Virginia's coast seems to be incongruous with Wagner's belief that Virginia ultimately needs to move toward using more renewable energy sources. The recent rhetoric in support of offshore drilling, on both state and federal levels, seems to me to be yet another attempt by politicians to ignore the underlying issue here: that America needs to move toward progressive energy policies and renewable energy research.\Jonah Marsh\Glen Allen\4-way stops\Can someone in the city of Hampton's traffic engineering department explain to me why they are installing four-way stop signs at virtually every intersection in Fox Hill and Buckroe?\Were they having a sale on signs? If it is for safety reasons, they are sadly mistaken. I have lived in the area for over 30 years and have seen very few accidents at these intersections.\I have, however, seen many close calls as drivers who are not used to the signs slam on brakes or blow right through them and nearly hit others at full speed.\It is also wasting gas to consistently stop and start. If it is to reduce speed, ticket the offenders.\Mike May\Hampton\Senior ambassadors\Reference ""Seniors picket to walk the halls of convention center,"" June 26. It's rather obvious that Hampton city leadership is strictly concerned with money.

206," The new governor lays down a challenge for transportation improvements, talking tough but asking for cooperation from state legislators.\ Gov. Tim Kaine issued a no-nonsense call to action on the state's pressing transportation needs Monday, challenging legislators to work with him to control sprawl and decide now how to pay for long- overdue road improvements.\ ""Every additional moment we lose in traffic is time away from our families, from building our businesses, from recreating or worshiping,"" he said to a joint session of the General Assembly. ""And it's not your imagination: You are sitting in traffic longer. Gridlock is now a way of life for the majority of Virginians who live in our cities and suburbs.""\ In a speech that lacked detail but received mostly polite reviews, Kaine said the $625 million extra that former Gov. Mark R. Warner proposed for transportation was not nearly enough.\ Kaine wants more, much more, but he didn't say how he would pay for immediate road construction needs that -- by some estimates -- approach $20 billion. Instead, he'll submit a list of budget amendments in coming days that will spell out his plan.\ How much he proposes to spend and how to raise the money will be contentious issues in this regular session. He called for bipartisan cooperation from legislators.\ ""I know that legislators from both houses and from both parties will have their own ideas about how to address our transportation needs,"" Kaine said, ""but we can all agree that the needs are urgent.""\ Kaine was adamant that any new money appropriated for transportation -- whether it was in new tolls, a gas tax increase or other financing methods -- be used only for transportation.\ A few years ago, legislators raided the state's transportation trust fund for other uses. That decision continues to ripple through state government.\ New money for transportation is absolutely necessary because financing solutions shouldn't compete with other state needs, Kaine stressed.\ ""A long-term reliance on general fund dollars for transportation is a road to fiscal disaster -- a road paved with school books, nursing home beds and public safety resources,"" he said.\ Kaine was at his toughest when he promised to veto any bill that diverted transportation money to other uses. He vowed that he would amend any transportation revenue bill to specify that the money disappeared if legislators tried to reroute it to any other use.\ He repeated his oft-heard call for a constitutional amendment to put transportation revenues in a ""lockbox"" that legally could not be used for any other purpose. It would take several years, however, for legislators to enact that change.\ To control rampaging development, Kaine proposed several measures. One would allow localities to reject new housing developments that would overwhelm local roads. Another would require developers to gauge traffic effects that their projects would generate, giving local officials an argument to reject the proposals.\ Transportation issues headlined his 38-minute speech, but Kaine gave a passing nod to other issues. He called for improvements in education, the environment, health care and economic development. But most of what he had to say was a rehash of stump speeches that he's given over the last year.\ Reaction from key legislators was mostly favorable, though some wanted to hear specifics.\ ""I heard a lot of blue sky,"" said Del. Leo Wardrup, R-Virginia Beach, and chairman of the House Transportation Committee.\ ""There's nothing wrong with that (but) the governor has some hard choices to make. He hasn't made them yet.""\ Sen. John Chichester, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Kaine spelled out an ambitious agenda. But Chichester cautioned that forthcoming details on Kaine's broad proposals could have unintended ramifications. For example, locking up all transportation money would leave legislators little wiggle room in tough fiscal times, he noted.\ ""Everything he talks about are not unsound proposals that you want to squash right away,"" Chichester said. ""But some have long- term tentacles.""\ Del. Vince Callahan, the House budget chief, said he awaited the details.\ ""Then we will see the substance -- if any,"" the Fairfax Republican said. ""Let me say this -- a lot of platitudes, very little substance, which I assume will be dumped in my lap before the week is out, in the form of budget amendments.\ ""I thought there would be more substance, but it was just platitudes.""\ House Speaker William Howell, R-Stafford, said that by embracing greater legal protections for the transportation trust fund, public- private road building initiatives, tolls and steeper fines for abusive drivers, the new Democratic governor sounded kind of Republican.\ ""An awful lot of what he said is agreeing with what the House Republican caucus has been saying for the last couple of ears,"" Howell said. ""I embrace that.""\ Howell didn't criticize Kaine for avoiding detail.\ ""I don't think this is the time to come out with 'I'm going to specifically do this or that,' "" he said. ""Obviously, he's interested in discussing it. That's a great step forward.""\ Sen. Charles Hawkins, R-Pittsylvania, headed a Senate task force that took a long look at Virginia's transportation problems. He said the tone that Kaine struck was more important than the policy details. In fact, he was gratified that Kaine didn't box in the legislature by drawing lines in the sand.\ ""The details are going to have to come in the legislation itself, so I was not displeased,"" he said.\ ""Now we have enough flexibility working with his understanding of what the problems are. We need to be fluid now because we are working with a very fluid problem."" *"
207," The wrath of voters came down on state lawmakers this year after passage of expensive penalties aimed at Virginia drivers who break the law, but not out-of-state tourists who blow past everyone on their way to the beach.\ As the 6th Senate District race heats up in Hampton Roads, the two candidates are at odds over what to do about them.\ The challenger, Democrat Ralph Northam, wants to scrap the abuser fee system, part of a much larger transportation funding plan, and replace it with a 1.5-cent-per-gallon gas tax.\ As he calculates it, the average driver -traveling 20,000 miles a year and averaging 25 miles to the gallon - would pay $12 more a year. ""It's really just a common-sense approach to collecting revenue that's fair to everyone who uses our transportation system,"" said Northam, a 48-year-old pediatric neurologist.\ Sen. Nick Rerras, R-Norfolk, is the two-term incumbent. He wants the fees to stay but says the state should apply them to all drivers, not just Virginians, and he would remove the less serious offenses from the list.\ That parallels the position of Republican leaders in the General Assembly and Democratic Gov. Timothy M. Kaine.\ Rerras said higher gas prices are the last thing Hampton Roads motorists need.\ ""I don't agree with the additional increases,"" he said.\ The question of real estate taxes has also sparked a sharp disagreement.\ Rerras is pounding home his support for a measure that would cap real estate tax increases at 5 percent.\ He says voters are feeling squeezed by rising assessments and have told him that time and time again.\ Northam calls the proposal ""an election year stunt"" that the legislature has already rejected and that would handicap localities that face growing school populations and increasing demand for services.\ These are among the clearest lines in the sand between two men fighting to represent voters in the 6th District, which includes about half of Norfolk and a small area of Virginia Beach, then stretches up to include the entire Eastern Shore and Mathews County.\ The district is trending Democratic. Kaine won 51 percent of the vote in 2005 compared to 46 percent for Republican Jerry Kilgore. In last year's U.S. Senate race, Democratic challenger Jim Webb won 50 percent compared to 48 percent for Republican incumbent George Allen.\ That's partly why Rerras is vulnerable, said Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University.\ Democrats have discussed retaking the Senate, where the GOP holds a four-seat edge, and the 6th is one of the districts they hope to take.\ Plus, said Kidd, ""There seems to be an anti-General Assembly sentiment that hits Republicans more than Democrats.""\ The campaign has intensified in recent days. The candidates have sparred over debate appearances and traded barbs from a distance.\ Northam has accused Rerras of not trying hard enough to address problems in the region, from transportation to cleaning up the environment.\ ""It's not what he's done,"" Northam said. ""It's what he hasn't done.""\ Besides the difference over abuser fees, Northam says Rerras hasn't pushed hard enough for cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay. He also criticized the incumbent for voting against a bill that changed how the government could seize private property through eminent domain. The bill later became law.\ In an interview, Northam also pointed to two instances where comments from Rerras - or at least reported comments - have grabbed headlines.\ A few months ago, a woman who wanted to be a Norfolk judge said Rerras used the term ""feminazi"" - used often by Rush Limbaugh - during her interview. Some also have said that Rerras has linked some mental illnesses to demonic possession.\ On the judgeship question, Rerras said he has apologized ""for anything I've said that is wrong"" and added, ""we have excellent judges who are doing a good job."" As for the comment on mental health, he bristles at the idea that he doesn't understand the challenges of the mental health system.\ ""He's resorting to character assassination,"" Rerras said. ""Here's what I say: Mental illness is a brain disorder that can be cured with medication and therapy.""\ On the eminent domain bill, Rerras' vote - he was one of two dissenters in the Senate - appeared to be in line with Norfolk officials who feared the legislation would hinder efforts to fix up blighted neighborhoods.\ Rerras said the General Assembly had made record investments in environmental cleanup in recent years.\ Northam supports more funding for the bay, but stops short of endorsing a new revenue source, such as a flush tax. ""I hope it can be done within the confines of the budget,"" Northam said. ""We need to sit down at the table and prioritize.""\ ELECTION COVERAGE\ This is the first in a weekly series of stories on General Assembly races in our area.

208," If you're considering an end-of-summer vacation, go ahead and unfurl your road maps.\ The average price of a gallon of regular gas this week is $2.77, down nearly 23 cents from this time last summer, according to the Energy Information Administration. That means you might be able to add an extra day to your trip, or stay in a motel with premium cable and a pool.\ Oil analysts warn, however, that a major hurricane or refinery breakdown could send gas prices sharply higher. In addition, the recent bridge collapse in Minneapolis has prompted some lawmakers to propose raising the federal gas tax to pay for bridge repairs. (President Bush said he opposes the idea.)\ One way to protect yourself against future oil shocks: Buy a fuel- efficient car. All the major automakers have rolled out high- mileage cars and trucks, and more are on the way. And if you buy a hybrid -- a vehicle that combines an electric motor with a gasoline engine -- you may be eligible for a tax credit when you file your 2007 tax return.\ But if you're counting on the tax credit to reduce the cost of buying a hybrid, pay attention to the calendar.\ The tax credit begins to phase out after an automaker sells 60,000 vehicles.\ Once a manufacturer's sales hit the limit, buyers are eligible for the full credit until the end of the quarter in which the threshold was reached and through the next quarter. Then they're eligible for half the credit for six months. For the next six months, the credit will shrink to 25% of the full amount, then it will disappear.\ How this will affect two manufacturers of popular hybrids:\ *Toyota. If you're planning to purchase a Prius, the most popular hybrid, start looking. Toyota reached the 60,000 threshold last summer. Under the phase-out formula, taxpayers who buy a Prius before Oct. 1 will be eligible for a $787.50 tax credit. But after that date, you won't be able to claim a tax credit for the Prius, or any other Toyota or Lexus hybrid.\ *Honda. Currently, the maximum credit for Honda's 2007 Civic hybrid is $2,100. But Honda expects to hit the 60,000 mark in the third quarter, says spokesman Todd Mittleman. If that happens, purchasers of Honda hybrids will be eligible for the full credit through the rest of the year. In January, the credit will fall by half, dwindle to 25% of the full amount next July and evaporate at the end of 2008.\ More hybrids on the lot\ Other automakers have introduced new versions of hybrid vehicles in recent months. Tax credits for IRS-certified Ford Motor and General Motors hybrid vehicles range from $250 to $3,000. Nissan's Altima hybrid, which received IRS certification in January, is eligible for a $2,350 credit. Based on sales volumes so far, auto analysts don't expect these automakers to hit the 60,000 threshold soon.\ Unless Congress extends it, the tax credit for all hybrids will expire Dec. 31, 2010.\ The tax credit was designed to offset the premium buyers typically pay when they purchase a hybrid instead of a conventional vehicle. But that premium is shrinking, says Philip Reed, consumer advice editor at Edmunds.com, a consumer website.\ ""Now that we're into the seventh year of the sale of hybrids, prices have come down,"" he says.\ Two years ago, demand for the Prius was so high that buyers had to put their names on waiting lists. Now, Toyota has ""quietly reduced the price"" of the Prius by lowering the cost of some options packages, Reed says.\ And because there's a healthy supply of hybrids, other automakers are offering incentives, too, says Patrick Olsen, managing editor of Cars.com.\ A tenuous credit\ People buy hybrids for all sorts of reasons: They're concerned about the environment, they want to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil, or they just think the Prius looks cool.\ But if you're motivated by the tax break, you may want to consult with a tax professional before you start test-driving hybrids. If you're subject to the alternative-minimum tax, you're ineligible for the hybrid credit.\ The AMT is a parallel tax system that was created to prevent wealthy taxpayers from using deductions and loopholes to wipe out their tax bills. But because it was never indexed to inflation, the number of taxpayers who must pay the AMT has steadily increased.\ The only way to figure out whether you'll have to pay the AMT is by doing your tax returns twice, once the regular way and once using the AMT.\ That doesn't help you much if you're contemplating buying a hybrid now. But if you paid the AMT in the past and your circumstances haven't changed, you'll probably owe it again. People who live in states with high state taxes, such as California and New York, are also more likely to owe the AMT.\ ---\ To suggest future columns, e-mail: sblock@usatoday.com.\ Hybrids gain ground\ Year-to-date hybrid sales, through July"
209,"Ralph Northam, Virginia's governor-elect, D, campaigned on one of the most liberal platforms in the commonwealth's modern history before his decisive win.\With Republicans currently set to hold one-vote leads in both chambers of the General Assembly (pending litigation and recounts in the House of Delegates), he'll have a much stronger negotiating hand than he may have thought while campaigning. \Here's a look at some of his campaign promises:\$15 minimum wage\Northam joined the growing movement of Democrats who want to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Virginia abides by the federal floor, $7.25.\""I would challenge anyone out there to go try to support themselves and support their families on $7.25 an hour,"" Northam said during a March campaign stop. ""It is impossible. You can't do it."" \Asked how he would persuade the legislature to double the minimum wage, he said he would campaign against Republicans who opposed it. But in a post-election radio interview, he didn't offer a specific number when expressing support for raising the minimum wage. \Immigration issues\Northam supports issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants in Virginia, as well as in-state tuition for students who were brought to the country illegally as children. \If a Virginia local jurisdiction declares itself a ""sanctuary city"" - generally meaning that they do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities - Northam said he would support a ban on sanctuary cities. That angered supporters on the left, who disrupted his Election Night victory speech. \Single-payer\ health care\Northam has resisted calls in his party to support a government-run, single-payer health care system, which have been louder outside of Virginia. While 11 Democratic House of Delegates candidates expressed support for single-payer, only one was elected: Lee Carter. \""Instead of single payer, Northam thinks Virginia should design a public option that would create competition and help drive down costs,"" Northam spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said during the campaign. \Taxes\Northam campaigned on overhauling Virginia's tax system, but said he would leave the details up to a bipartisan commission. During a primary debate, he said raising taxes was ""not realistic"" in Richmond.\Northam's only specific campaign tax proposal was phasing out sales taxes on groceries paid by low-income Virginians. Since his election, Northam also suggested exempting military pensions from state taxes. \Higher education\Northam's signature campaign policy proposal was offering free community college or apprenticeships to Virginians. It comes with several caveats: It's limited to those seeking training in high-demand fields including cybersecurity and early childhood education, and would require a year of public service. \His campaign pegged the cost of this program at only $37 million, and said it would eventually pay for itself. \Campaign finance\Facing pressure during his primary campaign over taking campaign contributions from the energy giant Dominion, Northam offered to push for a ban on all corporate political giving, as well as capping campaign donations at $10,000. \Few campaign finance reform advocates see this as feasible, given how Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike benefit from corporate and large contributions. \Criminal justice\Northam wants to increase the threshold for felony grand larceny from $200, one of the lowest in the nation. He also wants to end the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court fees, which critics says locks people into a cycle of poverty. \Northam favors legalizing medical marijuana, and decriminalizing simple possession of the drug - an idea that also has support from the Republican leader of the state Senate. Northam did not call for legalizing marijuana sales for recreational purposes, as is allowed in seven states. \Voting rights\Northam has backed a repeal of Virginia's requirement that voters present identification to cast ballots, and he wants to establish same-day voter registration and no-excuse early voting. But he hasn't called for automatic voter registration, which has been a priority for progressives nationwide.\Northam also wants to standardize a process for restoring voting rights to felons who complete their sentences, building on outgoing Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's work to restore rights to roughly 160,000.\Gun control\Northam supports a variety of gun control measures, including reinstating Virginia's ""one-handgun-a-month"" law limiting firearm purchases, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and requiring universal background checks for buying guns.\Confederate monuments\While Northam said in August that he would be a ""vocal advocate"" for relocating Confederate monuments to museums and do everything he can to remove statues at the state level, he has since softened his approach.\Now he says he wouldn't meddle with local decision-making. He touted the board of visitors at Virginia Military Institute, whose members he will appoint as governor, as an example of local decision-makers who grappled with a Confederate-era statue and chose to keep it up. \Environment\Northam has said he would support two natural gas pipeline projects set to cross through Virginia if state and federal regulators find they meet environmental and safety standards. He also says he would oppose drilling for oil and gas off Virginia's coast. \Transportation\Northam supports a ""floor"" on the gas tax paid in Northern Virginia to fund road projects, which would ensure stable revenue if the price of fuel plummets. \He also says he would support a dedicated funding source for WMATA, the regional transportation agency that runs Metro, but hasn't backed the regional sales tax favored by District leaders. \Right-to-work\Northam has said he wouldn't try to repeal Virginia's ""right-to-work"" law that prohibits paying union dues as a condition of employment. But Republicans pressed Northam on whether his tune would change with a Democratic legislature. \""I think also we have to be realistic in Virginia, what we can get done with our current legislature. I think rather than pick fights that we perhaps can't win right now,"" Northam said during the campaign.\Democratic House leadership has expressed little interest in reversing the right-to-work law.\Credit: By Fenit Nirappil - The Washington Post"
210," An assessment\ 2003 leaves plenty of work to do in 2004\ Each year the Editorial Board offers an agenda for the coming year. It's not really a to-do list. Rather, it's an outline of those issues the board believes are important and deserve the community's attention. We'll offer an agenda for 2004 next Sunday.\ Today, however, is reserved for a look back. Evaluating 2003 through the lens of our agenda offered 12 months ago, how does the year shape up? The answer: It's a mixed bag. Progress, yes, but incremental in some cases. There's still too much talking around the edges, too much energy spent trying to cope with the collateral damage that's the consequence of fundamental problems that remain beyond our willingness to tackle.\ Governance\ A year ago, we noted that more than 30 years had passed since Virginia had given its constitution a thorough examination. If the political will existed to tackle some of the state's problems at the constitutional level -- at the foundation -- issues that seem intractable now could be resolved. But it's clear, at least now, that the political will is lacking. It remains to be seen whether the General Assembly even has the stomach for ""tax reform,"" as Gov. Mark Warner's modest changes in tax policy are labeled.\ But there's precious little oink in that pig. Warner's changes, even if adopted, don't resolve the fundamental revenue problems of localities. They don't tax the service sector, leaving a heavier tax burden on other areas of economic activity.\ And real constitutional revision would have addressed areas other than taxes. What about the ongoing debate over whether Virginia's governors should be allowed to seek consecutive terms? What about language spelling out more clearly the state's obligation to education? What about a process for redistricting that puts greater value on a healthy political debate than it does on protecting incumbents?\ All are questions that could be addressed if the governor and General Assembly were willing to recognize that the profound changes that have occurred in Virginia over the past three decades can be effectively addressed only with broad reform. Trying to work within the existing constitutional framework condemns lawmakers to a piecemeal approach to problem solving. Effectiveness will be diminished; frustration will be elevated.\ Education\ Good news, bad news. Our schools and students are doing better on Standards of Learning tests. But the gap in achievement between black students and white students persists. Progress in reducing and then eliminating that gap is a critical measure of the health of our society.\ For higher education, 2003 brought little relief. If the year were a term paper, it would get a grade of D. Consider this one point as indicative of the failure to support higher education adequately: The state provides barely more than 8 percent of the University of Virginia's operating funds. That's right. Just over 8 percent. Twenty years ago, it was almost one-third.\ Across Virginia, tuition has soared. Quality hasn't. We're headed in the wrong direction, folks.\ Transportation\ Seems we haven't traveled far. The governor does not call for higher gas taxes, although it's possible that whatever budget comes out of the General Assembly could include revenue from a higher gas tax. That would be movement, but it wouldn't be sufficient.\ Lack of faith in the Department of Transportation will continue to undercut any effort to win significant increases in revenue for transportation. VDOT is a long way from having a clean bill of health. If anything, some of the missteps in Hampton Roads in 2003 make the agency even more suspect.\ It's also hard to see how any statewide effort will bring sufficient revenue to Hampton Roads. We need to find a way to raise money within the region for use within the region. Tolls might be the answer. No one likes them, but technology can nearly eliminate the backup at tollbooths. Other proposals will have to be put forward, but clearly the economic and cultural life of Hampton Roads is hurt by an inadequate transportation system.\ The economy\ Well, things seem to be bouncing back. That's the good news. The region's reliance on defense spending cushions the worst downturns, but the challenge remains just what it was: We need greater diversity in employment and more high-paying jobs.\ The closing of Gateway is a reminder that there are no magic bullets. Economic strength requires a supportive environment for homegrown, small businesses. It requires skilled workers. It requires a community that's attractive to young people with brains and energy.\ In short, this stew has plenty of ingredients. We have them all in Hampton Roads, although not necessarily to the extent we'd like. Let's aim high.\ Regionalism\ Efforts, thwarted thus far, to consolidate the separate economic development teams on the Peninsula and south Hampton Roads are just one indication of how much work there is to do in the area of ""regionalism."" Smart people are making good-faith efforts to overcome the barriers to a better way of life -- barriers that are often the result of outdated, narrowly defined political interests. But the past year has demonstrated that much of the work in this area involves defining regionalism in a way that can build support. This isn't about bigger government; it's about a better economy, better roads, better entertainment, better choices.\ Open government\ It ought to go without saying that government should be conducted in the open. Unfortunately, it must be said, and, in fact, it must be repeated.\ Too often, we see the abuse of political power -- such as the insistence on some members of the General Assembly on blocking reappointment of Verbena Askew as a judge. In Hampton, will an interim mayor be appointed in the open? Or behind closed doors? Government that isn't open doesn't enjoy or deserve the trust of the people.\ Quality of life\ We have a welcoming climate. We have wonderful museums. We are home to grand outdoor recreational opportunities and positively great history. We have a mix of colleges, private and public, that contributes immensely to the intellectual and cultural life of the community.\ But these things are not free. They must be nurtured. The Mariners' Museum must count on its friends to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Isabel. Colonial Williamsburg must count on its friends for patience and support as it deals with its financial troubles -- troubles so severe they required layoffs in 2003. Our colleges and universities must count on private support to make up for the state's shortsighted stinginess.\ Hampton Roads has a pretty good quality of life. The question is, will we do what it takes to keep it? Will we do what it takes to make it even better? The generosity of corporations and people such as Ferguson Enterprises and Frank Batten are signs that the best is yet to come."
211,"They ran on making Virginia safer and more equitable.\Now, the bills that the Democrats who gained control of the General Assembly last year passed during this winter's legislative session are set to take effect Wednesday, and the new laws are sure to make the state more progressive.\Aside from the slate of gun control measures that were at the top of the Democratic majority's list, the group - younger and more diverse than past Virginia legislatures - had the votes they needed to make big changes to the state's voting, criminal justice and anti-discrimination laws, to name a few. They also had the support of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\Most of the hundreds of new laws are opposed by Republicans in the minority, who have said the measures will be costly for businesses and taxpayers and will make Virginia less safe.\""Democrats like to say that elections have consequences. They're right, and unfortunately for businesses and families, those consequences are about to become crystal clear,"" Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said at the end of session in March.\Nearly 1,300 bills were approved by Northam after lawmakers' short time in Richmond earlier this year, but Democrats say they're far from done. They'll have more largely liberal legislation - which includes bills related to police accountability - when they meet in August for the special session.\For now, here are a few laws affecting Virgnians that'll be in place starting Wednesday:\Voting \Virginians won't need a photo ID to cast a ballot starting at the November election, just a document that confirms identity, which can include a utility bill, bank statement or other documents specified in the law. And they won't need an excuse to vote absentee. People will automatically be registered to vote when they do a transaction at the DMV, and Election Day in November will be a state holiday. Democrats say these measures will make it easier to vote, and Republicans believe it'll lead to widespread voter fraud, despite no evidence of that happening.\Abortion rights \The requirement that women get an ultrasound before an abortion to determine the fetus' gestational age is disappearing, as is the requirement that a woman wait 24 hours after the ultrasound to get the abortion. A woman will also no longer be required to be offered an ultrasound image and the opportunity to hear the fetal heartbeat. Backers of such laws say these measures are critical for a woman's health, but abortion-rights advocates say they make it harder for women to get abortions.\Anti- discrimination\A new bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in the areas of housing, public and private employment, public accommodations and access to credit. Another bill bans conversion therapy - a controversial practice that aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity - and another clarifies that racial discrimination includes any bias due to hair texture or hair type. School boards must also create policies about the treatment of transgender students. And workers have new protections against pregnancy discrimination.\Criminal justice\Getting caught with an ounce or less of marijuana will no longer land you in jail. Lawmakers made the penalty a $25 civil fine, akin to a parking ticket. The amount that makes a theft a felony has increased from $500 to $1,000. People will no longer have their driver's license taken away if they can't pay court fines. And lawmakers increased the age at which a juvenile is automatically tried as an adult for murder, from 14 to 16.\Gambling \Online sports betting will be legal starting Wednesday, but that doesn't mean you can make a wager right away: The platforms on which to do the betting still have to be approved by the Virginia Lottery Board. The board estimates sports betting will be available in December. And there will be a tax on so-called ""games of skill"" - slot-like machines found in convenience stores, bars and truck stops - for a year, with most of the revenue going to a statewide COVID-19 relief fund for businesses.\Confederate statues\Localities will get to decide what they want to do with their war memorials. Local governments must hold a public hearing before moving one. Several localities, including Virginia Beach and Portsmouth, are already having discussions and scheduling public hearings. Norfolk was planning a hearing, but after some gatherings at monuments elsewhere turned violent, the city decided to move its monument before the new law took effect.\Education\In-state tuition will be offered to undocumented students with the passage of Del. Alfonso Lopez' Dream Act. School principals will no longer be required to report to police students who commit misdemeanors on school property. Students can also no longer be charged for disorderly conduct if it occurred on school property.\Energy and environment\The Virginia Clean Economy Act outlines a way for the state to get to 100% renewable electricity by 2045, and requires Dominion Energy and American Electric Power to retire their fossil fuel plants and replace them with solar or wind-powered energy, and creates a new program to reduce the energy burden on low-income customers. A Division of Offshore Wind will also be created to help Hampton Roads become an offshore wind hub. And a 27-member Council on Environmental Justice was formed to recommend environmental policies that focus on equality and equity.\Transportation\The statewide gas tax is going up by five cents, but vehicle registration fees are going down by $10. The $64 annual fee for all-electric and alternative fuel vehicles is going away, but there's a new highway use fee that is tiered based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency, and that's expected to be $19 in the first year for most vehicles.\Tobacco \The tax on tobacco products is doubling, from 30 cents per pack to 60 cents. And for the first time, liquid nicotine products will be taxed at a rate of 6.6 cents per milliliter of liquid nicotine.\Marie Albiges, \757-247-4962,\malbiges@\dailypress.com"
212," Q: Many people think that the General Assembly should change the so-called abusive driver fees that were included in the 2007 transportation plan. What other provisions of that plan, if any, would you favor reconsidering when the legislature returns in 2008?\ A: HB 3202 must be repealed in its entirety and rewritten. I do not support HRTA as a regional taxing authority. The Commonwealth Transportation Board could more economically handle HRTA's current mission. Transportation is a statewide responsibility. HRBT congestion must be addressed. We must place greater emphasis on public transit and alternate methods of transportation. The allocation of only 4.3% of the Capital Projects Revenue Bonds to rail is disheartening. The creation of urban transportation service districts with taxing authority should be approved by local referenda. I question the time line to acquire environmental permits for highway projects ((Section) 33.1-19.1).\ I support the development of comprehensive plans for localities which will include urban development, impact fees on new construction, road improvements costs and plans, preservation of green space, etc. I applaud the creation of the Joint Commission on Transportation Accountability ((Section) 30-278) and the statewide transportation plan.\ Q: How should the state pay for road construction?\ A: Road construction should be paid for by an increase in the state gas tax and tolls on the Interstates at the state borders. In addition, tolls could be placed on new construction, but not on any existing roadways even with improvements. (Section) 15.2-2319 gives localities the authority to impose impact fees on new development to pay all or a part of the cost of reasonable road improvements that benefit the new development, relieving the state or the localities of some of those financial responsibilities. With the creation of the Joint Commission on Transportation Accountability perhaps reckless spending by VDOT (ex. $80,000 for four hurricane gates at each entrance/exit on I-64) can be curbed and more funding made available.\ Q: The Virginia Tech tragedy has sparked a debate over care for the troubled mentally ill. What changes to Virginia's mental health system would you support in the wake of the April 16th tragedy?\ A: Students should be required to sign a release allowing communication between the school and parents when it is believed to be in the best interest of the student. Universities can create workshops for students and faculty on mental illness and have plans in place to identify students or faculty who exhibit aberrant behaviors. Anyone found to be an imminent danger to others should be confined to an in-patient mental health facility until determined no longer to be a danger. There needs to be a community education component to remove the stigma of seeking help for mental illness. All firearms transfers and sales must require a fingerprint and background check to at least weed out the felons and those adjudicated mentally ill. (Section) 37.2-819. must be amended to preclude the possession, purchase or transfer of firearms by anyone adjudicated mentally incompetent who is referred to any type of treatment program. Unfortunately that still leaves those persons who are mentally ill, perhaps even undergoing voluntary hospitalization, able to possess firearms.\ Q: What will be your personal top legislative priority in 2008?\ A: Dropout rates are unacceptable. We need more technical/ vocational education, prevention programs in elementary schools, alternative schools for disruptive students, higher education tuition assistance, and a program to teach new parents how to teach their preschool children. There must be universal health care for children whose parents are unable to afford coverage. We must offer affordable health insurance to the uninsured. Medicaid payments must be increased or health care providers willing to serve Medicaid patients will be scarce. To fund these programs I propose an additional tax on tobacco, alcohol, firearms and junk food.\ The General Assembly must prioritize its needs with a zero-based budget. I propose employing out-of-state auditors to review every agency's justification of the need, effectiveness and cost of their programs. Achievement of the Commonwealth's financial goals can best be accomplished through excellent fiscal management. Environmental regulations need to be strengthened. We must prioritize clean renewable energy over coal.\ Q: Do you support an expansion of preschool as proposed by Gov. Tim Kaine?\ A: I do support an expansion of a 4-year old preschool program for at risk children, if funds are available. I believe it would be more cost effective and provide earlier intervention if we established a program to teach parents how to teach their children. Children must be properly stimulated from birth to be able to reach their full potential. Waiting until a child is 4 years old is often too late. I would also like to propose a program that would ensure children learn to read. The end of first grade would place any student who did not read at grade level, with comprehension, in a yearlong reading program with a low pupil-teacher ratio. Students would then proceed to 2nd grade with the tools to succeed. Remediation at the beginning of the educational process is much more effective than allowing a student to fall further behind every year. I believe our dropout rate and youth crime would decline if all of our students were able to read their textbooks with comprehension.\ Q: What are some areas in which the state can cut spending to fund other priorities?\ A: Prioritize needs before considering wants. There are many programs that improve our quality of life, but must be funded by the private sector until there is a surplus of funds. Education, public safety, transportation, health care, & the environment are needs. Audits of all state programs can identify and cease duplications of effort, remove ineffective programs, cut wasteful spending, and create better-organized, efficient programs. Some will say that a savings of $10,000 in one program is such a drop in the bucket that it is not worthwhile to address. I believe that no matter how insignificant the savings may seem, unwise spending must halt. The following are two small examples of wasteful spending. Virginia requires people to complete not 1 but 2 separate eligibility processes, one for SSI and one for Medicaid, while 39 states have abolished this practice to save on duplicative administrative costs. The Virginia Lottery spent $2,200 on a newspaper ad commending a local high school for its achievement. $2,200 could have bought 50 textbooks at $40 each, a much better investment.\ Pamela Pouchot\ Party: Independent\ Address: 103 Kimberly Ct., Yorktown, VA 23692\ Campaign phone: 757-898-8453\ Email: plpouchot@t-s-a-g.com\ Age: 57\ Marital status: Married 33 years\ Family: Husband Jim Pouchot, 2 adult daughters and 9 grandchildren\ Education/degrees: University of Grenoble, France, Columbia University, American University, The College of Hampton Roads, Marshall Real Estate School, Christopher Newport University.\ Occupation: Small business owner: TSAG Mid Atlantic, Inc., and American Greetings\ Experience: York County School Board, York Citizens' Education Assoc chair, Virginia Committee For Gun-Free Schools chair, volunteer GA lobbyist, community and school volunteer and political activist\ Community involvement: Elected school board referendum, Adopt-a- Highway, Safehaven, handicap access issues, education issues, assisted in guns on school property court cases.

Minner attacked Burris as soft on environmental issues. But Burris accused Minner of voting anti-business while in the legislature. Democratic Gov.

Republicans are outnumbered in the state by almost 2-1, and Wise narrowly led in the polls throughout most of the race."
214,"RICHMOND - With this year's late start to the General Assembly and 40% more bills filed than in 2019, Tuesday's ""crossover"" deadline - when the House and Senate are supposed to turn over their bills to the other body for consideration - is looming larger and more intimidating than ever.\Despite the new Democratic majority's broad agreement on many priorities, the heavy workload already is forcing one key gatekeeper to put in an unusual Sunday meeting.\Legislators and lobbyists have been trying to assemble coalitions crossing party, regional and ideological lines on often technical, hard to understand proposals that include how insurers run their business, what's taught in schools and how Virginia should manage its energy, water and other natural resources.\To become a law, a bill has to pass through both Senate and House. Any wording changes on the way have been accepted by both chambers. It's a long and winding path, but crossover is a chance to see what laws are possibly coming, what's not and what debates or quiet deals are still to be struck.\What's up in the air\Some of the biggest differences between House and Senate turn on labor law.\Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas, wants to repeal Virginia's ""right to work"" law - the rule that says people covered by a union contract setting pay and job security rules don't have to pay dues to the union.\Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Springfield, a pro-business Democrat, has proposed a slightly different approach: requiring workers covered by a union contract to pay for the portion of union dues that cover negotiation and enforcement of that contract. The idea is the workers should not have to pay for other things the union does, such as political activity.\The House has proposed that repetitive stress injuries at work - problems such as back strain from repeated lifting of heavy objects - be covered by workers' compensation. Virginia is the only state where such injuries are not covered. There's no such bill in the Senate.\The House's version of a bill allowing public employees union to negotiate contracts - Virginia is one of only three states that does not allow collective bargaining by public employees - is broader than the Senate's. The House bill covers state and local government workers, while the Senate says local governments can choose whether to allow collective bargaining by their employees.\Gun control was perhaps the biggest talking point for Democratic candidates last year, but the House and Senate took different tacks on two key parts of Gov. Ralph Northam's legislative package.\While universal background checks and a one gun a month limit on purchases passed both bodies, House and Senate panels took different views on the so-called ""red flag"" bill - which allows a judge to order taking firearms temporarily from people found to pose a substantial risk of harm to themselves or others - and a measure to boost penalties for recklessly leaving a loaded gun around children.\The House voted for Northam's version, which says the judge can issue such an order on a petition from a prosecutor or police officer. Under the Senate version, two law enforcement officers would have to provide affidavits demonstrating that risk, after consulting with a prosecutor; the House says a prosecutor or a police officer can simply ask the judge for such an order.\The Senate Judiciary Committee also declined to increase the penalty for recklessly leaving a loaded firearm lying around so as to endanger a child.\While the House unanimously passed a bill saying 14- and 15-year-olds could no longer be tried as adults on the simple say-so of a prosecutor, a similar Senate proposal has languished, undiscussed in the Senate Judiciary committee.\A bill to limit the number of balloons an individual may release at any one time died in a House committee but passed the Senate. Its sponsors say deflated balloons pollute the environment and can injure wildlife.\What's sailing through\Both the House and Senate have approved a comprehensive crackdown on high interest rate loans, including the online ones that have hit Virginians with interest rates exceeding 900%.\Efforts to chip away at abuses by payday, car title and open end credit lenders - some of the biggest donors to legislators' campaign funds - have failed for a decade, but with all House Democrats joined by 10 GOP House members voting for the measure, the crackdown is headed for the governor's desk - despite the continuing opposition from Saslaw.\Marijuana is another area where consensus is emerging. Both the House and Senate are on track to say possession of a small amount would no longer be treated as a crime subject to jail time, though their bills still differ on how small an amount should be treated that way and how large a fine for possession would be. The Senate bill calls for a fine of up to $50 for possession of up to an ounce; the House for a fine of $25 for possession of up to a half an ounce.\Legislation making it easier to vote - allowing people to vote absentee without having to provide an excuse, and eliminating the requirement to show a photo ID before casting a ballot - has passed both bodies. They've also agreed to make Election Day a state holiday in November and remove Lee-Jackson Day in February, which honors the birthdays of the two Confederate generals.\Also passing both bodies are measures banning discrimination at work and in housing on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\Northam's transportation package - which includes a 12-cents-a-gallon gas tax hike to be phased in over three years - is moving through both bodies.\Measures granting the Virginia Marine Resources Commission regulatory authority over the menhaden fishery, a first stop toward bringing the Bay fishery into compliance with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's quota, passed both House and Senate.\What's dead\A measure to set minimum standards for Virginia's understaffed nursing homes died - for the 16th time in two decades.\Bills to say records of the administrative office for the state courts should be open to inspection by the public under the Freedom of Information Act died in a House panel.\A measure saying use of cannabidiol oil or THC-A oil by a parent in a custody or visitation case shall not serve as the sole basis for the denial or restriction of custody or visitation, if such parent has a written certification by a practitioner attesting to the benefit of such use, also died in a House panel.\A Senate panel killed a proposal allowing emergency shelter staff to temporarily deny entry of a registered sex offender.\Most of both chambers' bills related to expunging certain criminal records and bringing back parole will head to the State Crime Commission for study for a year.\Dave Ress, 757-247-4535, dress@dailypress.com\Caption: Gun control, marijuana laws and the removal of a state holiday honoring Confederate generals are among the topics debated so far in the 2020 Virginia General Assembly session. \ Virginia state lawmakers are up against Tuesday's ""crossover"" deadline - when the House and Senate are supposed to turn over their bills to the other body for deliberation.\Left, AP file photo.

215," Plan keeps transportation dollars here\ There seems to be much misunderstanding and confusion surrounding the transportation projects that would be funded by the new Hampton Roads Transportation Authority. The Metropolitan Planning Organization has developed a list of six projects that would greatly improve transportation around Hampton Roads.\ The MPO is a federally mandated organization charged with developing a continuing, cooperative and comprehensive regional plan for transportation projects. Approval by the MPO must be given for any project to receive federal funding.\ Six projects have been approved: Route 460 upgrade, I-64 widening on the Peninsula (Jefferson Avenue through Williamsburg), I-64 widening on the the Southside (High-Rise Bridge), a new Midtown Tunnel, the Southeastern Parkway, and a Hampton Roads crossing. The latter, the so- called third crossing, includes the widening of I- 664 on both the Peninsula and Southside, connecting I-564 to the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel and the Craney Island connector between Route 164 and the Monitor- Merrimac.\ Historically, Hampton Roads has been a net donor region with respect to state transportation funding; for every transportation- related tax dollar we send to Richmond we get 85 cents back. The remainder has traditionally gone to the more rural parts of the commonwealth. With the Hampton Roads Transportation Authority, 100 percent of the money raised in the region stays in the region. The authority can only fund these six projects, unless amended by the General Assembly, and will terminate once the projects are paid for.\ Transportation experts have picked the most pressing projects, and the General Assembly has prioritized them. Our city councils and county boards must now empower the newly created authority to fund the projects. It is time to stop second-guessing, to stop sitting in traffic and start moving forward.\ Clyde R. Hoey II\ Newport News *\ Another rebate, please\ Ah, yes, spring is in the air; the birds are singing, the Democratic and Republican debates are starting up. All of this is a wonderful reminder we're closer to the 2008 election and ending the failed presidency of George Bush.\ I've thought back over these six-plus years -- that have felt like eight -- and thought President Bush hasn't done one good thing for me. And then I remembered, no he's done one good thing and it's been the only good thing he's done. Not long into his presidency, Bush gave me a tax rebate of $300. I thought this is nice, but I still don't like this president.\ My feelings for the president haven't changed. What an embarrassment he has been to our country, and, boy, could we use new leadership in a hurry.\ That rebate check got me thinking how at the time I didn't really need the money, but I cashed it anyway. The president picked the wrong time to send out those rebate checks. I'd prefer to have mine now so I can have some gas money to make it through the summer.\ Would you reconsider, Mr. President, another tax rebate?\ Daniel Burns\ Hampton\ Williams' record\ Tricia Stall has taken on a big challenge. She has agreed to run against the powerful Marty Williams for the state Senate seat in the 1st District. This is the same Marty Williams who is chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee and who encouraged enough other representatives to forego their responsibilities by dumping the funding for transportation solutions in the laps of the 12 cities and counties in Hampton Roads. If approved, there will be road tolls established, taxes assessed, fees increased and other obligations imposed.\ Williams and other state legislators should recognize transportation as a statewide problem, not just a regional one.\ This is the same Marty Williams who (according to his latest political flyer) seems more concerned with solving the federal illegal alien problem than he does with state transportation.\ The General Assembly and its so-called ""leaders"" have failed miserably during the past four years to offer a realistic plan to relieve road congestion. Williams says his plan will bring an additional $200 million a year to Hampton Roads. If a simple five- cents-a-gallon gas tax had been created by the General Assembly four years ago there would now be one billion dollars accumulated for transportation improvements.\ Stall has the background and determination to influence positive changes without imposing limitless and complicated financial burdens on the citizens.\ It's time for new blood in Richmond -- blood that can visualize major improvements to Route 460 as the long-range solution for all of Hampton Roads. Stall has shown the courage to challenge one of the ""big guns."" A vote for Tricia Stall in the Republican primary election on June 12 will be one to be proud of and happy about.\ Richard H. VanDerzee\ Newport News\ Dog abuse\ Whenever I read about a dog-fighting ring, such as the one recently found in Surry County, I am sickened that there are those in this country who delight in the horrific abuse of loving animals (""Signs point to dog fights at Vick house,"" May 17).\ Dogs rely on us to protect them, and most owners rush to the vet when their pet is in any kind of pain. Purposely abusing a dog by putting it in a dangerous situation where it is savagely bitten, mauled and painfully left to die should not be tolerated.\ Police should investigate this type of activity, and heartless people who mistreat these beautiful animals should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, to include a prison term.\ Sylvia Moore\ Suffolk\ NN sports model\ Recently, my daughter's traveling softball team played a tournament in the Stoney Run sports complex in Newport News. I was completely impressed with the thoughtful design of the regulation fields, parking lots and concession building. Stoney Run is a far better complex than the new one that sits adjacent to the Virginia Beach amphitheater. The last time I was on that plot of land, I was loading mulch into my pick-up truck.\ I hope that someday the city of Hampton will have the vision to build and maintain a regulation sports complex for our children.\ Timothy Seekins\ Hampton\ Police priorities\ Once again the personal affairs of an athlete are being scrutinized and exploited. Authorities are trying their best to associate Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who played at Virginia Tech and Warwick High School in Newport News, with being a leader and financial backer of a dog-fighting ring (""Cool down on Vick, coach says,"" May 19).\ Surry County's commonwealth's attorney said investigators still are collecting evidence. This is time and money that could be used towards crime prevention and further investigation of the many open homicides of the Hampton Roads area. Local authorities appear to continuously misuse funds with biased investigations.\ Instead of spending funds on making an example out of a local successfu,l African-American athlete, authorities should make attempts to strengthen and strategize crime-prevention units such as civic leagues, neighborhood watches and business watches.\ The investigation is portrayed in the light of concern for animal rights and protection. What about the protection and rights of human citizens? There are more important issues worthy of investigation.\ Alicia Hunter\ Hampton *\ TRAFFIC TALK\ ""I'd rather be driving a Titleist""\ Who wouldn't?

216," Open up\ Protect public access to government ...\ The principle of open government is simple: In a representative democracy, officials are elected to conduct the public's business. They must do so in the open, where the public can observe and participate. Openness is the antidote to the abuses that breed in secrecy.\ The logistics of open government, however, can be complex. Competing interests must be reconciled, such as the need to protect the privacy of individuals without sacrificing the public's need to know. Factor in the inclination of partisan politics to retreat from scrutiny, plus the challenges and opportunities new technologies present, and the fine-tuning of open government is a job that's never done.\ Every session of the General Assembly must wade through a spate of bills that seek to close loopholes or open new ones, to bring some aspect of government into the light or let another slip into dim reaches. This session, legislators face several bills that would deal serious blows to open government. A few of the worst are truly dangerous:\ * Exceptions to freedom of information must be carved out narrowly, with painstaking assessment of the implications. Flying in the face of this caution is a bill that could basically shut down Internet access to public records by prohibiting the posting on public agency Web sites of information that includes personally identifiable information, even information public records already require. This bill would undo the good work begun under a bill passed last year that tackles the complexities of providing access to information the public has a right to, such as land records maintained by court clerks, while safeguarding personal information in those records. The two-year pilot allowed time for study of the issues involved. But the sweeping bill before this session would run roughshod over that deliberative effort and, says Forrest Landon of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, ""could shut down e- government.""\ * Even more far-reaching, and troubling in its potential to slam the door on every meeting of the General Assembly, is a bill just introduced. Into the debate over which legislative meetings must be open -- party caucus meetings being the sticking point -- Del. Morgan Griffith injects an offer to start from scratch, giving a joint committee power to rewrite rules for access to all meetings. It could open everything up. Or it could, absurdly, exempt the legislature from FOIA.\ * Records created with public money should be available to the public. It isn't government's job to decide which uses of information are worthy and which aren't. But a wish to restrict access -- by private enterprises (developers, for example) that gain financially from free information -- is behind a bill that would except from FOIA certain high resolution maps in geographic information systems. Instead of posting the maps on their Web sites, localities could charge hefty fees. But that information also benefits the public: The Daily Press used such maps to create graphics of damage from Hurricane Isabel. And it isn't appropriate to turn public records into a revenue source for localities.\ * The public pays for the collection and computerization of tax records maintained by local treasurers, and it shouldn't have to pay again to access that information. Legislators should kill a bill allowing treasurers to charge for remote access.\ * As communication technologies evolve, so does the definition of a meeting. But a measure that would authorize all local governmental bodies to hold electronic meetings is a leap in the wrong direction. State government can, under certain conditions, conduct meetings electronically. When it's a hike from Galax to Fairfax, that makes sense, but the argument doesn't hold up in localities. What kind of opportunity would the public have to be ""present"" at a meeting that takes place by e-mail or cell phone?\ ... and open up new windows\ The General Assembly also has opportunities to expand public access to government. Among the bills it should consider favorably are those that would:\ * Require all public bodies to make audio or video recordings of closed sessions, so there's a contemporaneous record if a question arises of whether a closed session was warranted or it is determined that the proceeding should have been public.\ * Open up access to records of how delegates spend the money they receive for office expenses. These tax dollars should be accounted for -- it's as simple as that.\ * Clarify that newly-elected officials, state or local, become subject to the Freedom of Information Act as soon as their election is certified.\ History offers the General Assembly a simple rule of thumb in weighing the merits of access bills. Beginning with ""We the people,"" governance in America has been shaped by the need to safeguard the public's voice in government, a voice that is silenced if it doesn't know what government is up to.\ Speak up\ Good time to tell elected officials how to spend\ It's your money they're spending. Do you care how?\ If you do, now's the time to speak up, while localities are drafting their budgets for the fiscal year that will begin July 1.\ If you live in James City County, what do you think of the Board of Supervisors buying development rights to keep some land from being developed?\ If you live in Hampton, what's your take on spending for school maintenance?\ Isle of Wight residents: Should the county budget include money to continue curbside recycling in parts of the county?\ Gloucester folks: You know developers are eyeing the county. Do budget plans include realistic assessments of the costs of growth?\ If Newport News is home, are you happy with your recreation options?\ This is a good time -- and the most productive time, short of Election Day -- to pay attention to what your elected officials are up to and tell them what you want. Do you think the real estate tax rate should be lower? Higher? Funding for libraries hiked? Less spent on mailings and brochures put out by city hall? More spent on school music programs? Is the tax on cable and cell phones just right?\ Every locality will hold public meetings to get citizen input on taxes, fees and spending. Every locality will make its draft budget public and take comments. School boards, too, will publicize their budgets and hear input before they're adopted.\ Notices appear in this newspaper, and many localities publicize their meetings on their Web sites. Or call the city, county or school administration office to find out when you can add your voice to those that budget writers are listening to.\ It's worth while to participate, if you care about how much money you have to pay, how it's spent, and what you and your community get in return.\ A big chunk of Virginians' money will be spent by the General Assembly. So while you're keeping tabs, this is also a good time to keep an eye on what your representatives are doing in Richmond. If there's something you care a lot about -- whether it's funding for the environment or teachers' salaries, hiking the gas tax or eliminating the car tax -- this is the time to act, and listen, and watch.\ Your representatives -- in Richmond, on your city council or board of supervisors, on your school board -- are getting ready to spend your money. Let them know what you think. Find out what they think, and how they vote, and remember it when they run again."
217," Transportation projects take taxes and tolls -- it's that simple\ We are not being realistic about the scope of the transportation challenges of the commonwealth. We talk vaguely about public- private partnerships, we suggest the use of surplus funds and heavier fines for bad drivers. We talk about transferring dollars from the general fund, borrowing money from Wall Street, raising a few taxes and fees, and eliminating fraud, waste and abuse to generate all of the funds needed for transportation.\ But the sources and sums being discussed do not provide significant long-term responses to Virginia's growing transportation challenges, and we know it.\ While we may not like it, without money, no roads will be built, no bridges repaired.\ Without money, passenger rail service will not return across Virginia and high-speed rail from Washington to Richmond and beyond will remain a dream.\ Without money, public transit service will decline and disappear.\ Without money, plans for all transportation improvements will remain on the drawing boards and Virginia's future will be sorely compromised.\ Just as our ancestors once faced geographic barriers in transportation, we face barriers of our own making -- the inadequacy of public investments.\ In today's political environment, it is difficult for some to recognize the obvious: Transportation projects are built with either taxes or tolls -- or both. One cannot be against taxes and tolls and be in favor of transportation investments. Money is required.\ The last time the commonwealth made a major investment in transportation funding was 1986. The buying power of that 1986 package of\ increases in the gas tax, titling tax, sales tax and license tags, because of inflation, has been eroded by 40 percent, while demand for highway use has increased by 79 percent.\ There are those who suggest that we seek increased federal funds, as if that would solve all of our unmet needs. Tell that to Congress. It took Congress three years to adopt its last six-year transportation budget.\ It may not be generally known, but federal funds already constitute the largest single source of funds in Virginia's transportation construction budget, over 50 percent.\ There are those who talk about using the commonwealth's current surplus funds to meet our transportation needs. If major capital projects that cost billions of dollars could be planned, designed and constructed within the two-year budget cycle that produced the surplus, that might work.\ But a major project, such as a new tunnel in Hampton Roads, or Northern Virginia's Wilson Bridge, or the ""Mixing Bowl"" project, or Route 58 in Southside and Southwest Virginia can take five to 10 years, and the money must be there in years eight and nine, not just the first or second year.\ There are also several problems with the use of [state] surplus funds.\ First, they are unpredictable. Second, they are not sustained over a long period. Third, the constitution of Virginia requires the transfer of certain surplus funds into the commonwealth's ""rainy day fund.""\ What about transfers from the state's general fund? Because of significant population increases and cost pressures, the state's general fund dollars are required to meet the increased costs of K- 12 education, higher education, mental health, environmental protection and public safety, not to mention other public priorities. It puts the commonwealth in the position of ""robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" a very politically difficult situation.\ In a search for transportation revenue answers, there are those who refer vaguely, but cheerfully, to public-private partnerships -- PPTAs. Implicit is the assurance that the PPTAs will magically provide the funds without any cost to the public. It is portrayed as ""free money."" There is almost no ""follow-up"" explanation of how PPTAs work, no suggestion that a PPTA project would require the imposition of tolls upon the public to pay for the construction and maintenance of the project.\ PPTAs can be quite useful, but they must not be oversold or portrayed as a ""cure-all"" for the state's transportation financial woes.\ So the bottom line is this: Whatever the sources of funds, transportation projects must be able to depend upon long-term dedicated and protected revenue sources large enough to permit the commonwealth to complete the projects.\ At present, we find ourselves in a situation where there is lack of agreement on the size of the funding package, as well as the sources for it. It may well be weeks or months before the House, the Senate and the governor can find common ground on transportation funding.\ What happens if the governor and the legislature are unable to reach an agreement on an acceptable funding package for transportation needs?\ First, it is safe to assume that population growth will continue, vehicle miles traveled in Virginia will continue to soar, and deterioration of the infrastructure will continue.\ Second, traffic congestion in the urban areas will continue to increase, especially in Hampton Roads when the new Maersk Terminal in Portsmouth opens in about a year. That event alone will add 1 million new trucks a year to the traffic arteries of Hampton Roads. Think about that.\ Third, the quality of life challenges for rural areas will grow without relief in sight.\ Here's my concern -- and it should be yours. If the governor and the General Assembly do not act to identify and secure significant and sustained transportation funding in 2006, we may not have another opportunity for such funding until January 2010 -- five more years of waiting in traffic for someone to do something.\ If you have doubts about that prognosis, consider that 2007 -- next year -- is an election year for the entire General Assembly. Tell me how many members of the legislature will vote for the imposition of taxes and/or tolls or raid the general fund in an election year!\ The year 2008 is a presidential election year, and the political air will be filled with talk and tirades about debt, deficits and taxes. The record does not show that state legislators anywhere act in such moments of high national drama to raise new revenue at the state level.\ That takes us to the year 2009 -- another statewide campaign season for the offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and the House of Delegates. You can see what I'm suggesting. It is highly unlikely that taxes and tolls will be on the tip of anyone's tongue in that year.\ So that takes us to the year 2010, at the earliest, the year after another gubernatorial election, in which significant sums of money could realistically be generated for transportation needs.\ There's a phrase in engineering that describes what I fear is happening to our transportation infrastructure. It is called ""elegant degradation."" That is what happens to machines that are subject to constant repetitive stress. The machine continues to look the same while it is slowly becoming weaker and weaker. Finally, unable to withstand the stress, it breaks down.\ I fear that we're on the slippery slope of elegant degradation. In my judgment, the future of the commonwealth's economic vibrancy lies in the balance. What happens in the next few weeks may determine whether the scales are tipped in favor of a future of forward motion and economic vitality or one of slow motion and economic lethargy.\ I hope we have the collective wisdom as a people to make the correct choice. *"

\WASHINGTON – Before President Joe Biden even offered specifics of his aim to fix the nation's roads, bridges and railways, Republicans he'll need to work with in Congress panned it, saying it goes too far beyond traditional infrastructure spending and comparing its climate aspects to the Green New Deal.\Republicans argue the package should be limited to transportation, broadband internet and other basics, not green energy like Biden has touted since he was a candidate. Biden doesn't want to just fix roads, Republicans warn, he wants to upend American life.\They've also balked at raising taxes – long a sticking point for Republicans to get behind big-ticket Democratic programs. To find bipartisan support, the president will have to persuade skeptical Republicans to support an increase of the corporate tax rate to pay for infrastructure and a wide range of other spending.\These dynamics foreshadow a possible repeat of Biden's first major legislative victory, when he won approval of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, the American Rescue Plan, last month without a single Republican supporter in Congress.\""What taxes are the Republicans who want infrastructure spending for?"" said Matt Grossman, who heads the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University. ""I think the answer is not many. And if so, they won't be ones that Democrats are likely to support. So that, right off the top, limits the potential for bipartisanship pretty fundamentally.""\Biden's proposal – in addition to addressing roads, bridges, railways and broadband – includes spending on manufacturing, research and development and ""the caregiving economy."" \'A Trojan horse,' GOP warns\The White House has billed the proposal as a way to create ""good-paying union jobs"" and a first step toward economic recovery amid the coronavirus pandemic. A second proposal in Biden's ""Build Back Better"" agenda addressing health care, education and child care is expected later in April.\To build their case for the large infusion of domestic spending, the White House said the U.S. ranks 13th globally in infrastructure quality, down from fifth in 2002, and significantly lags rival superpower China in infrastructure spending. More than one-third of America's bridges need repairs, and one in every five highways are in poor condition.\""We know that 80% or more of people in this country, Democrats and Republicans, support investing in infrastructure,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.\Yet Republican lawmakers have spent recent days fine-tuning their attacks.\""We're hearing the next few months might bring a so-called infrastructure proposal that may actually be a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes and other job-killing left-wing policies,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said from the Senate floor last week.\His office seized on recent comments from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., likening the proposal to the Green New Deal, a sweeping environmental effort pushed by Democrats to fight climate change. ""Sold as an infrastructure plan,"" warned Scott Sloofman, a top McConnell aide, it ""actually intends to reshape the U.S. economy and other parts of American life.""\Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., the leading Republican on the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, said she's ""very disappointed"" the plan could include social programs in addition to infrastructure. \""They're terming it 'social infrastructure.' Never heard that before,"" Capito said, predicting a hard legislative fight. ""I think we need to talk to the American people and say: 'Is this what you envision with infrastructure? Are these job creators? Are we reengineering our own social fabric here with a 50-vote majority?'""\House Republicans warned Biden's transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, that any plan that strays from core transportation priorities won't get GOP support. ""I don't think the bill can grow into a multi-trillion-dollar catch-all,"" s aid Missouri Rep. Sam Graves, the top Republican on the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. ""A transportation bill needs to be a transportation bill, not a Green New Deal. It needs to be about roads and bridges.""\Former President Donald Trump repeatedly promised an infrastructure package but never delivered one.\The road to passage\Democrats could choose to pass the infrastructure legislation in the Senate through budget reconciliation – just like they did Biden's COVID-19 relief bill known as the American Rescue Plan – which would require just a simple majority in the evenly split chamber and therefore no Republican votes. \In an interview Monday on CNN, Buttigieg said he believes there's ""a tremendous opportunity now to have bipartisan support for a big, bold vision of infrastructure,"" arguing Americans ""don't need a lot of selling"" on the proposal.\He also defended the inclusion of green investments in the infrastructure package.\""You can't separate the climate part from this vision,"" he said, ""because every road we fix, every bridge we build, we can either do it in a way that's better for the climate or worse for the climate. Why wouldn't we want to be creating these jobs in a way that's better for the climate?""\Buttigieg said he believes the administration can get Republican votes on infrastructure, adding ""We're going to work with them to try shape it in a way that earns as much support as possible.""\To pay for the sweeping package, Biden wants to make large corporations pay more taxes. He will propose increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% and overhauling how the U.S. taxes multinational corporations by increasing the minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21%. The White House eliminated user fees, such as a gas tax, to pay for the infrastructure plan. \Public support for infrastructure\A poll this month from The Hill-HarrisX found 54% of American voters believe an infrastructure package should be a priority right now for the federal government, compared with 46% who said other initiatives should. Sixty percent of Democrats, 54% of independents and 46% of Republicans agreed infrastructure should be prioritized. \""To have a bill like this that can generate jobs, help improve transportation, and infrastructure in general is a win-win all around,"" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. ""Paying for it, obviously, is going to be the sticking point for Republicans.""\Green energy investments are also popular among the public, according to Grossman. And while polls generally find opposition to raising the federal tax on gas to pay for infrastructure, the public gives higher marks to raising taxes for corporations and higher-income Americans. \""In that sense, this developing bill does have the potential to at least start out with bipartisan support in the public,"" Grossman said. \Such a scenario would also reflect the dynamics of Biden's relief bill, which multiple polls found was backed by more than 70% of Americans. But as Biden learned, that doesn't mean Republicans in Congress will jump on board.\Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called an infrastructure package the ""the best chance"" for Republicans and Democrats to do something together, saying ""Everybody needs roads and bridges and ports.""\But, he added, ""we just want to make sure it's related to infrastructure.""\"
219,"Published correction ran Tuesday, February 13, 2007. An editorial on Sunday's editorial page, ""They're off?,"" about a proposal to raise money for transportation through gambling on pre- recorded horse races incorrectly said the legislation under consideration was sponsored by Del. Phillip Hamilton of Newport News. Although Hamilton sponsored such a bill, it died in the House. The legislation now under consideration is sponsored by state Sen. Thomas Norment Jr. of James City. (Text corrected.)\ They're off?\ Some legislators would rather gamble for roads than tax gas\ With a huge slice of general funds at stake in the transportation funding battle, could one alternative be back to the future? Could highway improvements get a ride on the ponies -- parimutuel ponies, that is?\ Yes, it could happen -- if the General Assembly permits what Ian M. Stewart, president of Colonial Downs, calls ""a logical progression of gaming in Virginia.""\ Try regression. It's called ""historical racing,"" and it would allow Virginians to wager on races past. It works this way: You sit down at a terminal and deposit a bet anywhere from a nickel to $5, and the machine selects a previously recorded race from thousands stored away. There's information on the odds, statistics on the horses and all you have to do is pick the winner.\ Of course, you do this, in most instances, with your favorite beverage in hand. The monitor displays the race, and if your horse comes in, you get a payout much as you would at a live race.\ Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is what you call gambling. If approved, it would generate millions for the state that could then be spent on roads. Colonial Downs would operate the machines in its existing facilities, and it would get a hefty cut of the take, too.\ Now, Virginia has leaped across the line on gambling already. There's a big sign out there on Interstate 64 near Jefferson Avenue displaying the latest mega-whatever lottery payout. Anytime you enter a convenience store, there's someone laying down cash for instant this or that. Colonial Downs has trotters and thoroughbreds; churches throughout the state have bingo, which is a lot bigger than you might think.\ So while it's not Vegas East, Virginia is no virgin on the subject of legalized public gambling. So why not allow ""historical racing""? What's the difference?\ Well, it's the machine itself, for many people. It resembles a slot machine; it functions like a slot machine. There's a tad more skill involved, but how much of a leap is it from throwing quarters into a horse race machine to dropping them into a slot?\ Newport News Del. Phil Hamilton says that ""historical racing"" would generate around $323 million and Virginia would get half of that. This is a clever argument. Gambling proponents offer a ""solution"" to a state problem -- a solution that just happens to pour millions of dollars into the pockets of gambling interests. It's like the good old days, when proponents of the lottery said the proceeds would pay for education. (And don't you just love that label? ""Historical racing."" Why, surely, if it's historical it's all well and good.)\ As of the moment, the bill is alive and kicking in the General Assembly, where direct highway funding based on those who use highways -- via a gas tax -- has found little favor. A majority of legislators -- mostly Republicans, but some Democrats, too -- would prefer to shift money away from education and public safety, combined with some significant borrowing, than actually pay for road improvements with new state taxes.\ That's an unattractive and shortsighted proposition, with serious implications for years ahead when state revenue is not nearly as robust as it happens to be now.\ Question: Would it be better to lean on revenue-producing, historic nags than establish general funds as an enduring source of road funding? If that's the choice, the answer would be yes.\ But what a tradeoff, huh? Rather than go at road funding in a straightforward, transparent manner that attaches a user fee or tax to a service, the ""conservative"" General Assembly may decide to lean on the proceeds of what once was regarded as sin. This represents a fairly wretched commentary on the way Virginia funds infrastructure in the brave new world of the 21st century. *\ Left behind\ The Board of Education's graduation goal is too low\ Well, it's progress.\ But at so glacial a pace that instead of pride, the appropriate reaction would be despair, or anger.\ The state Board of Education has raised the standard Virginia high schools must meet for the percentage of students who graduate within the usual four years.\ All the way to 61 percent.\ That's right: Virginia's standard will be that of 100 students who enter the ninth grade, 61 graduate on time.\ Sadly, that goal -- one of the lowest in the nation -- represents progress. For the last several years, it has been 57 percent.\ That's hardly the way to strengthen Virginia's position in a knowledge-based economy, in a globally competitive market, in an environment in which states have to compete for employers.\ Why is Virginia's goal so abysmally low? It was set to accommodate the schools in which the gradation rate is, in actuality, abysmally low. It was set to accommodate failure, not to spur schools to reach for success.\ And Virginia's Board of Education balked at having to set even an easy-to-reach goal. It asked federal authorities for a waiver from the requirement, under No Child Left Behind, that high schools be measured on graduation rate as well as on things like test scores and attendance.\ Until No Child Left Behind introduced the requirement, Virginia chose not to hold high schools accountable for graduation. Separate from No Child Left Behind, the state sets its own standards for accrediting schools, and they don't address the graduation rate. That's right: The accreditation of a Virginia high school doesn't depend on how good a job it does of getting its students to graduation.\ The chairman of the Board of Education wants to fix that. That's good -- and long overdue. It will be interesting to see if and when the board takes that step and whether it sets a meaningful goal.\ A young person without a high school diploma is a young person without much of a future. Gone are the days when a strong back and a willing spirit were enough to get a good, steady job. Now the currency of the work force is knowledge and skills and the things that come with sticking through high school, like perseverance and discipline. Now the outlook for a dropout is likely to include poverty and dependence on welfare and, for many, crime and incarceration.\ There are some in the educational bureaucracy who like to debate whether the graduation rate is 74 percent or 76 percent or 79 percent. But year in and year out, research that tackles the issue from different perspectives keeps coming to remarkably similar conclusions: About one in four Virginia students doesn't finish high school.\ That's too high. Period.\ The Board of Education has created a committee to address the matter. The future will tell how serious that effort is and whether the board will make the substantive commitment it will take to get results.\ As a starting point, setting a goal of 61 percent graduating is hardly encouraging. *"
220,"Build, don't bail\$700 billion dollars are being fought over by politicians, lobbyists and Wall Street. It will do little but make the rich richer and our grandchildren poorer. We as individuals owe approximately $30,000 each - our part of the $10 trillion debt.\This money could create 3 million jobs at $50,000 per year while leaving plenty for materials and equipment. This would create even more jobs and taxes to be paid back into the system. Let's fix our infrastructure while coming close to breaking even.\Leon M. Whittaker\Heathsville\TR, not FDR\President-elect Barack Obama sees himself as today's version of Franklin Roosevelt, creating a new New Deal for Americans. The media seems to support this vision. Perhaps he and they should consider the following comments from another Roosevelt, Theodore: ""If an American is to amount to anything he must rely upon himself, and not upon the State; he must take pride in his own work, instead of sitting idle to envy the luck of others. He must face life with resolute courage, win victory if he can, and accept defeat if he must, without seeking to place on his fellow man a responsibility which is not theirs.""\Jack Moran\Poquoson\And so ...?\""And so?"" used to be a popular response to someone's presuppositions that were meant to convince you they were right. Now we hear, ""We (the taxpayers) need to bail out the automakers. Without this bailout they could go into bankruptcy.""\And so? Isn't that what happens to a company that's run inefficiently and wastefully?\""We (the taxpayers) need to bail out the stockbrokers and insurance firms because we wouldn't want that to happen.""\And so what if that happened? Perhaps these free-spending, high-riding people will begin to feel the brunt of what it feels like to wonder if your outgo will match your income.\Maybe if we (the taxpayers) enable someone who has the courage and conviction to speak up for the common man, then the other side might get to know what even playing fields feel like. Typically, it's pretty bumpy with no rosy bailouts when things get rough.\Rick Woolery\Hampton\Street litter\I am writing to address the problem of litter and trash on the streets throughout Hampton and other cities. I am one of many volunteers who cleaned up an area, known as an Adopt-a-Spot. As of 2007, there were 5,000 kindhearted people who clean up Adopt-a-Spots. I am also only one of many neighbors who clean up trash in front of our homes that is thrown out of cars. Between cleaning the Adopt-a-Spot and various neighbors reporting what they pick up, the trash ranges from beer cans, used baby diapers, fast food wrappers and cigarettes butts to cardboard boxes.\How hard is it to bag your trash and take it home? You can find the energy to throw it out your car window. A lot of the trash that isn't picked up finds its way to the water ways, causing pollution and injury to wildlife. Also, it is unlawful to litter, and you could be fined. Trash also draws insects and vermin. Let's not mention the smell and the fact that trash lying around just isn't pretty.\So I ask you, start thinking before you pitch.\If you see someone in your neighborhood picking up trash, why not stop and thank them? If you have an interest in the Adopt-a-Spot program, contact your city. But most of all, take your trash home with you. Nothing would please me more than to have no littler to clean up.\Elizabeth Nieder-Bocka\Hampton\Turkey pardon\Barack Obama has risen from humble beginnings to the power of the presidency.

Williams' argument in ""Socialism's evils"" is not against socialism, but against the fundamental principles of society itself. In it, he argues that any attempt to use money garnered from the citizenry (i.e., taxes) to help those who are weak or infirm is a form of ""slavery.""\To strip the honeyed (or more accurately, loaded) words out of Williams' column, he is claiming that we are all, right now, slaves, because we pay for such services as Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security. His argument is that any attempt by the government to use its power for social betterment ""has no redeeming features and is worthy of condemnation.""\The original metaphor of the article was taxes used to help an elderly lady who could not mow her yard, but let's think about the man who cannot perform his job because of a workplace accident his HMO won't cover. This is a man who paid his taxes for his neighbors' well-being when they were weak, when they needed help. Now, he needs help from them, and when he has recovered from his surgeries, he will become a healthy, productive member of society once again, as opposed to forcing him and his family out on the street, where he will starve and his children may well turn to crime for survival.\It is not merely morally right to aid those of us in need, it is economically sensible.\James Akridge\Newport News\Hold the fish\Congratulations, Vice Mayor Joe Spencer, for protecting our rainy day funds at the Hampton City Council retreat on Nov. 17.\Hampton has $11.99 million in its rainy day fund beyond an amount required for emergencies. It also has $87.79 million already earmarked for projects. I am encouraged by the many council voices of reason. Every project must be weighed against the unknowns that daily beset us on the economic front. We already know the governor will cut school money next year. We know that our city continues to flood. We know that our children are gunning each other down. And we know that a fish market is not a good neighbor to an elementary school.\Mayor Molly Ward and council, hold onto that money.\Dave Blackburn\Hampton\Exporting jobs\Virginia's roads and bridges are falling apart.

Check out all the potholes on Interstate 64 between the airport and the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel and on Interstate 664 in Hampton and Newport News.\On the other hand, the Better Jacksonville program in our competitor region has had a half-cent regional sales tax that is funding new roads, bridges and port projects everywhere you look.\With the lack of investment in Virginia's infrastructure, expect more of Hampton Roads' port and business activity to move to Jacksonville and elsewhere where the transportation infrastructure is of good quality.\Al Riutort\Newport News\Impeach Bush\It is unthinkable that this president could just pack up and leave office without being held accountable for his and his staff's illegal actions while in office. Impeachment proceedings should be held now to make them accountable for the war in Iraq, torture and financial crimes they have committed. To do any less would show an act of outrageous contempt for the people of the United States and the world.\Gerry Evans\Smithfield"
221," Venue changes hurt victims\ The men accused of being the Washington, D.C. snipers have been given a change of venue for their trials, and I have a couple of serious concerns about the judicial attitude toward the living victims. The accused have been given trial relocations to Chesapeake and Virginia Beach in what judges see as an attempt to allow for fair trials. Part of a fair trial is the fair treatment of the families and friends of the murdered people. Are the judges who ordered a change of venue also going to order a provision for room, board and time off for the families and friends of the murdered so that they may attend the trials? If not, the judges have not been impartial.\ We take it for granted that it is a right for the accused to be faced by the accuser but ignore the needs of the living who were wronged to stare into the face of the accused. An important part of justice is allowing families and friends to sit in a trial and bring weight on the proceedings. To deny this is to give all rights to accused and guilty as they rob the victims' families of the right to see justice carried out. The judges who changed the venues of these trials have announced that they are taking sides.\ To move the trials means that all of the witnesses, all of the evidence, all of the information gathered in the Washington, D.C., area will have to be relocated. If anything ""disappears"" it may throw the trial. This is not a quest for justice.\ James H. Wilson\ Newport News\ Solutions needed\ My wife and I visited your part of the state during the July 4th weekend. That Saturday we made a trip to Norfolk from Williamsburg for a downtown meeting with family members. We were dismayed at the five and 10 mile backups in the eastbound lanes of Interstate 64. To avoid this problem, we went back to Williamsburg that night via Smithfield and the Jamestown ferry.\ All over Virginia now you find these problems on I-95 from Richmond to Washington, D.C., on Route 17 outside of Fredericksburg, and along I-81 in the Shenandoah Valley. Our state government has failed the public by not maintaining a good transportation system.\ Virginia last had an increase in the gas tax in 1986, while nonstop growth has taken place since then. The General Assembly's desire to hold down our taxes is a bad position relative to our transportation needs. Gas taxes are paid by those who use our roads. Keeping a lid on that tax while we suffer with a bad transportation system does not make sense.\ The time we waste in traffic jams, the fuel we waste and the additional damage to our environment caused by emissions of stalled vehicles is costing all of us dearly. The Republican members of the House of Delegates need to come back to planet earth and get real about these issues.\ Virginia needs additional funds for our transportation system and a House of Delegates that will work with the Senate and Gov. Mark Warner to find solutions to this mess.\ W. Rodger Provo\ Fredericksburg\ Just clean house\ The Commonwealth of Virginia has been in such a mess regarding the budget shortfall and trying to find ways to keep the budget in the black. I have one suggestion sure to save millions if not billions of dollars. Start from the top down and clean house at the Virginia Department of Transportation.\ What is going on with VDOT? Have they absolutely no accountability to the taxpayers? I am no engineer or road builder, but if they knew about the problems with the slope of new pavement on Interstate 64 not being right when they allowed E. V. Williams to continue pouring the concrete, then I would assign the blame to them. Nothing goes on in road construction without VDOT engineer and inspector approval. They admit they knew about it, yet they don't want to assign blame. How convenient and how nice. But the fact is millions of dollars will be paid out for the work already done. Now, for them to have to fix a problem they knew existed and yet allowed to continue is an outrage.\ We are talking about costing the taxpayers millions of dollars, and yet nothing happens to make sure it doesn't keep happening again. From the computer program that they never followed up on and refused to take the contractor to court on, to the I-64/Jefferson Avenue mess with Archer-Western, to this new mess, it doesn't take an accountant to realize just how much money has been thrown to the wind.\ I guess when you spend someone else's money, you wouldn't feel badly about those ""little"" mistakes, but every time I drive down the road and hit potholes and wait in traffic, I am reminded that my taxpayer dollar is not being well spent.\ We want to come up with a budget solution? Let's hold VDOT accountable for their mistakes.\ Michelle Osborn\ Hampton\ Trained monkeys\ It is with total disbelief I read the Interstate 64 expansion project snafu between the Hampton Roads Center Parkway and Mercury Boulevard in Thursday's paper. I work in the construction industry and cannot believe that Virginia Department of Transportation and E. V. Williams installed the concrete surface without a crown for drainage. Even worse, VDOT knew the problem existed and allowed construction to continue. Sloping paved surfaces for drainage was covered in Concrete 101.\ No wonder the sales tax referendum was defeated. Why would anyone want to provide more money to VDOT? Trained monkeys could do it better.\ Tim Seibel\ Williamsburg\ Role model\ What a fine article Dave Fairbank wrote about Ganon Baker (""Positive trip for Baker,"" July 20). It's disappointing that so many sport heroes don't measure up to be role models for today's youth, but Ganon certainly does. It was refreshing to see him featured on your Sunday sports page.\ He is giving back to the young people in this area what he has been given and has learned from others. His passion is basketball, his faith is in God, and his dream is to reach as many young people as possible.\ There are many fine athletes out there -- and to publicize the good ones is rewarding and a credit to themselves, their parents and the community.\ Bill and Jac Robertson\ Hampton\ Alienated allies\ Reading the Daily Press and watching TV news is painful for me these days. It's bad enough that President George W. Bush has deceived the American people -- and our allies around the world -- about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. It is even worse that he has alienated all of our former friends in ways that no other president has ever done.\ Now he has probably destroyed the career of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who, before Bush, had a promising future ahead. The British people are not only angry with us, they are angry with Blair for his support of Bush and his agenda.\ Our former friends and allies despise us -- because of Bush. I wish I could write letters to those people, in their own languages, to tell them that we do not agree with him, and we value their friendship.\ If Bush would practice the religion he claims to have, he would not treat friends as if they were enemies. He would treat enemies as if they were friends.\ I am old enough to remember when our allies helped the British hold off Hitler for two years, through nightly bombing raids, until we could get our act together and join them. And even then it took the attack on Pearl Harbor to get us moving. Great Britain, America and all our other allies won the war by fighting together, against Hitler.\ Bush is not likely to understand what it means to have allies. If he did, he would know that you do not alienate the people who helped you in past wars. There's always another one coming up.\ Julia M. Ahearn\ Newport News"
222," Road extension in York unwarranted\ I am asking the York County supervisors and the Virginia Department of Transportation to cancel the Fort Eustis Boulevard extension project. The proposed construction will not provide relief to existing or future traffic issues around the Route 17 corridor.\ I recently attended the meeting at York High School and was told that the reasons for the project were:\ * Very attractive funding. It is only a bargain if we really need it. The funding is still my tax dollar even if it is 80 percent federal and 20 percent state. There is no funding available in the foreseeable future for phases two or three, according to the officials at the meeting, so this short extension to Old York Hampton Highway will not fulfill the original premise. At least $5.4 million will be wasted.\ * If we build it they will come. The extension is being touted as easier access to Interstate 64 to and from Victory Industrial Park and York River Commerce Park. Large trucks will still have to negotiate the exits from I-64, Jefferson Avenue, a two-lane road and stoplights along five miles of Fort Eustis Boulevard, cross Route 17, then travel a short four-lane section ending in a T-junction on Old York Hampton Highway. This two-lane road was not built to handle heavy traffic, according to the VDOT report at the meeting. What plans are there to upgrade Old York Hampton Highway to meet the load?\ Maybe if they come they won't stay. Remember Winn-Dixie in the county? Gateway in Hampton?\ Once the road is built, there will be irreparable damage to the environment, endangered species' habitats and wetlands in the area. Plans can and should be altered to fit changing circumstances. Go back to the drawing board before it is too late.\ Lynda Young\ Yorktown\ A party in the club\ Ever since I have been old enough to vote I have scrutinized our political process. I have never believed that I had to be labeled a Democrat because of the color of my skin, where I dwell demographically or the size of my bank account. I pay close attention to the issues, factor in my opinion and cast my vote accordingly.\ I watch ""The 700 Club"" on a daily basis. I respect Pat Robertson and the Christian Broadcasting Network staff to the fullest for getting God's word out to the masses and bringing forth the religious issues that are detrimental to our society. What I cannot understand is why Robertson is trying to push Republican views on his audience. Robertson should know that with a religious following it is best to remain unbiased, ask supporters to vote their consciences, and pray for any president who would attempt to lead our country through adversity.\ We have Tim Russert, Dan Abrams, Jim McLehrer, ""Face the Nation"" and various other politically based programs to spin the public dizzy and drag us back and forth across the political lines. Can't we keep a religious institution such as CBN spiritual by uplifting the graciousness of God and out of the political arena?\ If we wanted Robertson in the White House, we would have put him there years ago. Being seen in the political arena enhances our faith that God is working in our government, but being heard as a politician breeds a perception of disbelief and dishonesty.\ Michael J. Taylor\ Newport News\ Mission accomplished\ Finally no more guessing, rumors, gaps and flaws in President Bush's National Guard duty. Yes, it's all over, folks. On Feb. 17 the invisible commander-in-chief visited Fort Polk, La., where he was seen by about 7,000 Guard troops getting ready for deployment to Iraq. And, as usual, the showboater came in prancing and saluting.\ Of course, it's only 32 years later.\ Frank M. Savala\ Hampton\ Parasitic aliens\ A friend sent me the letter by Nancy P. Rocha, knowing that I would be interested (""Mexican immigrants aren't parasites,"" Feb. 25). I'm Hispanic and I am now retired from the nursing field.\ I have seen illegal alien women waddle into the emergency room with the baby's head crowning to have the baby in the hospital. This way an ""anchor baby"" gets documentation that he is born on U.S. soil. Contrary to what Rocha says, here in California, one can see wall-to-wall illegal aliens in any welfare office seeking and getting state assistance. American citizens have to go through a red- tape nightmare to get help, but not illegals. They get help, no questions asked.\ In California, illegals get paid under the table and don't pay taxes. They get help from the state with the rent, utilities, food stamps, free health care, free breakfast and lunches for their children in school, help with day care for preschool children and in- state college tuition. Illegal aliens here are not afraid to demand welfare, and they get it for all their children whether they are born here or not.\ California is in debt for $38 billion with no relief in sight. We have become the welfare state for illegal aliens. Here, illegal aliens are parasites.\ Haydee Pavia\ Laguna Woods, Calif.\ False claims\ Nancy P. Rocha thinks Mexican illegal aliens only come to the United States to pick fruits and veggies? She is wrong concerning all her claims. Our hospitals in California are going bankrupt due to illegal aliens using them without paying their bills. Our welfare workers must be bilingual due to so many Spanish-speaking applicants.\ Mexican nationals are taking American jobs in record numbers. Mexican nationals out-number American citizens in this state, yet they couldn't vote in order to get Cruz Bustamante in office as governor?\ And everywhere we look there are Mexican illegals throughout this state. The truth doesn't say much for the credibility of Rocha.\ Priscilla Espinoza\ Nuevo, Calif.\ Listen to Greenspan\ As we watch our state government struggle with the continuing gap between state revenues and our perceived needs for government spending, we would be well-served if those charged with this enormous responsibility would consider the advice that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave to the U.S. Congress on Feb. 25.\ Addressing the pending retirement of the Baby Boom generation, Greenspan said, ""This dramatic demographic change is certain to place enormous demands on our nation's resources -- demands we will almost surely be unable to meet unless action is taken. For a variety of reasons, that action is better taken as soon as possible.""\ Greenspan's advice on how to deal with this problem is useful at the state level as well: ""I believe that a thorough review of our spending commitments -- and at least some adjustment in those commitments -- is necessary for prudent policy. ... I certainly agree that the same scrutiny needs to be applied to taxes. However, tax rate increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base. The exact magnitude of such risks is very difficult to estimate, but they are of enough concern, in my judgment, to warrant aiming to close the fiscal gap primarily, if not wholly, from the outlay side.""\ Wise counsel indeed.\ Richard E. Hawley\ Newport News\ Gas tax needs\ Our voted lawmakers seem to have lost the concept of representation. Not too long ago, Virginia citizens were asked to vote whether to raise taxes and, as I recall, clearly voted ""no."" The folks in Richmond now decided on their own to raise taxes further on gasoline purchases.\ I have always believed that ""need"" is relative. They must need more money in order to fuel their wastes, salaries, fleet vehicle purchases and similar ""needs."" A large number of taxpayers don't have vehicles with air conditioning, for instance. But every government vehicle I see, whether it be for local or state use, does. Need is relative. Their efforts seem to be driving our state surely toward a ""feudal"" system.\ Unfortunately, we voters have too short a memory when election time rolls around.\ Bernard L. Evans\ Newport News"
223," Off the fence\ A friend of mine talked me into attending the Transportation Referendum Forum in Virginia Beach last month. Since I live on the Peninsula and work in Norfolk, I am very concerned with the state of our interstate highways and the constant congestion that I deal with.\ Although I am no fan of tax increases, I was disappointed to find out from opponents of the referendum that they have no plan. Although they made some very good points about how we got to this point, they offered no serious resolutions to our transportation problems.\ I just do not think asking the federal government for the money is a plausible resolve, nor do I believe that a 1-cent increase in the general sales tax will ""drive people from their homes,"" according to an opponent.\ I was on the fence before the forum. Now I am committed to voting yes on Nov. 5.\ Jennifer Sage\ Newport News\ Fuel tax is fairer\ In response to the Sept. 3 Daily Press editorial ""Road to the future.""\ Since the service provided is public transportation, why not place the tax on the people who use that service? Surely a fuel tax would be more appropriate for the benefit received by the people paying the tax.\ This solution to the transportation problem seems to make common sense. A fuel tax is fairer, since everyone would be paying a uniform tax rate across the state.\ Indeed, this solution should be applied across the entire country.\ A fuel tax has the additional benefit of being progressive rather than regressive. It also serves the social needs of conserving natural resources and protecting the environment by giving each of us the financial incentive to reduce our use of the scarce resources of roadway capacity, fuel and breathable air.\ Europe, with greater experience than us in providing for dense population, has already taken the lead in increasing the cost of transportation fuels. We might learn from their example on this issue.\ No one wants to pay more tax than is absolutely needed for services we all require. But we should all agree to pay for the services we use rather than asking someone else to pay for our wants and needs. Basic human dignity demands at least that much from each of us.\ Edmond T. Seymore Jr.\ Grafton\ Future in our hands\ This letter is to take issue with the individuals who have written criticizing the transportation referendum. Apparently there are a few folks who think that all taxes are evil. No one enjoys paying more taxes. I definitely don't, but I understand that taxes are the price we all pay for being part of a community.\ The transportation referendum is an opportunity for Hampton Roads to avoid the terrible congestion now plaguing Northern Virginia.\ The anti-tax zealots keep complaining about a penny of additional sales tax instead of presenting alternative solutions to our current and future traffic problems. Anyone who has spent time stuck on (or in) one of our bridge-tunnels knows that congestion is a worsening problem.\ The referendum is the best answer to today's congestion and tomorrow's gridlock. So far, the only alternative we have is the Santa Claus solution -- keep waiting and hoping that someone somewhere solves our problem for us.\ Sorry, Virginia, this Christmas, Santa won't be bringing you a third crossing.\ On Nov. 5 we will have the opportunity to take our future in our hands and make a difference. Vote YES on the transportation referendum.\ Forrest Ward\ Hampton\ Poor land use\ Reference the upcoming sales tax increase for road improvements. I'm beginning to incur doubts.\ To begin with, Interstate 64 improvements have been ongoing over 20 years, and the results are a parking lot. Jefferson Avenue, Warwick Boulevard, Todds Lane, Fox Hill Road, Mercury Boulevard and other arteries have undergone similar improvements over the years with the same results.\ In real estate terms, the problem is volume, volume and volume.\ Poor planning and land-hungry developers contributed to this mess. Every tiny plot of land had to have a house on it along with three or more cars with as many drivers. Planners and developers alike didn't figure on the infrastructure needed to move all that traffic.\ What do we have? Try to get from a dead-end street onto Fox Hill Road at 2 p.m. or 2 a.m. should provide a ready answer.\ Now the politicians, statisticians and officials want us to approve a tax for road ""improvements."" Being an educated person of sorts, I've studied the pros and cons of the issue and try as hard as I may, cannot jump on their bandwagon or arrive at a workable solution.\ What's the answer? I don't know.\ What I do know is spending more money in whipping a dead horse is not.\ Thomas Parker\ Hampton\ Toll for crossing\ The Daily Press is campaigning very hard to make sure the Nov. 5 tax referendum is passed by tugging on heartstrings: i.e.: leading us to believe that emergency treatment is at risk and we might die if we don't support the tax increase.\ For those of us not falling for scare tactics, I make these points: The local hospitals have helipads so that copters can expeditiously transport high-risk emergencies to other facilities and I have seen helicopters land on Interstate 64 to transport accident victims.\ To address the argument that the military needs bigger and better roads to transport their equipment, then let the military build them.\ If a third crossing is necessary, stick a toll on it like the Coleman and Chesapeake Bay bridges to pay for it. And finally, finish up the construction mess we have now before new messes begin, which will take years.\ The toll on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel has been reduced from $20 to $14 and the bridge has long been paid for, even the new one. Where's the extra money?\ To cite one stupid use, millions of dollars of taxpayer money has been spent on erecting new bridges on Tangier Island because the locals keeping tearing them down to use the steel.\ There are many other VDOT wastes that can be cited. Clean this up and start spending taxpayer money wisely, then I will vote to give more of it. Vote no to tax increases.\ Patricia A. Lassiter\ Newport News\ Finish existing jobs\ Where I stand versus where the newspaper stands, reference the Sept. 3 editorial. Vote no on the transportation referendum.\ Because the less fortunate should not be required to pay more for food and medicine because the more fortunate want to get places faster and make money off developing more land.\ The chaos and incompetence in road building that is all around us on the Peninsula now will be extended for 20 or more years. Does it really take 11/2 years to build a small bridge in front of Home Depot in Hampton? Check out the progression on Mercury and Interstate 64. Why can't we get our community cleaned up and organized before we jump into more spending?\ A kindergarten adage is ""finish one thing before you start another.""\ If you want to speed up traffic in the Hampton Roads Bridge- Tunnel, post a sign that says ""Anxiety attacks, right lane only,"" post a 50-mph minimum in the left lane and have a traffic person on duty to arrest violators.\ Taxes should fall on users: ergo if you smoke or drink alcoholic beverages, you pay that tax.\ If you want more roads do what other cities do -- toll roads.\ There's also taxing cars by size or a gas tax.\ Susan Bentley Joseph\ Hampton\ Private partnership\ We do need better roads to move the cargo from Hampton Roads' marine terminals, more tunnels between Norfolk and Portsmouth and a wider Interstate 64.\ And we need to spend the money. But will I get all the facts to decide if the entire menu of the referendum on Nov. 5 is worth the cost?\ In 1995 the Virginia General Assembly passed the ""Public-Private Transportation Act"" authorizing private partnerships to build roads without using tax dollars. The builders get paid back from tolls on the new roads.\ A private partnership proposed to VDOT, earlier this year, to build the ""third crossing"" per this act. That would mean a third crossing without spending tax dollars.\ What has become of that proposal? Will we read anything of it in the Daily Press prior to Nov. 5?\ A casual glance at a Southside map shows the proposed path for the Route 460 project leading into the hinterlands of Isle of Wight County. This is a rural area, farmland, ripe for new residential development. How will new homes in rural Southside ease traffic congestion?\ Are tax dollars being spent to subsidize developers or are there other compelling facts justifying a super highway across farmland?\ More reporting, please, to help me decide on how to vote on Nov. 5.\ R.M. Hixson\ Yorktown"
224," Solutions to Hampton Roads' mounting traffic problems - from backups at York River's Coleman bridge to clogged Norfolk and Virginia Beach expressways - may depend on getting 15 cities and counties to agree on how to raise money for expensive highway projects right here at home.\ Locally imposed taxes or tolls - rather than traditional federal and state money - appear likely to play a major role in paying for new roads and maintaining existing ones in the 1990s.\ ""If you want more roads, it's going to cost more. If people are willing to pay more taxes, then there's no problem,"" said Newport News state Sen. Robert C. Scott.\ ""If people are not willing to pay more for roads in taxes, are they willing to pay tolls?"" Scott asked.\ In 1991, the 30-year-old federal interstate highway program will end, and so will the money formula the federal government has used to build highways.\ Congressional hearings will begin soon on the Highway Reauthorization Act, which will determine federal highway money policies for the next decade. Transportation policy at all levels of government will face drastic changes as a result of the new act.\ The federal government now provides 90 cents of every dollar spent on interstate construction. State and local financing make up the rest. After 1991, the split is likely to change to somewhere between 50-50 and 80-20, said Joe Rhodes, director of the Office of Policy Development at the U.S. Department of Transportation.\ Money for major roadways will likely be redirected, according to several congressional aides, and the largest debate will not be over how much to spend, but where to spend it. The large western states will compete with congested urban areas for the lessened federal allocations.\ ""Looking at the condition of the nation's highway system, we'd like to see $80 billion appropriated. And that will barely hold the system together. About $100 billion will begin to approach the system's needs,"" said Frank Francois, director of the American Association of State Highway and Transit Officials.\ ""But we can't do that unless we raise taxes,"" he said. ""The end result is that we need to increase funding by whatever blend we can - state, federal, local and private money.""\ The reauthorization hearings will likely center around what can be done to best use roads already built.\ ""The general thrusts of the hearings will be that we've got to do a better job with what we have,"" Rhodes said. ""We have to preserve and maintain, and discussions at this level have two primary themes: rural accessibility and the safety and condition of bridges.""\ In that framework, the push for local money sources, especially in metropolitan areas like Hampton Roads, will increase. A recent study released through the Southeastern Virginia and Peninsula planning district commissions recommends creating a regional transportation finance authority.\ Such an authority, if accepted by the 15 localities of Hampton Roads and approved by the General Assembly, could have the power to issue bonds, levy additional gasoline and sales taxes, and create assessment districts to generate real estate taxes, according to the study.\ ""At this point, it's just an idea,"" said Art Collins, executive director of SVPDC. Local businesses, through the area's two chambers of commerce, have backed the plan, though they have not endorsed a particular payment method from among the variety proposed.\ Tolls are the surest way to pay for construction of roads and repairs for existing ones. But without congressional approval, placing tolls on river crossings and entrances and exits to interstate highways is unlikely.\ ""I don't know that it's do-able in a federal legislative context. Tolls are a very dramatic change to an interstate highway program,"" said Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-1st.\ ""It's not something that Congress is going to wait anxiously to do,"" Bateman said.\ A regional toll program could raise as much as $320 million a year. A regional gas tax, at 5 cents per gallon, would raise $38 million, according to figures supplied by SVPDC.\ Other fund-raising ideas proposed in the study include a regional sales tax of one-half percent that could raise as much as $44 million annually.\ All sources of added income combined, excluding tolls, could raise up to $155 million a year, still leaving a considerable shortfall in money to complete the projects identified as needed to keep drivers across Hampton Roads moving along.\ For 20 projects listed by the planning district commissions, there is almost a $160 million shortfall for 1989 alone. Total cost of the work listed is projected at $3.5 billion.\ Democrat state Del. Howard E. Copeland of Norfolk said he was against tolls on the interstate, calling them ""an impediment.""\ ""It is a barrier to the movement of traffic. It's counter- productive,"" Copeland said.\ The General Assembly starts its biennial budget process in January, which steps up the pressure on local governments to issue their opinions on the study. Collins has attended city council meetings and county board meetings to explain the study, which he said had so far met with favorable review.\ The study recommends that ""coalition efforts also be pursued with counties and communities in the state that have similar interests in the shape of transportation reauthorization legislation ...(A) coordinated effort with the General Assembly will be needed to implement any new federal legislation.""\ ""You need to be careful you don't create a layer of bureaucracy that absorbs money in place of laying concrete,"" said Rep. Owen Pickett, D-2nd. ""Similar ideas have been proposed before in terms of regional transportation. We would not have this kind of concern if requirements were being met,"" he added.\ Transportation planning in general is likely to change, as the environment, regional growth and even the budget deficit come into play.\ ""I think there's recognition that we're not going to build ourselves out of our demand for highways. The citizens' commitment to a large freeway system is no longer there. I'm not sure it's politically possible,"" said Jim Echols, director of Tidewa ter Regional Transit, the operators of public transportation on the south side of the harbor.\ Scott agreed: ""One of the problems when you try to build yourselves out of it: You tend to build yourselves into it."" Improving access to already congested areas means traffic levels will increase, he said.\ ""The Interstate 664 crossing will help ease the Hampton Roads crossing,"" but it will become congested quickly, he said. I-664's bridge-tunnel crossing from Newport News to Suffolk is scheduled to open in December 1991.\ ""The number-one priority is getting a third tube at the Hampton Roads tunnel,"" said Copeland.\ Many local leaders agree the solution to roadway problems does not necessarily lie in simply building more miles of road, but in changing how we use them. Tidewater Regional Transit, the City of Norfolk and, to a lesser extent, Virginia Beach are looking at building some form of rapid transit between the two cities.\ Where it is most needed, according to Echols, is along the corridor that most people use to commute between the two cities: the Route 44/I-264 tollway. ""Norfolk has been very supportive and sees a very clear relationship between this proposed facility and other transportation needs. Virginia Beach is less clear, because its development is not centered along the corridor. In either case, it will be very new to the entire area,"" Echols said.\ Similar methods of rapid transit have been studied for the Peninsula, according to Michael Townes, director of the Peninsula Transportation District Commission, which operates the public bus system on the Peninsula.\ The transit methods considered involve some form of a fixed-route system, either using light-rail rapid transit or buses, adding that such a system is about 10 years away.\ While Virginia Beach and Chesapeake are looking at a Southeastern Expressway, and Norfolk is studying rapid transit, a regional umbrella organization would have to address the needs of Peninsula localities and enlist their support.\ A big concern to Gloucester, York County and Newport News is a second York River crossing that would alleviate rush-hour back-ups on the Coleman Bridge. At one point, after a second crossing was approved by the State Highway Commission, construction costs were to be raised with a $1 toll on the bridge. Extensive picketing by Gloucester and York County residents killed that plan, and an alternative source for the money hasn't been determined, said state Sen. Elmo G. Cross, whose 4th District includes Gloucester County.\ These various concerns can be brought under one umbrella, Collins said, but other concerns of the affected localities must be answered first, such as whether all votes on a local transportation board would be equal.\ ""If not all jurisdictions decide to participate, I would not consider that a failure. Some may move forward if they have immediate needs. The fact that some communities may not see it as appropriate does not mean the idea is flawed,"" Collins said."

PAUL VOLCKER: AUTHOR
\
Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, shunned the media throughout his 40-year career in public service. But to promote his just- published book, Changing Fortunes: The World's Money and the Threat to American Leadership, he has appeared on CNN's Larry King Live and granted some rare interviews to newspaper reporters. He's scheduled to appear on NBC's Today Friday morning and PBS' McNeil-Lehrer NewsHour June 22. Last week, Volcker talked with USA TODAY economics reporters Beth Belton and Mark Memmott in his New York office. He had just returned from a 12-day consulting trek to Hong Kong, Australia, France and Switzerland. Earlier this year, he visited Moscow and East Europe to advise finance officials on how to fix their collapsed economies. Volcker splits his time between consulting, teaching at Princeton University and being chairman of James D. Wolfensohn, a small New York investment bank. At his office there, on the 40th floor of a mid town skyscraper, the 6-foot-6 Volcker sipped iced tea, often leaning back in his leather chair to chuckle at his own jokes. Volcker is best known as the Fed chairman who whipped inflation by pushing up interest rates until the prime rate hit a record 21.5%. Then, the economy slid into recession. The New Jersey native is also an avid fly fisherman. On one wall of his office hangs a watercolor of a memorable trout catch. And he is father of two children. A small oil painting of a sad clown face, painted by his daughter when she was 10, adorns another wall.
\
Q: Why did you decide to write the book?
\
A: There are a lot of people through the years who said, ``You ought to write a book.'' I never responded. But then Toyoo Gyohten (TOY-u Gee-OH-ten), the co-author ... was (at Princeton), and I was there, and they said, ``Why don't you give a seminar together?'' I said, ``well, if we're going to go to all that trouble of giving a seminar on postwar international stuff, stick a tape recorder in the room, and it'll be simple, we'll have a book.'' Part of the purpose was to contribute to the educational process and maybe even the motivational process of young students interested in the public service.
\
Q: What do you see as the key issue in domestic policy?
\
A: It's so dull and people are so tired of hearing about it, but I do think the budget problem ... cuts across a lot of the other problems.
\
Q: What needs to happen?
\
A: It's obviously a political choice. I don't see how you can balance the budget by passing a constitutional amendment. You've got to balance the budget by reducing expenditures or reducing the rate of growth of expenditures or increasing the rate of growth in taxes. ... If you want to amend the Constitution, then we should make it harder to spend money ... presumably by a line-item veto. Or you can make it harder to spend money very directly by amending the Constitution to say you need better than a simple majority of (Congress) to spend money. Make it 60%.
\
Q: How frustrating was it as the Fed chairman to talk about this ad nauseam and see things just getting worse?
\
A: It gets very frustrating. There's only one very cynical advantage. Every time you wanted to get them (Congress or the administration) off your back, you could say, ``Well, what did you do about the budget recently?'' And the answer was always, ``Nothing'' (laughter).
\
Q: Do you agree with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , who says inflation is not to be feared at today's levels?
\
A: Inflation is pretty well under control at the moment. You would like to see it reduced further. We are making some progress, and interest rates don't fully reflect that because the deficit is so big.
\
Q: If you were still at the Treasury and the president called you for advice on the July economic summit and on the state of the economy, what would you say?
\
A: The state of the economy is moving ahead, however sluggishly. We don't have any dramatic actions to be taken to speed the recovery. Trade would certainly be on the agenda. If they could really finish up this General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it would be a great accomplishment. I'm sure they won't, but that would be good. They could do some work coordinating assistance to the East. ... On the environment, the weight of the evidence looks pretty clear that the greenhouse effect is a problem. Doesn't it make sense to raise revenues with a carbon tax or a gas tax?
\
Q: How much do you miss being in government?
\
A: I am not immune from the feeling in the country as a whole, which is, ``Who wants to go to Washington?'' That is a pretty sad comment from me, because I spent a lot of my life there, taking great pride in government service.
\
Q: In the book, there were numerous people you encountered at the Treasury or the Fed who have left public service. Are we in danger of losing that kind of brain trust?
\
A: No doubt about it. ... There's clearly been a trend toward politicization, (and) you lose something when you do that. ... Back in the days of Roosevelt, when everything was getting highly politicized, presumably he had (just more than 200) political appointments in the administration. Now we've got 3,000. Or look at Congress. When I first went to Washington in the 1950s, there were 350 professional staff people in Congress. Now there are (15,000 to 20,000) professional congressional staff people. It costs $2 billion just to run the Congress. It makes it a lot harder to be in a bureaucracy downtown that spends half its time fending off the congressional staffer types.
\
Q: The period from 1979, when you became Fed chairman, through the '81-82 recession, you must have been surprised that interest rates had to go as high as they did to control inflation.
\
A: Yes. No doubt about that.
\
Q: What were Federal Open Market Committee meetings like then? You're human, too, and you saw unemployment going to 11%.
\
A: Well, in fact, once the Fed governors got the bit in their teeth, meetings were dull (laughter). I'm exaggerating a little bit, but there was a real strong attitude that we'd better see it through and we'd better not flinch in terms of what, to me, were unexpected levels of interest rates. That sentiment was surprisingly strong. And I sensed a good deal of support in the country. People were alarmed. They understood that something had to be done about inflation. ... They associated our actions with dealing with something they thought was a big problem.
\
Q: Is there any parallel between those times and now?
\
A: It's harder now because then there was a clear feeling of emergency and an enemy. Now people are not happy, but there are no nice enemies.
\
Q: Isn't inflation still the No. 1 enemy?
\
A: To me, inflation is always the No. 1 enemy, but it's not in an emergency state (now). Back in the early 1980s, when those price figures began coming in at an annual rate of 15% or so, I mean that was scary even to great liberals who didn't like to worry about inflation. That was the most inflation we'd ever had in the country, maybe outside a few wartime months in the whole history of the U.S. ... Inflation continues to be a chronic problem, a residual problem. But it doesn't scare you when you get up in the morning the way it did a lot of people then. Unemployment's a problem now, but you don't have a Depression level of unemployment. You don't have a feeling of enormous crises, you don't obviously have a war. ... The enemy isn't sticking his nose up there quite so clearly.
\
Q: The Fed and Alan Greenspan have been criticized for not acting quickly enough. Is that fair?
\
A: That's luck. No, it is unpleasant to be in the Federal Reserve in an election year, I assure you. It's not very pleasant to be there in even small recessions. ... I think he's done a remarkable job in some sense in not being criticized more than he has been.
\
Q: When the reader finishes your book, should he or she be pessimistic or optimistic?
\
A: Challenged (laughter). What really aggravates me is, compared to the problems of a Russia or Eastern Europe or even Europe now or potentially Japan and certainly Latin America, the kind of problems we have are quite manageable. But we're not managing them. And I'd like the reader to think, ``Goddammit, let's manage it!'' And that does require some restraint on spending. And it may require something on restraining the growth in entitlement programs. It may require some reorientation and increase in taxes, but since we've got among the lowest tax take (as a percentage of gross national product) of any advanced country, I don't think it's going to kill us. That idea that it's going to kill you is nonsense. What kills you is the failure to tax.

227," TRUST WILDER\ Doug Wilder's concern for the environment is not new. In 1971, he voted to preserve one of Virginia's most valuable natural resources, the Appalachian Trail. In 1973, (before the Exxon Valdez incident), he supported legislation to make oil refineries and vessels liable to the state for all costs of cleanup and property damage from oil spills. He supported legislation to preserve our rich farmlands and had the foresight to protect our citizens from the hazards of uranium mining. In 1985, he voted to assure that communities receive prior notification of hazardous waste sites in their localities.\ Wilder pledges consistent enforcement of environmental protection laws concerning waste management. He promises to work with local governments to meet the recycling goal of 25 percent by 1995.\ Wilder has and will continue to enact laws to reduce the sources of pollution that threaten the air we breathe. He believes that Virginia's air must not be used as a chemical dump.\ We can all look at other areas of our nation and see what has happened as a result of special interest groups. The Chesapeake Bay is a perfect example of what can happen if laws are not passed and/ or enforced.\ Fortunately for Virginia, we can still do something about our bay. But, we must elect persons who will not sell out to special interest groups or big developers. We must elect Wilder because we know he doesn't owe anyone favors - except the people of Virginia. We can put our trust in him to keep his promises. Vote Wilder on Tuesday.\ Theodore O. Howard\ Hampton\ FULL STORY\ I read with interest the article in the Daily Press that stated the Hampton Professional Firefighters Association endorsed Doug Wilder for governor.\ Sounds great, but here's what Wilder really got for his money. First, a union endorsement that represents less than 50 percent of the professional firefighters in Hampton or about 97 firefighters. Second, the union meeting nights in October were attended by less than 50 percent of the union membership. This small group of union members apparently voted on who they were to officially support for governor and Wilder came out ahead.\ There are over 250 professional firefighters and support personnel in the Hampton Fire Department. A small group of union firefighters supports Wilder. It is their right to do so.\ However, in order to set the record straight, Marshall Coleman has a number of supporters in the Hampton Fire Department, both union and non-union professionals. This is also our right.\ May the best man win for Virginia.\ Ronald L. Young\ Hampton\ NOT THIS TIME\ I have been voting Democrat here in Virginia. But this year there are many reasons why I am voting for Marshall Coleman. I feel betrayed by the Democrats. Gov. Gerald Baliles promised no tax increase. Look what he did. Two or three gas tax hikes. The titling tax went from 2 to 3 percent, with a minimum of $35. The sales tax went to 4.5 percent Then we got the seat belt law. Using seat belts should be optional.\ Now we are getting the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act. This is going to cause higher priced homes and more problems for farmers. The pollution horse has been out of the barn for many years, yet this preservation act seems to want to lay the blame on the average homeowner and the farmers.\ All of these laws are passed by the Democrats, whether good or bad. They control in Richmond by large majorities. I am not real pleased with Coleman or Doug Wilder, either. They have both been mighty negative. The abortion issue has been used too much. I consider aborton murder, but we will always have it.\ I voted for Wilder four years ago, but I can't support him this year. I didn't know then he had been censured by the Supreme Court. That didn't happen when he was a kid. That happened since he has been a lawyer, a grown man.\ Then his deal on a house in Richmond was real shady. Coleman is not perfect either, but he gets my vote. We need less government, not more.\ Sam L. Callis\ Suffolk\ FOR BENEDETTI\ I recently heard Joe Benedetti speak in Newport News. He was very impressive in his earnest desire to serve full time as a strong attorney general.\ Benedetti addressed the issues head-on and seemed to be extremely informed on all of the critical legal matters that our current attorney general has had some trouble with. He spoke of the pension crisis that is costing the taxpayers as much as $350 million. He also spoke of Mary Sue Terry's critical remarks lodged at our state police where she described being ""outraged"" at their behavior in the coal fields.\ I believe that Virginia does need a full-time attorney general to concentrate on the job. I support Benedetti.\ William Wornom\ Hampton\ RETURN HIM\ The Conference Committee is one of the most powerful committees in the General Assembly. The six members of this committee iron out differences between the House of Delgates and the Senate versions of bills.\ If Alan Diamonstein is returned to the House of Delegates, he will by virtue of seniority hold one of the six seats on this committee. Sen. Hunter Andrews of Hampton holds one of the other seats.\ In view of the changing balance of power in the direction of Northern Virginia, we think it is critical for our area to have a strong voice in the choices made for the future of the Commonwealth. We therefore strongly support the re-election of Diamonstein.\ Jane and George Webb\ Newport News\ PROUD HELP\ In recent years there has been a tremendous increase in state funding that has come to the Newport News schools from Richmond. In the 1980-81 school year the state government contributed $26 million to the schools in basic state aid and sales tax revenues. In the 1987- 88 school year that figure has risen to $54 million. The reason for this 107 percent increase in state funding is the hard work and leadership of Del. Alan Diamonstein. His vote to change the state aid funding formula has brought needed revenues into our schools.\ In my opinion Diamonstein has provided outstanding leadership that has resulted in the improvement of our school system. Such leadership should be rewarded with a strong vote of confidence from the voters in Newport News.\ Daniel J. Ruggaber\ President, Newport News\ Education Association\ STIEFFEN BEST\ I am a student at Kecoughtan High School and have not yet gained my right to vote. However, I believe that Wallace Stieffen is the best candidate to represent the 91st District. This past General Assembly session, I had the privilege of serving as a page for Stieffen in the House of Delegates. While being a busy man, he still found the time to give me the guidance and attention that I lacked being away from home. Stieffen is a conscientious, hard-working state legislator. Being assigned to the Chesapeake Bay and its Tributaries Committee, I observed firsthand his concern for protecting our bay. Stieffen is a well-respected legislator and above all a gentleman. He deserves to return to Richmond as our representative from the 91st District.\ Jane A. Allen\ Hampton\ A REAL MAN\ We ""everyday"" people have our own preconceived, stereotyped ideas of what politicians are all about. We view them as promising one thing and doing another after being elected. It takes a firsthand encounter with one to change that negative opinion. Becoming a neighbor of Wallace Stieffen certainly changed mine.\ Not all politicians are alike. Stieffen is not one of those political machines who know little about everyday life. It's not unusual to see Stieffen cutting the grass, spreading gravel in his driveway or patching a leaky roof for a tenant. He understands everyday life.\ The Chesapeake Bay is a tremendous part of everyday life in this area. Stieffen knows its importance. He lives by the bay and he loves it. He has worked diligently to see that the bay survives. We need him in Richmond again continuing to fight for the bay's survival.\ Some vote for a party. I'll vote for the man, and that man is Stieffen.\ Linda Wall\ Hampton\ COOPER CARING\ Shirley Cooper is a caring, experienced and dedicated person, who gave up a teaching position to represent us on a full-time basis as our delegate to the General Assembly.\ Michael Maguire is a lawyer and will be unable to represent us on a full-time basis, and to me it's a full-time demanding job. The citizens deserve the best.\ Cooper was there when I needed her. I hope all the people who have been helped by her will go to the polls on Election Day and vote for her.\ Margaret Peters\ Grafton\ COOPER HAS IT\ A concern in the 96th District campaign for delegate has been the concept of horsepower. There is a simple formula in the legislative body of this state. That formula is experience plus seniority equals horsepower. It is this seniority that is the basis for committee assignments. It would be naive to believe otherwise.\ Gaining experience and seniority is the method whereby your representatives are in a position to best serve the interests of this district and Virginia. At this most critical period we do not need a freshman representing our district. What we require is an experienced, caring, hard-working, full-time delegate who has gained the necessary horsepower to represent the 96th District. Del. Shirley Cooper is the one individual who meets all these requirements.\ A vote for Cooper is a vote for effective representation and horsepower for the 96th District.\ Jim Douglass\ Poquoson\ NO QUITTER\ As we head into the final days of the election for the House of Delegates for the Middle Peninsula, I want to remind my fellow citizens to be on the lookout for true negative campaigning.\ The reason I bring this up is because I haven't forgotten that Harvey Morgan and his friends tried to stop Mike Soberick for running for the House of Delegates last spring.\ Morgan got his friend, former Sen. Paul Trible, to try and stop Soberick from running by threatening his new job, the one he was going to take when he left the county attorney's office.\ Fortunately, Soberick refused to be intimidated. He quit that job, and started practicing in Gloucester.\ I can't stress too much how those kinds of tactics are par for the course for Republicans when they feel threatened. Morgan should feel threatened by Soberick, because Soberick is honest and hard-working, and he can do the job.\ Edythe Holmes\ Gloucester\ MORGAN BEST\ Mike Soberick's most recent mailing prompts this letter. I worked with Soberick when he was county attorney and found him to be professional, capable and accommodating, and seemingly possessive of high standards as to fairness.\ Now, I find it hard to believe that he would print and distribute such unfair, and untrue, statements concerning Harvey Morgan's record as our delegate. My only conclusion is that someone else must be responsible for the misrepresentations of Morgan that are being circulated.\ I'm sorry that Soberick found it necessary to lend his name to such misrepresented interpretations of Morgan's legislative record. The Virginia legislature probably has no other delegate who is more fair, honest, diligent and hard working than Morgan. He is dedicated to the concerns of those whom he was elected to serve.\ Katherine Jordan\ Gloucester Point"
228," Gerald L. Baliles leans back in his chair, one foot propped on his desk, as he talks about the campaign promises he has kept and broken as Virginia's governor.\ With less than a year left to finish what he set out to accomplish, Baliles says he is satisfied his administration has done or soon will do all it can to meet the many commitments he made Virginians when he sought their votes in 1985.\ ""I believe you ought to know what you are running for when you run,"" he said. ""I did.""\ Regardless of what Baliles accomplishes in the final nine months of his administration, state political analysts, Democrats and even Republicans agree he has already secured a spot in state history as one of the most effective governors of the 20th century.\ That's despite the fact that he broke pledges not to raise taxes, not to increase the size of state government and not to build new prisons.\ A check of dozens of other pledges he made on the 1985 campaign trail shows that Baliles has met or made substantial progress toward the majority of his goals.\ Among other things, Baliles has strengthened environmental laws, pumped millions of dollars into public education and social programs, dramatically increased road construction and launched an ambitious program of international trade.\ Baliles says his success in honoring the long list of other promises he outlined in thick position papers is proof he was honest with voters.\ He is not a candidate this year. The state constitution prohibits Virginia governors from serving two terms in a row.\ Republicans, seeking to recapture the governor's office this year for the first time since 1977, point to campaign promises Baliles made as evidence that the Democrats misled voters.\ ""The two things we are particularly critical of is the fact he said there would be no new taxes - and he said it over and over again,"" said state GOP chairman Donald W. Huffman. ""And he said there would be no more state employees when he left office than when he took office.""\ Republicans took the position in 1985 that it wasn't possible to do everything Baliles advocated without increasing taxes and adding state employees. ""And it hurt us at the time,"" Huffman said.\ ""He sold the voters a bill of goods.""\ Nine months after Baliles took office, he backed a plan to improve roads, ports and airports by raising the sales tax a half penny on the dollar, the gas tax by 2 cents a gallon and the vehicular titling tax by 1 percent.\ Within a year of taking office, Baliles had called for two new prisons. And the number of full-time government employees, the state budget shows, increased 9 percent: From 90,803 in January 1986 to 98,932 in January 1989.\ These are issues Baliles prefers to brush aside, referring to the tax increase as a ""real non-issue"" and laying it at the doorstep of the General Assembly.\ Baliles initially asked the General Assembly to finance highway projects with bonds, but lawmakers rejected that proposal, choosing to stick with the state's tradition of ""pay as you go."" That left few alternatives to higher taxes.\ As for the growth in government, Baliles notes that Virginia's population is growing by about 90,000 each year.\ ""Clearly, even though the economy is expanding, there is a greater need for prisons, to build roads. And when you pledge to clean up the bay and correct child support, it takes staffing. The growth of state government has been less than the private sector.""\ Figures from the Virginia Employment Commission bear out that employment in the private sector has outpaced employment in state government. From January 1986 to December 1988, private sector employment in Virginia increased 11 percent, compared with the 9 percent for state government.\ Republicans acknowledge that Baliles has been masterful at getting what he wanted from the General Assembly, which is dominated by members of his own Democratic party.\ ""He is the first governor since the Byrd machine who knew what he wanted and had the votes to get it. Some of the things he has done, like the environmental steps, have been a long time coming,"" said Steve Haner, who covered the Baliles campaign as a reporter in 1985 before going to work for the state Republican Party.\ The last governor historians associate with the Byrd machine is Mills E. Godwin, who served from 1966 to 1970 as a Democrat. He served a second term as a Republican from 1974 to 1978.\ ""The only big promise he didn't keep was his promise about raising taxes,"" Haner added about Baliles. ""But that is a big one. He blew that wide open.""\ While Republicans stress those failures, other observers say Baliles' many wins outweigh his losses.\ ""Baliles has been one of the most accomplished and signficant governors of this century, period,"" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\ ""Virginia is a better place than it was in 1985, and that is about the best thing you can say.""\ Baliles' staff members say they and the governor have been methodical about ensuring that his promises were met or at least attempted.\ ""We basically have a report card on these objectives,"" said Donald Finley, Baliles' secretary of education. ""We report to the governor probably about twice a year on these various things he spoke of.""\ All education promises either have been met or should be met before Baliles leaves office, according to Finley, Baliles and a comparison of the promises and the results.\ For example, the state provides localities the full amount of money needed to adhere to the Standards of Quality, a list of minimum state requirements for all public schools. It has raised teachers' salaries, increased the number of magnet schools in the state for gifted and talented students and launched a program that requires a microcomputer in every middle school in the state.\ To protect the environment, Baliles has pumped more money into cleanup programs for the Chesapeake Bay and pushed through new laws to increase the state's power to protect areas around the bay. He created the Department of Waste Management to bring under one umbrella the many agencies dealing with hazardous and toxic waste.\ Environmentalists praise him as one of their strongest allies. ""He certainly has been a leader, and he has advanced the whole cleanup program a tremendous amount,"" said Judy Crenshaw of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. ""We've had a great relationship with his administration.""\ Baliles has used the governor's office to promote Virginia and its products. Prior to this year, he had spent about $300,000 traveling on six over seas trade missions to the Far East and Europe. Last month he took his seventh, this one to Egypt. He also created the Department of World Trade.\ Through the 1986 tax increases, Baliles more than doubled the number of road, port and airport construction projects, a move he says will benefit industry.\ ""I did exactly what I said I would do in transportation,"" Baliles says.\ The tax increases approved in 1986 will bring the state $10 billion over 12 years, he said, but that still won't satisfy at least $20 million in estimated needs.\ This year, Baliles proposed giving local governments the option of adding 1 percent to the state income tax to raise more money for the roads they want to build. But the legislature limited that authority to Norfolk and Northern Virginia localities.\ Baliles contends he accomplished more than he set out to do in at least one area: social programs. He met his promise to increase state spending on mental health and to continue looking for alternatives to keeping patients in state mental institutions.\ To keep up with federal mandates, he also budgeted for millions more in health care for low-income and indigent persons and tried to forge a compromise with the health industry to ensure that someone picks up the tab for those who cannot afford quality health care. New programs to make housing afford able were also launched.\ One area where Baliles failed on many of his campaign pledges is prisons. He built two new prisons, despite initially insisting the state could do without ""new, expensive, lengthy and unnecessary programs of siting and constructing new prisons.""\ It is impossible, Baliles says, for a candidate to predict everything that will happen once he's in office. When he said that state prisons could be expanded to solve overcrowding, he says, he had no way of knowing that Virginia's prison population would skyrocket.\ In the spring of 1985, both the State Department of Corrections and the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission were estimating that the state would be responsible for about 11,100 prisoners by 1989. Instead, the number of inmates reached 14,950 in December 1988.\ State prisons can't handle all those felons; more than 2,000 are crowding city and county jails across Virginia.\ Baliles also failed to expand work release programs and programs to put non-violent criminals to work in the community. State-of-the- art security systems he advocated are in place only in new prisons, not all facilities. However, prison escapes have been kept to record lows for three years in a row. In 1988, it stood at fewer than four escapes per 1,000 inmates.\ Many of the accomplishments of the Baliles administration, Republicans and analysts suggest, have been geared towards satisfying the Democratic constituency that put Baliles in office.\ ""He made promises to teachers, and he kept them,"" Haner said. ""He made promises to the environmentalists, to state employees and to the black communities. And I think develop ers knew full well what he was going to do when it came to roads. A good, smart politician takes care of the people who elected him.""\ Another reason Baliles has been such an effective governor is because he is serving at the right time in history and has the skills to get what he wants, said Tom Morris, a University of Richmond political science professor.\ He noted that Baliles came to office following three governors who primarily maintained the status quo: Godwin (in his second term), John N. Dalton and Charles S. Robb.\ Morris compares Baliles' term to the Godwin's first term and Harry F. Byrd Sr.'s governorship from 1926 to 1930.\ Byrd reorganized the state bureaucracy, increased spending for roads, schools and mental hospitals, and put in place a strong anti- lynching law. He began Virginia's tradition of ""pay-as-you-go"" for public improvements with a constitutional amendment forbidding bond sales except in very limited circumstances.\ Under Godwin from 1966 to 1970, the state sales tax was imposed, the community college system was created and the state constitution revised, in part to allow more of the type of borrowing Byrd's amendment had prohibited.\ ""Harry Byrd Sr. and Mills Godwin came at a time when there were needs to be met, and they were individuals with great skills,"" Morris said.\ ""Jerry Baliles fits that mold. He knew state government well, and he had the political skills to make things happen.""\ Baliles served as a legislator and state attorney general before being elected chief executive in 1985.\ Morris added that Baliles' administration has moved forward so quickly and on so many fronts that he may have limited the accomplishments of his successor, Republican or Democrat.\ ""Voters may decide that it is time for something different, that the brakes should be applied for a while,"" Morris said.\ Staff writer Nancy Cook covered the 1985 guvernatorial campaign and has covered the administration of Gov. Gerald L. Baliles since he took office."

\
THE MIDDLE CLASS
\
CLINTON: ``There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down. The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.
\
``But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way. It's also a departure from tax-and-spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing. I propose an American version of what works in other countries - invest and grow.
\
``On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration. I don't believe trickle-down economics will work. Unemployment is up. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago. I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.''
\
BUSH: ``Well, he doesn't like trickle-down government, but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs. The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden. And what I don't like is trickle-down government.
\
``Government - he says invest government, grow government. Government doesn't create jobs. If they do, they're make-work jobs. It's the private sector that creates jobs. And yes, we've got too many taxes and we're spending too much.
\
``And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending. It won't be painless. I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there. It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done. But not by raising taxes.
\
``Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet, because his figures don't add up, and he's going to sock it right to the middle-class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes.'' PEROT: ``The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget. If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them.
\
``Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding. If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding. And we are bleeding arterially.
\
``There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base. Balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt.
\
``We have spent their money. We've got to pay it back. This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice. My plan balances the budget within six years. We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy. We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover. But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.''
\
CLINTON: ``I disagree with both of them. I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan.
\
``And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't. And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle-class tax relief.
\
``And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent. Now, it's hard to out-spend Congress, but he tried to for the last three years.
\
``Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they're upper-income people? Yes. But look what's happened to the middle class. ... The tax burden on them has not gone down. It has gone up. I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector. The answer is to invest and grow this economy.'' BUSH: ``I think everybody's paying too much taxes. He refers to one tax increase. Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it. And I said I made a mistake. If I make a mistake, I admit it. That's quite different than some.
\
``Then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill. Yes, I did. And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress. We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates - who remembers that? They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15. We don't want to go back to that.''
\
CLINTON'S ARKANSAS
\
BUSH: ``The record in Arkansas. I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have? He says Arkansas is a poor state. They are. But in almost every category they're lagging.
\
``He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or two years. Over the last 10 years since he's been governor, they're 30% of the national average. On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.
\
``You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective. And I'm going to do that. It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.
\
``What's his mistake? Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard - environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.''
\
CLINTON: ``Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year. First.''
\
BUSH: ``This year.''
\
CLINTON: ``Fourth in manufacturing jobs, fourth in the reduction of poverty, fourth in income increase. Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average. Over the last five years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average. We are second in tax burden, the second lowest tax burden.
\
``We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country. We're low-spending, low tax burden. We dramatically increased investment, and our jobs are growing. I wish America had that kind of record, and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.'' PEROT: ``I grew up five blocks from Arkansas. Let's put it in perspective. It's a beautiful state. It's a fairly rural state. It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.
\
``So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small. It's irrelevant. ... I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart. That's not true.''
\
CLINTON: ``The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all; they think it's highly relevant, and they wish the rest of the country had them.''
\
BUSH: ``Gov. Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment - he has to do it, that is the law. I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress.
\
``What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people. I want the line-item veto.''
\
BUSH'S LEADERSHIP
\
BUSH: ``I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities. I'm for enterprise zones. I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress. And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.
\
``I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that. I've been speaking out since day one. We've gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation. And yes, it took me to veto two civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas. And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.
\
MODERATOR JIM LEHRER: ``(Does) it have be a crisis before it gets your attention?''
\
BUSH: ``I don't think that's true at all. I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.''
\
PEROT: ``I will let the American people decide that. I would rather not critique the two candidates.''
\
CLINTON: ``The only thing I would say is on the economy: Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise with Congress.
\
``I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again ... and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues. ... They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.'' BUSH: ``You're overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term. But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the United States Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.
\
``You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover. Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%. The misery index - unemployment and inflation added together, it was invented by the Democrats - went right through the roof. We've cut it in half.
\
``Remember the question, are you better off? Well, is a home buyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down? Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings? I think they are. Is the guy out of work better off? Of course he's not, but he's not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Gov. Clinton says, invest in more government.''
\
PEROT'S COMMITMENT
\
LEHRER: ``You had a problem (when on the board of General Motors). You took your $750 million and you left. You (quit the race for president in July). Does that say anything relevant to how you would function as president?''
\
PEROT: ``I think the General Motors thing is very relevant. I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong. They just wouldn't do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems.
\
``At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares. I sold them my remaining shares. They went their way. I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.
\
``But let's take my life in perspective. Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course. When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed. And I had five small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for three years.
\
``Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset. Then when I had two people imprisoned in Iran; I could have left them there. I could have rationalized it. We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.
\
``Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded. And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.
\
``Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again. But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.
\
``And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the two parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. I put my wallet on the table for you and your children. Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to lead the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.''

``There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base. Balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt.''
\
RAISING TAXES
\
CLINTON: ``I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan.
\
``And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't. And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle-class tax relief.''
\
BUSH: ``I think everybody's paying too much taxes. He refers to one tax increase. Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it. And I said I made a mistake. If I make a mistake, I admit it. That's quite different than some.
\
``Then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill. Yes, I did. And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress. We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates - who remembers that? They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15. We don't want to go back to that.''
\
READING LIPS
\
BUSH (on the 1990 tax increase): ``I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak. I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling `read my lips,' and I did it because I thought it was right. And I made a mistake. That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you. That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning. I thought it would be better for the country than it was.''
\
PEROT: ``101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do. Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly. Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised. That's absolutely unconscionable. Both parties carry a huge blame on their shoulders.
\
``This was not a way to pay down the deficit. This was a trick on the American people. That's not leadership.'' CNN'S SUSAN ROOK: ``Gov. Clinton, will you make a pledge tonight (not to raise taxes on incomes below $200,000?)''
\
CLINTON: ``Now, I'll tell you this. I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs. If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.
\
``Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you `read my lips' on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country. And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.
\
``I think even he has learned you can't say `read my lips' because you can't know what emergencies might come up. But I can tell you this. I'm not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs I've recommended. Read my plan.
\
``And you know how you can trust me about that? In the first debate, Mr. Bush (made news by saying James Baker) is gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.
\
``Well, I'll make some news in the third debate. The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton. I'm gonna make those decisions, and I won't raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.''
\
BUSH: ``That's what worries me. ... that he's going to be responsible. He's going to do for the United States what he's done to Arkansas. We do not want to be the lowest of the low. We are not a nation in decline.''
\
CLINTON'S ARKANSAS
\
BUSH: ``The record in Arkansas. I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have? He says Arkansas is a poor state. They are. But in almost every category they're lagging.
\
``He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or two years. Over the last 10 years since he's been governor, they're 30% of the national average. On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.
\
``What's his mistake? Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard - environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.''
\
CLINTON: ``Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year. First.
\
``Fourth in manufacturing jobs, fourth in the reduction of poverty, fourth in income increase. Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average. Over the last five years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average. We are second in tax burden, the second lowest tax burden.
\
``We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country. We're low-spending, low tax burden. We dramatically increased investment, and our jobs are growing. I wish America had that kind of record, and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.''
\
Later, ``We're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction. And I have to defend the honor of my state.''
\
PEROT: ``I grew up five blocks from Arkansas. Let's put it in perspective. It's a beautiful state. It's a fairly rural state. It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.
\
``So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small. It's irrelevant. ... I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart. That's not true.'' CLINTON: ``The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all.''
\
BUSH: ``Gov. Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment - he has to do it, that is the law. I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress.
\
``What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people. I want the line-item veto.''
\
BUSH AND IRAQ
\
PEROT: ``We told (Saddam Hussein) that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th. I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table. They're not the secrets to the nuclear bomb.
\
``We told (Saddam) he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts. And if we didn't tell him that, why won't we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?''
\
BUSH: ``I've got to reply on that. That gets to the national honor. We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.''
\
PEROT: ``Well, where are the papers?''
\
BUSH: ``That is absolutely absurd.''
\
PEROT: ``Where are the papers?''
\
BUSH: ``Glaspie has testified and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the United States Senate. Please, let's be factual.''
\
PEROT: ``Talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate. They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie. And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.''
\
CLINTON: ``Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word - he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait. And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield. It was a remarkable event.
\
``But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made. In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran. ... The responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.''
\
BUSH: ``Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight. We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the fourth largest army. All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that. And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand.
\
``And what you're seeing on all this Iraqgate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks and try to do a little revisionism. And I cannot let that stand.''
\
PEROT'S COMMITMENT
\
MODERATOR JIM LEHRER: ``You had a problem (when on the board of General Motors). You took your $750 million and you left. You (quit the race for president in July). Does that say anything relevant to how you would function as president?''
\
PEROT: ``I think the General Motors thing is very relevant. I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong. They just wouldn't do it.
\
``At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares. I sold them my remaining shares. They went their way. I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.
\
``But let's take my life in perspective. Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course. When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed. And I had five small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem.
\
``Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset. Then when I had two people imprisoned in Iran; I could have left them there. I could have rationalized it. We went over, we got them out.
\
``Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded. And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.
\
``In terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.
\
``And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the two parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. I put my wallet on the table for you and your children. Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to lead the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.''

236," Dominion power company wants to build two new generating facilities in Virginia, one coal-fired, the other nuclear, and both bad ideas. The 585-megawatt coal plant would reside in Wise County and cost about $1.6 billon, while the 1,520-megawatt nuclear unit will expand the North Anna complex in Louisa County, northwest of Richmond, costing at least $3 billion. History suggests that the cost of each plant will rise significantly during construction, and the price tags do not include the cost of fuel and maintenance, nor the very real cost to our environment posed by their operations.\ The coal plant will convert scenic mountain tops into global warming carbon dioxide, toxic mercury and other air pollutants. In the short 50-year-or-so life span of the nuclear plant, tons of high- and low-level radioactive wastes will accumulate. The high-level waste will remain dangerous for 100,000 years or more, and no safe way exists to store it for that time.\ How will Dominion plan to pay for the cost of these plants? It won't. We citizens of Virginia will pay through a combination of increased rate charges and tax revenue transferred to the corporation. And generations to come will continue to pay with reduced life spans, chronic illnesses and a ravaged environment.\ Is there a viable and sustainable alternative to expanding coal and nuclear production to meet projected peak energy demands? Yes, our houses, condominiums, apartment buildings and places of work possess the potential to support nonpolluting solar and wind energy. And we can significantly reduce the demand for electricity by common- sense conservation measures (fluorescent lighting, more insulation, etc.).\ Installation of a 1-kilowatt solar-powered photovoltaic system on the roof of a house costs about $9,000, and less if you do some of the work yourself. In our area that system will easily produce 4 kilowatt hours per day. Rather than storing the captured energy in expensive batteries, net-metering systems ""sell"" any excess home- generated electricity back to the power company. This system will reduce the need for electricity from the grid (and your bill) by at least 16 percent for a ""typical"" home, and up to 50 percent for a very efficient house.\ Suppose Dominion took the $5 billion it will surely spend on capital costs for the coal and nuclear plants, and used it instead to install photovoltaic units on 555,555 homes and businesses (there are about 2.4 million homes in Virginia). That would produce about 2.2 megawatt hours per day, without air pollution, greenhouse gases, despoiled land, dangerous radioactive waste or any charge for fuel.\ It would also provide employment for local building trades without developing more land. Better yet, Dominion could split the costs with home- and business-owners, providing low-interest loans, and enable almost every structure in the state with a southern exposure to produce clean energy. Dominion could also reduce the price of solar by bulk purchases of the hardware, creating economies of scale.\ The home-grown solar won't add up to the 2,000 megawatts of additional capacity from the proposed coal and nuclear plants. But does Virginia really need that much electricity? I think not.\ Investing in efficiency and upgrading building codes could eliminate the projected need for more electricity production. We should no longer accept the inevitability of increased population growth and land development. Let's instead focus on improving the energy efficiency and livability of our communities and preserving what remains of the natural world.\ If you want information on how to add solar power to your house, you won't find much help at Dominion's Web site. But if you live in California you could get step-by-step directions by visiting the Pacific Gas and Electric Company's home page.\ The responsibility of regulating Dominion ultimately rests with Virginia's elected officials and federal entities. In its effort to influence the regulators, the Dominion PAC has contributed $2.2 million to Republican and $2.1 million to Democratic candidates in Virginia since 1996.\ Cuker, who lives in Hampton, is a professor of marine and environmental science at Hampton University."
237,"""Solar energy is democratized energy and the most efficient way to generate energy is to generate it at the place you are using it.""\Dr. Anthony Smith\CEO of Secure Futures\""There will be a gradual transition to renewable technologies, and I believe in 50 years things will look much different.""\Dr. Jonathan Miles\director, Virginia Center for Wind Energy at James Madison University\It was a grass-roots movement. Neighbors, farmers and small business owners banded together to bring the new technology to their communities. Cooperatives formed to pool their cash to purchase equipment and services. The result? More than 75 years ago light bulbs starting coming on in homes around Augusta County. In a few years rural electrification went from an impossible dream to an everyday reality. Today, proponents of renewable energy technology, from photovoltaic solar panels to electricity generating windmills, say that model is how they see wind and solar power coming to the Shenandoah Valley.\The local players\""There's a movement sweeping the state that's home-grown and community-based where people are coming together to not only bring down the cost of renewable energy, but also to share knowledge and overcome some of the technical barriers,"" said Dr. Anthony Smith, CEO of Secure Futures, a Staunton-based renewable energy company.\In Augusta County a community group called Solarize Augusta is working to make solar power more accessible to area residents, following the lead of similar organizations in Harrisonburg and around the state.\""In the 1930s people said that rural electrification wasn't feasible, but then the New Deal came along and within a decade nearly every home in the U.S. had electricity,"" noted Sandy Greene, a Mount Sidney resident and leader of Solarize Augusta. ""We want to maximize the use of solar in the area, and we feel that it will have to be individuals that choose solar, because corporations and utilities just can't make that decision. Look how fast light bulb technology changed. In just years we went from incandescent to compact florescent and now LEDs.""\At the turn of the century large cities around the U.S. shimmered at night with the glow of electric lights, but the big urban utilities didn't believe that extending the power grid into rural areas made economic sense. Today utilities are slowly adopting renewable technology as part of their energy portfolios.\""At Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative (SVEC) we engage in an 'all of the above' approach to where we get our energy from,"" said Michael Aulgur, vice president of external affairs at SVEC.\SVEC is a distributor for power that is supplied by Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC). ODEC has contracts to ensure that about 7 percent of its power comes from renewable sources, including hydroelectric and wind.\Dominion Power has two renewable solar projects in the works in the state, a solar field in Remington scheduled to produce 200 megawatts and go online in October 2016 and a 500-megawatt solar field scheduled to be operational in 2020 at a location yet undecided. Such a field would comprise approximately 9 million solar panels spread out over 9 and a half square miles.\About 2 percent of the electricity Dominion distributes comes from renewable sources. The company has committed to getting 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2025.\The potential for renewable energy is high in Virginia.\""Every hour the sunlight is hitting the earth makes enough energy to power the needs of all the humans on the earth for one year. We just need to figure out how to harvest it better,"" Greene said. ""Virginia gets as much solar radiation as Miami. Renewable energy has much potential in the Valley, it just takes individuals to get things started.""\According to Dr. Jonathan Miles, the director for the Virginia Center for Wind Energy at James Madison University, Virginia is ""average"" for a U.S. state when it comes to wind resources. In 2012, Augusta County approved a lease for Charlottesville-based Apex Energy to place 20 to 30 wind turbines on a site at the county landfill. After a two-year study that included assistance from the Center for Wind Energy it was determined that the site was not suited for a wind turbine installation. According to Kevin Chandler, a public relations manager at Apex, ""That project was set aside after studies found the site lacked a suitable wind resource for a commercial project.""\""As utility costs go up and technology improves it's possible that in the future that site would become feasible,"" Miles said.\There are no utility-scale wind farms in Virginia. An Apex project in Botetourt County is scheduled to begin construction in 2017.\""We believe the state has a bright clean energy future. Virginia has a largely untapped wind and solar resource, and one need look no further than our neighboring states for examples of successful economic development from these technologies,"" said Chandler. ""These technologies are proven and cost-effective ways to diversify Virginia's energy portfolio while creating new jobs.""\Sun doesn't always shine, wind doesn't always blow\While solar panels and wind turbines are becoming more popular at homes around the Valley, using these technologies to produce utility-scale power has its challenges.\""The challenge with renewable energy is that it's intermittent,"" said Rob Richardson, a senior communications specialist with Dominion Energy. ""The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow. We're focused on making sure we provide reliable electricity to our 2.5 million customers every hour of every day.""\The other challenge is cost. While renewable energy advocates believe that it will be possible to produce renewable energy as cheaply as fossil fuels, the present reality is that renewable sources currently cost more. From a utility's perspective it's hard to move power generation toward renewable sources if customers aren't willing to pay for it.\""Do we have consumers who tell us they are interested in renewables? Yes. When we ask if they are willing to pay more for it, they say 'no,'"" Aulgur said.\As proof, he cites SVEC's Renewable Energy Option program, which allows customers to ensure that their electricity comes from renewable sources for an extra $0.015 per kilowatt/hour, an amount that would raise the average home electric bill less than $20 a month.\""For us, it's about passing along the actual costs and sending a true price signal to our consumers about the services we provide,"" Aulgur said.\SVEC has less than 35 of its nearly 100,000 customers participating in this program, despite what Aulgur said was an active campaign to promote the option.\Dominion also has an optional renewable energy purchase program, known as ""Green Power."" At $0.013 per kilowatt/hour Dominion estimates that it will cost their average residential customer an extra $0.43 per day. It has about 28,000 customers who participate in the program, or about 1 percent of its total of 2.5 million.\State law requires utility companies to tie private power generation devices back into the grid in a process known as ""net metering."" The energy an individual produces offsets the energy used from the local utility. SVEC has 167 net metering customers or less than 0.2 percent of its total. Dominion has more than 1,000 net metering customers, or about 0.04 percent of its customer base.\While local residents who have connected their renewable energy technology to the grid say their utility companies have been helpful and supportive, many believe that power companies have too much invested in fossil-fuel power generation to make the transition to more renewable energy sources.\""The potential for solar is huge in Virginia, but largely untapped because of public policy and utility barriers,"" Smith said.\""To have the attitude that we won't change anything and just keep burning fossil fuels until they're all gone isn't going to work,"" said Greene, who uses the 26 solar panels installed at her home to provide her total electric usage, including charging an electric car and lawn mower. ""Fossil fuels seem like the cheapest and the easiest way for utilities to make power, but they won't last.""\Experts like Miles believe the tipping point will be economics. As the price of fossil fuels rise and the cost of renewable technology drops, adopting wind and solar power generation becomes more cost-effective for individuals and utilities.\""We will be depending on fossil fuels for years to come, at least for another generation,"" Miles said. ""There will be a gradual transition to renewable technologies, and I believe in 50 years things will look much different.""\Meeting in the middle\Like rural electrification individuals, small businesses, churches and educational institutions are leading the way. In 2011, Washington and Lee University in Lexington installed solar panels that produce about three percent of the electricity the school consumes. They were followed by other schools, churches, businesses and government agencies around the Valley.\These institutions have been able to buy into renewable power with the help of Secure Futures. Secure Futures' business model makes it possible for these institutions to buy in to solar by securing funding for the project and then charging the institution a below-market rate for the electricity it provides. ""We finance, build, operate and maintain solar arrays,"" said Smith. ""It allows these institutions, at no capital costs and no maintenance costs, to have clean, renewable energy at lower cost than what utilities provide. Solar energy is democratized energy and the most efficient way to generate energy is to generate it at the place you are using it.""\According to Smith, by the end of 2016 Secure Futures plans to have 50 megawatts of solar energy production under contract, about a tenth of the capacity of the average coal-fired power plant.\""There's a growing demand for solar across the region, not only because there is a growing awareness of the technology, but because we have reduced some of the barriers to obtaining it,"" Smith said. ""I see renewable energy progressing in both directions, both from the big utilities down and from the community-level up, and hopefully they will meet in the middle.""\Companies like Apex use private investment to develop and construct renewable energy facilities and then sell the power they create to utilities, electric cooperatives or large-scale businesses.\""Recent advancements in wind and solar technology offer Virginia a chance to compete with our neighboring states, which are already benefiting from wind and solar technologies,"" Chandler said. ""Our hope is that we can help our home state develop more of its wind potential through properly sited and responsibly developed projects.""\While utility-scale renewable power crawls forward at a snail's pace, groups like Solarize Augusta are taking a grass-roots cooperative approach. Using a model that has been successful in other areas of the state the group is currently signing up members to purchase solar installations as a group price. Greene said that members can expect to save 15 to 25 percent over going out and hiring a contractor on their own. Eighty local residents have signed up and the process is open through the end of the month. They put out requests for bids and have chosen local company Sigora Solar of Waynesboro to install the solar panels.\Another key component is governmental support. Over the years, federal and state tax credits have made renewable technology more affordable. In 2011 the city of Harrisonburg passed an ordinance that exempted solar installations from taxes.\""What renewable can benefit from most is a consistent government policy,"" Miles said. ""The intermittent nature of tax credits has introduced an uncertainty into the market that has kept individuals and businesses from investing in it.""\What would a future of renewable energy look like in Augusta County? The solar panels required to generate enough power for the area's nearly 120,000 residents would cover three square miles or about the area of 1,500 football fields. It would take nearly 150 wind turbines to satisfy the county's energy needs.\How accepting would the local community be of a large renewable energy projects in their own backyard? Residents of Botetourt County are suing the local government over ordinances that will allow for a wind farm proposed by Apex. Tazewell County authorities have proposed an ordinance to classify wind turbines as an undesirable industry in response to a proposed Dominion Wind farm.\In the future will those passing through Augusta County on the interstate notice vast fields of black panels pointed towards the sun or see a skyline dotted with the slowly spinning blades of large wind turbines? It's hard to say, but one thing is for certain. You can expect for some solar panels to appear on a rooftop in your neighborhood and the occasional wind tower to silhouette the horizon behind a home or farm as a bottom-up renewable revolution silently takes hold in the Valley.\staff illustration by merry eccles/thinkstock/the newsleader\""Solar energy is democratized energy and the most efficient way to generate energy is to generate it at the place you are using it.""\Dr. Anthony Smith\CEO of Secure Futures\""There will be a gradual transition to renewable technologies, and I believe in 50 years things will look much different.""\Dr. Jonathan Miles\director, Virginia Center for Wind Energy at James Madison University\Getting renewable\Staunton, Waynesboro and Augusta County residents interested in learning more about the possibilities of adding solar power to their home or business can contact the Solarize Augusta cooperative about the technical and legal requirements of purchasing solar technology in our area:\https://www.facebook.com\/solarizeaugusta\More information on using wind power can be found on the Web site of the Virginia Center for Wind Energy, including the document ""Is a Wind Turbine Right for Me?"":\http://wind.jmu.edu/\Both Dominion Power and Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative (SVEC) offer voluntary pricing programs that allow their customers to opt to pay extra to support the production of renewable energy.\SVEC offers the Renewable Energy Option, known as ""Rider R"" and costs customers an additional 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour they use.

If enough people did that Dominion would not have to start standby generators and perhaps they wouldn't have to upgrade the transmission lines.\Can the home owner charge Dominion for the power we fed back into the grid?\Virginia lawmakers keep saying that they are in favor of alternative energy but I guess it should not come from the ""little"" guys. Only the big moneyed powers can do alternative energy?

A corporation that sells a product for profit will do anything possible (particularly if uncontrolled) to prevent competition.\Incredibly, I once imagined that infinitely available free and untaxable sunlight would be exploited for the good of humanity and the environment with full governmental encouragement. But obviously not if a corporation can make money from it. You don't have to sell or tax sunlight - just penalize anyone who tries to use it.\Your otherwise admirably thorough coverage fails in one vital way (as such stories are wont to do). It does not specifically identify by name for consumer/voters the politicians/legislators/bureaucrats who allowed/caused this travesty to occur.\Jeffersonian wannabes love to rant on about ""least government equals best government,"" but they know full well that their corporate employers can only maximize profits if uncontrolled. In short, there must be real regulation and control of corporations and banks by legislators and bureaucrats not in the pay or thrall of the banks and corporations being regulated.\John W.Dayton\Hallieford"
239,"Perhaps it was the new solar installation at the University of Richmond, perhaps it was one of the thousands of homeowners in the U.S. installing solar panels. Sometime in the last two months, a critical milestone occurred for renewable energy in the United States: Our nation saw its one-millionth solar power installation. And experts say it will take only another two years to double that number.\Solar power has grown exponentially in the last several years. The U.S. now has enough solar capacity to power 5.4 million homes. What made this milestone possible? Why will it seem modest in just a few years' time? And, perhaps more importantly, when will Virginia finally jump wholeheartedly on the solar bandwagon? \It's not as if the sun just started to shine. Enough sunlight hits Virginia to supply our energy needs with solar power many, many times over. The reason we've seen an exponential growth in solar power in recent years is the trifecta of public policies, public-private partnerships and plummeting costs. \Pollution-free, with no fuel costs and the allure of energy independence, solar power has long enjoyed broad public support. As a result, policymakers at all levels of government have enacted policies to level the playing field for solar so that it can begin to replace polluting fossil fuels. Virginia, however, is lagging behind. \The 10 states with the best solar policies also account for the vast majority of the solar electricity capacity installed. And it's not just sunny California; our neighbor North Carolina also tops the list. These states account for only 26 percent of the U.S. population but 86 percent of the nation's total installed solar electricity capacity. \Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have clean energy requirements, many with particular incentives for solar power. Since 2006, federal officials have offered tax incentives for solar installations. Policies to enable solar panel owners to connect and sell excess power back to the electric grid in these states have played a role as well. Last year, Gov. Terry McAuliffe announced a goal for Virginia to get at least 8 percent of the power for state buildings from solar. \But, there are more policies that stand in the way. A recent report from the Center for Biological Diversity gave Virginia an ""F"" as one of the sunniest states in the nation with policies that actually block the development of distributed solar power. The report cites Virginia's lack of a mandatory renewable standard, its weak net metering standard and its unclear legality for third-party ownership. \However, despite these challenges, more and more Virginia consumers are going solar every year. Thanks to technological innovations and strong demand, solar is being deployed more widely than ever before, and the costs are falling in turn. Dozens of local communities and governments have taken action by launching Solarize bulk-purchasing programs to help make solar more cost effective and easier to install. And innovators are working constantly to make solar power more efficient. Prices have plummeted 73 percent in the last decade -- and more than 99 percent in the last four decades. Even without subsidies, solar power is beginning to compete with conventional fuels in some areas. \That's why solar capacity will likely double in another two years. Yet even then, the clean energy source will still represent only 2 percent of the nation's energy use -- a far cry from its potential. A new study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, for example, shows that rooftop solar alone could supply 40 percent of our nation's electricity needs. \That's why we still need strong public policy to fully tap into the power of the sun. Two percent solar falls far short of what's needed to slow global warming. We must swiftly and steadily transition entirely off fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. \The Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, which sets state-by-state limits on carbon pollution from coal and gas power plants, provides an opportunity for Virginia to expand the market for solar power. The rule provides additional incentives for states to accelerate the development of solar energy and Virginia could easily meet its Clean Power Plan goals with a plan that doubles down on energy efficiency and solar power alone. \We're celebrating one million solar installations, but there's no time to rest on this major milestone. To keep up and accelerate the pace of solar, we're working to ensure commitments from Virginia's elected officials to embrace bold goals for solar power, to remove the barriers to solar in Virginia and to promote a strong Clean Power Plan that promotes solar energy. \Let's make sure Virginia plays a bigger part in the next million solar strong. \Bucci is the state director of Environment Virginia, a statewide, citizen-based advocacy organization working for a cleaner, greener and healthier future."
240,"This year, Max Buzard began thinking about the wind.\From his waterfront home on Chesapeake Avenue, where a brisk breeze is a near-constant thing, the civil engineer began contemplating how to use the wind for power.\Now Buzard and his wife, Regina, own a 33-foot-tall wind turbine that they've affectionately dubbed the ""Windy I.""\In the process, they've joined a growing number of people and businesses trying to reduce their dependence on the power company. By Max Buzard's estimates, his turbine will save about $790 a year on electricity for his 3,000-square-foot-house.\The project likely won't pay for itself for about 13 years, but Buzard said it was about more than money - it helps the environment.\Buzard estimates that the turbine - which went up in mid-July - will generate 400 to 600 kilowatts a month, which could reduce his use of utility-generated power 20 percent to 30 percent.\The U.S. Energy Department estimates that a small wind-energy system, depending on the wind resource and size of your home, can lower an electricity bill 50 percent to 90 percent.\""Sure, it reduces your electricity bill, but in one small way, there are less greenhouse gases,"" Buzard said.\""We still need other conventional energy sources like coal-fired plants - that's not going to go away - but if everyone tried to do something, it would help.

""\Hampton's first known residential wind turbine also is an advertisement of sorts for Buzard's wife's company, which he manages.\Royer Technical Services is a small Hampton-based engineering and design company that's been doing contract work, including marine construction, for clients such as the Navy and Jefferson Lab for the past 10 years.\Now the Buzards hope to install Windys across the state.\Their company is putting up a second residential turbine - the Windy II - at a new home in Isle of Wight County.\Buzard said he was negotiating with clients in Mathews County and on Grandview Island in Hampton.\And he's been in contact with people from Charlottesville to the Eastern Shore.\Interest in wind turbines has seemingly increased along with the cost of energy.\Wind farms - where turbines can reach 400 feet tall - have popped up across the country.\This week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed putting windmills on city bridges and rooftops as part of a push for alternate energy.\Last year, the state approved Virginia's first commercial wind farm in Highland County, near the border with West Virginia - a state where more wind-energy farms have been proposed.\Dominion Virginia Power is getting more inquiries from individuals wanting to put up their own windmills, though it's still uncommon, spokesman David Botkins said.\""There's beginning to be an uptick because of an increased interest in energy efficiency and conservation - whether it's homeowners switching to compact fluorescent lightbulbs or weatherizing their houses, or turning their thermostats down in the winter and up in the summer,"" Botkins said.\About 60 customers are enrolled in or exploring Dominion's Net Metering program, where excess generated power - from wind and solar - is credited to the homeowner's account to offset future use, Botkins said.\The first such system was installed in Virginia in 2002.\More recently, increased interest in wind power has prompted Virginia Beach and Suffolk to consider wind turbine regulations.\Hampton officials said the Buzards' windmill would prompt more discussion.\""It's something we recognize as something we need to look at in our ordinance,"" said Joe Dunford, Hampton's chief codes inspector.\Buzard said he encountered two kinds of people interested in the wind turbines: Some want to cut their rising electrical costs - Dominion recently raised its rates 18 percent - while others just want to go more ""green.""\""They want to do the right thing,"" Buzard said.\It's not cheap. The Buzards' company will install the turbines - typically 33 or 50 feet high - for $17,000 to $18,000, which includes the unit, all permits and construction.\The Buzards' own three-spoked turbine - brand name Skystream - is on the water side of the vacant lot next to their Chesapeake Avenue home, which overlooks Hampton Roads.\As the Buzards began putting up the turbine, they talked to their neighbors and asked them to sign a paper saying they were on board.\All were, they said.\Common complaints about wind turbines elsewhere have included the noise, as well as worries about the effects on birds.\From the ground, the sound of the wind turbine at first resembles the buzz of a mosquito, but then it blends in with other sounds: waves lapping at nearby seawalls, flags waving in the air, a lawn mower cutting grass.\It takes an 8 mph wind to get the 6-foot-long blades turning; the average windspeed at their house is about 12 mph but can be higher. The faster the turbine spins, the less noise it makes.\The Buzards said they planned to landscape around the base of their turbine to improve the aesthetics.\They haven't seen any signs that birds are running into the sky-blue spokes.\And to them, the sound - they joke that ""Windy's singing"" - is magical because it means energy is being created.\About wind power in Hampton Roads\* Height of the wind turbine on Chesapeake Avenue: 33 feet\* Average windspeed:\12 mph\* Reduction in use of utility electricity: 20 percent\to 30 percent\* Time it'll take to recoup initial expense:\13 years\* For more information about wind systems, visit windenergy.com and click on ""About Small Wind"" in the right bar.\* For more information about Dominion Virginia Power's Net Monitoring program, call 804-755-5040."
241,"It was Girl Scouts who led DeLevay Miner of Hampton to carry a picket sign outside the Dominion Virginia Power office in Richmond on Thursday.\""I have a Girl Scout troop, and we're working on a badge about the environment,"" Miner, a 54-year-old substitute teacher, said in a phone interview from the picket line. ""And because I don't know a whole lot, I had to do a little bit of research."" \That research taught her the role that fossil fuels play in climate change and sea level rise, she said, and ""I just got involved."" \Miner is part of a ""Week of Action"" that began Monday and is set to conclude Saturday, staging daily rallies outside Dominion's office. Environmental organizers also made an appearance during Wednesday's cocktail hour outside the Governor's Energy Conference. \About 30 protesters showed up Thursday to focus on sea level rise, which is of particular concern to coastal areas. U.S. Geological Survey scientists announced earlier this year that since 1990 the sea level has risen in Hampton Roads faster than anywhere else in the world. \It was findings like this that prompted 36-year-old physicist Gianluigi ""Gigi"" Ciovati to use a vacation day at his job at Jefferson Lab in Newport News to head to Richmond, too. \""If we're going to continue relying on fossil fuels, the problem is only going to get worse,"" Ciovati said. \Organizers also intend to shine a spotlight on the role energy companies like Dominion play in setting energy policy through campaign contributions and lobbying, and on a $76 million incentive Dominion stands to receive under the state's Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard, or RPS. \Environmentalists call it a ""$76 million rip-off"" because Dominion is eligible to receive a bonus for meeting renewable energy standards while failing to put ""one electron on the grid from wind or solar,"" said Glen Besa of the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club. \Dominion qualifies under the RPS, said Tom Cormons of Appalachian Voices, ""by buying renewable energy credits from generators who are mainly out of state, and they're mainly generating electricity through hydroelectric plants built before World War II."" \Organizers want lawmakers to strengthen the RPS to encourage real growth in solar, wind and other green energy. \""(RPS) was passed in order to create incentives to get new renewable energy built in Virginia,"" said Beth Kemler, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. ""And instead it turns out that Dominion and other utilities are able to get these huge bonuses for little more than filling out paperwork."" \Dominion is the largest electric utility in Virginia. According to spokesman David Botkins, it operates one of the largest renewable energy power stations in the country. The Pittsylvania Power Station burns waste wood to generate electricity, and three coal-fired power stations are being converted to waste wood fuel. The conversions will double its output from renewable biomass by the end of 2013, he said. \The company is seeking approval to lease commercial store rooftops to install solar panels, Botkins said, and worked with more than 600 customers to help them sell renewable energy from their solar, wind and water-powered facilities to Dominion. \The company wants to build a wind farm along a ridge in Tazewell County, he said, but has been blocked by a tower height ordinance. \Lawmakers established the RPS in 2007 to offer financial rewards to utility companies that choose to bring renewable energy online. \According to the State Corporation Commission, or SCC, Dominion qualifies. \In 2010, the agency found Dominion has a ""reasonable expectation"" of achieving 12 percent of its base year electric energy sales from renewable sources during 2022, and 15 percent during 2025. \Botkins said the $76 million is a two-year figure and has not been collected nor received. It's still up to the SCC to award it. \But, Botkins said, ""we're legally entitled to it."" \For meeting RPS criteria, he explained, the company is entitled by the terms of the program to receive half of 1 percent toward its return on equity. \""There is no rate increase as it relates to the RPS standard,"" Botkins said. ""The RPS hasn't cost our customers anything. Dominion Virginia Power's base rates are frozen until the end of 2013; after that, the RPS is just one of many factors to be considered by the SCC in rate setting during the biennial rate review."" \State law allows Dominion to recover, if it chooses, projected and actual costs of meeting future RPS goals through special surcharges. But it must prove those costs are ""reasonable and prudent,"" according to the SCC. \More than two dozen states, including neighboring Maryland, require electric utilities to include a set amount of renewables in their energy mix, Kemler said. Virginia lawmakers chose to make it an option. \Today, she said, there is no utility-scale wind or solar generation in the commonwealth."
242,"Bank on solar power\Utility companies are notorious for fluctuating electricity prices. This can be a burden for families with large households especially during hot summer months. The upside is that there is great potential for investments in clean energy savings through solar generation. The steadily growing solar industry reaps endless economic benefits for both homeowners and the job market - much of which is due to its reliability. No only is solar sustainable, but it's also a renewable, unlimited and free source of energy.\Environment Virginia's new solar energy report revealed that, ""Virginia comes in at 39th in solar capacity per capita, with 23 megawatts installed across the state in 2015."" Virginia is among the eight states that have adopted voluntary Renewable Portfolio Standard goals. The commonwealth has set a very low RPS goal to generate 15 percent of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2025. This is one of the least ambitious goals among the 37 states that have RPS standards.\Luckily, the Obama administration is working hard to ensure that Americans have options to for a better tomorrow. The administration has already begun to tackle climate change and energy solutions at the federal level through the Clean Power Plan. Statistics show that the majority of Americans support policies that curb climate change and protect public health. We urge continued support for clean energy policy that stimulates economic growth and sustainable job opportunities for Americans.\Mariah Davis\Richmond\Inflated fears\So the Chesapeake Bay generates huge amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas! Amazing. Who knew that ""Saving the Bay"" was an evil plot of climate-change-denying Republicans determined to raise the sea levels and fry the planet?\But if you do the research, it has been known for many years that benthic bacteria contribute way more to any greenhouse gas effect (good for preventing ice ages) than puny mankind ever has. Not to mention volcanoes and other things. Man-made climate change is a hoax perpetrated on the ignorant - which includes an awful lot of soi-disant scientists.\Brooks A. Mick, M.D.\Col. Army (Ret.)\Yorktown\Helping hands\On a recent weekend, while driving across the James River Bridge from Hampton to New Carrollton, my driver's side tire blew. I managed to limp off the bridge but was barely off the road onto a narrow shoulder. A very nice gentleman and his son noticed my situation and stopped. They advised me and guided me to a much safer pull-off I couldn't see about 100 yards away.\I just wanted to thank them again and let readers know there are exceptionally nice people in the world. Especially now when racial difficulties occupy our attention so much.\Bill Fitzgerald\Hampton\Better care for vets\As a retired U.S. Army officer and a 20-plus year user of Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities, I have seen the growing demand for increased access to services. Despite good efforts at the state and federal level, much more needs to be done to ensure our veterans have greater access to the very best health care we can provide and in a timely manner. A proposed rule change would provide veterans with direct access to nurse practitioners who can perform to the full extent of their education, training and certification.\Nurse practitioners currently provide a full range of services to our veterans in the VA health facilities. Studies have indicated this care is equal to the care of their physician counterparts. Allowing more independence for nurse practitioners would increase veteran access to health care, particularly in medically underserved areas, as well as decrease the wait times for patient appointments.\In almost half the nation, nurse practitioners can practice to the full extent of their education, training and certification without clinical supervision or mandatory collaboration of physicians. Implementation of this rule would expand access to high-quality health care and improve the VA's capacity to provide timely, effective and efficient care. This proposal also would provide the VA with flexibility to fully utilize all providers within the health care team and maximize the effective use of existing resources.\It is the duty of a grateful nation to provide the very best health care to our nation's warriors. The proposal by Veterans Affairs to allow nurse practitioners to practice to the full extent of their education, training and certification is a common sense approach to ensure that veterans can get the care they need.\Bill Flanagan\Colonial Heights"
243,"Staff Writer \WEYERS CAVE - A tractor-trailer en route to Massachusetts slammed onto its side about 6:30 a.m. Thursday on I-81 just north of the Augusta County line. The rig came to a stop across both lanes of northbound I-81, dumping less than 10 gallons of a potentially hazardous white liquid onto the roadway. \Hazmat members from Augusta County Fire Company were called to contain the spill and determine its risk to travelers on I-81 and residents in surrounding communities. \By 8:30 a.m., emergency workers said the liquid posed no threat to people or the environment. \""It was a very small runoff and a very high viscosity of liquid,"" said Augusta Fire Chief Ron Garber. \The driver, Michael S. Hardin, 43, left Knoxville, Tenn., several hours before reaching the Augusta County line. \Ken Evans of Stoneville, N.C., was driving a tractor-trailer in the left lane behind the Hardin's truck. \""We had just passed the RPS truck,"" he said, pointing down the gradual slope to the curve behind him. ""He swerved off the road. When he got in the ditch; you could see he was fighting it."" \When Hardin's rig returned to the pavement, he lost control and the truck flipped onto its side, throwing its load against the roof of the trailer. Two barrels containing the water-based adhesive Glasstack partially ripped through and began leaking onto the road. \Evans said he slowed his tractor-trailer as soon as he saw Hardin's truck swerve and stopped just before hitting the fallen truck. He and other truck drivers went to help Hardin, who had pulled himself from the truck's cab. \Virginia State Police Trooper D.P. Cappuzzo said Hardin's nose was broken, and he had other head injuries. He was conscious and told Cappuzzo he did not remember how fast he was going. \""I think fatigue was a causing factor,"" Cappuzzo said. \Hector Santos of Fort Worth, Texas, parked his double-trailer rig on the right shoulder of I-81 and talked with Evans for several hours before their trucks could be moved. They speculated about Hardin's options. \""The best thing for him to do would have been to let it lay out on the grass,"" Santos said. ""When you have hazardous materials, it's the best thing to do."" \""But your natural instinct takes hold,"" Evans said. \Santos nodded his head. ""He's right. It's your natural instinct to get it back on the road."" \According to his travel log, Hardin's load weighed 29,281 pounds and filled about half of the trailer. The load also included barrels of latex paint, which leaked inside the trailer, adding hours to the clean-up process. \Garber estimated that 20 firefighters from Augusta County and Bridgewater companies with two fire engines and a hazmat vehicle were on the scene. Rescue workers came from the Grottoes Rescue Squad, Staunton Augusta Rescue Squad and Bridgewater Rescue. \Hardin was taken to Rockingham Memorial Hospital where he was stabilized and moved to the University of Virginia Medical Center. He was listed in good condition Thursday night. \Cappuzzo charged Hardin with reckless driving. He estimated damage to the truck at @$!15,000 to the load. \Interstate Traffic Blocked \Traffic in both directions of I-81 was shut down at about 7:15 a.m. Thursday while hazmat members determined the safety of a tractor trailer spill. \n The southbound lanes were reopened to traffic at 8:30 a.m. \n I-81 northbound was cleared and reopened just after 10:35 p.m. \A Friday A1 story in The Daily News Leader about the tractor-trailer wreck on I-81 should have included Weyers Cave Fire Department as one of the responders.\LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 1A"

245,"RICHMOND - Virginia lawmakers killed a proposal that would allow some special education students another year of instruction because of the struggles of virtual learning caused by COVID-19.\House Bill 2277 proposed that high school students with special needs who are set to graduate in the 2021 school year and who are 22 years old after Sept. 30, 2020, be allowed to take an extra year and graduate in 2022. Students who are younger than 22 are automatically eligible for another year, according to the Virginia Department of Education.\""While other students might have more time to make up whatever was lost because of COVID-19, the kids that were going to age out this year will never get that chance,"" said Del. Robert Bell, R-Charlottesville.\Virginia students with disabilities age out of the school system at 22 years old, according to the VDOE. Those 22 and older are dependent on the bill if they want to attend another year of high school.\Each student with disabilities in Virginia develops an Individualized Education Program, or IEP, throughout their education. The VDOE provides tips for helping parents and teachers navigate a student's IEP amid virtual learning. Tips include practicing communication skills, hands-on, non-digital activities and documenting progress for a teacher's review.\Special education students have had a difficult time thriving in the virtual learning environment, Bell said during the bill's subcommittee meeting. He said the final year of school is crucial to prepare special needs students for post high school life.\""It is heartbreaking to think what those kids are going to have to do to manage,"" Bell said.\The legislation didn't make it past crossover day, when bills must pass the chamber in which they originated. \""The bill is simple,"" Bell told legislators during the bill's hearing. ""It's not easy, but it's simple.""\Bell said he introduced the measure because he has a personal attachment to special education. His 18-year-old son attends the Virginia Institute of Autism in Charlottesville. \Bell said he wants the change to be made, whether through this legislation or another method. \""If for some reason it's easier or better to do it, just through the budget that's fine too,"" Bell said.\Bell said he was not surprised the bill didn't pass because of how much money it would cost to implement. The bill's passage would require an additional 1,000 students to be served, which would cost $5 million during the 2022 fiscal year, according to the legislation's impact statement. \Bell introduced an amendment to the state budget that adds $5 million to public education. The money would provide free public education as deemed by the Individuals with Disabilities Act. The proposed budget for state education assistance in 2022 is $7.8 billion.\""I'm hopeful that they will see this as a priority,"" Bell said. \The bill passed out of committee, but it died in appropriations. \There are almost 168,000 students with disabilities currently enrolled in Virginia public schools, according to the VDOE. In the 2019-2020 school year, 84 students with disabilities were over the age of 22, according to the VDOE. A total of $12,111 is spent per public school student each year, VDOE stated on its website.\Renesha Parks, director of exceptional education at Richmond Public Schools, said HB 2277 has pros and cons. \""I do feel that because of their age, they probably should be with age-appropriate peers,"" Parks said.\Park said students would benefit from working with community partners instead of continuing in high school. The success of these students depends on public schools connecting them with resources as they enter adulthood, she said.\RPS works with Resources for Independent Living, the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services and the Virginia Commonwealth University Autism Center for Excellence, the VCU Center on Transition Innovation and SOAR365, Parks said. \The organizations offer a variety of services, including working with adults to set up plans for higher education, job training, employment and independent living."
