0,"Spin Control\State law calls for Washington to reduce carbon pollution in the coming decades. It sets standards for how much, and how soon. It doesn't say how though.\To fill in that blank, lawmakers this session have what might be described as a shotgun approach to pollution reduction. They have introduced an array of proposals for new fuel standards, incentives, taxes or fees.\Into this mix, the Senate Environment, Energy and Technology Committee last week considered a ""cap-and-trade"" system that would set up requirements for some large businesses and utilities to limit and gradually reduce their carbon emissions with new technologies or programs, or to pay others for the reductions they've achieved.\If that sounds vaguely familiar, it's probably because versions of a cap-and-trade system have been introduced in previous years, but never passed. The hearing showed it remains controversial.\One common complaint is that it's complicated. The Association of Washington Business questioned whether there was enough time left in the legislative session, scheduled to end April 28, for an in-depth discussion on the cap-and-trade proposal, spokesman Peter Godlewski said. Maybe lawmakers should study it after the session ended, and come back next year, he suggested.\One of the group's concerns was higher costs to businesses could lead to ""leakage"" - moving jobs to other states to avoid those costs, he said.\The Legislature worked on a carbon tax bill for two years that tried to address the leakage issue, Sen. Guy Palumbo, D-Maltby, said. Did the AWB support that bill when it was introduced?\Before his time with the organization, Godlewski said. He'd have to check.\""I'll answer it for you. They didn't,"" Palumbo said. Legislators, it should be noted, have long memories for people who vote against things they like.\Kaiser Aluminum also worried about leakage of jobs from its Spokane Valley rolling mill to places outside Washington where aluminum is processed. It could support a cap-and-trade system if the mill was granted an allowance as an operation that has large emissions, but faces foreign competition, something known as EITE for emissions intensive trade-exposed, spokesman Kyle England said. Aluminum mills aren't specifically mentioned as EITEs in the bill, and there's a lack of clarity on the allowances, he added.\Dan Wilson, of the United Steelworkers, which represents 900 Kaiser workers in the Valley, also made a pitch for a permanent EITE designation. The mill makes products with a lower ""carbon footprint"" than plants elsewhere, he added, so leaking those jobs to other mills would be bad for the environment.\Committee Chairman Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, said the bill doesn't name companies but sets up a process for the Ecology Department to determine EITE. ""It's not that we're not including you,"" he said, they're trying to do it in ""a responsible policy way.""\The oil industry was divided on the proposal.\It lacks transparency, consumer protections and certainty for business, said Dan Coyne, a spokesman for Phillips 66, which has a refinery in Ferndale. If the Legislature does pass a plan to limit carbon pollution, the company favors a well-designed carbon tax over cap-and-trade, he said. It would be more transparent, provide certainty to businesses, and keep revenue in the state.\""I think we're all impressed with Phillips 66's new religion on carbon tax,"" Carlyle said.\Last year, Phillips 66 gave $7.2 million to the $31.5 million campaign against Initiative 1631, which opponents denounced as a carbon tax.\Oil producer BP, another major donor to the campaign against I-1631, supports the cap-and-trade bill. Bob Allendorfer, the manager of its Cherry Point refinery, said the company believes it could bring an effective carbon-pricing program to the state, reducing emissions and be applied consistently across the state, he said.\The Washington Farm Bureau is against just about any type of carbon-pricing mechanism, spokesman Tom Davis said. Buses and Priuses are fine for people in Seattle, he said, but you need a pickup truck on the farm, and raising the price of gasoline or diesel is going to raise the price of production.\Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Auburn, said he was worried the Legislature has so many carbon reduction ideas that several will pass and add so many taxes and fees on fuel, that will raise the cost of everything that needs fuel to be made, powered or transported.\What about the higher cost of health care and a degraded environment if they don't reduce carbon pollution, countered Sen. Joe Nguyen, D-White Center.\The committee has yet to vote on the proposal but the hearing showed one thing about carbon is as true in politics as chemistry: It can be a great source of heat.\Contact the writer:\(360) 664-2598\jimc@spokesman.com"
1,"OLYMPIA - The Washington State Senate passed Thursday two controversial climate proposals that aim to reduce carbon emissions in the state: a ""cap-and-trade"" bill and a clean fuel standard.\Both bills have been proposed by Democrats and Gov. Jay Inslee for years, but neither has made its way through the Legislature. They're both pieces of what Senate Democrats call a ""grand bargain,"" which ties proposals that reduce carbon emissions to a transportation revenue package that funds new highways, roads and green energy initiatives.\The cap-and-trade bill, which passed 25-24 after a six-hour debate on more than 40 amendments, would put a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and force companies who cannot meet that cap to purchase carbon allowances from the state.\Four Democrats voted against the bill.\Bill sponsor Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, said the proposal is ""good economics and good environmental policy."" It looks at effects of carbon on the environment, as well as the effects on people most harmed by climate change, he said.\""It is a profoundly serious endeavor that this legislation embarks on,"" Carlyle said on the floor.\It would put a cap on emissions from large polluters by 2023. Companies who cannot meet the cap can purchase carbon allowances from the state. The revenue from those allowances would fund projects resulting in ""long-term environmental benefit and increased resiliency to the impacts of climate change,"" according to the bill.\Supporters say it will provide cleaner air across the state by reducing carbon emissions from the largest polluters in the state while generating some revenue for the state to spend on projects that could improve the environment.\Supporters also say it would invest in programs that would help those disproportionately affected by climate change, including people of color and low-income earners.\Opponents say the bill could result in working families paying more for fuel, electricity or food. Large corporations, they say, could find ways to avoid paying large fees.\""There is not a single person today in the state of Washington who will not be affected,"" said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.\An amendment proposed by Braun would have implemented a carbon pollution tax instead of the cap-and-trade program. It would have started with a $15 tax per metric ton of greenhouse gas emissions on the sale or use of fossil fuels in the state.\Republicans said this amendment would have broader support from business and corporations, but Democrats said the tax would not be enough.\Tax reform should be on the table, Carlyle said, but a carbon tax alone would not effectively reduce carbon.\""This is a climate bill, not a tax bill,"" Senate Majority Leader Marko Liias said.\Opponents also argued it has negative effects on manufacturing and farms, which could see loss of jobs or increasing costs. Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, said the proposal could have harmful effects on farms in Eastern Washington because it could drive up costs for many small farmers who use a lot of fuel.\Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, criticized the passage of the bill in a statement, saying farmers in the state use large amounts of fuel to produce crops and move them to market or ports.\""Farmers and growers are price takers, not price setters, which means they'll be hurt by higher fuel prices,"" he said. ""This bill will be very bad for ag, no question about it.""\The clean fuels standard bill passed 27-20 after a late-night debate. It aims to use progressively cleaner transportation fuels in the state, including those used in cars, trucks, boats, trains and aircraft.\If enacted, it would reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuel by 20% by 2035, according to the bill. To do so, the bill would incentivize the creation of alternative fuels in the state and penalize producers of transportation fuels that don't meet the standards.\Similar to the cap-and-trade bill, opponents say it would result in an increase in gas prices. Supporters say that in California and Oregon, which also enacted these standards, those price hikes didn't happen.\Inslee has tried to introduce both proposals for years, but they have never received enough support in the Legislature. He told reporters Thursday both the cap-and-trade and the clean fuel standard proposals would bring Washington in line with the rest of the West Coast.\""We need climate action this year,"" he said. ""We can't run or hide from it. We have to defeat it.""\Senate Democrats are trying to keep both the clean fuels standard and the cap-and-trade proposals tied to a new transportation package.\Last week, the Senate Ways and Means Committee attached an amendment to the clean fuels standard bill that requires at least $500 million more every two years for transportation before the new standard could go into effect.\That new funding could come from a new transportation package, written by Sen. Steve Hobbs, D-Lake Stevens. His plan looks to spend $17.8 billion over the next 16 years on new investments in highways, roads and green energy initiatives. To do so, it uses some money from the cap-and-trade bill, as well as a 9.8 cent gas-tax increase and other taxes and fees.\For Spokane, that package could mean finally funding the long-awaited Division Street Bus Rapid Transit system. The proposal currently has $50 million set aside for the project for the next 16 years.\But that package only passes if both the cap-and-trade and low carbon fuels standard proposals do. While they've now passed the Senate, they might not be as lucky in the House, where leaders have already indicated it could be too late in the game for such a large package to pass.\The last day of the session is April 25, just over two weeks away.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com.\SIDEBAR:\BILL INFORMATION\Senate Bill 5126 passed the state Senate 25-24.

2,"OLYMPIA - A ""cap-and-trade"" proposal passed the state House of Representatives on Friday, one of two climate bills Democrats hope to push through before the end of session Sunday.\The proposal passed 54-43 and heads back to the Senate, which must concur on changes in the next two days.\A cap-and-trade program in Washington would apply to the largest polluters in the state. It would set a cap on emissions that polluters would have to meet by 2023. If large polluters could not clean up their work to meet the cap, they would have to purchase allowances from the state.\""It's not too late for us to get this right,"" Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, said on the floor.\The state would then receive the revenue generated from those allowances, which it would use to improve the environment and invest in programs to help those disproportionately affected by climate change, including people of color and low-income earners.\Republican amendments debated on Friday would have allowed the revenue from the bill to be used to fund the working families tax credit, which provides rebates for low-income families. The proposal passed the Legislature years ago but was never funded. Democrats have said the rebate would finally be funded with the general fund in the upcoming budgets, so there is no need for the cap-and-trade revenue to be used for it.\Instead, the revenue should be prioritized to help those suffering the most from environmental pollution, Democrats said.\Rep. Debra Lekanoff, D-Bow, said the bill is needed to help tribal communities across the state. The only Native American member of the Legislature, Lekanoff said federally recognized tribes are ""fighting for their lives"" because of pollution.\""Today the people's House will right the wrong of 150 years of living in a pollution-based economy,"" she said.\Democrats said it is long overdue for the state to address climate change.\""It is unconscionable that we have failed to take action on climate change for this long,"" said Rep. Alex Ramel, D-Bellingham.\Opponents said the program would raise prices for the average Washington resident paying for fuel, electricity or food.\Rep. Mary Dye, R-Pomeroy, called the bill ""a trifecta of taxes embedded within an environmental policy, and it's bad news for the people of Washington state.""\An amendment added in the House would require approval of a 5-cent gas tax increase - likely part of other legislation - before the cap-and-trade program could start. Linking climate policy to new transportation revenue to pay for roads, highways and infrastructure is what Democrats call a ""grand bargain,"" which has been the subject of disagreement among lawmakers.\The idea would be to invest in new infrastructure while simultaneously cleaning the air, Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane, has said.\Two climate proposals, the cap-and-trade plan and a low carbon fuel standard, and their connection to a revenue package have been the subject of debate in the final days of the session.\Passing two major climate proposals and a new multibillion dollar transportation package is getting less and less likely.\Negotiations around a low carbon fuel standard are ongoing. Both chambers are trying to reach an agreement on the plan, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuel by 20% by 2035.\For now, a proposed transportation revenue package doesn't seem like it will pass this session, but lawmakers have indicated they're willing to work on it after session ends and call themselves back into special session when an agreement is met.\The climate proposals have been priorities for Gov. Jay Inslee since he took office. He has pushed lawmakers to pass climate change action this session.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com.\SIDEBAR:\HOW THEY VOTED\Senate Bill 5126 passed the state House of Representatives 54-43 Spokane-area Democrats Timm Ormsby and Marcus Riccelli voted in favor while Republicans Rob Chase, Mary Dye, Jenny Graham, Joel Kretz, Jacquelin Maycumber, Bob McCaslin, Joe Schmick and Mike Volz voted against it.\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"

Deep recessions and multi-billion-dollar budget deficits usually arent good news for Mother Earth.
\
Thats the situation in Olympia this year, where conservation groups have set modest goals, hoping to pass a few environmental bills and hold onto precious budget dollars dedicated to protecting the states land, water and air.
\
The biggest environmental win of the 2011 Legislature happened Thursday, on the eve of Earth Day, when a bill that will phase out operation of the states only coal-fired electrical plant by 2025 cleared its final legislative hurdle and headed for Gov. Chris Gregoires desk.
\
The measure requires Canadian company TransAlta to phase out its 1,460-megawatt Centralia coal plant in stages between 2020 and 2025. Supporters say the timeline allows for an orderly transition for plant workers and the local community and provides an opportunity to replace power from the Northwests largest coal-fired plant with energy efficient and clean resources such as wind and solar.
\
This is a win-win-win for our health, the environment, our economy and the Lewis County community, said Doug Howell, director of the Coal-Free Future for Washington campaign. This legislation the result of environmentalists, labor unions, health experts, faith leaders, the local community, the corporation, the governor and legislators all working together will drastically reduce the harm to human health and our environment from coal pollution.
\
It was good news for conservationists, though they had hoped to win a phase-out of coal by 2020. And it may help restore the states tarnished image as a national leader in addressing climate change.
\
Effort lags
\
The political climate was different in 2007, when Gregoire announced a strategy to reduce Washingtons greenhouse gas emissions in stages beginning in 2020. Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, introduced the first cap-and-trade bill in the Legislature that year, two weeks after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared that evidence of global warming was now unequivocal and that human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, was a major cause.
\
In February, the Department of Ecology announced that it wont meet its first state-mandated target, to reduce the states greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The main reason, the agency said, is the collapse of both regional and national efforts to establish a cap-and-trade system mandating reductions of greenhouse gases by major polluting industries.
\
I think that the states progress needs to be put in the context of the national situation, where we have been outspent and outmaneuvered by the coal and oil industries to set back our progress, said Kathleen Ridihalgh of the Sierra Club.
\
The timeline for a phaseout of the TransAlta plant, the states largest emitter of greenhouse gases, will bring us closer to where we hope to be, she said. Its one significant step, she said, but theres much more work to be done, especially in the transportation sector, where the goals of increasing mass transit use, promoting clean-fuel cars and reducing vehicle miles traveled touch on the individual day-to-day decisions of Washington residents.
\
Were demonstrating that it is possible to move away from fossil fuels to clean energy in a way that is good for everyone, said Eric de Place of the Sightline Institute, a progressive Seattle think tank. But theres a somewhat alarming postscript, he said active proposals to establish coal export facilities in Longview and Blaine that would send huge volumes of coal to China.
\
If we ship 50 million tons of coal to China, thats roughly 10 times as much coal as is burned at Centralia, de Place said. It would be terrific if the governor would say something definitive about Washingtons role in the global coal economy. My biggest disappointment is that the state has failed to take a really serious and comprehensive approach to climate change in general. ... What Washington lacks is strong political leadership on climate policy.
\
Some victories
\
This year, lawmakers in Olympia, preoccupied with cutting more than $5 billion from the 2011-13 state budget, have had little time to focus on environmental issues.
\
Everything was overshadowed by the budget, Ridihalgh said.
\
Yet there have been wins along with the losses.
\
Of four top legislative priorities set by a coalition of environmental groups this year, two the TransAlta initiative and a measure to ban the use of phosphate fertilizers on golf course greens and lawns succeeded.
\
Last week, the governor signed a bill banning the use of turf builder fertilizers on those manicured landscapes. The ban applies only to mature lands, said Neil Beaver of the Lands Council in Spokane, who lobbied for the measure. Healthy mature lawns have plenty of phosphorus. New plants require phosphorus to produce fruits and vegetables. Farmers and gardeners can continue to purchase the product as before.
\
Nonetheless, the measure was opposed by nearly every agriculture organization, even though farmers were completely exempt, Beaver said, as well as by a handful of golf course managers. The manufacturer of Scotts Turf Builder supported the bill, he said, because they are phasing the product out by 2012, anyway.
\
Excess phosphorus runs off lawns into streams, where it can trigger algae blooms and damage fish habitat. When Michigan passed a similar measure, Beaver said, it saw a 28 percent reduction in phosphorus runoff.
\
Another success story happened Thursday, when the Legislature enacted a first-in-the-nation ban on toxic coal tar sealants. When applied to pavement, these sealants, which contain high levels of suspected carcinogens, leave a residue that is responsible for polluting stormwater runoff and contaminating lakes and waterways.
\
Bird-dogging the budget
\
One goal that is still a work in progress is to make sure core environmental protections already in place programs that protect the health of our air and water and make sure that our toxic sites are cleaned up, said Kerry McHugh of the Washington Environmental Council are adequately funded in the next two-year budget cycle.
\
We were really pleased that the Legislature maintained the Model Toxics Control Act, McHugh said. It funds environmental cleanup projects across the state for contaminated projects. It also creates jobs.
\
Over the past few years, about $250 million has been diverted from the fund and used for other purposes, she said. But no money was taken out this year, and thats a good thing. We know the legislature had a really challenging budget, and to a degree they did the best they could with targeted cuts. The problem is, environmental protections have been cut so far that any future cuts push things to the breaking point.
\
With agency budgets cut to the bone, conservationists also are concerned that proposals to fund programs like forest practices enforcement with new fees will result in less enforcement.
\
What industry is saying is, Well pay more fees, but that means protections need to be rolled back, McHugh said. We cant support fees that reduce protection. But if the fee bills dont pass, that means there will be fewer people on the ground making sure logging operations are carried out in a safe way.
\
Conservationists are prepared to accept deep cuts in the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Program, which pays for grants to help local governments buy land valuable for wildlife habitat and recreation. In the past, the popular program has been funded at $100 million per biennium. This year the House budget allocates $50 million, the Senate just $20 million. Those numbers will have to be reconciled in the Legislatures special session.
\
Maybe next year
\
Other bills failed to make it out of the Legislature by the deadline for policy bills. They include:
\
* A childrens safe products bill that would have required Washington manufacturers to look for safer chemicals to use in toys and other childrens products.
\
Earlier legislation banned the use of lead, cadmium and plastic softening agents called phthalates, Laurie Valeriano of the Washington Toxics Coalition said. But the Department of Ecology has identified a list of additional chemicals that also are potentially hazardous to children, including formaldehyde and certain solvents and flame retardants.
\
This was a very rational next step in the process of moving companies toward safer alternatives, Valeriano said. Obviously, it was hugely challenging because of the budget occupying a huge amount of time. And with this issue, a lot of new members needed a lot of education. People needed more time to figure it out.
\
* A Clean Water Jobs Act, which proposed to address toxic stormwater runoff into rivers, lakes and coastal waters and create jobs by imposing a new fee on hazardous substances to pay for stormwater control facilities. Oil refineries, which would have been most affected by the fee, lobbied against it.
\
McHugh said the bills failure was not a total defeat. The House included $46 million and the Senate included $50 million for toxic stormwater runoff, she said. Our bill would have raised $100 million from a new fee.
\
We think that to really address clean water issues, we need a sustained and significant new funding source, she added. Right now, there is just not the money to address the scale of the problem.

4,"The decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to classify greenhouse gases as ""pollutants"" subject to the Clean Air Act effectively ends the government's resistance to putting a price on heat-trapping emissions that exacerbate global warming. This time, the nation must take this seriously, because the EPA now has the authority to act if Congress does not. This means the nation needs a comprehensive strategy that melds energy and environmental concerns.\Previous efforts have suffered from quick power outages. Propelled by the OPEC-led oil shocks of the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter took to the airwaves and implored the nation to conserve energy and explore alternative fuel sources. But the cardigan sweater and dour message were extinguished by ridicule. Then oil prices dropped, and the nation shifted back into no-problem mode. In 1993, President Bill Clinton introduced the idea of a BTU tax on energy sources based on the amount of heat they generated (as measured by British thermal units). This was the first instance of acknowledging the environmental price of our traditional energy sources. But the idea couldn't generate enough backing.\Now, the nation has no choice, but it does have better options than turning this over to EPA regulators. The Clean Air Act was not written with greenhouse gases in mind. The nation needs a regulatory regime that takes the best ideas from wide-ranging interests based on today's realities. The EPA is not known for its cost-benefit analyses, but that's exactly what we need. Killing emissions is easy. Killing them while maintaining a healthy economy is not.\The most popular bill in Congress proposes a complicated ""cap-and-trade"" system, which would set a limit on emissions for smokestack industries and then allocate permits to pollute that would be bought and sold. Another bill, by U.S. Rep. John Larson, a moderate Democrat from Connecticut, would impose a carbon tax. It states up front what the cost will be. This definitive price signal would be the basis of subsequent business decisions and consumer choices. This bill is the underdog, because of truth in labeling: It is a tax.\But so is cap-and-trade, because the costs will be passed along to consumers. In hiding that fact, cap-and-trade would be a more complicated system that could be gamed by insiders and contorted by powerful interests. A growing number of lawmakers are beginning to see this, including U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's energy subcommittee. She prefers a cap-and-dividend system, whereby industry is charged for pollution credits and dividends are distributed to consumers to help offset increased energy costs.\The best system would probably be a straight carbon tax, which would quickly give rise to investment in energy alternatives. It would be important to take the proceeds and pour them into alternative energy research, development and production, which includes wind, solar, nuclear, a high-tech grid and energy storage. As new technology kicks in, the tax could be lowered.\Whatever the course, we cannot laugh off or ignore the problem any longer. The nation needs a plan."

This crosswalk near Clark College on Fort Vancouver Way is solar-powered and uses energy-efficient light-emitting diodes, part of the city of Vancouver's effort to reduce energy consumption while also reducing the amount of greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere.
\
The city of Vancouver has measured its contribution to the greenhouse gases warming the globe, partly out of concern for a potential planetary crisis and partly to stay a step ahead of regulatory requirements.
\
The bottom line: City operations last year spewed the equivalent of 41,013 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
\
While that's a sliver of the estimated 85 to 90 million metric tons emitted statewide - which, in itself, is only 0.3 percent of worldwide emissions - city officials believe it's in their interest to get ahead of future requirements.
\
The city last year commissioned Good Company of Eugene, Ore., to conduct a two-phase study examining the carbon footprint of city government operations and the community as a whole. The company finished the first phase late last week.
\
""We need more cities like Vancouver to take a leadership role and do a really good and thorough study of the carbon footprint,"" said Joshua Skov, principal of the seven-year-old company-
\
The company next will estimate the carbon footprint of the community as a whole, including all public and private sector emissions within Vancouver's city limits. The $35,000 study is expected to be finished in July.
\
The first phase revealed the city's vehicle fleet to be the biggest carbon culprit among the activities over which the city exercises the most direct control. City vehicles emitted about 4,600 metric tons in 2007.
\
Electricity used in the operation of city government totals 7,666 metric tons annually.
\
City officials said the results weren't surprising, but it does provide a baseline to prioritize and measure future reductions. They said it also prepares Vancouver for future reporting requirements under a state climate-change law that passed last year.
\
With the U.S. Senate taking up debate over a national cap-and-trade system, city officials said they believe they are staying ahead of the game.
\
""No matter who the president is, all of them have stated that they want to do something on climate change and they expect to regulate (carbon emissions),"" said Mike Piper, the city's sustainability coordinator.
\
Yet, the city has the least control over what is by far its biggest single source of emissions: carbon emissions embodied within the purchase of goods and services. The estimated emissions within those products - everything from building materials to copy paper - totals 22,085 metric tons, almost three times the next biggest source.
\
The study identified about 13,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from construction in 2007. Piper said Vancouver ultimately may adopt a strategy that adjusts its purchasing decisions accordingly.
\
""In construction, we can strive for more 'green' building supplies,"" he said. ""That's where we're really going to see our opportunities.""

6,"Two events this week just might usher in an era where a balanced, pragmatic approach to energy and environmental issues replaces long-standing acrimony and uncertainty.\First the Obama administration announced plans to open up offshore areas for the possible drilling of oil. Though the West Coast was not included, large regions in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Coast would be available for exploration. Republican criticism of the plan was muted, which passes for high praise in the polarizing political climate that has paralyzed energy issues for a long time. Environmentalists were more upset, saying that short-term profits will not solve long-standing issues surrounding dependence on foreign oil and global warming.\In actuality, it isn't clear how much oil is available in the Atlantic, says energy historian Daniel Yergin, because the latest estimates are decades old and exploratory technology wasn't as advanced. This is more ""drill, maybe, drill"" than ""drill, baby, drill.""\As for global warming, the production of sufficient alternative sources of energy is far into the future. In the meantime, the United States will need petroleum, and the less we have to depend on volatile regions like the Middle East the better.\The administration issued another ruling this week that should please environmentalists. Ending 30 years of wrangling, the feds announced greenhouse emissions standards for automobiles and light trucks, the first time greenhouse gases have been regulated under the Clean Air Act.\By 2016, the fuel economy average for new vehicles will be 35.5 miles per gallon, because the process of limiting emissions also yields more efficiency. This will raise the price of the average 2016 car by $1,000, but drivers could recoup as much as $3,000 in fuel savings over the life of a vehicle. Officials estimate that this will reduce greenhouse emissions by 30 percent between 2012 and 2016.\Because this is a national standard, states such as Washington and California can park their ""clean-car"" initiatives for the time being. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers praised this approach, noting that a patchwork of varying standards posed difficulties for auto engineers.\Left unanswered is what to do about the greenhouse gas emissions of utilities and other large industries. Few experts believe it's best for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to impose rules, and the agency recently noted that it would not do so for at least the rest of the year. Cap-and-trade bills and other efforts to put a price on carbon have stalled in Congress.\Nonetheless, the decisions this week show that the key to progress on energy and environmental issues is to steer a middle course. It's about time."

The 2009 Legislature is proving unfriendly to bold environmental initiatives.
\
Washington environmental groups set their sights this year on winning passage of legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions, promote super-efficient energy use in buildings, spur transit-friendly development and pay for the cleanup of the states waters through a tax on petroleum refiners.
\
Gov. Chris Gregoires own environmental agenda includes legislation to reduce Washingtons contribution to global warming through a regulatory cap and a bill to raise energy efficiency standards in the state building code by 30 percent over time.
\
But halfway through the session, the fate of most of these bills remains clouded, and Washingtons reputation as a national leader on climate change could hang in the balance.
\
A Senate committee gutted the heart of Gregoires cap-and-trade bill, making participation by businesses voluntary.
\
A bill that would have phased in tougher energy efficiency standards for buildings was amended to delay its implementation until 2031 and take away local governments authority to pay for incentives for energy conservation through new bonding authority.
\
A bill that proposed to add a climate change goal to the Growth Management Act was weakened and now carries no consequences for local governments that fail to plan for compact, transit-friendly development.
\
This is a tough session for everyone and I dont think the environment is any exception, said Kerry McHugh of the Washington Environmental Council. With lawmakers focused on a projected $8 billion budget deficit, she said, Theres not a lot of oxygen.
\
Bar lowered
\
The Legislature also appears poised to weaken the law implementing voter-approved Initiative 937, which requires utilities to get 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020.
\
Senate Bill 5840, prime-sponsored by Sen. Chris Marr, D-Spokane, clearly dismantles I-937, said Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver. It literally adds so many things to the allowable energy sources that it renders the standards meaningless.
\
Marrs bill, awaiting action in the Senate, would cap the renewable energy requirement at a lower level, allow utilities to grandfather in existing energy sources such as biomass and small hydropower projects, and permit them to substitute energy conservation for acquiring new renewable sources such as solar and wind power.
\
Those changes would effectively cancel out the laws renewable energy standard, according to the Northwest Energy Coalition, which opposes Marrs bill.
\
Clark Public Utilities testified in favor of the changes. But Port of Vancouver Executive Director Larry Paulson urged a legislative committee in January to avoid diluting Initiative 937, noting that wind energy development has been a boon to the port.

Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounds proposed climate change legislation.
\
Washington is one of seven states and four Canadian provinces that signed on to the Western Climate Initiative, which in 2007 set a regional goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.
\
To date, only California has passed legislation to implement the initiative through a cap-and-trade system. Under such a system, companies would initially buy permits from the government to emit carbon dioxide. Companies would trade the permits among themselves or elect to install pollution controls. The number of permits would be reduced each year.
\
Cap and invest, a variation favored by Pridemore and many environmental groups, would invest revenue from the permits in green energy and do away with permit trading.
\
The governors bill, Senate Bill 5735, originally required major industries to limit the greenhouse gases they emit beginning in 2012, with details on the trade of emissions to be worked out later.
\
It was amended in the Senate Environment, Water and Energy Committee and now directs the Department of Ecology to design voluntary emission targets and a voluntary emissions registry and report back to the Legislature.
\
Republican lawmakers warned that a cap-and-trade system would result in unemployment and higher utility bills at a time when the state is bleeding jobs. The powerful Association of Washington Business also opposed the legislation.
\
Its an economy-killer, said Sen. Jerome Delvin, R-Richland, also a member of the Climate Advisory Team. Our small businesses can barely keep their doors open now. Jobs are hanging by a thread.
\
Pridemore, vice chairman of the committee, declined to add his name to the bills list of sponsors. He doesnt expect to see a bill to implement the Western Climate Initiative this year.
\
Becky Kelley of the Washington Environmental Council said she isnt giving up.
\
The Senate bill and a separate House bill are very much works in progress, Kelley said. I know the governor remains very committed to moving forward with action on climate change this year.
\
Obama focus
\
Some opponents of climate change legislation have suggested that the states step back and let the Obama administration take the lead on climate change legislation. President Obamas budget, released last week, envisions raising $79 billion by 2012 through a cap-and-trade program in which companies pay to emit carbon dioxide.
\
Kelley thinks the new administrations focus makes it even more important for the state to act.
\
It is now looking much more real that there will be a cap and trade program, she said. Washington, with its agricultural industries, its forests and its abundant hydropower, needs to play a role in developing that program by endorsing the Western Climate Initiative, she said.
\
We have a lot to gain by helping to shape a federal program, and potentially a lot to lose by not being at the table, Kelley said. Increasingly the shape of the conversation is, What can we do to move forward in reducing our emissions and building our clean energy economy, and how can we influence this ongoing regional national debate about cap and trade? I think this is going to be a live conversation through the end of session.

While the game isnt over yet in the 2015 Washington Legislature, Gov. Jay Inslee couldnt help but glance at the scoreboard last week. Using the occasion of Wednesdays Earth Day recognition to assess the work of lawmakers thus far, Inslee said, Its been an absolute goose egg when it comes to doing anything for the environment.So true. The governors cap-and-trade proposal, which would charge industrial polluters for the carbon they release into the environment, has been bottled up in committees; his desired low-carbon fuel standard has been scuttled by a poison pill from the Legislature; and stricter safety standards for oil-bearing trains have yet to be approved. Thus far, the recommendations from a 21-person panel Inslee convened last year to study ways to reduce emissions have been summarily ignored by lawmakers, and the odds are that the man who desires to be known as The Green Governor might be shut out this time around.Which leads us to expand upon the sports metaphor. Because while Inslee is losing this contest, like a coach in the playoffs he knows that this is a series rather than one game. Inslees approach, while he might not articulate it this way, is focused upon winning the war rather than a single battle. Its really unfortunate that it came to be seen, by some people at least, through a partisan political lens, Inslee told The New York Times for a profile this month. But I do think the ice is breaking.That, for Inslee, is the salient point. In putting forth his cap-and-trade proposal, he was fully aware that new ideas can require time to take root. As Bill Arthur of the Sierra Club told The New York Times, Jay has always had a clear eye on the bulls-eye, the goal hes trying to achieve, and also an understanding of what he has to do to get there. Hes smart and savvy enough to know, Ive also got to speak in a language and speak in terms that can resonate with a larger contingent of people. Inslee attempted that by earmarking projected revenue from the cap-and-trade program for education and transportation rather than climate or energy projects. To which state Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, said: Its just not something that could not work in our state. Were doing very well (on carbon emissions); that makes it a very tough sell.The selling, however, will continue. If not in this years special session of the Legislature, then in the regular session next year and the year after that, or at least as long as Inslee is governor.But in selling his proposals, Inslee must work to win the hearts and the minds of the public. Environmentally friendly policies inherently draw vehement disagreement on both sides of the issue, and Republicans are quick to say that cap-and-trade policies would harm businesses, or that low-carbon fuel standards would cause a spike in gas prices.There is room for robust debate on the policies and for lessons to be learned from other states, primarily California, that have adopted similar policies. Because of that, Inslee must continue to take the long-term view of his desired goals and eschew the notion of imposing fuel standards or other actions by executive order, as critics have suggested he is planning to do.Inslees desire to reduce Washingtons carbon emissions, to do everything within the states power to combat climate change, and to provide environmental protections will require public support, even if unanimity is an unrealistic goal. In the end, the people will determine the final score.

\
Gov. Chris Gregoire's attempt to push Washington to the forefront of climate-change regulation appears dead -- mortally wounded in the state Legislature by fears it could hurt the economy and be vulnerable to rip-offs.
\
Both the state House and Senate have balked at adopting the so-called ""cap-and-trade"" system that would have forced industries to cut greenhouse-gas emissions to fall below a cap or buy extra permits in something resembling a stock market.
\
While a climate-change bill passed in the Senate and is headed for the House, it bears little resemblance to the comprehensive legislation Gregoire unveiled at a January news conference.
\
Gone is the mandatory program regulating pollution from big factories, electric utilities and fuel such as gasoline. In its place, state agencies are supposed to come back to the 2011 Legislature with a menu of approaches for regulating greenhouse gases.
\
""I think it's safe to say that we will not be implementing, this year, a cap-and-trade program,"" said Rep. Dave Upthegrove, D-Des Moines, the legislation's prime sponsor in the House. ""I couldn't even get the trading part out of my own committee.""
\
It marks a win for major Washington businesses and a setback for environmentalists and Gregoire, who had made the legislation a top environmental priority. It's also the clearest sign that, amid a crumbling economy, environmentalists face a tougher audience in the Legislature this year.
\
""Our goal is to get out alive,"" said Clifford Traisman, a lobbyist for the Washington Environmental Council.
\
Environmentalists also are trying to fight off changes to a 2007 voter-approved initiative requiring utilities to invest in new renewable energy. A push to encourage high-density development around transit centers has failed to pass the House or Senate. A move to tax oil to pay for better stormwater protection is still uncertain.
\
When it comes to climate change, ""absent the governor pulling a rabbit out of the hat, cap-and-trade is dead as a doornail,"" Traisman said.
\
A top Gregoire official signaled the administration isn't pushing for a state-level cap-and-trade program at this point, in the face of opposition in the Legislature and signs the Obama administration will push Congress to adopt a nationwide cap-and-trade system.
\
""What we are interested in is a bill that's a climate-change bill, as opposed to a cap-and-trade bill,"" said Jay Manning, director of the state Ecology Department.
\
He said he hopes lawmakers will authorize Gregoire to continue working on regional and national programs to regulate greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and tell Ecology to write a more detailed state cap-and-trade plan to bring back to a future Legislature.
\
House Speaker Frank Chopp, D-Seattle, said many fellow Democrats voiced concern about the economic toll new regulations could take on businesses already shaken by the recession. He also has heard doubts about a market for pollution permits.
\
""With what's happened in the last year, one would wonder about the wisdom of the markets,"" Chopp said. ""Remember energy deregulation? Well, that didn't turn out so well.""
\
Republicans also oppose the measure -- even the watered-down Senate bill.
\
""This bill takes us one step closer to leveling a huge tax on Washington's employers,"" said Sen. Jim Honeyford, R-Sunnyside, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment, Water and Energy Committee. ""This will lead to job losses and business failures.""
\
A cap-and-trade approach is one of the most popular ideas for tackling greenhouse gases. It's already used in Europe, is supported by both Obama and his opponent last fall, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and was earlier endorsed by a coalition of Western states, including Washington.
\
Proponents argue it would create more efficient regulations by tapping into market forces. Polluters that can't cut their emissions to stay under the cap could buy extra permits from other polluters who reduce their pollution more than is required.
\
But in Olympia, a number of energy-intensive industries, such as paper mills, have warned it would saddle them with added costs not faced in other states. They also have raised concerns the price for permits could be manipulated.
\
""Especially given the economic crisis that is facing Washington, the Legislature has shown leadership and understanding in moving forward this session on climate-change legislation in a more responsible manner,"" said Grant Nelson of the Association of Washington Business, which opposed Gregoire's legislation.
\
Environmentalists, however, charge hesitation risks long-term damage to the state's economy, because there would be less incentive to pursue cleaner, new energy technology.
\
They also warn it threatens the ability to meet targets, established by the Legislature, to cut statewide carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
\
""We're changing from a fossil-fuel dependent economy to a carbon-reduction economy. That scares people. Does anyone doubt that we have to do it?"" Traisman said.
"
10,"
Washingtons environmental groups will lobby the 2009 Legislature to impose a polluter pays levy on oil companies. The money would help pay the cost of reducing contaminated runoff into the states waters.
\
The Washington Environmental Council, a coalition of the states major environmental groups, also will urge lawmakers to move ahead with adopting a cap and invest system for carbon emissions, which would require polluters to buy permits to emit carbon. The revenue would be used to create green energy jobs, spur innovation, and provide assistance to people who are struggling with high energy costs.
\
Rather than wait for the federal government to design a cap and trade system for us, we can adopt a program that benefits the Washington economy, protects Washingtons interests in the national climate policy debate, and positions us for success in the new energy economy, the council said in announcing its priorities for the session.
\
Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, will serve as vice chairman of the Senate Environment, Water and Energy Committee and is expected to push the green agenda. He said last week he supports a strict regulatory approach to reducing carbon emissions rather than a cap and trade system that allows polluters to buy and sell the right to emit greenhouse gases.
\
Asking oil companies to help pay to clean up the cost of polluted stormwater, which it calls the states top water pollution problem, is a matter of fairness, the council said. Presently, stormwater projects are funded by utility taxes and fees on local developers. By also imposing fees on the companies that sell the primary stormwater contaminants, we move toward a system where everyone is paying their fair share.
\
Clark County home builders have long argued that its unfair to expect them to bear the full cost of containing and decontaminating stormwater runoff. Those development fees in turn are passed on to home buyers.
\
The councils four-point agenda also calls for the Legislature to:
\
* Adopt and promote super-efficient, low-energy-use building codes for new buildings, for example by requiring disclosure of energy-use performance scores and helping energy-efficient projects qualify for Local Improvement District funding;
\
* Encourage less driving by making urban regional transportation planning agencies responsible for meeting goals to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled, for example by zoning for compact development near rail and bus rapid transit stations to make it more convenient to use mass transit.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee takes questions from reporters Thursday at the annual Associated Press Legislative Preview in Olympia.

\
Gov. Jay Inslee, right, and Hyogo Prefecture Gov. Toshizo Ido shovel dirt onto a newly planted magnolia tree on the Capitol grounds in Olympia during a 2013 visit by a delegation from Hyogo, Japan, to celebrate a sister-state relationship. For Inslee, 2015 could be the year he rolls out some of the most ambitious proposals in the nation to reduce the states carbon pollution. Known as the nations greenest governor, Inslee will decide later this year whether to allow an oil-by-rail terminal at the Port of Vancouver.
\
TED S. WARREN/Associated Press
\
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, left, speaks Dec. 17 at REIs flagship store in Seattle. Inslee was at the store to propose a cap-and-trade program to require the states largest industrial polluters to pay for every ton of carbon they release.
\
A few months ago, President Barack Obama spoke to a room full of world leaders and tried to convey the importance of acting on climate change.
\
We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do anything about it, Obama said at the United Nations Climate Summit in September.
\
Obama attributed the quote to an American governor: Washingtons Jay Inslee.
\
The first-term Democratic governor has carved out a reputation as a green-energy pioneer and the nations greenest governor.
\
Inslee recently unveiled an ambitious climate-related package that calls for taxing the states biggest polluters. It will face fierce opposition in the state Legislature.
\
But there is one decision facing the governor that is his alone to make, and some have likened it to the choice now facing Obama on the Keystone XL pipeline; Inslee will decide whether to approve the nations largest oil-by-rail terminal at the Port of Vancouver.
\
Dan Riley, the public face for the West Coasts biggest refinery, Tesoro Corp., which is behind the proposed Vancouver project, said despite the governors climate-friendly reputation, Inslee has every reason to say yes to the terminal.
\
One former key player in the regulatory process, Vancouver lawyer Jim Luce, disagreed.
\
I think if youre Tesoro, youre most worried about the governor, Luce said.
\
Inslee is constrained by law and cant say a word about the terminal until a recommendation from the environmental siting council lands on his desk.
\
Then he has 60 days to make a decision.
\
Environment, economy
\
While unveiling his lofty climate package at REI in Seattle last month, Inslee subtly hit a note hes hammered before: The green revolution is not only about the environment, but also the economy.
\
The state needs to kick its addiction to fossil fuels, the governor told the crowd.
\
Its not healthy for us, physically or fiscally, he said.
\
In 2007, Inslee co-authored a book on the topic titled Apollos Fire: Igniting Americas Clean-Energy Economy.
\
The motivation behind his policies, the governor told The Columbian, are as much economic and job creation and entrepreneurial as they are environmental.
\
I think thats something that is lost on a lot of people, Inslee said. My major was economics at the University of Washington; it was not in granola or mountain flowers.
\
In his book, Inslee, a U.S. congressman at the time, lauds Sweden for trying to eliminate oil use altogether and writes that he believes the U.S. should do the same.
\
Considering the decision now in front of the governor, there is one particularly prescient passage; it details the thorny issues that would face policymakers as they work to shape a new policy agenda.
\
Not all new energy technologies answer the national goals of both energy independence and climate protection, the passage states. Increasing our domestic use of alternative fossil fuels by harvesting tar sands and oil shales, for example, would help improve our domestic energy security but would greatly worsen CO2 emissions.
\
This is a concept climate activist KC Golden, senior policy advisor with the environmental group Climate Solutions, which opposes the terminal, seizes upon and hopes the governor will, too.
\
Golden compared Inslees decision on the proposed terminal in Vancouver to the one facing Obamas decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, adding that he hopes Inslee uses what hes coined the Keystone Principle.
\
President Obama said last June he would reject Keystone if it significantly increases carbon pollution. This suggests a vital principle for climate action: First, stop making it worse, Golden wrote in the Huffington Post.
\
Golden later told The Columbian that its not possible to eliminate emissions overnight, but its time to stop making long-term capital investments that lock in dangerous emission levels.
\
Personal to political
\
The governors childhood might seem like a scene depicted in an L.L. Bean catalogue, with family vacations to state parks, kids packed in the back of a 1956 Chevy station wagon, pup tents and Trapper Nelson backpacks.
\
Inslee learned early on that one of the best things in life is catching a trout in a mountain lake.
\
His father was a high school biology teacher, and both parents spent summers in Mount Rainier National Park, where they helped restore alpine meadows.
\
I just had a very treasured growing up (experience) with my mom and dad, and I feel very fortunate, Inslee, 63, said. My goal now is not too philosophical or highfalutin. Its just that I would like my grandkids to have the same experience with their children. And thats just a very personal, if not commitment, a desire.
\
It appears Inslee also passed that dedication to the environment along to his children. One of the governors sons worked with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on oil spill responses.
\
When Inslee landed at the University of Washington as a college student, he was already interested in energy, said David Fluharty, one of Inslees professors at the university.
\
I dont know if I can say I inculcated any particular values he didnt already have, Fluharty said, but we certainly helped him develop those interests.
\
Fluharty, who still teaches at the university, has kept in touch with Inslee over the years. The two traveled to the first United Nations conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972.
\
Inslees energy interests were cultivated at a time when economists started to examine additional effects of energy projects.
\
Projects were evaluated as something more than just the price of oil and gas, Fluharty said. People started to consider what it takes to extract it and what happens when it burns. You look at all these different elements (more than just) oil and gas, and it starts to look a lot more expensive than renewables.
\
A difficult decision
\
Seventeen days before Tesoro Corp., the refinery, and Savage Companies, a supply-chain management business, were scheduled to present their application to the oil-by-rail terminal to the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, which is charged with making a recommendation to the governor, the chair of the council who had served more than a decade resigned.
\
The siting council, a quasi-judicial environmental panel, was created in 1970 by the state Legislature to evaluate large energy projects. The council is tasked with considering energy and protection of the environment of the projects as well as safety.
\
Luce said he decided to resign, in part, because he knew the oil-by-rail proposal for the Port of Vancouver would be one of the most consuming and complex projects the council has ever faced. The terminal would be capable of handling as much as 360,000 barrels of volatile crude oil per day. Luce, who is 70 years old, said he was ready to travel with his wife and didnt want to spend another three or four years shackled to the project.
\
Bill Lynch was chosen to replace Luce as chairman of the environmental siting council after Inslee personally interviewed him.
\
Lynch declined to be interviewed for this article, but he told The Columbian in a previous interview that when he was appointed, the governor didnt say do this or that.
\
Luces final project before retiring was the siting of the Whistling Ridge Energy Project. Despite not speaking to the Gregoire directly about the project, the Vancouver lawyer said he was aware of her position on wind projects.
\
To the extent I had discretion, while following the law, I would consider the governors policy, he said.
\
Luce knew Gregoire was a big proponent of renewable wind sources. Unless I can find a compelling way to reject, Im going to find a way to approve it in a way that is consistent with the environmental safeguards.
\
State law gives the siting council one year to make its recommendation to the governor, who then has 60 days to approve, approve with conditions or reject the project. The council has never recommended rejecting a project outright, although it has recommended approval with restrictions. And no governor has outright dismissed the councils recommendation.
\
After Inslee decides on the proposal, extensions likely will be filed. His decision could also be appealed to the states Supreme Court.
\
Luce said its a real possibility the councils recommendation wont necessarily be as black-and-white as outright rejection or lax approval.
\
You want a bold stroke? Reject it, Luce said of the governors decision. You want to walk the middle line? Approve it with stringent conditions that satisfy all the community interests, and if Tesoro can build it, they build it. But with all the environmental safeguards that the community wants? Is that possible? I dont know.
\
With enough conditions tacked on, the project could likely no longer be considered economically viable, Luce said.
\
Riley, the vice president of government affairs for Tesoro, said the company has no backup plan if the governor rejects the proposal.
\
Any transition to green energy has to be gradual, Riley said, adding that in the meantime, the oil terminal will bring jobs and infrastructure.
\
Some people, because of their environmental values, believe in the end of oil. They want to see us ween off fossil fuels, Riley said. Thats why I go back to say, this is a bridge to the energy future . Theres going to be technology breakthroughs and well see a change, but for the foreseeable future, we are still dependent.
\
Transitions take time
\
Five years ago, Inslee said, he could not have predicted the explosion of oil production in our country.
\
Its happened because of enormous strides in technology, the governor said. And I know this sounds a little bit contrarian, but that technological change, I think, is an indication of what were capable of.
\
That same intellectual talent could be tapped to work on innovative carbon policies and new technology, Inslee said.
\
But he agreed with Riley that the transition will not happen overnight.
\
No one is asking people to park their cars Friday and switch to these technologies, Inslee said.
\
And the jobs need to be there before making a transition.
\
If we want our kids to go with their parents to a state park, Inslee said, we also want parents to have jobs so they can afford to have a way to get to the park and a roof over their heads when they arent in the parks.

YAKIMA HERALD-REPUBLIC
\
Democratic leaders in Congress have yet to negotiate a final bill for health care reform, but regardless of what the House and Senate ultimately agree on, Rep. Doc Hastings is sure he will vote no.
\
In a speech before members of the Downtown Yakima Rotary Club on Thursday, Hastings called President Barack Obama's health care reform ""very very bad policy"" and said he believes it's likely to lead to rationing of medical services in the United States.
\
Under the two Democratic proposals, new rules would be imposed on insurers, health care providers, employers and patients, and several pilot programs would be set up to experiment with ways to provide better, less-expensive care. All Americans would be required to have insurance, and people who've been denied traditional insurance coverage because of pre-existing conditions would have access to it.
\
One of the most controversial provisions is in the House bill, which would give people the option of a government-run insurance program.
\
Hastings, a Republican who represents Central Washington's 4th Congressional District, predicted the final legislation will become a financial burden on the states as Medicaid is expanded to serve millions more low-income Americans.
\
""I have a real concern obviously with this (legislation) ... I think that's bad for America,"" he said.
\
During his 30-minute speech at the Yakima Convention Center, Hastings did not discuss the spiraling costs of health care for individuals and businesses, unemployment, or the economy. He focused on the national deficit, which is now at $1.2 trillion.
\
Government spending, as related to the Gross National Product, has historically been at about 20 percent since World War II. But now, it's risen to about 28 percent, he said.
\
The Republican congressman predicted the government's role in the national economy will grow even more once health care reform is approved. The Senate is proposing funding the $1 trillion cost through taxes on health-care plans and medical devices, while the House is proposing taxing people with high incomes.
\
""The $1 trillion price tag on top of the spending we did last year is bad for our great-grandkids,"" Hastings said.
\
To control health costs, he supports expanding coverage choices and bringing more competition into the system. He underscored his belief in the current system, in which insurance coverage is largely provided by employers.
\
Hastings, acknowledging Republicans are vastly outnumbered by Democrats, predicted health care reform will become law.
\
In addition to health care reform, he touched on the cap-and-trade energy tax and water storage in the Yakima Basin.
\
The House of Representatives passed a bill in June that seeks to cut carbon emissions by establishing a cap-and-trade system. Utilities, manufacturers and other businesses would be encouraged to trade pollution permits, or allowances, among themselves.
\
The legislation also sets a national standard of 20 percent for the production of renewable electricity by 2020. Billions of dollars would also be spent on new energy projects and subsidies for low-carbon agricultural practices, research on cleaner coal and electric vehicle development.
\
If the Senate approves similar legislation, Hastings said the cap-and-trade energy tax would pick winners and losers in the utility industry, which he doesn't think is a proper role for government. He favors all types of power, from hydro and solar to wind and nuclear. But he said he also supports oil, gas and coal, all of which, he added, can be accessed in the United States in a way that's safe for the environment.
\
""It's in our best interest to be as energy independent as we can,"" Hastings said.
\
The eight-term congressman was a strong supporter of the proposed Black Rock reservoir east of Yakima. But the $7.7 billion project was nixed last year after a five-year study rejected the reservoir as too costly.
\
Hastings said Washington's population is growing, and that additional water storage is necessary.
\
""More people are discovering this is a wonderful place to live,"" he said. ""We will have more population growth. We need water and more storage for the Yakima Basin.""

WASHINGTON -- It looks like perfect political symmetry -- party-line voting in Congress on the first key pieces of Barack Obama's agenda, matching a deep partisan divide within the electorate in judging his performance as president.
\
But, for reasons that require a little explanation, it may be wrong to conclude from this evidence, as many are doing, that the center has fallen out of American politics and Obama is on a fool's errand if he continues to pursue bipartisan support.
\
First, the data that shouts that I am wrong. No vote is more important in encapsulating the approach of the two parties to the basic issues of governing than the vote on the budget resolution for the year. It defines the spending priorities and the tax limits, along with many of the policy innovations that will be fleshed out in later legislation.
\
This year, not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for the Democratic budget resolution and not a single Democrat endorsed the Republican substitute.
\
The Republicans denounced the deficit-spending envisaged by the Obama-endorsed budget and decried the Democrats' habit of voting down every Republican amendment, as if none of the GOP ideas could possibly have any merit.
\
Democrats, for their part, called Republicans ""the party of no,"" pointing out that the GOP members of Congress had been almost as unanimously negative in their reactions to Obama's stimulus bill and the catch-up budget left over from last year's partisan gridlock.
\
As for the voters, the Pew Research Center reported earlier this month on a survey that showed the partisan gap in Obama's job approval scores is the widest in contemporary history. He rated a thumbs-up from 88 percent of the Democrats and only 27 percent of the Republicans in the poll -- a gap of 61 points.
\
At a comparable point in their first terms, the gaps for George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were only 51 and 45 points, respectively. A separate Pew poll found that since January, the percentage of voters who think that Democrats and Republicans in Washington are bickering more than usual has grown by 14 points, with a similar trend on the question of whether the country is more politically divided than in the past. By large margins, majorities now answer ""yes"" to both questions.
\
All this suggests the notion that Obama's election marked a change for the better in the political environment was as fanciful as Michigan State's chances against the mighty North Carolina Tar Heels.
\
But, still, this analysis ignores several potent factors, starting with the fact that the fastest growing portion of the electorate consists of people who have no strong partisan allegiance. These political independents are now as numerous as self-identified Republicans and are closing the gap on the Democrats.
\
Though badly underrepresented in Congress, where districting rules and campaign finance practices reinforce the two-party hegemony, the independent voters make up the swing vote in almost every contested election -- including the presidential race.
\
It is the reaction of those swing voters -- or the politicians' anticipation of their shifting opinion -- that drives the outcome of the big policy debates. You've had an example of this already with Obama's cap-and-trade proposal for protecting the environment from carbon discharges.
\
Once political independents, who like the idea of clean air, grasped that cap-and-trade would mean a big tax increase for them, Republican opposition was reinforced and Democratic support weakened to the point that the Obama plan may already be doomed this year.
\
The crucial role of the independents will be demonstrated again and again when Congress takes up Obama's challenge to reform health care, immigration and other broken systems, or renew arms control agreements. Because those independents are impressed when measures find prominent supporters in both parties, it will continue to behoove Obama to woo Republican help -- no matter how tough the odds.
\
Presidents who hope to achieve great things cannot for long rely on using their congressional majorities to muscle things through. That is why a strategy based on the early roll calls and polls is likely to fail.

Washington wont meet its first state-mandated target for reducing greenhouse gases, warns a new report to the Legislature by the Department of Ecology.
\
The main reason: Both regional and national efforts to establish a cap-and-trade system regulating emissions, the heart of the states strategy, have collapsed.
\
On the issue of climate change, the political landscape has changed dramatically since 2008, the new report notes.
\
As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama pledged to push for cap-and-trade legislation putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions. But he backed away from that pledge in 2009 in the face of Republican opposition. And though his new budget calls for investments in clean energy, the budget document itself doesnt mention cap-and-trade.
\
A regional cap-and-trade approach Washington favored also has been abandoned, at least for now.
\
In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. That finding gave the agency the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions as a pollutant. But the EPA endangerment rule is under attack from the Republican leadership in Congress.
\
State Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, introduced the first cap-and-trade bill in the Legislature in 2007, two weeks after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared that evidence of global warming was now unequivocal and that human activity primarily the burning of fossil fuels was a major cause.
\
Pridemore said the failure to put in place a market-based solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is disheartening.
\
The cap-and-trade piece was the centerpiece, he said. The lack of that makes any meaningful progress pretty hopeless.
\
He attributed loss of support for the market-based approach in part to the struggling economy.
\
A majority of citizens today believe that climate change is not real, he said. The worst thing for the environment is a recession.
\
In its new report, Path to a Low-Carbon Economy, Ecology assessed the states progress three years after the Legislature put the states emission reduction targets into state law and found it lagging.
\
Gov. Chris Gregoire adopted the targets by executive order in 2007. In 2008, the Legislature passed legislation that commits the state to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020; to 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2025; and to half of 1990 levels by 2050.
\
That first target is now out of reach, the report found.
\
In 2008, all sources combined produced an estimated 101.1 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, a 9 percent increase over 1990 levels. Ecology officials now predict that emission-reduction policies the state has already implemented, including actions by state agencies, will result in relatively constant emissions between now and 2020.
\
Unfortunately, this means that the state is not on track to meet its statutory reduction limit for 2020 and beyond, the report says.
\
The targets set in 2008 were centered on implementing the emissions trading program designed by the Western Climate Initiative, a regional effort developed by seven western states, including Washington, and four Canadian provinces, the report notes. But, after debate at the state and federal level, lawmakers have not implemented the centerpiece of the 2008 comprehensive plan: an economy-wide emissions trading program.
\
Under cap-and-trade, government agencies set an overall limit on emissions of the gases that contribute to climate change and allow polluters to develop their own strategies for reducing emissions within that cap. Participating polluters can trade the right to emit on a regional or national exchange.
\
In 2009, after the Legislature failed to adopt the regional emissions trading program, Gregoire directed her agencies to take other steps to curb emissions.
\
Those include working with large industrial sources to reduce their emissions voluntarily; evaluating whether to adopt a low-carbon fuel standard for the transportation sector; and negotiating with TransAlta, the states only coal-fired electrical plant, to cut emissions in half at its plant near Centralia.
\
Under an agreement negotiated with the governor, Canadian-owned TransAlta will make the transition to a cleaner source of energy by 2025. A bill that passed the Senate Environment, Water and Energy Committee on Friday would transition the plant off coal as early as 2020 and provide some transition help for coal plant workers and the community.
\
Pridemore favors the Senate bill. The TransAlta plant is the single largest source of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in the state, he said. Its critical that we move away from that. I would like to see it speeded up.
\
Trying to win voluntary emission-reduction agreements from major industries has been only partially successful, the Ecology report said. Companies cite lack of capital and an uncertain regulatory environment as major barriers to their emission reduction efforts.
\
With a $22 million federal grant, the state also is working to create a corridor for electric vehicles the length of Interstate 5, with plug-in recharge stations at regular intervals. The grant would fund the construction of up to 2,000 charging stations over the next two years.
\
Other threats
\
In its report, Ecology lists several threats climate change poses to Washingtons environment and economy:
\
nReduced snowpack will continue to decrease summer water availability and increase competition among water users.
\
nHuman-released carbon dioxide is being absorbed by the oceans, changing the chemistry of sea water and making it more acidic. Washington oceans are particularly susceptive to acidification, which may already be affecting Hood Canal, Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor, the report said. Increased acidification threatens the food chain by affecting a variety of marine organisms, especially those that form shells, and those who in turn support herring, salmon, even whales.
\
nWashington can expect its average temperature to increase by 3.2 degrees by 2040, according to an assessment compiled by the University of Washingtons Climate Impact Group.
\
nWarmer and drier summers will double or triple the average annual acreage burned by forest fires.
\
nRising sea levels will threaten ports in Seattle, Tacoma and other low-lying coastal areas.
\
nSignificant increases in spring snowmelt in the Cascades will alter seasonal stream flows, affecting fish passage in some sensitive watersheds, such as the Yakima River.
\
If greenhouse gases continue unchecked, the report warns, changes in Washington temperature, water availability and sea level will exacerbate current environmental problems and create new ones.

\
* Eighty-five percent of Washingtons greenhouse gas emissions are produced by burning fossil fuels. Transportation is the states largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In 2008, the transportation sector produced 45.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, nearly half the states total emissions load.

"
15,"Conservative activists in Idaho and Washington are trying to force the federal government to keep out of issues such as guns, health care and the environment.\Through legislation and initiatives, people aligned with what's variously known as the 10th Amendment or State Sovereignty movement are trying to pass state laws that limit what the federal government can do within a state's borders.\""Government closest to the people is best able to solve the problems,"" said State Rep. Matt Shea, R-Greenacres, who introduced a series of ""sovereignty"" bills the first week of Washington's legislative session.\The 10th Amendment, which reserves to states any right not spelled out in the Constitution, is the basis for the bills, Shea said. Language for much of the legislation came from the 10th Amendment Center, which supports and tracks efforts to strengthen states' rights.\But legal scholars question such efforts to have the Legislature set limits on Congress or to interpret what the U.S. Constitution means within a state's borders. That's really the job of the courts, in precedents that stretch back to 1803, said Amy Kelley, who teaches constitutional law at Gonzaga University School of Law.\""What the U.S. Constitution means is not a state option,"" Kelley said.\Under bills introduced by Shea and other Republicans, Washington wouldn't have to follow any federal mandates on health care reform or obey any cap-and-trade rulings that govern greenhouse gases unless the Legislature approves them.\The federal government couldn't regulate any firearm that was manufactured, sold and only used in Washington. Federal law enforcement agents would need permission from a county sheriff before arresting anyone. Any legislation Congress passed would have to state the constitutional authority for any law.\Democrats who control the Legislature have yet to schedule any of Shea's bills for a hearing, and some describe it as part of a ""tea party agenda,"" a reference to the conservative, anti-tax, smaller-government movement that has gained steam since Barack Obama's election as president.\""We want to lead the state out of recession. They want to lead the state out of the country,"" Rep. Jeff Morris, D-Mount Vernon and House speaker pro tem, said of Shea's legislation, which some Republicans call the Freedom Acts.\Some Republican leaders are co-sponsoring individual bills, but the GOP leadership said the bills are not a priority. Some members are passionate about state sovereignty issues, said Caucus Chairman Dan Kristiansen, of Snohomish, ""but it's not a party position or a caucus position.""\Rep. Kevin Parker, R-Spokane, signed on to the bill to ban any greenhouse gas emission regulations because he sees them as ""a major job killer."" Rep. Joel Kretz, R-Wauconda, signed on to several because of concerns in his northeast Washington district of too much federal intrusion, but he doubts the bills will pass in a session devoted mainly to budget problems.\An effort to bring two of the bills immediately to a floor debate without even a committee hearing was defeated in the first week of the session on a party-line vote. Shea conceded that voting on bills without a hearing is unusual, but he argued the measures on blocking health care and environment rules are so important they warranted special treatment.\Chris Bass, a Liberty Lake resident who was active in the Ron Paul presidential campaign, filed eight initiatives on many of the same topics, some with nearly identical language, a few days after Shea's bills were filed. A bill has already been introduced in the Idaho Senate by Sen. Jim Clark, R-Hayden Lake, to block enforcement of any national health care rules. Rep. Dick Harwood, R-St. Maries, plans to introduce a bill that would forbid the federal government from regulating any firearm built, sold and used solely in Idaho.\The Washington and Idaho firearms proposals are patterned after a law enacted last year in Montana.\Gary Marbut, president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association and drafter of the Firearms Freedom Act, said Tennessee has passed a similar law, and 19 states are considering such legislation.\If passed, these ""states' rights"" laws would be ignored by the federal government or thrown out by the federal courts, said Hugh Spitzer, a constitutional scholar who teaches at University of Washington School of Law. Some are an attempt at nullification - an argument that states can nullify federal laws with which they disagree. Clark's bill in Idaho is even called health care nullification.\The nullification argument stretches back to the beginning of the nation, Spitzer said. In the mid-1800s, nullification led to secession and the Civil War. In the mid-1900s, some states tried to nullify federal segregation rules and lost in the U.S. Supreme Court. There's no doubt that Congress is limited in what it can have the states do, said Spitzer, who considers himself a states' rights advocate. Usually, it ""bribes"" the states by giving them money to do something or threatening to take it away if they won't.\States' rights is not strictly the province of the conservatives, he added. Liberals tend to cite states' rights arguments in clashes between federal drug laws and state ""medical marijuana"" statutes or in arguing that the federal government should recognize a same sex marriage in a state that has passed such a law.\ON THE WEB: Follow political and Statehouse news on Jim Camden's blog: spokesman.com/blogs/spincontrol\Credit: Jim Camden jimc@spokesman.com, (509) 459-5461"

Traffic woes need long-term solutions
\
Scott Dalesandros July 3 letter, HOV lane is a punishment, misses the big picture when he suggests we help our environment and cut out the wasted fuel and time by getting rid of the Interstate 5 high occupancy vehicle lane. Traffic is terrible weekday afternoons. Dalesandro points to the pain of carpoolers trying to get over to the HOV lane and the crowded northbound onramps as a way to punish Vancouver drivers. I doubt anyone is trying to punish Dalesandro by providing an alternative to driving alone. Adding asphalt to relieve congestion is like loosening your belt to cure obesity therell always be more cars to fill the lanes, as any commuter on Los Angeles freeways will tell you.
\
We will never totally get rid of traffic jams; we can only create options. A light-rail connection will be a welcome addition with the new bridge, along with bike lanes. This nation has tried to pave its way out of congestion for 50 years, and the results are painfully obvious to any freeway commuter. Getting rid of the carpool lane may be tempting, but it would be a short-sighted step that only eliminates one of the beneficial options.
\
To help the environment, conserve fuel and create a sustainable economy we have to provide another way.

Focus on fixing freshwater habitats
\
A July 7 Columbian story reported, Study that says Snake dams dont stifle fish survival knocked. Theres no question from fishery scientists that dams on the lower Snake and main stem of the Columbia are by far the biggest killer of endangered wild salmon and steelhead. Its no coincidence that the Bonneville Power Administration is funding a study to take the pressure off the hydropower system.
\
The study by David Welch of Kintama Research Corp. parrots BPAs consistent message that ocean conditions are the driver to salmon survival or mortality. Theyre a part of the equation, but ocean conditions have always been and always will be cyclical and largely beyond our control. The best way to ensure strong salmon returns in variable ocean cycles is to fix their freshwater habitat and the best available science shows us that restoring Columbia-Snake salmon habitat must include the removal of the four lower Snake River dams. With strong actions such as dam removal, salmon populations will be able to weather poor ocean cycles in good health and truly thrive when ocean conditions are good. I would rather have my money spent on real solutions such as dam removal, rather than on studies that keep us on the road to nowhere and salmon spiraling toward extinction.

Thankfully, its over for another year
\
After this years traditional Fourth of July orgy of noise and violence, I was moved to write this letter out of anger at my neighbors and the lawmakers who allow neighborhood fireworks to continue. My pets are still trembling under the bed.
\
A lost dog wandered into my yard that evening. Animal Control told me that more than 400 pets were missing. What a cruel thing to do to a dog, not to mention children crying in their cribs, from hearing all the bombs bursting in air.
\
I believe the majority of neighbors feel as I do. It was only a few and thats all it takes who ruin a beautiful summer evening. Thank God its over for another year. I wish people would use their freedom for more civilized activities. And I hope those poor dogs and cats are returned to their homes.

Give voters a voice
\
President Obama recently said that some of us have what he called old attitudes. I agree with his evaluation; however, I do not agree with his assessment of the behaviors intrinsic to the word homosexuality.
\
I find the statement that There are still fellow citizens, perhaps neighbors or even family members and loved ones, who still hold fast to worn arguments and old attitudes, is a very slick put-down designed to intimidate those opposing his view.
\
Let me affirm that those old attitudes and very old principles were around long before President Obama was born. They are, in fact, eternal. The question is: Do we believe Obama or do we believe the God who made us, sustains us, and knows all about us, our proclivities, weaknesses and strengths?
\
Right now in our state we have an opportunity to give all the voters a voice in whether we accept his view or whether we accept the view of God Almighty and His Word. We all are accountable for every word, every action we take here in this life. I, for one, want to hear the words from my Father in Heaven, Well done, thou good and faithful servant. What about you?

Warming myth isnt real science
\
Failing to make informed decisions is a violation of the public trust and hence makes Congressman Brian Baird and all those who voted for the job-killing, tax-raising, cap-and-trade bill unfit for public office. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is right when she says this is a job bill. Its a job bill for the Chinese, Indians and Europeans. It is clear that for years these countries wanted the USA to be the first fools to pass cap and trade. This would force American jobs overseas and allow foreigners to take market share from our industries. It can only be a lose-lose proposition.
\
It is nothing but selling indulgences to the self-imposed guilty. Paying someone to move a pollution source from one location to another on the planet and saying this will reduce pollution is the worst form of deceit. There has never been any historical or scientific evidence that CO leads to global warming.
\
In fact, EPA internal e-mails suggest that the agency may have suppressed a report from NASA satellites that dispute the warming myth. Swallowing this warming hoax proves that real science is dead in the heads of 219 representatives.

Cost effects of bill exaggerated
\
Clearly, some Columbian readers have been drinking the Faux News Kool-Aid. At least two recent letters have wildly exaggerated the costs of cap-and-trade legislation passed in Congress. Sorry, youre entitled to your own opinion but not your own set of facts.
\
Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other alarmists have suggested that cap-and-trade would cost families more than $3,000 per year and cited a study from MIT. The author of the study says the Republicans are being simplistic and misleading. No other study has estimates even remotely similar (EPA, Congressional Budget Office or even the conservative Heritage Association.)
\
I suggest readers look up cap-and-trade at factcheck.org which is nonpartisan and is tough on both parties when they tell those little white lies and big whoppers.

While being exceptional on many levels, when it comes to views on climate change the people of Clark County are perfectly average.That is the conclusion to be drawn from a survey conducted by researchers at Yale Universitys Project on Climate Change Communication (http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication). Breaking down responses by states or counties or even congressional districts, the study offers an interesting snapshot of geographical differences when it comes to opinions about climate change. In Clark County, 63 percent of adults responded last year that they believe global warming is occurring, while 18 percent said it is not and the rest were unsure. Those exactly match the nationwide percentages, placing Clark County smack dab in middle America, no matter what the maps might say.This information is offered simply as a point of interest. Because regardless of public opinion regarding climate change, the pertinent questions revolve around what, if anything, should be done about it. These are particularly relevant as Gov. Jay Inslee pursues cap-and-trade policies in the Legislature in an effort to trim the emission of greenhouse gases, which many scientists believe contribute to global warming.Under such a plan, regulators would cap total statewide emissions and would grant companies allowances for the amount of gases they may release. The government would periodically tighten the standards, and companies that have surplus allowances would be able to sell those surpluses to producers that cant or wont cut their emissions. The theory is that the ability to sell allowances provides a market incentive for producers to minimize emissions, but critics say the plan could put companies out of business and could result in higher prices for consumers.Inslees proposal predictably has met with resistance from lawmakers and is going nowhere during this legislative session. The governor was the one who predicted as much, as he acknowledged that the cap-and-trade concept is relatively new to the public and that such innovative ideas require time to establish a beachhead in the court of public opinion. But if the goal is to develop a groundswell of support for future attempts to sell the proposal, Inslee must work to convince Washingtonians of the need for such a plan.By virtue of its abundant hydroelectric power and a well-established affinity for environmental concerns Washington long has had a relatively small carbon footprint. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2012 the state produced 69 million metric tons of carbon emissions. That was down from a high of 83 million metric tons in 2000, and it represented about 1.3 percent of the nationwide emissions. Critics say those numbers call into question the practical benefits of the state focusing on reducing carbon emissions; if Washington is a small player, then small changes here will have no discernible global impact. That argument has some merit, yet it falls short of the ethos long displayed by the states residents, and Inslees cap-and-trade bill notes a desire to provide leadership and a model for other jurisdictions.That leadership must include realistic, well-vetted projections regarding the costs of cap-and-trade legislation and the long-term impacts upon the states economy. It also will require making a compelling argument in favor of the program an argument that can appeal to middle America.

18,"The only way Republicans will seriously respond to global warming is if President Barack Obama locks arms with Sen. James Inhofe, R-Hoax, and calls out the world's scientists.\""Hotter planet? This is good news, people.""\Inhofe, from oil-producing Oklahoma, has long called global warming a hoax, so naturally Republicans installed him to head the Environment Committee. It's like putting Bill Belichick in charge of footballs or fashion. Last week, the Senate took a vote on whether global warming was a charade, but only one senator voted yes. That was followed by a tally on whether humans are to blame. Most Republicans said no, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary. It does seem odd they would vote on such matters when their favorite dodge is, ""I'm not a scientist.""\They're not generals, but they decide defense matters. They're not schoolteachers, but they decide education matters. But global warming? ""The science isn't in.""\I imagine them pacing on a porch waiting for a delivery truck to pull up and drop off the verdict. ""You ordered some science? Sign here.""\Meanwhile, they make political moves that will make it more difficult to solve the problem if they're ever persuaded. In Congress, it's placing shackles on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and deriding carbon taxes and cap and trade schemes. In Olympia, it's passing a rule requiring a two-thirds majority to pass the carbon-related levy proposed by Gov. Jay Inslee.\But if you ask them point-blank what should be done, they peer off into the distance looking for that truck.\The only answer at this point is for Obama to echo the ""hoax"" cry, and watch Republicans reflexively scurry to the other side. When substantive legislation reaches his desk, he can wink and say, ""This is good news, people.""\STILL IN DEBT. Remember peering over the fiscal cliff and seeing Greece? The budget showdown that led to the government shutdown? Congress seemed so worried that it almost stopped paying the bills.\In the 2011 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama mentioned ""debt"" and ""deficit"" 12 times, according to Peter Beinart of Atlantic Monthly. In the Republican response, Rep. Paul Ryan invoked those terms 14 times. In the latest address, the president mentioned the deficit once, noting that it had plummeted by two-thirds. In the Republican response, Rep. Joni Ernst didn't mention the issue at all.\Mission accomplished? Not really.\The Congressional Budget Office estimates that while the deficit will continue to shrink in the near term, public debt (the accumulation of annual deficits) will soon be twice as high as it was in 2007, and higher than any year since 1950 as a percentage of GDP. As a result, interest payments on the debt are taking a bigger chunk of the overall budget.\But don't expect any mentions of a ""grand bargain"" between Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, because both parties have moved on. Too bad, because it would be much easier to address the systemic issues under the present rosier economic conditions.\Discretionary spending - the kind Congress votes on annually - is at historic lows. So what's the problem? Part of it is failing to react to an aging population. Medicare benefits have expanded and health care costs have gone up, but it's been nearly 30 years since the payroll tax was increased to keep pace.\In his 2013 address, Obama said, ""Those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.""\That challenge remains, but last week Democrats and Republicans joined as one ... to ignore it.\Associate Editor Gary Crooks can be reached at garyc@spokesman.com or (509) 459-5026.

19,"Fuel standards, cap-and-trade program long sought by Dems\Two major climate bills championed by Gov. Jay Inslee passed the state Senate late Thursday, bringing Democrats one step closer to a long sought cap-and-trade program and a low-carbon fuel standard.\The bills passed nearly along party lines after several hours of fierce debate. Among Southwest Washington's lawmakers, Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, and Sen. Lynda Wilson, R-Vancouver, voted no on both. Sen. Annette Cleveland, D-Vancouver, cast her votes in favor.\Together, the two pieces of legislation would mark a significant advancement in Democrats' big-picture climate goals.\The first, Senate Bill 5126, would cap greenhouse gas emissions by major polluters. The cap would slowly decrease over time and companies would need to shrink their emissions or purchase carbon allowances, a trade-off that proponents say encourages industries to invest in green energy.\Revenue raised would go toward a handful of proposed funds, including transportation projects and programs that help fund transitions to cleaner energy sources.\If signed into law, Washington would be required to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.\“The hour is late, but the time for action is now,” said bill sponsor Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, in his opening statements of the floor debate Thursday evening. “By creating a cap on emissions that responsibly lowers the aggregate emissions allowed in our state, we give the industry sector time to adjust. We give them the regulatory structure to function.”\SB 5126 passed 25-24, a major victory for Democrats on the first carbon pricing bill ever brought to a vote in the state Legislature. It now faces an uncertain future as it heads to the House, where representatives are expected to make changes.\Wilson said she voted against the bill because she worries that it will limit Washington's competitiveness among major industries without making a significant dent in greenhouse gas emissions — companies will just “pay for the privilege” to emit, she said.\Wilson added that she's also concerned about the regulatory power that the bill gives to the Department of Ecology, which would be tasked with creating and enforcing the cap-and-trade program.\“When we cede this authority over to unelected bureaucrats, we don't have any control,” Wilson said.\Clean fuel standards\The other environment-related bill to pass the Senate on Thursday has already passed the House. House Bill 1091 aims to implement progressively cleaner fuel standards for cars, trucks, boats, airplanes and trains, shrinking the amount of carbon they're allowed to emit over time.\It passed by a wider margin, 27-20. Both Rivers and Wilson spoke vehemently against it.\Rivers argued a bill that raises the price of fuel will disproportionately impact people who can least afford it.\“Here we are again, passing yet another regressive tax,” Rivers said. “This is super personal to me, because in Battle Ground in my district, we have cheap land, but it's far and away from the job center. Our people have to drive a far distance. They live out there because it's where they can afford to live, so now they're going to be paying more for fuel to get to work.”\“We talk about regressive taxes. I think tonight we have seen possibly one of the most shameful nights in Senate history,” Rivers added.\Rivers proposed an amendment to the bill that would use existing Washington State Department of Transportation maintenance funds to plant grass on department-owned land. Sen. Derek Stanford, D-Seattle, called the motion a distraction from the issue at hand, and the amendment ultimately failed.\“Carbon sinks have one purpose, and that is to decarbonize,” Rivers responded, appearing frustrated behind her face mask. “The idea that we can't do some of these things that would be helpful to decarbonization, I just find that to be a really questionable statement.”\Cleveland, a Democrat, joined her colleagues Thursday evening casting her vote in favor of both bills. She didn't testify in the Senate hearing or respond to The Columbian's request for comment Friday, but she's previously said that raising revenue for transportation projects should be the Legislature's top budget priority this session.\In March, Cleveland was one of just three Democrats to cross the aisle and vote against a hotly debated capital gains tax. Her reasoning, she said at the time, was that passing other taxes could reduce the political clout to raise revenue for an ambitious transportation project she was championing. That plan hinged on carbon pricing and a cap-and-trade program.\“In the Legislature, there are only so many tax votes that there are going to be an appetite to pass this year,” Cleveland said last month.\Whether Democrats can shepherd both bills over the finish line before the legislative session concludes on April 25 remains unknown.\Inslee has long pushed for both a carbon pricing program and a fuel standard. In 2014, he put forward a cap-and-trade proposal during his first term as governor; in 2019, a bill that would have established a low-carbon fuel standard passed the House but never made it to the Senate floor.\Washington voters have twice struck down ballot measures that would have levied an environmental tax on fossil fuel sales, once in 2016 and again in 2018.\Wilson believes it's unlikely that the Legislature can get the bills to the governor's desk in the next 16 days, but she said it's not impossible. The cap-and-trade bill will need to work its way through the House Environment & Energy Committee before it lands on the floor for a vote — a public hearing on the legislation is scheduled for Wednesday.\“Where there's a will, there's a way,” Wilson said. “This is the farthest they've gotten it in all those years.”\Calley Hair: 360-735-4558; call\CREDIT: Calley Hair The Columbian"
20,"The mound of trash is piled four stories high, filling one of the bays at the city of Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant.\The bulging garbage bags, tattered textiles, discarded food, and broken furniture and toys represent about four days' worth of trash from Spokane-area residents.\""I think a lot of people put it out at the curb and forget about it,"" said Gina Dempsey, the plant's manager. The garbage ends up at a West Plains incinerator, where it's burned to produce electricity.\City officials say the Waste-to-Energy Plant performs a valuable service, consuming 800 tons of trash daily and generating enough electricity to power 13,000 homes. But Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant also has a darker side: It's one of Washington's top emitters of greenhouse gases.\In 2014, the plant released more than 105,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It ranks on the lower end of a list of 35 Washington factories, oil refineries, power plants and other facilities that are jointly responsible for 60 percent of the heat-trapping gases released in the state.\Under new rules being developed by the state Department of Ecology, the city would have to cut carbon emissions at the Waste-to-Energy Plant by 5 percent every three years beginning in 2017, or find other ways to offset the emissions.\That's a tall order for Spokane, which doesn't have a lot of options for garbage disposal, said Marlene Feist, a spokeswoman for the city's utilities division.\""I don't anticipate that we would build another landfill for this community,"" Feist said.\The $110 million Waste-to-Energy Plant opened in 1991. It was built to replace a leaking landfill and help protect the Spokane Valley/Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, the sole source of drinking water for more than 500,000 of the region's residents, Feist said.\Trucking the city's waste to a distant landfill would create its own carbon footprint. And there are trade-offs to burying garbage versus burning it, she said. Landfills produce methane, a greenhouse gas that has 25 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon when measured over a 100-year period.\While city officials support the state's goal of environmental stewardship, Spokane also needs a practical, cost-effective way to dispose of garbage, Feist said.\Given the number of low-income households in the community, ""we'd like to keep utility rates affordable,"" she said.\The state rules are being developed under Washington's Clean Air Act at the direction of Gov. Jay Inslee, who has made climate change a centerpiece of his administration but failed to get a cap-and-trade system and carbon tax approved by last year's Legislature.\State officials said the new rules would gradually reduce carbon dioxide, methane and five other heat-trapping gases that contribute to global warming. Washington is already experiencing the effects of a changing climate through smaller snowpacks, increased flooding and rising sea levels, according to a 2015 report by the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group.\The proposed rules apply to facilities that release more than 100,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually. In the future, smaller polluters would also have to comply. Beginning in 2020, the compliance threshold would drop by 5,000 metric tons every three years until it reaches 70,000 metric tons in 2035.\The approach isn't as sweeping as Inslee's earlier legislation, but the proposed rules still face hefty opposition from Sen. Doug Erickson, R-Ferndale, chairman of the Senate Energy, Environment and Telecommunications Committee. He's the author of Senate Bill 6173, which would prohibit the Department of Ecology from restricting carbon emissions without legislative action. The bill passed out of Erickson's committee last week.\Meanwhile, the city has asked the Department of Ecology for flexibility in complying with the proposed rules.\Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant is one of only two in the Northwest, Feist said. The other is in Salem.\Waste-to-energy plants are more common on the East Coast, where there is less space for large landfills.\By virtue of what they burn, the plants are high carbon emitters, said Wayne Krafft, an Ecology Department section manager in Spokane. Items such as carpets, shingles, and the foam found in cast-off couches and mattresses contain high amounts of fossil fuels. Burning food waste, such as bacon grease, also releases carbon, he said.\In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, burning waste is better than burying it, city officials wrote in a letter to the Ecology Department. They cited models developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which estimated that sending municipal garbage to a waste-to-energy plant instead of a landfill actually reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\State officials don't disagree with the models, but said it's hard to make direct comparisons. Burning garbage releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere immediately, while landfills release emissions over decades.\In addition, ""it really depends on how they manage the methane,"" said Neil Caudill, the Department of Ecology's greenhouse gas reporting specialist.\Many landfills are required to flare the methane produced from the decaying garbage, which reduces greenhouse gas outputs, he said. Some landfills also generate electricity from the methane, which also lowers the impact.\Under the proposed rules, the city has several options for bringing the Waste-to-Energy Plant into compliance, Caudill said. Stepping up recycling efforts to reduce the amount of garbage burned might be the simplest way to reduce carbon emissions, he said.\The city could also buy credits from other polluters who cut their carbon emissions to levels below what the state requires, Caudill said. The Department of Ecology would also accept credits from several out-of-state carbon trading markets.\Earlier this month, crane operator Eric Vangemert sorted the wet garbage out of the refuse coming into Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant. After the garbage dried out, it was headed for nine-story-tall boilers, where it would be burned at temperatures reaching 2,500 degrees. Steam produced by the boilers is forced through turbines, creating electricity.\Employees at the Waste-to-Energy Plant take quite a bit of pride in the work of turning trash into energy, said Dempsey, the plant manager.\""I would love it if more people knew what we do and why we do it,"" she said.\TOP EMITTERS\A coal-fired electric plant, transportation fuel suppliers and oil refineries are the six largest emitters of greenhouse gas in Washington, according to 2013 data.

21,"Conservative activists in Idaho and Washington are trying to force the federal government to keep out of issues such as guns, health care and the environment.\Through legislation and initiatives, people aligned with what's variously known as the 10th Amendment or State Sovereignty movement are trying to pass state laws that limit what the federal government can do within a state's borders.\A bill has been introduced in the Idaho Senate by Sen. Jim Clark, R-Hayden Lake, to block enforcement of any national health care rules. Rep. Dick Harwood, R-St. Maries, plans to introduce a separate bill that would forbid the federal government from regulating any firearm built, sold and used solely in Idaho, which he described as a way for people to tell the federal government to ""back off and let us govern our state.""\""Government closest to the people is best able to solve the problems,"" said State Rep. Matt Shea, R-Greenacres, who introduced a series of ""sovereignty"" bills the first week of Washington's legislative session.\The 10th Amendment, which reserves to states any right not spelled out in the Constitution, is the basis for the bills, Shea said. Language for much of the legislation came from the 10th Amendment Center, which supports and tracks efforts to strengthen states' rights.\But legal scholars question such efforts to have the Legislature set limits on Congress or to interpret what the U.S. Constitution means within a state's borders. That's really the job of the courts, in precedents that stretch back to 1803, said Amy Kelley, who teaches constitutional law at Gonzaga University School of Law.\""What the U.S. Constitution means is not a state option,"" Kelley said.\Under bills introduced by Shea and other Republicans, Washington wouldn't have to follow any federal mandates on health care reform or obey any cap-and-trade rulings that govern greenhouse gases unless the Legislature approves them.\The federal government couldn't regulate any firearm that was manufactured, sold and only used in Washington. Federal law enforcement agents would need permission from a county sheriff before arresting anyone. Any legislation Congress passed would have to state the constitutional authority for any law.\Chris Bass, a Liberty Lake resident who was active in the Ron Paul presidential campaign, filed eight initiatives on many of the same topics, some with nearly identical language, a few days after Shea's bills were filed. Last week, similar ballot initiatives were filed in Boise.\Democrats who control the Washington Legislature describe Shea's bills as part of a ""tea party agenda,"" a reference to the conservative, anti-tax, smaller-government movement that has gained steam since Barack Obama's election.\""We want to lead the state out of recession. They want to lead the state out of the country,"" said Rep. Jeff Morris, D-Mount Vernon and House speaker pro tem.\If passed, these ""states' rights"" laws would be ignored by the federal government or thrown out by the federal courts, said Hugh Spitzer, a constitutional scholar who teaches at University of Washington School of Law. Some are an attempt at nullification - an argument that states can nullify federal laws with which they disagree. Clark's bill in Idaho is even called health care nullification.\The nullification argument stretches back to the beginning of the nation, Spitzer said. In the mid-1800s, nullification led to secession and the Civil War. In the mid-1900s, some states tried to nullify federal segregation rules and lost in the U.S. Supreme Court. There's no doubt that Congress is limited in what it can have the states do, said Spitzer, who considers himself a states' rights advocate. Usually, it ""bribes"" the states by giving them money to do something or threatening to take it away if they won't.\States' rights is not strictly the province of the conservatives, he added. Liberals tend to cite states' rights arguments in clashes between federal drug laws and state medical marijuana statutes, or in arguing that the federal government should recognize a same-sex marriage in a state that has passed such a law.\Both the Idaho and Washington firearms proposals are patterned after a law enacted last year in Montana.\Gary Marbut, president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association and drafter of that state's Firearms Freedom Act, said Tennessee has passed a similar law, and 19 states are considering such legislation. That concept and the other states' rights proposals are gaining favor with tea party organizations; the 9/12 Project, founded by conservative talk show host Glenn Beck; and the Liberty Coalition, which focuses on individuals' rights.\""There's this great wave of discontent. The Firearms Freedom Act was the first to catch that wave,"" Marbut said.\He shies away from the term nullification, although he acknowledges the dictionary definition of the word applies, and he disputes critics' suggestion that this is really secessionism, which was settled by the Civil War.\""Nullification has gotten a rap, like 'militia,' "" he said. ""It's really that the federal government is seceding from its proper role as servant. Montana is saying to the other states, get your creature on a leash.""\Harwood, too, sees it as pushing back against the federal government, not seceding from the nation: ""There's no such thing as secession. There's nowhere to go.""\ON THE WEB: Follow political and Statehouse news on Jim Camden's blog: spokesman.com/blogs/spincontrol\Credit: Jim Camden jimc@spokesman.com, (509) 879-7461"

U.S. Rep. Brian Baird of Washington, flanked by U.S. Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, left, and U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee of Washington, right, listens Monday as a panel of experts testifies during a field briefing aimed at exploring the possibilities of using timber products to produce clean energy with low greenhouse gas emissions.
\
---
\
The U.S. energy supply could get a major boost by making use of a fraction of the immense amount of biomass growing in American forests, three members of Congress heard during a field briefing Monday in Vancouver.
\
U.S. Rep. Brian Baird, D-Vancouver, convened the briefing with scientists and industry groups as Congress takes up discussion of a major cap-and-trade bill intended to limit the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
\
This is incredibly timely, Baird said.
\
Baird was joined by U.S. Reps. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., and Greg Walden, R-Ore.
\
The congressmen heard from several Northwest scientists and policymakers exploring new ways to convert the detritus of forestry into various types of renewable fuel sources. Tree limbs and tree tops normally discarded or burned as slash could instead be converted to hydrocarbon fuel for automobiles or burned in co-generation power plants, they said.
\
We believe the technology is getting close, said Denny Hunter, chief technology officer for Catchlight Energy, a joint venture between Weyerhaeuser and Chevron.
\
Chevron and Weyerhaeuser?
\
The oil company and wood products giant forged an alliance on the implied notion that Chevron is interested in forms of energy besides oil. And Weyerhaeuser controls an abundance of wood fiber.
\
As soon as four years from now, Hunter said, it may be possible to fill a tank with hydrocarbons converted from wood chips rather than from oil.
\
When you burn fossil fuels coal or oil that is carbon which is buried in the Earth. Nature sank it millions of years ago, Baird said in an interview. Every time we dig that stuff up and burn it, thats not net-carbon neutral.
\
Turning wood chips into energy ultimately also releases carbon into the atmosphere, he said. But its renewable and much more energy-efficient than extracting fossil fuels.
\
Rural areas hit hard
\
Biomass comes in myriad forms. In Washington, an assessment in 2005 estimated that 16.9 million dry tons a year could be sustainably harvested. A little less than half would come from the detritus of forestry, such as tree limbs, bark and other miscellaneous debris. (Almost 2 million tons would come from animal waste. Municipal garbage and field residue were other big categories).
\
Baird, who chairs the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the House Science and Technology Committee, is focused on forestry.
\
Rural areas are especially hard-hit by the economic recession, he said. Mechanization, combined with the decline of timber sales on federal land over the past several years, has cost jobs in timber-dependent communities.
\
I just believe we need to make a full-court press to solve the immediate job situation, Baird said.
\
At the same time, a federal effort to thin small trees from overcrowded forests has languished.
\
A cap-and-trade system could provide new market incentives to reinvigorate rural economies and improve forest health, Baird said.
\
In essence, the system establishes an overall allowance for greenhouse gas emissions. The allowance is capped and gradually lowered. Institutions then may trade carbon credits, rewarding those that undershoot their emission allowances while punishing those that dont.
\
Congress this week will debate a bill creating a nationwide cap-and-trade system.
\
However, Walden pointed out that the bill excludes biomass culled from timber sales on national forests. Walden, who sponsored the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 with Baird, said he intends to seek changes in the cap-and-trade bill to promote thinning on federal forests.
\
That sounded good to Tom Partin, president of the American Forest Resource Council, an industry group based in Portland.
\
Partin said federal forest managers wont be able to pull biomass out of the forests without offering a direct incentive in the form of a straight timber sale or stewardship contract. Limbs, tree tops and other debris then could be hauled out rather than left behind or burned as slash.
\
I dont see biomass coming out on its own, Partin said in an interview. Thats just a fact of where we are price-wise right now.
\
On state and private timberland, where logging occurs much more regularly than on federal land, biomass generally stays put. The biomass stays on the forest floor simply because there is little reason to haul away the limbs and tree tops shaved off the merchantable logs.
\
Today, there is no economic value to it, Inslee said. As soon as we pass the cap-and-trade bill, there will be.

23,"
Democratic and Republican lawmakers don't agree on how to improve education or teacher pay, protect the environment, reduce health care costs or make government more efficient.
\
But they seem to agree their upcoming two-year budget-writing legislative session, which starts Monday, should not approach the brinkmanship of the last two-year budget cycle.
\
Caucus leaders and budget writers staked out their opening positions last week, claiming they're optimistic the upcoming session won't go into extra innings this year.
\
""I believe that we are going to get out of here in 105 days,"" said Rep. Bruce Chandler, R-Granger, at The Associated Press Legislative Preview in Olympia on Thursday. ""And I believe we will have a budget that makes everyone unhappy.""
\
The talking points about beginning the session in good-faith negotiations were similar in 2013, when the last two-year budget was drafted. But that session ended in June, well beyond the regular 105-day session, with government agencies scrambling for contingency plans in the event of a shutdown.
\
""If we are doing our duty for the citizens of the state, we won't go there again,"" Senate Minority Leader Sharon Nelson, D-Maury Island, said Thursday.
\
The sunny outlook comes in spite of historic pressures from court rulings to increase funding to education and pay for the proper care of mental health patients, while Democrats also say it's time to give teachers pay increases for voter-mandated cost-of-living adjustments that have been deferred for the last six years.
\
At the same time, Gov. Jay Inslee has put forth a capital gains tax proposal to meet those demands as well as a cap-and-trade program and carbon tax that would demand more from the state's biggest polluters.
\
Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, has already stated he ""can't support"" the cap-and-trade proposal. The most Republicans could support, he said, would be creating market incentives to reduce carbon output that don't put new costs on businesses.
\
Meanwhile Chandler, the Republicans' chief budget writer in the House, has said any tax increase would ultimately find its way to the ballot for voters to decide.
\
""If we simply pass a tax increase and don't put a referendum on it, there will be an initiative and the voters will put it on the ballot themselves,"" Chandler said in an interview Friday. ""The voters are going to be heard on this and I think they should be heard first rather than last.""
\
Remy Trupin, executive director of the liberal policy group Washington Budget & Policy Center, said state officials and voters will be educated on the hard realities facing the state's education and transportation systems, and he thinks they'll see the value in Inslee's tax proposals.
\
""If the public gets what the impact of these things are, I think it's all possible,"" Trupin said.
\
But before that would happen, both parties will also have to come to terms on whether new revenue is needed to solve any of the challenges facing government services in the coming biennium and beyond. Senate Republican budget writer Andy Hill of Redmond has stated emphatically that there is no budget deficit in terms of meeting the state's constitutionally mandated functions because revenue will grow in the biennium.
\
But that is something his Democratic counterparts don't see when they do the math.
\
""It's a myth that the budget deficit is a myth,"" said Senate Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Karen Fraser, D-Thurston County.
\
Projected revenue for the upcoming biennium is nearly $37 billion, according to the Office of Financial Management, almost $3 billion more than the previous biennium from 2013-15. Democratic leaders say as much as another $3 billion on top of that may be needed if the Legislature doesn't defer voter-approved Initiative 1531, which would require between $1.2 billion and $2 billion to reduce class sizes in K-12 education.
\
The Legislature would need a two-thirds majority vote to put off the implementation of that initiative. House Democratic budget writer Ross Hunter, D-Medina, whose caucus has the most members that support the initiative, indicated he doesn't see any room for it in the 2015-17 budget.
\
""When you look at things that can't be funded, they won't be,"" Hunter said Thursday.
\
Jason Mercier, of the conservative Washington Policy Center, said in an interview he expects the class-size initiative voters approved in 2014 to be the foremost hang-up in successfully drafting a budget. He said he doesn't think there are enough Democrats at the moment to help make up the two-thirds vote needed to defer the initiative.
\
""What passed at the ballot box will not be implemented this session,"" Mercier said. ""The question is in suspending that or putting it back on the ballot with a corresponding tax source.""
\
Lawmakers have until June 30, when the 2013-15 biennium officially ends, to approve a budget without forcing a government shutdown. The next biennium begins July 1.
\
The carbon tax discussion has all but derailed talk of a gas tax increase that was the center of transportation talk over the last year, Mercier said. Chandler said he's not sure what the governor's proposals mean for the prospect of a transportation package.
\
""I'm a little bit confused by the governor on whether it's a choice between the carbon tax and the gas tax or whether he's advocating both,"" Chandler said.
\
Inslee spokeswoman Jaime Smith said the governor has dropped the gas tax proposal in favor of his carbon tax plan, which charges businesses that emit 2,500 metric tons per year, with that threshold being lowered over time and a goal of reducing emissions overall. Businesses can purchase carbon emission allowances from others as part of the cap-and-trade program in order to avoid penalties.
\
Smith said the governor's proposal would raise $12 billion over 12 years, roughly the same estimate associated with last year's gas tax proposal.
\
But the gas tax remains an option for Senate Transportation Chairman Curtis King, R-Yakima, so long as a package of Republican reforms to cut costs to the state is included. King said a new revenue source is needed and he prefers the gas tax because that money is protected by the state constitution from being diverted to unrelated projects.
\
""There's no guarantee a carbon tax will go entirely to roads and bridges and highways,"" King said Friday.
\
While the budget and new revenue proposals will dominate the session, they won't be the only high profile or important pieces of legislation lawmakers will consider. What follows are some issues of importance to the Yakima Valley that are likely to come up.
\
Agriculture
\
Many growers in the fruit industry have concerns about Inslee's proposed efforts to limit carbon emissions, said Jon DeVaney, president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association based in Yakima.
\
""His direction to the Department of Ecology to draft a new state low-carbon fuel standard could substantially increase fuel and energy costs, which is a concern for the transportation-intensive agricultural sector,"" DeVaney said in an emailed statement.
\
While Democrats have sought to close tax breaks in order to generate revenue, most of the agricultural community hopes the Legislature keeps a variety of tax breaks for the industry, said Steve George, president of the Yakima County Farm Bureau.
\
""We have some tax preferences we'd certainly like to keep because that generates more business and stimulates the economy,"" he said.
\
As one example, businesses can qualify for a sales-and-use tax exemption on equipment and facilities used in livestock nutrient management. And certain replacement parts for farm machinery and equipment, and related services, enjoy exemption from sales taxes.
\
Mike Gempler of the Washington Growers League, a Yakima-based association that focuses on labor issues, said some growers seek more funding to train farm laborers to safely handle pesticides. Growers also want continued support of farm worker housing construction.
\
The Washington Growers League plans to ask for roughly $500,000 to double the scope of the state Department of Agriculture's farm worker education program, said Gempler, adding he's realistic about getting it.
\
""Asking for any kind of money is difficult,"" he said.
\
Agriculture is expected to oppose a bill proposed by the Agriculture Department that might apply specifically to Yakima County and two west side counties where dairy manure has been linked to water pollution problems.
\
The proposal would make farmers who buy manure from dairies and apply it as a fertilizer subject to similar regulations as dairy farmers. Currently, once manure leaves the dairy, there are no regulations to ensure that manure is applied at appropriate times and at rates that crops can use.
\
The goal is to protect surface and groundwater from manure run-off. It's already controversial. The plan has been criticized by the agricultural industry as unnecessary over-regulation and by some environmentalists as a way for the state to avoid enforcing existing water-quality laws.
\
Natural resources
\
The Department of Ecology has requested $30 million for capital projects that are part of the 30 year, $4 billion Yakima Basin Integrated Plan.
\
The request is comparable to federal funding for the plan - a joint proposal by Ecology and the federal Bureau of Reclamation - expected over the next two years, said Derek Sandison, Ecology's lead on the issue.
\
The request includes: $9.5 million for work at Kachess and Keechelus reservoirs; $9.5 million for fish passage at Cle Elum Dam and Tieton Dam; $5 million for agricultural and municipal water conservation; $5 million for habitat improvement work; and $500,000 each for water bank development and a groundwater storage pilot project.
\
But Inslee's capital budget proposal calls for $15 million for the Integrated Plan's projects.
\
Meanwhile, Sen. Jim Honeyford, R-Sunnyside, is sponsoring legislation that would create a funding mechanism for water infrastructure projects around the state, including water supply, flood control and storm water projects.
\
The details are still being worked out, but basically a new program would give local governments an opportunity to compete for grants and loans to fund needed water infrastructure projects.
\
Forest thinning across Eastern Washington and the funds to do it will be pushed by the Department of Natural Resources in order to reduce the risks of catastrophic wildfires.
\
The department is asking for $20 million for the next biennium - up from the current funding level of $4 million - to reduce the wildfire hazards in unhealthy forests.
\
Recent studies have shown that 3.5 million acres in Eastern Washington are in need of thinning work that has been proven to reduce wildfire severity - that's more than 5,000 square miles.
\
State Forester Aaron Everett told the Herald-Republic in December that the current pace of restoration work isn't keeping pace with the growing need, which leads to escalating wildfire danger.
\
According to the National Resources Department, $20 million could treat 45,000 acres, including state lands and private lands in partnership will small forest landowners.
\
The governor's budget also includes $2 million for the management of the 50,000-acre Teanaway Community Forest, created by the Legislature as part of approving the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan in 2013.
\
Social services
\
Meanwhile, local social service providers are keeping close watch that their budgets aren't tapped to help fund other needs.
\
""We're on high alert,"" Lori Brown, director of Yakima-based Aging and Long-Term Care of Southeast Washington, said in a recent interview with the Herald-Republic.
\
State-only funding for programs at Entrust Community Services in Yakima are also at risk, according to Mark James, community relations director at the Yakima program. Entrust provides a range of services, including employment support and training, for adults with disabilities.
\
Nursing homes, meanwhile, received $22 million in Medicaid dollars last year, but are still operating at rates well below cost. They are hoping for another adjustment.

Tuition increases are unreasonable
\
In response to the Feb. 4 story WSUV students raise voices, protest potential cuts, I am a Clark College student who plans to transfer to WSUV next year, but if the cost of tuition continues to rise and financial aid continues to drop, I along with many other students will not be getting a degree. In these economic hardships, it is the time to support and stand behind education and the future of our country. We have grown up in a country that supposedly supports education and building toward a brighter future. Budget cuts are doing exactly the opposite.

Be diligent in finding elder care
\
I was saddened to read recent stories on abuse in adult family homes in Washington state. In any industry, unfortunately, there are always the few that can give an industry a negative image. I want to speak up for the many excellent adult family homes that provide a safe and caring home environment for so many seniors and developmentally disabled adults. As a RN delegator for the state, I am in homes weekly and witness caregivers who value the dignity of the individual and advocate for their choices and rights daily. An adult family home can provide a nurturing, more personal, less institutional environment than a nursing home at a more affordable cost.
\
Do your research by looking up the homes license, history and the qualifications of the caregivers. Background checks are required of all who work or live in the home. Ask questions, show up unannounced. Communication is of utmost importance. Approximately 6 percent of adult family homes in Clark County are owned and operated by registered nurses. Lets be more diligent and alert to prevent the horrors of elder abuse. Lets also give credit to caregivers who give selflessly every day to make a positive difference for vulnerable adults.

Obamas hypocrisy is stunning
\
It seems our teleprompter president cannot speak without his electronic crutch notes. In a recent news conference, he identified a Navy corpsman as a corpse-man. National news media denigrated Sarah Palin, having written a few reminders in her palm when speaking at a recent rally. The hypocrisy is stunning.
\
Our Founding Fathers embroiled strong debates, like health care now, but their conduct was rooted in different principles and the premise that men can disagree and still be respected, that the core of this great nation is a faith in God, and the slowly evolving Constitution was a work of great promise. Every facet of this president has been questioned, from his tenure in a church cemented in vitriol, to his reluctance to wear a patriotic pin on his lapel, to his tongue-in-cheek moniker as Chief Apologist. Why should the opposition bow to a man who claims to be a leader, yet leads through condescending insolence? His credibility is ruined. This is Obamas economy now, his job losses, and his responsibility to fix it. Americans are waking up to this Anointed One, as Massachusetts demonstrated, and so can we all.

Presidents achievements listed
\
In her Feb. 13 letter, President should have more influence, Ann Harris asked if her vote was wasted on Barack Obama. What has he accomplished in a year? I would answer: the stimulus package; tax reductions; elimination of the F-22 fighter program, saving millions; Sonia Sotomayor; Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act; expansion of SCHIP to cover 4 million children; public lands bill to protect 2 million acres of wilderness; credit card reform; regulation of tobacco by the FDA; stem-cell research; expansion of AmeriCorps. There are achievements on the world stage; the Cairo speech; not turning over Afghanistan to the Taliban; strengthening of the Department of State; renewed engagement throughout the world; leadership in world climate change; ban on torture; organized and effective responses to H1N1 and Haiti disasters.
\
I also voted for Obama, and Im proud of these accomplishments. I dont regret my vote. Of course, its not enough. Im impatient for health insurance reform; closure of Gitmo; re-regulation of banking; ending Iraq and Afghanistan wars, ending dont ask, dont tell; passage of Card Check; and carbon cap-and-trade. Do I wish I had voted for McCain-Palin? Nope, not for a minute.

Now is not the time to give up
\
As a person who survived a heart attack and the ensuing quadruple bypass surgery, I have a personal stake in getting health reform passed. My total for the two hospitals and the surgery was well over $175,000. Thank God I had insurance through my employer then. In this tough economic time, I have changed jobs. Now I dont have the medical insurance to make myself feel secure should I have another major medical situation come up that I wont go broke and lose my home due to huge medical bills. A new federal study shows that health care spending rose to an estimated $2.5 trillion last year, or just over $8,000 per person.
\
If we dont stand up to the Republicans and the conservative Democrats now, the economic burden will continue to mount, with more lost jobs, more families pushed into bankruptcy and even more foreclosures. If our politicians stand up again and insist on health care reform, we can make it happen still. I urge my elected representatives to fight hard for health care reform and not let a single vote be the difference between passing comprehensive health reform and doing nothing. Doing nothing isnt working.

Republicans have better answer
\
Real health care or Obama care? Barack Obama and his Democratic Congress often challenge Republicans to produce a better health care plan than theirs.
\
What Democrats will not acknowledge is that Republicans have a common-sense plan to help lower premiums, cut the deficit, and expand coverage without government intrusion. This bill will not raise taxes or add to the deficit. It will, however, allow for small businesses to keep and hire new workers without any government takeover.
\
To drive down the soaring health care costs for all Americans, this Republican bill will end lawsuits that drive up costs, by turning to real medical liability reform; allow small businesses to pool together to purchase affordable coverage; allow Americans to buy insurance across state lines; bolster free market health saving accounts; prohibit taxpayer funding for abortion; expand coverage for those with pre-existing conditions; and lets employers reward workers who lead healthy lifestyles.
\
All of the above has been suggested by the alleged party of no.

Allow small pleasures to be enjoyed
\
I dont smoke and never have, but I support a persons right to smoke even if they live in public housing. The one place where a person should be able to smoke is in their own home, even if its rented. Private landlords can ban smoking because the people who rent from them usually have other options. The people who live in public housing dont have other options. They often have to wait a long time to get access to an apartment they can afford. To ban smoking in their apartments is discrimination against some of the people who public housing is trying to help.
\
I would much prefer to have a neighbor who smokes than one who gets drunk and beats his wife. Why shouldnt a person who cant afford to play golf at a country club or go to a play have a small pleasure in life such as smoking?

Smoking should disqualify from aid
\
I was appalled when I read the June 28 story An old familiar lifestyle is ... gone in a puff. As a taxpayer, I am incensed that Teri Richard, someone who relies on taxpayer money for their livelihood, would be so bold as to advertise a three-pack-a-day habit in this forum. At an average of $6 dollars a pack, three packs a day is $540 dollars a month on her vice. More than her rent.
\
Were she to add that to the $377 a month she now pays for rent, she would be living better than many of those paying the taxes that support public assistance programs. Those people are not mean. They are angry. I would vote that, if you are a smoker, you are automatically disqualified for assistance that is meant for necessities, not vices.

Many experts state that talking on the cell phone causes a significant lack of awareness of the ability to concentrate on driving. It appears that this editorial is downgrading the emphasis on reckless driving.

HOV lane is a punishment
\
Can someone tell me why the only HOV lane in the state of Oregon has nothing to do with Oregon traffic?
\
Why isnt there a southbound HOV on Interstate 5 going south of Portland? Why isnt there one on Interstate 84 going east or Highway 26 going west? Is Oregons only HOV lane there to punish Vancouver drivers?
\
Think about the insanity of the HOV. It is designed to speed along traffic by encouraging carpooling, but all it has done is make everyone move to the right two lanes where the many entrance ramps full of commuters are trying to get on.
\
Even if you are carpooling, trying to get on I-5 and get over to the HOV lane is painful.
\
If the HOV lane was eliminated, traffic would move much faster.
\
Have you ever noticed that there is no traffic mess once you cross the bridge? An average car burns over a gallon of fuel an hour sitting in traffic.
\
Lets help our environment and cut out the wasted fuel and time. Lets get rid of the HOV.
\
Maybe then we wouldnt need a new bridge.

Middle-class insured caught in middle
\
Congress must consider passing legislation for a public health care plan, allowing people to chose private or public plans.
\
Availability to all would be a blessing to those who have not been able to afford health care.
\
Currently, my family is dependent upon the state of Washington Retirement Health Care plan. This plan is an HMO, and very expensive.
\
Middle-class people are caught in a bind: No health care and you jeopardize your financial future by risking all your assets. I am unwilling to risk that, so we are billed almost $1,500 a month. How many can afford that bill (and remember, co-pays add on to the monthly costs)?
\
The time is now to find a national health care plan with real bargaining clout. In order to control costs and compete with private plans, a strong public health insurance option must be made available.
\
Costs continue to rise, and with the economy, more and more people find health care unaffordable.
\
As a nation, we should meet a standard of accountability that means affordable medical insurance is available. We need to make the health care system accountable and transparent to Congress and the voters.
\
Time is of the essence; we need to get costs under control and health care on track.

Defend vote without full reading

Nancy called and Brian answered, and we all got the shaft. Id like to ask how our Congressman Brian Baird, D-Vancouver., can vote on two of the largest pieces of legislation (stimulus and cap-and-trade) in the countrys history without reading them completely. (Reported in June 27 story Wood-waste provision drew Bairds vote.)

Adjust to what existed first
\
Ive lived in Felida, for nearly 40 years, in one of the last houses before you drop down to the Northwest 122nd Street railroad crossing. I also hear the warning sounds of the trains, but unlike the people complaining about what they call noise, I actually informed myself before moving to the area. Its like when people move near an airport and start complaining about the airplanes flying over, or moving near a dairy farm and complaining about the smell.I personally dont like car horns that are electronically activated when locking the car doors or loud, rude people talking on their cellphones in public places. The list goes on, but I am adjusting.It seems odd how for decades we never heard anyone make much noise about the trains and yet in recent years with all the castles being built, we now do. Maybe, just maybe, these people should do a little research before purchasing a home near train tracks. Or maybe learn to adjust to your surroundings. Or maybe, just maybe, move.

Bridge idea is joke on commuters
\
So Clark County Commissioner David Madore wants to build a bridge from 192nd Avenue across the Columbia River, funneling traffic onto Airport Way in Oregon and later onto Interstate 84.He has got to be kidding. Does the man ever drive on Airport Way or I-84? Does he not know that these two roadways are already over crowded? Maybe he should get out of his county and find out what goes on around him before proposing such an outlandish idea.

Improve crossings between states
\
The traffic congestion between Clark County and Portland on both the Interstate 5 and Interstate 205 bridges is getting much worse. Recently I was traveling from Yacolt to Portlands Veterans Affairs Medical Center.When I approached the freeways, there was massive traffic congestion so I had to reroute to Harbor Drive to get to Airport Way to approach the on-ramp to the I-205 bridge. It took one hour and 39 minutes to arrive home.I spoke before the Clark County Board of Commissioners and stated that before any bridge proposals, this traffic congestion problem needs to be resolved immediately. It affects the commuters, and it affects the trucking industry in lost time and profits. Any bridge will work, but the bickering over the last bridge didnt gain any traction and wasted valuable funds that could have been used for purchasing more buses to relieve traffic congestion on both bridges in the short term. What is needed is more jobs in Clark County and not giving all the jobs to Oregon.My family purchased a 9-acre property in Yacolt, where the environment is peaceful and our grandchildren have decent friends. Back in Gresham, Ore., their former friends got involved in drugs. Here they have a better future with a better education system.We want better things for our new state and a better future for our family.

Lobby legislation for carbon tax
\
Kudos to state Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, for acknowledging the need for climate action while describing some plans drawbacks. Cap and trade cause rising prices. Administratively imposed regulations feel dictatorial and are inefficient.Unfortunately, Rivers omitted an option that costs the public nothing, doesnt involve administrative tyranny, is transparent and allows the free market to decide between hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear and other non-emitting options. Henry Paulson, George W. Bushs secretary of the Treasury, advocates for a carbon tax. Rivers omitted this option perhaps because it includes the word tax. If fossil-fuel producers pay a carbon tax on their fuels, the free market will develop alternative fuels to avoid the taxes.If tax revenues are returned to the public in rebates, well be protected from energy price increases.A rebated carbon tax will reduce emissions. The public wont suffer. Only fossil-fuel companies will suffer. Honestly, though, the only way to slow climate change is via lower emissions, which ultimately hurts fossil-fuel companies.As for Rivers concern about China, Congress can make Chinese manufacturers pay our carbon tax until China enacts its own. Guess how long that will take.I encourage Rivers to lobby Republican members of Washingtons congressional delegation to sponsor national carbon tax and rebate legislation.For information on the many ways carbon taxes benefit the economy, contact Citizens Climate Lobby.

Where is July 4 celebrated for months on end? You guessed it in Clark County. I live just a few blocks outside the city limits. Fireworks in my area of the county started in mid-June. Im still hearing them, and were now into August.It appears that the M&M boys, Clark County Commissioners David Madore and Tom Mielke, are dead set against listening to the people who actually vote. The majority of voters in the fall of 2013 wanted to restrict fireworks to the Fourth of July only.In a poll in The Columbian, the majority also wanted it restricted to the fourth. So now the M&Ms want to waste even more taxpayer dollars and do their own survey? Well, you can be sure that the voters will remember this when they are up for re-election.

"
27,"OLYMPIA - Lawmakers this weekend passed two major climate change bills that would put caps on carbon emissions from large polluters and push fuel companies to make cleaner products - two proposals long soughtby Gov. Jay Inslee and Democrats.\The cap-and-trade and low carbon fuel standard proposals passed in both chambers after big changes, including tying them to a 5-cent gas tax increase to help fund a transportation package.\""We're the home of 21st century climate action,"" cap-and-trade sponsor Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, said on the floor Saturday.\Both proposals were pushed through in the final days of the session. Supporters say they're long overdue to address climate change.\""We finally have meaningful climate legislation that reflects the values and priorities of Washingtonians, and that respects the science of climate change,"" Inslee said in prepared remarks.\A cap-and-trade program in Washington would set a cap on carbon pollution and greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2023. The largest polluters in the state would need to either clean up their work to meet the cap or purchase allowances from the state.\The state would then receive the revenue generated from those allowances, which it would use to improve the environment and invest in programs to help those disproportionately affected by climate change, including people of color, tribal communities and low-income earners.\Washington would be only the second state, behind California, to have such a plan.\In a statement, Fawn Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians and vice president of the Quinault Indian Nation, said the Legislature ""boldly confronted"" the existential threat of climate change.\""Our collective spirit soars for the ancestors whose example we have finally heeded, and for our youth and children who deserve to live in this beautiful and blessed land the way the Creator intended it,"" she said.\Opponents argued the plan would hurt businesses, which could mean higher costs for fuel, electricity or food. During the debate, Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, said the bill is ""deeply regressive"" with high gas tax increases.\Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, said the bill will drive businesses and families from the state who can't afford to stay.\""What are my grandchildren going to do? Because their best opportunity will be to get the heck out of Washington,"" he said.\A similar climate bill, the clean fuels standard, passed the Legislature on Sunday. It aims to use progressively cleaner transportation fuels in the state, including those used in cars, trucks, boats, trains and aircraft.\Beginning in 2023, polluters must start reducing their emissions a little bit each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20% below 2017 levels by 2038.\Fuel companies can either clean up their fuels by producing biofuels or mixed fuels. If they can't, they would be required to purchase ""credits"" to make up for emissions that go above the allowed amount.\During the floor debate, Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, said the bill lays the foundation for ""a safer climate for every single person in the state.""\""This bill is not the silver bullet,"" he said. ""No bill will be.""\For residents at the pump, that could mean more fuel options to choose from, said Leah Missik, Washington transportation policy manager at Climate Solutions, a Seattle-based nonprofit. Aside from regular and diesel, there may also be a more mixed, cleaner option.\Oregon, California and British Columbia all have similar clean fuels standard systems.\Opponents of the bill, however, say it will raise prices for people buying gas in Washington. And with cap-and-trade as well as the proposed 5-cent tax increase, it could mean too much for working families, Republicans said.\Rep. Mary Dye, R-Pomeroy, called the bill ""a trifecta of taxes"" that is bad for middle class families in the state.\Both climate proposals are now tied to at least a 5-cent gas tax increase, meaning they cannot go into effect as scheduled unless the Legislature passes a transportation revenue package that includes one. Lawmakers have said a new transportation revenue package is needed to pay for more roads, highways and infrastructure investments across the state.\Without one, the transportation budget that passed Saturday only ""keeps the lights on,"" as Sen. Steve Hobbs, D-Lake Stevens, has said.\Democrats want to tie new investments in transportation to climate policies, so the state is investing in new infrastructure while simultaneously cleaning the air.\A transportation package did not pass this session, but lawmakers have indicated they want to continue working throughout the interim. If a deal is reached before January, they may call themselves back into special session to pass one.\Missik said both the clean fuels standard and cap-and-trade proposals are complementary of each other in how they both look to reduce emissions, but they can also stand alone.\The bills now head to Inslee's desk where he will almost certainly sign.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"

Spare special needs
\
To the editor -- I saw on the news May 8 that the Yakima School District was having a meeting to decide how to spend a $20 million surplus in funds. I had an Individual Education Plan meeting on May 7 with my grandson's teacher and she tells me that they had cut funding for their program. What is up with that? This program is unique as it is for behaviorally challenged children. Without it my grandson would not be succeeding in school. According to the superintendent there were not enough kids in the program and they were closing a classroom. Kids with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and other behavior disorders would well qualify for this program. This program works!
\
My grandson was on the verge of not being in school at all and definitely not succeeding in mainstream school. If kids are having extreme behavior problems at school, then the school counselor should be able to see something is wrong and the teachers too. They have our children 61-2 hours a day. Please do not cut any more funding for our special-needs programs. These kids need to have a chance at life too. Instead of making our teachers accountable for learning, make them accountable for making sure that our kids are in an environment where they are able to learn.

Inslee has it wrong
\
To the editor -- Bill Gates once observed that he did not know anyone he would say is smarter than Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's former chief technology officer and now co-founder of Bellevue-based Intellectual Ventures, an invention company that controls over 20,000 patents.
\
Chapter 5 in the book ""Superfreakonomics"" details Intellectual Venture's geoengineering concepts to reverse global warming that are simple and relatively inexpensive. Myhrvold states ""Carbon dioxide is not the major greenhouse gas. The major greenhouse gas is water vapor."" He adds: ""Global warming activists ... are seriously proposing doing a set of things that could have enormous impact -- and we think probably negative impact -- on human life. They want to divert a huge amount of economic value toward immediate and precipitous anti-carbon initiatives, without thinking things through. This will have a huge drag on the world economy.""
\
Jay lnslee led passage of the 2009 House cap-and-trade bill. He advocates postponing the Keystone XL pipeline until a full life-cycle assessment of greenhouse gases is determined to agree with Obama's climate change priorities. He supports allowing utilities to raise rates if people use less energy. Jay Inslee is obviously not the smartest person in the climate change debate.

Trouble in Union Gap
\
To the editor -- Union Gap's hiring freeze makes no sense at all. Councilman Dan Olson got great press coverage drawing attention to the number of city employees who have quit recently, but failing to replace them is ludicrous.
\
Thinking you're saving money by leaving positions open demoralizes remaining workers who have to do more work. A 3.5 percent pay increase is overdue, but fails to compensate if asked to do twice as much work.
\
Both fire and police departments were in the middle of hiring replacements when Mr. Olson's hiring freeze bombshell hit at the council meeting on May 14. This can only backfire if current staff racks up a lot of overtime hours to cover, busting allotted budget projections.
\
Yes, removal of mold from City Hall may be unknown expense. Taking it out on employees does nothing to promote harmony of city government.
\
To put it another way, as a taxpayer, I expect police and fire departments to be on service 24 hours, seven days a week. If the number of employees and budget are compromised, I must say that I'm not getting what I'm paying for.

God's law on marriage
\
To the editor -- I have gay people in my family, and had gay friends in Seattle. I do not dislike them. What I dislike is anyone trying to change our traditions and values. Whether it is atheists wanting us to stop believing what we believe because they don't agree, or foreigners demanding we abide by their lifestyle.
\
No one is telling gays they can't be together; what we are saying is find another word. Not marriage. That one is already taken for people who believe in God and obey his laws. They should not judge you. It is God's law, he will judge you.
\
Don't let anyone divide our country by pretending to care after saying he believed in one man and one woman, and now that he needs your vote, Mr. Nice Guy. We all know how it is to be lied to. So stand up for yourself. Until you find a word that meets your needs, make your partner your power of attorney, and make a will to protect you for the future.

Back traditional marriage
\
To the editor -- North Carolina approved by over 60 percent a state constitutional amendment defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman. There are now 38 states defining marriage as such and 30 by state constitutional amendment.
\
No matter how liberal the state is, if the people have a chance to vote, they will always vote for traditional marriage. The only chance the homosexual lobby has to pursue same-sex marriage is through the legislatures or the courts.
\
The sponsors of Initiative 1192 believe it should be up to the people, not the politicians, to not change the biblical definition of marriage.

Please support the petition for I-1192, marriage equals one man and one woman, by not only signing it, but having your family and friends, who are legal voters, sign it as well.

29,"The last Friday in April is National Arbor Day. You knew that, didn't you? Born in the Victorian era, Arbor Day began mainly as a gentle reminder to admire trees as things of beauty. As an environmental observance, it has been upstaged by the more comprehensive Earth Day (itself now almost 50 years old). But Arbor Day has been very much updated.\The status of trees as uniquely important environmental players has risen in recent years. Trees are now on the front lines in the battle against climate change. That's because forests absorb nearly 40 percent of human-made fossil fuel emissions every year. Burning wood and rotting trees release carbon dioxide into the air.\This makes massive deforestation a harbinger of doom for the environment as we know it. Fortunately, there are ways to head this off. Proposals to create a carbon-offset market for trees, if put in motion, could reverse the destruction. Right now, these cap-and-trade setups are open only to utilities and industrial companies. Adding trees to a cap-and-trade system would let owners of forested acres make real money by not cutting down trees.\The fate of tropical forests, particularly in Southeast Asia, is of greatest concern. The ranching, mining and timber industries have played a major role in leveling more than a billion acres of tropical forest over the last 40 years. The loss of these trees contributes an estimated 12 to 15 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions a year.\Here's a simplified version of how a market for trading carbon offsets now works: Company A reduces its emissions below a government-set cap. Company B's emissions, by contrast, exceed the limit. To avoid paying a penalty, Company B buys offset credits from Company A.\The price of credits is set by supply and demand. That these systems are market-oriented pleases conservatives committed to fighting climate change. Trade in these markets already totals billions of dollars a year.\Some 40 countries now put a price on carbon. Some do it via cap-and-trade. Others, such as Canada, place a tax on fossil fuels, with most of the proceeds going back to Canadians through reductions in their tax bills. The United States does none of the above, but California and nine Northeast states have established their own cap-and-trade systems.\Where do trees come in? Removing trees increases emissions. Letting them grow reduces them. Putting a price on leaving them alone would act as a powerful incentive to not cut them down.\There remains the dilemma that many locals in and around tropical forests make a living in ways that require their destruction. Under a proposal known as the Rainforest Standard, however, mechanisms would be set up to spend some of the money building new livelihoods not dependent on axing trees. Examples include ecotourism, fishing and harvesting tree products, such as nuts and palm fruit.\Ordinary homeowners don't have big forests to preserve but can nonetheless use trees to reduce their carbon footprint. Trees shading the house have a cooling effect in hot weather, reducing the need for air conditioning. And there is some money in this, of course, in the form of lower electricity bills.\So National Arbor Day is coming. Bear in mind that your state's Arbor Day may fall on a different date than the national one. (Editor's note: In Washington state, Arbor Day is celebrated on the second Wednesday in April.) Many states move their observance to coincide with the best times in their area to plant trees. The big news this year is that in addition to providing beauty and serenity, trees can play a major role in saving our world from catastrophe. Is there a poem for that?\Follow Froma Harrop on Twitter @FromaHarrop. She can be reached at fharrop@gmail.com."
30,"EDITORIAL\If it was not clear before the Legislature got down to business Monday, it's clear now: Neither of the major changes in the Washington tax code proposed by Gov. Jay Inslee will pass in the Senate.\With the two-thirds procedural rule quickly adopted by the Republican majority, just 17 members - one more than one-third - can block bills that would implement a new tax. There are certainly more than 17 senators prepared to stop the governor's cap-and-trade air pollution control plan and his proposed tax on capital gains.\Inslee did not acknowledge this in his State of the State address Tuesday. Instead, he cited an obvious fact the majority of Washington residents have shown they are willing to ignore: the inequity of a tax system that imposes a disproportionate share of the burden on the state's middle- and lower-income residents.\A state income tax might be fairer, but voters in 2010 rejected Initiative 1098, which would have created one. A capital gains tax is much the same thing, with much the same future.\Inslee celebrated Washington's history of innovation, but that has not been true regarding taxation.\In her response to Inslee on behalf of Republicans, Rep. Norma Smith of Clinton started, as Inslee should have, by noting the state expects to collect an additional $3 billion in revenues during the next budget biennium, a better than 8 percent increase that should go a long way - if not all the way - toward meeting court-ordered mandates to increase education funding and support for mental health services.\As revenue projections have advanced with each quarterly report, the possibility the state will be able to pad its reserves and backfill pension accounts has increased.\Smith's comments on Inslee's environmental initiatives were less helpful.\The governor and the Department of Ecology are fighting the good fight against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on water quality regulations. Also, the department last month released a nearly 500-page study, with recommendations, of the potential impacts of more oil train traffic through Washington and how the state can respond.\Knocking cap-and-trade as a substitute for higher gas taxes is easy. Finding money to get the North Spokane Corridor and other projects completed will be hard. Reforms - and they are needed - are not going to get these jobs done.\Senate Republicans last spring blocked a plan that included gas tax hikes. Gasoline was about $1 more per gallon then. If legislators are going to spurn ideas like cap-and-trade, or the expansion of tolling, this is an opportunity to minimize the pain of a tax increase and relieve the congestion that pours tons of pollutants into Washington's skies.\Although the gas tax works less well with every advance in automotive technology, the new Senate rules do not require a two-thirds majority to adjust existing taxes.\The state of this state's roads is detrimental to business, health and the environment. Let's get on with a fix.\To respond to this editorial online, go to www.spokesman.com and click on Opinion under the Topics menu."
31,"OLYMPIA\OLYMPIA - After years of fighting for statewide climate policies, Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday signed into law five bills that aim to address climate change in Washington state.\But Inslee also vetoed parts of the legislation, a move that is expected to spark a lawsuit from leaders in his own party.\The slate of new laws signed Monday will put caps on carbon emissions, create a low carbon fuel standard, limit single-use plastics and reduce the amount of fluorinated gases from air conditioners.\""We are at our best today in Washington state by adopting the best climate change policies in America today,"" Inslee said.\At a bill signing at Shoreline Community College, Inslee signed two of the most controversial, and likely most impactful, pieces of climate legislation this session: a low carbon fuel standard and a ""cap-and-trade"" policy.\Both policies had a line that connected the implementation of the proposals to a 5-cent gas tax increase - a key compromise reached by legislators.\The line was an attempt from Democrats to strike a bargain on decreasing carbon while increasing funding for new roads, highways and other transportation projects.\Inslee vetoed the line in both policies, angering Democratic leadership in the Legislature who said it was the product of weeks of negotiation among lawmakers.\In a veto message, Inslee said the delayed effective date of the policies ""unnecessarily hinders our state's ability to combat climate change, one of the greatest challenges facing our state and the world today.""\Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane, said the vetoes ""undermine the legislative compromises that allowed these bills to reach the governor's desk in the first place.""\He said he agreed to support those compromises in order to pass those bills.\""I am concerned that undoing good faith negotiations will severely hurt our ability to reach agreement on important policies in the future,"" Billig said in a statement.\Billig joined House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, in calling for court action against the veto in the low carbon fuel standard bill, which they say overstepped his power as noted in the state Constitution.\The state Constitution allows for a governor to veto sections of a bill while signing the rest into law, but Inslee vetoed a specific provision.\The Legislature took Inslee to court in 2019 after he vetoed sentences in certain areas of the transportation budget. A Thurston County Superior Court judge invalidated those vetoes.\""He lost in court then,"" Billig said. ""He will lose again.""\Jinkins said in a statement the courts have consistently held that the Legislature is responsible for drafting laws and the executive branch is responsible for implementing them.\Braun called Inslee's subsection veto ""illegal.""\""That alone says a lot about why our political system has checks and balances on one-person rule,"" he said in a statement.\In a similar move last week, Inslee vetoed a section of a bill that would have required all new cars in the state to be electric beginning in 2030. That part of the bill was contingent on a road user fee for most vehicles.\In a veto message, Inslee said the goal of 100% electric vehicles is ""too important to tie to the implementation of a separate policy like the road usage charge.""\Inslee said a transportation revenue package still will get done, but he does not want to delay the implementation of the climate policies to do so.\Sponsor of the low carbon fuels standard Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, said the vetoes do not change the urgency of the Legislature to pass a transportation package. He agreed that the climate policies should go into effect as soon as possible, and he did not think tying the policies to a transportation package would have delayed the implementation.\The Legislature would have likely passed a new transportation package before the 2023 start date anyway, Fitzgibbon told The Spokesman-Review.\""In the end I don't think it would've introduced delay, but it would've introduced uncertainty,"" he said. ""I'm happy to see some of that uncertainty removed.""\Fitzgibbon said he does not agree with the decision to go to court over the issue. While the vetoes add some new elements, he still called Monday a ""historic day"" for the state's fight against climate change.\Under the new laws, fuel companies must start reducing their emissions a little each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20% below 2017 levels by 2038. Fuel companies can clean up their fuels by producing biofuels or mixed fuels. If they can't, they would be required to purchase ""credits"" to make up for emissions that go above the allowed amount.\Washington follows California and Oregon as the last of the West Coast states to implement a clean-fuel standard.\The cap-and-trade plan puts a cap on carbon pollution and greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2023. The largest polluters in the state would need to either clean up their work to meet the cap or purchase allowances from the state. The state would receive the revenue from those allowances.\Washington joins California with having a cap-and-trade plan.\In a statement from Megan Baldino, head of corporate communications at BP, the oil and gas company applauded Inslee for signing the bill as it could put the state on a path to net zero emissions by 2050.\""BP's ambition is to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get to net zero,"" the statement read. ""We look forward to working with state agencies as they develop rules to implement this program and help make our shared ambition a reality.""\Inslee also signed bills that would limit single-use plastics by restaurants. By mid-2023, foam containers made of a type of plastic known as expanded polystyrene, such as the ""clam shell"" takeout boxes will be banned and recyclable materials will be encouraged.\He also signed a bill that limits the amount of fluorinated gases. It authorizes the Department of Ecology to create a threshold for the amount of fluorinated gases used in new air conditioning and stationary refrigerants as well as establishes a recycling program for used air conditioners and refrigerants.\Inslee also signed a bill that would implement recommendations of the Environmental Justice Task Force, which would require an environmental justice analysis on all decision making and an equal distribution of environmental investments statewide. The goal of the legislation is to help communities who disproportionately experience the effects of a worsening environment, such as people of color and low-income communities.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"

Southwest Washingtons emerging clean-technology industry could face long-term setbacks if the U.S. Congress fails to pass a comprehensive energy policy this year, state and local leaders say.
\
Both the House and Senate this session have debated energy bills that seek to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in some form, whether by establishing a carbon cap-and-trade system or a national renewable energy standard. But the proposals have so far failed to move forward.
\
The federal inaction has few immediate consequences to the clean technology industry in Washington, which has its own renewable energy and efficiency standards and has benefitted from large federal recovery act grants for energy projects, said Rogers Weed, director of the Washington Department of Commerce. But many companies are looking toward federal energy legislation as a signal that their investments will yield growth long term, he said.
\
Its an important market signal that would trigger a lot of activity, Weed said.
\
Room to grow
\
Vancouver-based NCS Power, which makes high-efficiency LED street lamps and replacement tubes for fluorescent commercial fixtures, recently landed its first large international order for 5,000 LED tubes, a deal worth several hundred thousand dollars. And it has hired several new employees in the past few months, bringing its total employment to 12, said Chief Executive Officer Bart Adams.
\
But instituting a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would help the company sell more of its products, Adams said.
\
Clients make decisions based on how long it takes for energy savings to equal the cost of installing all new fixtures.
\
Historically, most companies have looked for a return on investment within three years. But many cash-strapped businesses have lowered their return-on-investment threshold to 18 months, Adams said.
\
Without a price on carbon emissions, few companies see carbon reduction as adding to their bottom lines.
\
But the carbon reduction is just one of about 10 metrics NCS Power uses to calculate the financial return on its lighting systems, and so the federal delays arent slowing NCS down. NCS is just not growing as fast as it could.
\
Its not costing us business, Adams said, but it all helps.
\
Similarly, Oregon Iron Works has increased its work force in Vancouver to handle a string of energy-related projects, including a prototype wave-energy buoy, eight new 1,000-ton lift gates for the John Day hydroelectric dam and a nuclear shield door for the Hanford power plant. Company managers expect energy-related projects, which comprise about 10 percent of its business, to rise in coming years as the country increasingly turns to renewable sources of energy, said David Gibson, renewable energy program manager at Oregon Iron Works.
\
But its clients would likely be placing many more orders for renewable projects if a national energy standard was in place, he said.
\
Theres a considerable amount of risk (in these projects), Gibson said. So anything to mitigate that risk would help us.
\
Growth potential
\
Both companies belong to a growing clean-energy sector in Southwest Washington that includes solar industry giants such as Sharp and SEH America, as well as longtime manufacturers, such as Christensen Shipyards and Columbia Machine, that are retooling to compete for renewable energy contracts. The potential for further growth a proposed SEH expansion could create as many as 1,000 jobs has gained the attention of state and local officials.
\
Gov. Chris Gregoire has pegged the clean energy sector as one of a handful of industries with substantial job growth and economic development potential in coming years. And the Commerce Department has set a goal to increase clean-tech manufacturing in the state and boost exports to Asia.
\
Southwest Washington, with its proximity to the Columbia River Gorge and two major rail lines, is well situated to capitalize on that growth. The Port of Vancouver has already boosted its wind turbine imports, which accounted for 220 jobs and 56,000 Longshoreman hours in 2009.
\
The Columbia River Economic Development Council is working with the states clean energy leadership council to build the clean-tech sector in this region and across the state, said Bart Phillips, CEO of the CREDC. A preliminary report will be available in September.
\
In the absence of federal legislation, the state strategy will focus on upping state mandates and purchases to meet its goals for the sector, Weed said.
\
Some argue that the states renewable energy standard has provided enough incentive to Washington businesses, however. What the states clean-tech industry needs now is a more favorable business climate in general, including lower taxes, said Gary Chandler, a lobbyist for the Association of Washington Business.
\
Competition has made it cheaper to import (wind turbines) than to make them, Chandler said. The state needs to look at policy here to make it a better environment for manufacturing. Wed have a lot more people employed in Vancouver right now if we made the technology here.
\
Lack of incentives
\
Regardless of the states economic development plans, the exact effects of a national comprehensive energy plan on the states clean-tech sector is unclear. The likelihood that carbon regulations will pass this year among a slowing economic recovery is increasingly slim. Supporters have so far failed to garner votes from states that still meet most of their energy needs with coal and natural gas-fired plants, which are among the largest carbon emitters. Leaders from these states argue charging extra for carbon emissions is too costly for utilities and businesses to implement.
\
At one level, a national cap and trade will have some increased costs to our businesses, Phillips said. It will (also) level the playing field, and without it, its going to be difficult to stimulate the clean-energy market for us to sell goods and services to.
\
Most state and local officials agree, however, that putting a price on carbon would spur more demand for clean technologies and help the industry grow. This would happen, in part, by offsetting federal subsidies that make it hard for renewables to compete with oil and gas. It would also lower the risk that companies face in investing in new manufacturing facilities and new technologies.
\
If theres no federal legislation, the incentives go away, said Rep. Brian Baird, D-Wash., during a recent visit to Vancouver. It sets us back economically. Its costing us jobs.

What do you think Washington should do about climate change?
\
The Alliance for Jobs and Clean Energy wants to know. The relatively new coalition of faith, labor, social justice and health organizations, along with environmental groups, wants to bring more perspectives and more diversity to the state's conversation about climate change concerns and solutions.
\
To that end, its leaders embarked on a statewide listening tour and they'll be in Yakima on Monday evening for what they are calling a ""community conversation."" The local event is sponsored by two member groups more known for their civic and social activism than environmental issues: the Latino Community Fund and Progreso.
\
One of the goals is to challenge the idea that climate change is a concern for only stereotypical environmentalists of the white, upper-middle-class, liberal variety, said Felipe Rodriguez-Flores, the associate director of the Latino Community Fund in Washington.
\
""We don't want to talk about conservation for conservation's sake. It's about health and safety and quality of life and it's about the economy,"" he said. ""We have a tendency to see issues as separate, but we can't separate the environment from people's lives.""
\
An August poll of Latino voters found that environmental issues are a top concern, ranking ahead of comprehensive immigration reform.
\
Rodriguez-Flores says this makes sense because communities of color and low-income communities frequently end up disproportionately impacted by pollution and other environmental problems.
\
And that's why the Alliance is focused on policies that not only reduce the carbon pollution that drives climate change but also invest in clean energy technology. It also aims to help communities of color and low-income households that are disproportionately harmed by pollution.
\
That's the mission statement, but at this point the Alliance has few policy specifics. It supported Gov. Jay Inslee's cap-and-trade climate policy this spring, which included plans to invest some of the revenue raised from carbon emitters in those disproportionately affected communities.
\
But since that plan failed to gain traction with lawmakers, supporters are back to the drawing board. Hence the statewide listening tour.
\
""If we want to have a strong environmental movement, we need to have everyone involved,"" Rodriguez-Flores said. ""Rather than saying this is why you should care about climate, we want to see what people think we can and should do.""

"
34,"OLYMPIA - After campaigning on carbon restrictions and pushing for a capital gains tax for two terms, Gov. Jay Inslee scored big wins in the Legislature this year.\Aside from addressing COVID-19 recovery and response, the Democratic-led Legislature passed many long-awaited, consequential proposals. Pushed by Inslee, Democrats made last-minute deals on climate change, capital gains, police accountability and drug possession.\Inslee told reporters Monday he had ""never seen a legislative session that was so productive.""\""Their efforts were so broad in the number of things that they worked on in such difficult circumstances in the middle of the pandemic,"" he said.\Since taking office eight years ago, Inslee has pushed for passage of proposals that would lower the state's carbon emissions and help fight a changing climate. His unsuccessful presidential campaign was dedicated to raising awareness on climate change, but until this year, no major policy changes on the issue had passed the Legislature.\In 2012, Inslee campaigned for a low carbon fuel standard, which he said would encourage the use of fuels that have less effect on the climate. In 2014, Inslee laid out plans to cut carbon emissions by implementing a ""cap-and-trade"" proposal that would collect a carbon tax on industries that pollute.\The proposals have been complicated and controversial, with opponents saying they would increase fuel prices and the general cost of living for residents. Some also worried that businesses targeted by pollution caps would leave the state.\But something changed this year. In the final days before the voting deadline, lawmakers reached deals on both climate bills.\Washington joins California, Oregon and British Columbia in adopting a clean-fuels standard, similar to what Inslee has introduced.\Beginning in 2023, fuel companies in Washington must start reducing emissions a little bit each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20% below 2017 levels by 2038. Fuel companies can either clean up their fuels by producing biofuels or mixed fuels. If they can't, they would be required to purchase ""credits"" to make up for emissions that go above the allowed amount.\The cap-and-trade program that passed this year would set a cap on emissions that large polluters in the state would have to meet by 2023. If they can't meet the cap, they could either clean up their work or purchase allowances from the state. The state would receive the revenue generated from those allowances, which it would use to invest in programs that help the environment and communities disproportionately affected by climate change, such as people of color and low-income earners.\Both the clean-fuels standard and the cap-and-trade program that passed over the weekend come with a tie to a 5-cent gas tax increase, meaning neither would go into effect until lawmakers pass a new transportation revenue package.\Inslee said Monday he did not agree with the provisions tying the climate policies to the gas tax increase, but he would not say whether he would be vetoing those lines.\He said he is committed to getting a new transportation package moving, although he did not say for certain whether he would call legislators back into special session.\In a Sunday news conference, Democrats attributed their success this session on so many issues to a variety of reasons. House Speaker Laurie Jinkins said House members were told early in session to limit the number of bills they introduced.\Members really wanted to prioritize consequential bills and move through the session with ""real urgency,"" she said. ""The pandemic pressed us to do bigger things.""\Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane, said lawmakers worked more during the interim this year than in previous years. The pandemic exposed many institutional problems, which built public and legislative momentum to push a lot of bills through.\Sen. Joe Nguyen, D-Seattle, attributed the success to the Legislature being the most diverse it's ever been with more members of color, women and LGBTQ members than before.\The party breakdown in the chambers did not change this year, but some long-term moderate Democrats were replaced with more progressive ones after last November's election.\Another example of where lawmakers were able to reach a deal after years of trying: the capital gains tax.\Democrats have pushed for the policy for years as a way to fix what they say is a regressive tax code in which low-income earners pay proportionately more in taxes than those whose income is higher. In 2014, Inslee introduced a capital gains tax into his budget.\As in other years, Inslee had proposed a capital gains tax in his budget plans in December. His version though looked a little different than the one that eventually passed. It would have implemented a 9% tax on annual investment earnings of $50,000 for a married couple.\The final proposal approved by the Legislature implements a 7% tax on capital gains, including from the sale of stocks, bonds, businesses and other assets, if the profits exceed $250,000.\Lawmakers could never get enough support through both chambers to get Inslee's initial proposal through, as they faced stiff opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats who called it an unconstitutional income tax.\The measure that passed will be signed by Inslee, but will likely face a court challenge.\Inslee's initial plan would have brought in more money for the state than the plan that passed Sunday, which brings in about $415 million in tax revenue.\Inslee acknowledged Monday the capital gains tax rate in the final measure will be lower than those in other states, but said he did not have plans to push for expansion of the bill passed on Sunday. Instead, he said he wanted to first ""celebrate the success"" of a proposal he's worked on for years.\""This will bring a good portion of fairness to our tax system,"" he said.\Along with Inslee's requests, legislators tackled other consequential issues, passing significant reforms in many categories. Here are some other notable policy changes made this session:\POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY\Lawmakers passed almost a dozen police accountability measures, a package that came together almost a year ago after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\Bills include creating a statewide database of use-of-force incidents, requiring officers to intervene when they see another officer use excessive force and easing requirements to decertify officers.\Two others, which received some of the most debate, address police tactics and the standard needed to use force. The police tactics bill prohibits the use of choke holds and neck restraints and limits the use of tear gas, police dogs and vehicle pursuits. It also bans law enforcement agencies from acquiring military equipment.\Lawmakers then changed the policy for when force is allowed. A previous statute allowed for ""any means necessary"" during an arrest. A bill that passed last week requires officers to prioritize de-escalation before employing force.\DRUG POSSESSION\Drug possession will now be treated as a misdemeanor in Washington, punishable by up to 90 days in jail, a $1,000 fine or both.\Prior to February, possession was a felony. But a state Supreme Court decision ruled Washington's drug possession law unconstitutional. Lawmakers began scrambling for a fix. Some wanted to see decriminalization of drug possession and a focus on treatment while others wanted to see at least some criminal penalty.\The compromise: making possession of a controlled substance a misdemeanor, at least for the next two years. In 2023, the criminal penalty will expire, meaning no more arrests for drug possession, unless legislators pass any further laws.\The final bill also focuses heavily on treatment for substance abuse disorder. Those possessing drugs will be diverted to treatment on their first two offenses. Their third offense would be a misdemeanor. It also increases funding for behavioral health services to increase community treatment and outreach programs for addiction.\OPEN CARRY AT DEMONSTRATIONS\Openly carrying firearms at the Capitol campus and at public demonstrations would be illegal, if Inslee gives his final signature.\The proposal came after a year of large armed protests at the Capitol. In January, protesters breached the governor's mansion gate. Last summer, two protests ended with shots fired.\The bill would ban open carry within 250 feet of publicly permitted demonstrations and on the state Capitol campus. People openly carrying a firearm on their private property are exempt, if a protest is occurring outside their home or business. Law enforcement officers are also exempt.\FOREST HEALTH\After years of fighting for more stable funding for wildfire fighting and forest health, Commissioner for Public Lands Hilary Franz garnered support this session for a bill to give substantial funding every two years toward the wildfire effort.\The bill passed unanimously and would set aside $125 million every two years for wildfire response, forest restoration and community resilience.\For wildfire response, it would allow the state to hire 100 more firefighters and expand the air fleet. The bill would also help fund the Department of Natural Resource's 20-year Forest Health Strategic Plan, which treats the state's forests to make them more wildfire resistant. Lastly, it would help communities across the state make investments at a local level to reduce wildfire risk, such as building fuel breaks or doing prescribed burns.\COVID-19 ECONOMIC RECOVERY\With the infusion of billions of federal stimulus dollars, state lawmakers turned their focus to helping the state recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\At the start of the session, lawmakers allocated $2.2 billion for rental assistance, school assistance, public health, food assistance and child care grants.\When Congress passed an additional $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package, lawmakers used about $10 billion of the state's share of funds in their budget for one-time costs related to the pandemic. The final budget allocated funds for vaccine distribution, school reopening and rental assistance.\A portion of the federal funds will assist child care providers across the state. As part of a broad package to address child care shortages statewide, lawmakers expanded eligibility and decreased co-pays for subsidy grants and increased the subsidy rate, supports and grants for providers. In the short-term, federal funds will pay for those expansions. In the long-term, funds would come from revenue generated by the capital gains tax.\Lawmakers also funded the Working Families Tax Credit, which provides between a rebate of $300 to $1,200 for low-income families, depending on how many children they have.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com.\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"
35,"
OLYMPIA - A House committee chairman put his own stamp on a Senate climate change bill Friday, keeping the measure alive but also keeping open the possibility that a new carbon dioxide- emitting coal-fired plant could be built in Kalama or elsewhere in Washington.
\
Without committee action by a Friday deadline, the Senate bill, prime-sponsored by Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, would have been dead for this session. The bill passed the Senate on March 10 on a 35-13 vote. The two chambers have three weeks to work out their differences.
\
Rep. Jeff Morris, chairman of the House Technology, Energy and Communications Committee, redrafted the Senate bill. He said he believed that the bill as it came over from the Senate side ""created enough uncertainty in the process"" that Richland-based Energy Northwest, which is exploring building a coal gasification plant in Kalama, would find it impossible to get financing.
\
""The way the bill was originally drafted would create a natural gas economy,"" he said. ""We tried to make the bill more technology- neutral.""
\
The Senate bill set carbon emission limits at a level that would allow most newer natural gas plants to operate but would be impossible for conventional coal-fired plants to meet - 1,100 pounds of greenhouse gases per megawatt-hour, or the average for a natural gas plant, whichever is lower.
\
It also said that if a company proposed to build a coal-fired plant and permanently inject carbon dioxide emissions underground, a strategy called carbon sequestration, it would have to show that the technology to do that would be available within five years.
\
Energy Northwest President Jack Baker, who hopes to use that technology, testified in a hearing Tuesday that he could not make that guarantee to potential investors.
\
Instead, under the Morris rewrite, any utility that built a new fossil fuel-burning electrical plant or made a long-term purchase of power from a fossil fuel-burning plant could meet the new performance standard by buying carbon credits or making payments to a third party to reduce emissions from other sources.
\
Even if their actual emissions were higher than that standard, all electrical generating plants operating in the state as of June 30, 2008, would be grandfathered in under his bill as long as they offset their total carbon dioxide emissions to bring them down to the new standard.
\
Morris, a Mount Vernon Democrat with a background in energy policy, sponsored the 2004 bill that established Washington's carbon dioxide mitigation program for power plants, one of the first in the nation.
\
At Friday's hearing, lobbyists lingered while negotiations went on for nearly two hours behind closed doors. When Democrats emerged, Morris took aim at the way the Senate bill arrived at his committee, calling it ""one of the poorest-drafted bills I've seen come over from the Senate.""
\
""There were huge policy gaps in the underlying bill that needed to be addressed,"" he said. ""This subject is more than a press release issue.""
\
Pridemore, the sponsor of that bill, could not be reached for comment.
\
'About new pollution'
\
Environmental groups said they were disappointed that the House bill leaves open the possibility that more coal plants could be built in Washington.
\
""The Senate bill was about preventing new pollution,"" said Craig Engelking of the Sierra Club. ""This bill is about paying for new pollution.""
\
Allowing utilities to buy carbon credits to offset emissions won't achieve net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions unless the state also places an overall cap on emissions, a system called cap- and-trade, Engelking said.
\
""This lets you dig the hole deeper,"" he said of the Morris bill. ""We cannot accept legislation that allows an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.""
\
Brad Peck, spokesman for Energy Northwest, welcomed the new language.
\
""With the development costs associated with building a new plant, it's important that investors have confidence that the plant can be built and operated,"" he said. ""This may well provide the clarity that investors will need to be comfortable investing in a facility. We think it represents an acknowledgement that it really is an unfair scenario to expect developers to operate in an environment of open-ended risk.""
\
One last-minute change made to the bill Friday eliminated a sweetener that would have let investor-owned utilities raise rates as high as needed to give their shareholders a 2 percent return on investments they make in energy conservation and efficiency. Morris said he had to agree to that to get the six votes needed to pass the bill out of committee. It passed on a party-line vote, 6-4 with one member excused.
\
Rep. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, voted against the bill but said he was committed to coming up with a better bill by session's end. ""I anticipate this will be an end-game piece of legislation,"" he said.
\
Rep. Dean Takko, D-Longview, said he was voting for the bill reluctantly, because he prefers Gov. Chris Gregoire's approach: appointing a climate change task force and asking its members to look for ways to reduce the state's carbon footprint.
\
""I do have some concerns that what we are doing presupposes what comes out of the governor's office,"" he said. ""I think the governor's work group is the way to go.""
\
Starting the study
\
The governor's new 21-member Climate Action Team, established by executive order in February, met for the first time Friday.
\
The panel, with representation from industry, government and the environmental community, will spend eight months developing a comprehensive strategy for reducing carbon emissions in Washington from all sources, including transportation, which is responsible for more than 40 percent of the state's greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The governor's executive order sets goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Those goals are incorporated in both the Senate bill and Morris' rewrite.
\
The task force is chaired jointly by Jay Manning, director of the Department of Ecology, and Juli Wilkerson, director of the Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development.
\
""We want to be really clear that our focus is not on the science of climate change or about revisiting the goals,"" Wilkerson said. ""It's about the how-to.""
\
Manning said the task the panel will undertake between now and December dwarfs such earlier state efforts as the cleanup of Puget Sound and addressing the needs of Eastern Washington farmers for more water from the Columbia River.
\
""Climate change is overarching,"" he said. ""It's bigger, scarier and so global in nature that the temptation is to throw up our hands and say we can do nothing.""
\
But Washington can't afford to do nothing, he said. ""We have to start preparing the state for the change that's coming. How is Washington going to meet the emissions goals, and how are we going to prepare for the effects that we can't head off?""
\
Rising sea levels and a shrinking snowpack will have major impacts on the state's economy, he said. ""We're going to have to roll up our sleeves and do some real work here.""
\
Members will divide into working groups that will look at issues affecting forests, agriculture, water resources of all kinds, shorelines and human health. The panel has been asked to come up with strategies that could become legislation introduced in the 2008 Legislature.
\
Larry Paulson, director of the Port of Vancouver, said he was pleased to be asked to be a member of the panel because of the importance of climate change to the state's shipping industry, not only at the Port of Vancouver but at container cargo ports in Puget Sound.
\
""We're a very trade-dependent state,"" he said. ""We need to make sure that the ports are doing their part.""

Here are some of the things that Clark County residents already have done to celebrate this years Earth Day:
\
* Planted trees in the Salmon Creek Greenway.
\
* Learned about vermicomposting (using worms to compost kitchen scraps).
\
* Posted signs in 34 supermarket parking lots reminding people to bring and use their own cloth bags.
\
Although Earth Day is officially today, a lot of Clark County residents are already doing their part. We all need to do our part today, and every day. America was a different place in 1970, when the first Earth Day was founded by Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wisconsin. The previous year, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire due to an oil slick. We drove huge cars and didnt worry about slurping 20 gallons of gas driving to the coast and back; it only cost $6. Factories such as Vancouvers Carborondum Co. emitted tons of byproducts into the air. Nobody thought it should be closed.
\
A Camas native, Denis Hayes, was the national coordinator of the first Earth Day. Rather than planting trees or learning about worms, the founders organized protests to draw attention to the plight of the planet. They worked. The 1970s saw creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species acts, and a host of other reforms.
\
And the planet is better for it. Bald eagles are once again a common sight in Clark County. Longtime problems, such as groundwater contamination at the old Ridgefield creosote works, are being cleaned up. And all citizens are more environmentally aware.
\
Earth Day Network, the nonprofit group that organizes Earth Day, currently ranks Portland third among 72 U.S. cities in its urban environment report, behind Fargo, N.D. and Burlington, Vt. As a suburban area, Clark County isnt listed, but we can take pride in sharing Portlands clean air and water, and its high quality of life.
\
Now comes a new challenge: the recession. Amid the worst economic downturn of most of our lives, what will be left for the environment? Our commitment to building a sustainable lifestyle must remain in place. And we should look for opportunities to capitalize on our current situation:
\
* Plant a garden. Gardening has been a popular pastime here since the Hudsons Bay Co. fed its employees, families and visitors. Growing vegetables can save hundreds of dollars per year, and also saves the environmental cost of transportation. Home gardeners also use fewer pesticides and substitute their hand labor for fuel-burning mechanization.
\
* Reuse and recycle. Instead of refrigerating those leftovers in one-time-use plastic, invest in glass containers that can be washed hundreds of times. Consider it a personal challenge to fill the huge new recycling bins being rolled out in the metro area and leave your garbage can half full.
\
* Carpool. With fuel prices much cheaper than 2008, its tempting to fall back on our old driving habits. But sharing a ride to work puts money in your pocket, and less carbon in the air.
\
Of course, these are merely small changes in a big world. What about all the pollution in China? What about a cap-and-trade system for industries? Should Snake River dams be breached to benefit fish? These mega-issues remain. Making small changes today honors the tradition of Earth Day, and the movements enduring motto: Think globally, act locally.

David Hedrick spoke his mind and the mind of the great majority of this area and of this country when he confronted Brian Baird at the recent town hall meeting. This newspaper seems to be clueless that the country is not liberal and actually is more moderate-to-conservative and that a large majority are very upset with what is going on in our government.

Town hall tirades twist the facts
\
The Aug. 26 story Camas mans rant at health care forum goes viral, about David Hedricks tirade at a Brian Baird health care town hall, was most informative. The amount of outright lies in this debate is astonishing: death panels, forcing people into a public option, Obama is a Nazi, and covering advice on how to potty train children?
\
Millions of Americans cannot buy health insurance due to pre-existing conditions. Private insurers deny treatments at their whim. Additionally, 50 different state jurisdictions prevent buying health insurance across state lines. Premiums are skyrocketing due to a variety of causes including paying insurance CEOs exorbitant salaries and shareholder returns. A public option is the way to force real competition among insurers.
\
Many of those who rant dont realize that bureaucrats already get between patient and doctor with private insurance. Some seniors on Medicare rant about government control but dont want to get off it or dont even realize Medicare is government run.
\
Lets get some sanity back to this issue. It is too important to allow private insurers to once again stop any reform at all.

Enjoy a visit downtown
\
See them before they are gone. Downtown Vancouver is all decked out with dozens of beautiful hanging baskets. Not only one but two baskets hang from each lamp post along Main Street and each cross street. They are watered frequently by a diligent crew to keep them flourishing.
\
Among the interesting sites to see in downtown Vancouver is Turtle Place on Seventh and Main, an urban park, with a unique water sculpture, Ramona Falls, and one of the murals that Vancouver has become known for.
\
While downtown, stop at the fudge kitchen with the squeaky screen door or at a pizza parlor with a view of a busy corner from drapery-framed windows. The Visitors Center has information and a $1 token to spend at one of the friendly owner-operated shops.
\
To compliment the hanging baskets, the flower gardens at Esther Short Park are at their finest. Parking is affordable and the streets are clean and inviting, so come on down and enjoy a genuine small-town experience.

Quit funding programs that fail
\
What is a trillion dollars or two between friend or enemies? This is not politics as usual in Washington, D.C. The Ben Bernanke reappointment as Federal Reserve chairman was made to disguise the new $11 trillion debt we will have to pay for the rest of our childrens childrens lives.
\
I guess when the numbers get this large, no one understands what a real mess we have. I understand and Im no radical person, just another American who believes this country still has the potential to be great.
\
We will not be anything but another third world country if our local, state and federal governments continue on this reckless path of spending and unnecessary regulation and just plain lack of understanding about how business and the economy works. Please write your representatives and ask them to stop spending our money on programs that do not work. The cash for clunkers, health care, cap-and-trade, and stimulus programs mostly help our foreign economic competitors.

Advocate end of using mercury
\
Dennis Spains Aug. 18 letter, Mercury fillings: Get second opinion, is incorrect. The FDA web site at www.fda.gov states, Dental amalgam is a mixture of metals, consisting of liquid mercury and a powdered alloy composed of silver, tin, and copper. Approximately 50 percent of dental amalgam is elemental mercury by weight. It releases low levels of mercury vapor that can be inhaled. High levels of mercury vapor exposure are associated with adverse effects in the brain and the kidneys.
\
The World Health Organization, in 1991, confirmed that mercury contained in dental amalgam is the greatest source of mercury vapor in non-industrialized settings, exposing the concerned population to mercury levels significantly exceeding those set for food and for air. While the mercury from amalgam fillings doesnt have a noticeable affect on everyone, it does cause problems for many.
\
I have recovered from mercury poisoning due to fillings by having them removed and chelating the mercury from my body. Im not advocating that everyone have their mercury fillings removed, but Im advocating the end of using mercury fillings in anyone, ever. If it can negatively impact anyone, it shouldnt be used. Mercury is also harmful to the environment. It is toxic.

38,"Carl Mattson gets a small cash bonus for practicing no-till farming on his 4,000-acre dryland wheat farm near Chester, Mont.\Seeding his fields without plowing keeps carbon locked in the soil. ""We don't expose the organic material to oxygen, so we aren't releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,"" explained the third-generation farmer, who sells credits from his greenhouse gas-reducing farm practices on the Chicago Climate Exchange.\At the moment, the credits are worth 70 to 80 cents per acre - a pittance for Mattson, who spends about $100 per acre seeding his fields with the hard red wheat grown on Montana's prairies.\""No one's interested in this for 70 to 80 cents per acre,"" said Mattson, a speaker at Tuesday's annual meeting of the Big Sky Carbon Sequestration Partnership in Spokane. ""We're interested in the potential, if this stuff goes to $20 to $30 per acre.""\Part of the solution to global warming is locking up carbon, said researchers at the Big Sky partnership, a six-state effort headquartered at Montana State University.\Carbon dioxide can be pumped into salty, underground aquifers; stored in the pores of basalt rocks found in the Columbia and Snake River flood plains; captured by trees in temperate forests; or contained in prairie soils.\Storing carbon keeps it out of the atmosphere, helping buffer climate change. But without mandatory limits on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, there's little market incentive to develop carbon sequestration projects, speakers said.\That may change with a new presidential administration. Both candidates say they support a ""cap-and-trade"" system for emissions, which would create pollution allowances for businesses and industries. They could sell credits if they fell below their allotted emissions, or buy offset credits if they exceeded their limits.\It ""puts a price on carbon, and quits making it free to vent into the environment,"" said Melisa Pollak, a research fellow at the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs.\Developing underground carbon storage costs about $30 to $80 per ton of carbon dioxide, Pollack said. Without a strong market for carbon offsets, investors won't fund projects, other speakers said.\In Europe, where carbon dioxide emissions are capped by law, carbon credits run about $22 per ton. The going rate on the Chicago Climate Exchange, where industries voluntarily buy carbon credits to offset pollution, is $1.20 per ton.\In late May, while Congress debated legislation that would have capped U.S. emissions, the Chicago Exchange rate briefly shot up to $7 per ton. The legislation failed, and the price dropped.\A cap-and-trade system could also create new cash flows for Northwest forests.\In the United States, forests absorb about 10 percent of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions each year. About 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide are taken in by forests each year, or stored in wood products.\""Trees eat carbon. They pull it down out of the atmosphere,"" said Jay O'Laughlin, director of the Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Policy Analysis Group at the University of Idaho.\Trees take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, using it to build branches, leaves and roots. Young forests, in their 20s are 30s, soak up the most carbon, but older forests store greater quantities.\At the moment, however, stands of fir, larch and pine are worth more at the sawmill than they are as carbon sinks, O'Laughlin acknowledged.\The Nez Perce Tribe replanted 5,000 acres along the Clearwater River to get into the carbon credit business. But prices have been so low that the tribe is holding off on selling some of its credits, O'Laughlin said. Most landowners would break even at carbon credit prices of $10 per ton, he said.\As carbon sinks, forests hold tremendous potential, said Brian Murray, director of economic analysis at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions. They're already absorbing 10 percent of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions. ""That's a pretty big number to start with,"" Murray, who was not at the meeting, said in a phone interview.\However, carbon offsets from forests come with uncertainties, he added.\Stands of trees can be incinerated in wildfires, killed by bark beetles, or toppled by windstorms. ""Somehow, you have to make up for the loss of that carbon,"" Murray said.\The 2006 fire season in Idaho was a prime example, O'Laughlin said. So many acres burned in the Gem State that forests - which cover 41 percent of the state - were net producers of carbon dioxide that year.\Contact Becky Kramer at (208) 765-7122 or beckyk@spokesman.com.\Credit: Becky Kramer Staff writer"

SUNNYSIDE - Looking over the enormous hole that will eventually become the Roza Irrigation District's new reservoir, Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday praised the project as an important step to combat climate change's impact on the region's water supply.
\
The $26 million project will allow the district to temporarily store up to 500 million gallons within the system until needed by farmers, rather than wasting water that flows unused through the canals. The irrigation district estimates the increased efficiency will save 2.7 billion gallons of water annually.
\
""We're not just sitting around waiting for climate change to bite us; we're investing in a smarter irrigation system,"" Inslee said of the project.
\
Inslee also toured the digester that converts dairy waste to energy at DeRuyter Dairy in Outlook and met with the Yakima River Basin Integrated Plan committee.
\
The visit is his fifth stop on a statewide climate tour, meeting with businesses and communities threatened by the changing climate and discussing potential solutions. Impacts of climate change range from drought to increasingly acidic ocean water, which threatens shellfish farming.
\
In the Yakima Basin, climate change could jeopardize the water supply. The mountain snowpack acts as the largest reservoir, but less snow and earlier melting are predicted. Data already show that the spring snowpack has declined 20 percent since 1950, and climate scientists predict the trend will continue, or worsen.
\
Droughts are predicted to become more frequent while the basin's water supply is already completely spoken for. The Integrated Plan, a 30-year plan for investing in water supply improvements that Inslee signed last summer, aims to help the basin adapt.
\
Members of the committee told Inslee about progress made on a variety of projects, including expanding the capacity of existing reservoirs.
\
But the governor is also pushing a policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say drive the atmospheric warming.
\
""We can't solve this with just re-regulation reservoirs alone,"" Inslee told the water committee and local leaders. ""We've got to get on top of the carbon pollution issue or the climate is going to keep changing on us.""
\
He urged them to talk about climate change when they talk about the plan's goals of protecting the region's agricultural economy and the environment.
\
""I want to work with you on educating the western side of the state about how important this is,"" Inslee said. ""We're talking major dollars, so we need major political support.""
\
Inslee might be in need of more support for the second half of his climate strategy: the policies to reduce carbon emissions.
\
So far, such a move has been unpopular. In 2008, the Legislature set a goal of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, but has not approved any measures to meet that goal.
\
Adaptation measures, such as expanding water storage capacity, might be politically easier than cutting emissions, but Inslee said Washington needs both.
\
In an interview after the meeting, he likened the state's situation to a house on fire. It's smart to put out the fire now and look for ways to prevent another in the future, Inslee said.
\
Earlier this year, Inslee created a task force of leaders from business, labor, health and environmental organizations to consider two options to cut carbon pollution: a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade system.
\
Inslee said a cap-and-trade system would create an absolute ceiling on emissions, but allow businesses that can't make reductions to buy allowances from businesses that can cut back.
\
It's a market-based solution, Inslee said, that has worked for other countries and has been effective in the United States trying to combat sulfur dioxide, the cause of acid rain.
\
A carbon tax would put a price on carbon, paid at the gas pump or on electric bills. Supporters say that with a revenue-neutral design, the state could return the money to taxpayers through cuts to sales or business taxes.
\
Both systems aim to create a financial incentive for reducing the use of fossil fuels. Inslee said his task force should make a recommendation by the end of the year, and he plans to put forward a policy in 2015.
\
He's optimistic that support is building for taking action against climate change, even if there's still debate over the details.
\
""In Yakima County, we've got pragmatic leaders willing to recognize the problem,"" Inslee said. ""We're seeing this now with our own eyes. This is not our grandchildren's problem, it's our problem.""

"
40,"OLYMPIA - Major new policies in Washington that effect drugs penalties, climate change, taxes and other issues will go into affect on Sunday.\The state Legislature passed more than 300 bills last session. On Sunday, 90 days since adjourning, most bills will go into effect.\Legislators came into the session with hefty goals: respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, aid in its economic recovery, reform policing, fight a changing climate and more. Democrats left with big wins, passing many long-awaited bills dealing with climate change, taxes and equity.\The $59.2 billion two-year budget is aimed at helping the state recover from the pandemic, assist schools with reopening, expand public health services and improve the state's wildfire fighting capabilities.\Here's a look at some of the changes to state law:\DRUG POSSESSION\Possessing a controlled substance is now considered a simple misdemeanor, not a felony. That means possession is now punishable by up to 90 days behind bars, a $1,000 fine or both.\For the first two offenses, those possessing drugs would be diverted to treatment not jail.\The change went into effect July 1, but additional funding for community-based recovery programs will be allocated on Sunday.\The change followed a state Supreme Court ruling that found the state's law against drug possession, which at the time was punishable by five years in prison or up to $10,000 in fines, was unconstitutional.\The new law leaves open the possibilities that the misdemeanor penalty could be eliminated in 2023. The Legislature will set up a committee to review the state's drug laws over the next two years to come up with a long-term fix.\If no fix is implemented by 2023, the state would end all prosecutions for simple drug possession.\ENVIRONMENT\Two of the biggest bills attempting to fight climate change passed the Legislature this session, although neither goes into effect immediately.\The cap-and-trade program sets a cap on carbon and greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2023. The largest polluters in the state would need to clean up to meet the cap or purchase allowances from the state.\The state would receive the revenue from those allowances, which it would use to improve the environment and invest in programs to help those disproportionately affected by climate change.\The clean fuels standard would require transportation fuels in the state, such as those for cars, trucks, boats, trains and aircraft, to be cleaner over time. Starting in 2023, polluters must start reducing their emissions a little each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20% lower than 2017 levels by 2038.\Another new law aimed at creating a cleaner environment would require the state to better prepare for a zero emissions transportation future.\It requires the Department of Transportation to develop a publicly available tool to track charging and refueling infrastructure for electric vehicles. It requires the State Building Code Council to implement rules for requiring residential occupancies to have electric vehicle charging capability by July 1, 2024.\After more than a year of delays, the state's plastic bag ban will be going into effect right before the stroke of Oct. 1.\In 2020, the Legislature passed a bill that would establish a statewide prohibition on single-use plastic bags that are noncompostable. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit more than a year ago, Gov. Jay Inslee put a pause on the ban.\Inslee's updated proclamation lifts that pause at 11:59p.m. Sept. 30, meaning the plastic bag ban will go into effect.\Shoppers who want to use single-use plastic bags or reusable bags that do not meet recycled content requirements will be charged 8 cents per bag.\A recycled paper bag must contain a minimum of 40% recycled material, according to the law. A reusable carryout bag must have the capacity to carry at least 22 pounds and be durable, so it can be washed and disinfected.\CAPITAL GAINS TAX\One of the session's most controversial bills will technically go into effect Sunday, but funds from the capital gains tax won't be received by the state until 2023, at the earliest.\The law implements a 7% tax on the sale of stocks, bonds, some property, businesses and other investments, if the profits exceed $250,000 annually. The tax will be applied to sales after Jan. 1, 2022.\The law is caught up in the courts, with two lawsuits claiming the tax is unconstitutional. The suits were consolidated into one case earlier this month.\WILDFIRE FIGHTING FUNDING AND DISASTER RELIEF\The state will allocate $125 million to the Department of Natural Resources to aid in wildfire fighting, forest health and community fire prevention.\The funds will be received at the end of July, but as fires continue to burn across the state, Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz said funds would be too late for this season.\The $150 million will fund 100 more firefighters, two airplanes and the state's Forest Health Strategic Plan, which treats the state's forests to make them more wildfire resistant.\As the state faces a drought, Franz said the department has secured temporary contracts for additional planes, until the new funding can be received.\Those who have experienced property damage due to natural disasters, such as wildfires, will be able to apply for a tax exemption for improvements to single-family homes.\Starting with taxes levied in 2022, physical improvements to a property damaged by a natural disaster will be exempt from property taxes for three years following the completion of the product.\To qualify, the property must be in a governor-declared disaster area and reduced in value by more than 20% as a result of the disaster that occurred on or after Aug. 31, 2020.\The person applying for the exemption must have owned the property at the time it was reduced in value.\A taxpayer must file an application with the county assessor before beginning construction on the improvement. If the property owner started construction before July 25 of this year, they can apply for the exemption by Oct. 1.\EDUCATION\A significant amount of federal and state funding will go toward helping schools reopen and address learning loss from the COVID-19 pandemic.\Part of that will fund new educational technology and learning devices, as well as increased broadband connectivity for students. It also will help schools make up for a loss in enrollment and transportation funding.\High-poverty schools will get additional funding for guidance counselors for each school level beginning in the 2022-23 school year.\Along with new funds, some school districts may have to change their logos or mascots.\Those that use Native American names, symbols or images s have until the end of this year to change.\Beginning Jan. 1, schools may no longer use any Native names, symbols or images, unless the school is located on or adjacent to tribal lands and works with the tribe to respectfully use the name.\Two Spokane schools - North Central High School and Garry Middle School - have already changed their mascots.\HEALTH CARE\The biggest change in public health will be the additional funds allocated toward foundational public services.\The state's two-year budget allocates $147 million for public health services statewide - a significant increase from previous years. That funding likely will go toward local health jurisdictions.\Additionally, local health district boards may look a little different. Districts have until July 2022 to change the makeup of their boards to include an equal number of nonelected and elected members.\The nonelected members must include an equal number from three categories:\Those with experience in public health or health care, such as physicians, nurses or health care workers;\Consumers of public health, such as residents in communities that face health inequities;\Or other stakeholders, such as community-based organizations or representatives from the business community.\If the county contains tribal land, the board must include a tribal representative.\A significant amount of federal funding will be allocated to the Department of Health to aid in the fight against COVID-19, such as increased vaccinations and data collection.\With new laws in effect, the state has a permanent universal health care commission, which will work to implement benefits packages and reimbursement rates. The commission's main focus will be to help the state transition to a universally financed health care system, according to the Alliance for a Healthy Washington.\POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY\The way law agencies interact with the public is changing.\Officers no longer will be able to use chokeholds, neck restraints and no-knock warrants. Agencies will no longer able to acquire certain kinds of military equipment, including machine guns, armed helicopters and tanks.\The use of police dogs will be limited and a work group will meet to determine the best training and use of K-9s. There will be restrictions on car chases, prohibiting them unless there is probable cause or the chase is necessary for identifying a person in the vehicle.\Tear gas will be prohibited in public riots, unless law enforcement receives approval from the highest elected official in the jurisdiction. For the city police department, that would be the mayor, and for the Washington State Patrol, that would be the governor. An officer must then announce one time that tear gas will be used before deploying it.\Other new laws include the creation of an independent task force for investigating police use of force, changing requirements for certification and de-certification of officers, and requiring officers to intervene if they see excessive use of force by another officer.\Starting next week, the Office of the Attorney General will establish an advisory group to develop and implement a statewide use-of-force data program. The Office of the State Auditor will begin conducting compliance audits of any deadly force investigation.\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"
41,"Washington voters will decide whether to approve the nation's first carbon tax in November, a measure supporters say would help the state cut its greenhouse gas emissions and could set precedent for a national climate policy.\""The pitch is that climate change is real, and we should do something about it,"" said Yoram Bauman, founder of Carbon Washington, which is promoting Initiative 732. ""We have an approach that works for families and businesses across the state.""\But I-732 has failed to gain support from some of the groups that would typically back efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Both the state's Democratic Party and the Sierra Club have opposed the initiative, saying it isn't the right approach to climate policy.\Business and labor groups also are lobbying against it, saying I-732 would be a ""job killer"" that would shift employment to other states and countries.\Some of the loudest opposition is coming from Spokane Valley, where Kaiser Aluminum employs more than 900 people making aluminum products for the aerospace industry and other manufacturers.\Kaiser's Trentwood facility uses natural gas-fired furnaces to heat aluminum to its melting point, around 1,200 degrees. The energy-intensive process puts the company on Washington's short list of top carbon polluters. Each year, the plant releases more than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.\Kaiser has become one of the largest contributors to the campaign to defeat I-732, with a $50,000 donation.\""We're not saying that we shouldn't be working on carbon emissions,"" said Kyle England, a company spokesman.\But company officials say the carbon tax, as proposed, would cost Kaiser millions of dollars annually, undermining the company's ability to compete in a global marketplace. Ultimately, the tax would shift jobs overseas to coal-fired factories that produce more of the heat-trapping gases responsible for climate change, they said.\MODELED AFTER CARBON TAX IN B.C.\Bauman, who is leading the I-732 campaign, has a doctorate in economics and an unconventional career.\The Seattle resident, who earns his living as a writer and speaker, said he's probably the world's only stand-up comedian focusing on economic issues. He's the co-author of several books, including the ""Cartoon Introduction to Economics.""\Bauman helped write I-732, which is modeled after a similar carbon tax in British Columbia. He said it's a fair, market-driven approach to reducing carbon emissions that spreads costs across both households and businesses. He also takes issue with Kaiser's position that the initiative would reduce the company's global competitiveness.\Bauman described the initiative as a ""tax shift"" that raises the cost of carbon but also mitigates the effect on manufacturers and Washington families, who would pay more for gasoline, heating fuel and electricity.\Under I-732, each ton of carbon produced in Washington would be taxed by $15 beginning in July 2017. The tax would increase to $25 per ton the next year, and would rise annually until it hits a maximum of $100 per ton.\But Washington residents would see a 1 percentage point drop in the state's sales tax over two years if the initiative is approved. Most households would see a change of up to $200 in their annual expenses, which could be either a savings or an extra cost, according to Bauman. Initiative opponents argue that most families would pay more. And low-income families could qualify for refunds in the state sales tax they paid to offset higher gasoline prices and utility bills.\Kaiser and other manufacturers would get a break on the state's business and occupation tax, which is levied on companies' gross income.\If the initiative passed, Kaiser would pay about $1.5 million next year in carbon taxes, a figure that would increase to about $10 million annually if the company's emissions remained steady at 100,000 metric tons per year.\Kaiser doesn't reveal proprietary information, including how much the company pays in business and occupation taxes, said England, Kaiser's spokesman. But company officials said the proposed reduction in B&O taxes under I-732 is a negligible amount for Kaiser and wouldn't offset the cost of carbon taxes.\Since Kaiser won't ""put numbers on the table,"" it's hard to know how the company would fare under the initiative, Bauman said.\However, if Kaiser can demonstrate that it isn't getting an equitable break in B&O taxes, ""we will go with them to Olympia to fix the policy,"" Bauman said.\Opponents cite impacts to revenue\Other opposition to I-732 has centered around the potential impacts to the state's budget.\While the I-732 campaign is touting the initiative as revenue-neutral by swapping out one type of tax for another, the state Department of Revenue estimates that the initiative would cost the state about $800 million in lost tax revenues over four years.\The state's Democratic Party and the Sierra Club both listed revenue concerns in their statements against I-732. Lowering tax revenue would complicate the state's budget troubles when Washington is already \struggling to make court-ordered investments in education and mental health services, they said.\Bauman called the revenue issue a ""red herring."" The I-732 campaign disagrees with some of the Department of Revenue's methodology that resulted in the projected loss of $800 million in state revenue, he said.\Another study done by Sightline Institute, a liberal think tank in Seattle that hasn't taken a position on the initiative, calculates an $80 million annual decrease in tax revenues, or about $320 million over four years.\But both forecasts have significant uncertainties, based on future unknowns, the Sightline analysis said.\""The forecast depends on statewide carbon emissions and statewide sales tax revenue that could change by hundreds of millions of dollars a year,"" the Sightline analysis said.\If revenue shortfalls occur, Bauman said, the gap could be addressed through tweaking I-732's tax-swap formula.\Last year's drought and record wildfire season should be a wake-up call for Washington residents, Bauman said. Without action to curb climate change, the conditions experienced last summer could be typical for the state by 2060, he said.\CLEAN-AIR RULE PREDATES I-732\Kaiser is already a leader in reducing the ""carbon intensity"" of its products, company officials said.\Each pound of aluminum produced at Trentwood requires about 15 percent less energy than in 2010. Kaiser continues to work on energy efficiency, but the company hasn't found a way to replace its gas-fired furnaces, which remain the best way to melt aluminum, England said.\Both Kaiser and the local affiliate of the Steelworkers Union worked closely with the state Department of Ecology on Washington's recently adopted clean-air rule. The rule creates a cap-and-trade system for carbon \emissions, which Kaiser must comply with.\The administrative rule was created after the Legislature failed to act on Gov. Jay Inslee's earlier cap-and-trade proposal. It provides some flexibility for energy-intensive manufacturers that compete for customers with companies from other countries. Under the rule, Kaiser would get credit for previous work on energy efficiency.\Kaiser is ""cautiously optimistic"" that it can meet the requirements of the clean-air rule while continuing to expand its production, England said.\""We want to produce every pound of aluminum possible in Spokane, which is in one of the greenest states in the nation,"" England added.\That's good for both Washington's economy and the environment, he said.\INITIATIVE 732 AT A GLANCE\The carbon tax: Would start at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted, effective July 2017. The rate would rise to $25 per metric ton a year later, then it would increase gradually until the rate reaches a maximum of $100 per metric ton.\Reductions in other taxes: The state sales tax rate would drop from 6.5 percent to 6 percent, effective July 2017. It would drop to 5.5 percent in July 2018. The state business and occupation tax rate for manufacturing would drop to 0.001 percent in July 2017 from the current rate of 0.484 percent for most manufacturers.\Credit for low-income families: Low-income taxpayers could get a refund for some of the state sales taxes they paid during the year.\Supporters include: Audubon Washington, Cascadia Climate Action, Citizens Climate Lobby, Seattle Electric Vehicle Association.\Opponents include: Association of Washington Business, Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO, Washington Farm Bureau, Washington Environmental Council, state Democratic Party, Sierra Club.\Revenue question: I-732 is intended to be revenue-neutral. However, a state Department of Revenue analysis says it will reduce the state's tax revenues by about $800 million over four years. A study by Sightline Institute says the revenue reduction is closer to $80 million each year for four years.\Panel discussion in Spokane: Oct. 20 at 7 p.m. Walgreens Auditorium (PBS 101) at WSU Spokane, 205 E.

OLYMPIA - The 2008 Legislature opened with low expectations, experienced the jolt of a pessimistic revenue forecast midway, and ended up making some promises it may not be able to keep.
\
Democrats, who hold the governor's seat, a 63-35 majority in the House and a 32-17 lead in the Senate, controlled the agenda. They tackled a number of tough issues, including protecting home buyers from unscrupulous mortgage brokers and guarding Washington's children from toxic toys.
\
But facing re-election campaigns and an uncertain economic climate, they chose not to act on many others.
\
They put off for a second year a decision on how to pay for the family leave program they created in 2007.
\
""It's a significant move in social policy,"" Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown said after Thursday night's adjournment. ""You don't necessarily launch something like that overnight.""
\
They also passed a sales tax rebate program for working families that Gov. Chris Gregoire has not committed to signing and that future legislatures will have to decide whether to fund.
\
""I think it was important to get it on the books. We don't know if we'll have the money to implement it next biennium,"" Brown admitted.
\
Republicans point out that the majority party failed to consider providing property tax relief for homeowners, though Democratic leaders had promised last November to make that a priority. Serious tinkering with property tax formulas requires a two-thirds vote of each chamber under the state constitution.
\
House Republican Leader Richard DeBolt proclaimed the 2008 session ""much ado about nothing.""
\
""If I had 73 votes, we would have done health care reform,"" DeBolt said. On climate change, Republicans ""put a bill on the bar that really would have accomplished something,"" he said. ""Because the agenda is driven by special interests, we couldn't get the Sierra Club to even read it.""
\
Floods and ferries
\
Lawmakers did step up to pass a supplemental budget, their main duty in election years.
\
They provided $11.6 million to match $31.2 million in federal dollars for flood relief in Lewis and Thurston counties and passed a $50 million bond to help pay for flood control along the Chehalis River.
\
They appropriated nearly $400 million to replace and refurbish ferries in the state's aged, crippled fleet.
\
They passed a bill that sets broad statewide policy for the use of tolling revenues to pay for state projects. It lays the groundwork for future bills that will authorize individual projects, including the Columbia River Crossing between Vancouver and Portland.
\
And they took steps to protect homeowners from fraud and create greater transparency in mortgage lending practices.
\
They passed strong consumer protection legislation to restrict the sale of toys and children's products that contain lead, cadmium and other harmful chemicals.
\
And they enacted a broad climate change bill that requires major polluters to report their emissions of greenhouse gases and directs the Department of Ecology to design a regional cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide emissions.
\
This year's work builds on major investments the Legislature has made to improve education, support green energy and clean up Puget Sound since Gregoire became governor in 2005 - about $8 billion in additional spending in all.
\
""If you look back four years, it's amazing what we've done on our progressive agenda,"" House Speaker Frank Chopp, D-Seattle, said Friday.
\
Unfinished business
\
Some new initiatives, includin g passage of a homeowners' bill of rights, were shelved in the session's final days. Chopp refused for the second year to allow the House to vote on a Senate bill that would have held contractors responsible for shoddy construction. Critics said he was acting on behalf of the Building Industry Association of Washington.
\
Under intense pressure from the Service Employees International Union and the governor, Chopp also let die a bill that would have required state licensing and training for workers who provide long-term care for the elderly and disabled.
\
On health care, the Legislature restored the authority of the state insurance commissioner to regulate rates in the individual health insurance market, which have skyrocketed.
\
Lawmakers continued to make progress toward insuring all Washington children.
\
But they delayed action on more comprehensive health care reforms.
\
They established yet another health care reform study group, but rebuffed a Republican bill that proposed specific steps the state could take to help young adults obtain insurance tailored to their needs. Chopp said the Legislature might take up the idea next year. It was first proposed by the governor's blue ribbon task force on health care in 2007.
\
The House and Senate education committees debated whether to go ahead with requiring the class of 2008 to pass the reading and writing portions of the Washington Assessment of Student Learning. The Legislature ended up sticking with the plan, and adding $18 million to help struggling students.
\
Lawmakers also debated what form the revised math portion of the WASL should take. In the end, they quietly inserted money in the budget to develop four end-of-course math tests, which will replace the math WASL in 2014.
\
A popular bill to help local communities fight criminal gang activity passed both chambers. But funding for local grants was cut to just $1.18 million, and a key piece of the bill, allowing police to go to court and seek civil injunctions against individual gang members in high-impact areas, was removed by the Senate.
\
Gregoire's views
\
Gov. Gregoire delivered an upbeat message after Thursday night's adjournment, lauding passage of bills to improve patient safety, protect vulnerable adults, and improve supervision of foster children in state custody. The first-term Democrat thanked members on both sides of the aisle for bipartisan work on community safety issues,
\
She also acknowledged that the state will face a deficit - her advisers place the amount at $2 billion - in the 2009-11 biennium.
\
But she added, ""Projections are just that, they're projections. Based on past projections, we should be looking at a $5 billion deficit right now.""
\
In a post-session briefing Friday, Chopp said House budget-writers will soon begin scrutinizing the state's base budget, especially in the areas of health care and social services, to look for efficiencies and low-priority programs that could be cut.
\
Chopp declined to say if tax increases will be on the table next year.
\
Local influence
\
Clark County lawmakers once again played key roles this session, especially on budget and finance issues. Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, oversaw preparation of the Senate budget as vice chairman of Ways and Means, and Sen. Joe Zarelli, R-Ridgefield, took the lead in critquing the budget as the committee's ranking Republican. Pridemore prime-sponsored the climate change legislation and the working families tax credit bill. Zarelli's proposal for a homestead exemption to provide property tax relief to homeowners won a hearing in committee but didn't make it through the process.
\
Pridemore, Zarelli and Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, ranking Republican on the House Finance Committee, also sit on the bipartisan Revenue Forecast Council, which reviews and comments on quarterly state revenue forecasts.
\
Rep. Bill Fromhold, D-Vancouver, chaired the Capital Budget Committee for the second year in a row and delivered a construction budget that won nearly unanimous support and included money for a new homeless shelter and waterfront redevelopment in Vancouver.
\
Rep. Deb Wallace chaired the Higher Education Committee, which passed legislation this year requiring independent oversight of proposals for new college and university construction projects and academic programs.
\
And Rep. Jim Moeller, D-Vancouver, was elected deputy pro-tem House speaker, a job that required him to preside over House deliberations several hours a day.
\
The most challenging part, he said, was ""making judgment calls about when to gavel someone down, when someone is crossing the line as far as decorum, impugning someone else, or going off into issues that aren't germane.""
\
""I loved the job,"" Moeller said Friday. ""It's the most fun I've had as an adult. It also helped me keep track of exactly what we we re doing.""

\
Tim Eyman's Initiative 96 0, which effectively requires two-thirds votes on all tax increases and simple majority votes on all state fee increases, passed easily last November and was on legislators' minds this session.
\
With an eye to next year's projected deficit, Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown, D-Spokane, sued late in the session to overturn the supermajority vote requirement, which is contained both in I-960 and in Initiative 601, passed by voters in 1993.
\
The state Supreme Court rejected her request for an expedited hearing and might not rule before the 2009 session convenes.
\
The way Democrats dealt with the fee votes caused a minor tempest toward session's end, after they stripped fee increases from several policy bills and lumped them together into a single bill. Eyman and Republican leaders objected, arguing that the point of voting on individual fee increases was to make agencies justify them to lawmakers in a public forum.
\
House Speaker Frank Chopp said Friday that the House looked at different ways of dealing with fee votes and would probably keep most fees in policy bills in the future. He noted that state agencies charge more than 1,000 kinds of fees, from university computer lab fees to dam inspection fees. ""We think it's healthy for the public to understand where those fees go,"" he said

43,"FILE - In this Jan. 13, 2021 file photo, Washington Sen. Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, works at her desk on the otherwise empty Senate floor, at the Capitol in Olympia, Wash., during a joint session of the Washington Legislature being held remotely. The 2021 session of the Washington Legislature ended Sunday, April 25 and lawmakers had no shortage of weighty topics to consider while having to conduct their work amid a pandemic that meant most meetings and votes were conducted remotely. The Capitol building was also closed to the public since last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was surrounded by security fencing and national guard members at times due to fears of protests. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \Associated Press files \Speaker of the House Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, left, presides over a session of the House in Olympia on April 21 with most representatives attending remotely. The 2021 session ended April 25, and lawmakers had no shortage of weighty topics to consider while having to conduct their work amid a pandemic that meant most meetings and votes were conducted remotely. The Capitol building was closed to the public. It also was surrounded by security fencing and National Guard members at times because of fears over protests.\Included on list of wins: Capital gains and carbon output\Democrats scored one victory after another over the course of this year's 105-day legislative session, as lawmakers in the majority party eschewed incremental change in favor of sweeping, long-sought goals.\Just before the session concluded on April 25, liberal legislators shepherded major priorities through both houses and onto Gov. Jay Inslee's desk. Their list of policy wins includes a new tax on capital gains, a pair of carbon-curbing bills, and a $59.2 billion operating budget that pumps resources into the state's education and public health systems.\Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, said the year's productivity is owed in part to a lack of distractions. Facing a session slowed by its remote format, she and her colleagues were instructed to keep their attention narrowly tailored: Pandemic recovery, equity and environmental justice were the focus. Bills that fell outside those limits were not considered.\“We asked our members to limit our numbers of bills they introduced to around seven, and ensure that they were focused on those things,” said Stonier, who served as the Democrat floor leader over the course of the session. “I think that really helped us filter our attention and think strategically about those things.”\Lawmakers also passed a slate of bills aimed at increasing police accountability, including legislation establishing a statewide office to investigate use-of-force incidents and a bill that requires officers to intervene if they witness a peer using excessive force.\Two main strategies to reduce carbon emissions, a cap-and-trade program and a low-carbon fuel standard, passed both chambers just before the session concluded. However, in order to enact the pair of bills, the Legislature will need to pass a 16-year transportation revenue plan, which lawmakers say will need to be taken up in a special session later this spring.\Republicans feel ‘steamrolled'\Democrats could call the session — the first-ever legislative session conducted almost entirely via videoconferencing, as COVID-19 forced business-as-usual to a halt in Olympia — extremely fruitful.\But while a few measures passed with bipartisan support, many Republicans would use a different description: steamrolled.\“There were some bills that were just on greased skids, and there was nothing we were going to be able to do,” said Senate Republican Caucus Chair Ann Rivers, R-La Center. “Overall, when I think about the session, it was disappointing on a number of fronts.”\The approach was especially discouraging, Rivers added, because Washington is flush with resources. Despite dire warnings at the start of the pandemic that the state would face an $8.8 billion budget deficit, stronger-than-expected tax receipts combined with federal aid money left the state in an ideal position to scale back on existing regressive taxes, she said.\“Especially in this year of a $15 billion windfall, why wouldn't we choose another way to do this?” Rivers asked.\The Legislature took aim at crafting bills to right Washington's tax structure, which is among the most regressive in the country due to its heavy reliance on sales taxes. The first step, a new tax on capital gains revenue, passed despite uniform opposition from Republicans.\The bill imposes a tax on the sale of certain assets owned by wealthy people including stocks, bonds, and luxury goods like cars and fine art. Revenue from the sales in excess of $250,000 will be taxed at 7 percent; sales of homes, farms and retirement accounts such as Roth IRAs and 401(k)s are exempt.\Sen. Annette Cleveland, D-Vancouver, was one of the few Democrats who originally opposed the capital gains tax, claiming that the bill could drain the political will to pass other revenue-raising measures for infrastructure projects this year.\Cleveland cast her vote against Senate Bill 5096 when it first came to the floor. But when it returned to the chamber with House revisions, she switched her stance. Her changed vote may have been the deciding factor: The tax bill skirted through the chamber, 25-24.\If Inslee signs the bill, the tax will go into effect in 2022. It is expected to bring in $550 million in 2023. The revenue is earmarked for Washington's Education Legacy Trust Account, which funds child-care and early-learning programs.\“Looking at the data, there are fewer than 150 people in the 49th Legislative District that would be impacted by this,” Cleveland said, speaking about her own west Vancouver district. “There's a tremendous investment on every state dollar that we put toward early learning, and that's what the capital gains tax is aimed primarily at.”\The tax is also all but guaranteed to face a challenge in the courts. Opponents consider it a version of an income tax, which is in violation of the state's constitution. Republican lawmakers have also worried that the tax will discourage Washington's wealthy residents from putting down roots and creating jobs.\“The people this bill will ultimately impact are the very people that have worked hard, they've been wise in their investments, they have taken the good American dream, the free market economy here in America, and made it work,” Rep. Vicki Kraft, R-Vancouver, said during the bill's floor debate. ”Why would we penalize them for that?”\The second step toward a more progressive tax structure drew near-unanimous support on both sides of the aisle.\A bill expanding the Working Families Tax Exemption sailed through the Senate 47-2 and the House 93-3. It was a slam dunk — and a chance for Republicans to exercise some influence as the minority party, Rivers said.\“By putting it in our budget, we forced the Democrats to put it in theirs,” Rivers said.\The program was established in 2008 but left unfunded (a casualty of the Great Recession, and later the fight over school funding after the McCleary case, Rivers said). It's meant to offset the state's sales tax, which disproportionately impacts lower-income people.\Starting in 2023, Washington state will return an estimated $250 million to 420,000 taxpayers in payments ranging from $300 to $1,200, depending on household size and income level.\Environment and transportation policy\Democrats also passed a pair of bills aimed at curbing carbon emissions and raising revenue for clean energy transitions.\The first, a carbon cap-and-trade program, would limit emissions for businesses that produce greenhouse gases. They'll need to stay below a certain threshold of carbon pollution or purchase allowances from the state's Department of Ecology. That cap would decrease over time. The same bill increases the state's gas tax by 5 cents per gallon, on top of the existing 67.8-cent tax.\The other piece of legislation establishes a low-carbon fuel standard. It aims to incentivize energy companies like BP to produce cleaner fuel sources over time for cars, trucks, boats and airplanes.\The twin bills come with a caveat. They're linked to a sweeping 16-year transportation revenue plan, which didn't pass. Lawmakers ran out of time.\“I'm disappointed that we're looking at this scenario,” Stonier said. “I don't feel it is consistent with our legislative practice to tie things together like that.”\Rep. Sharon Wylie, D-Vancouver, serves on the House Transportation Committee. She said lawmakers will likely pick that work back up in the next couple of weeks. The transportation plan will need its own special session.\Planning for major projects, like the Interstate 5 Bridge replacement, also hinges on federal infrastructure dollars, she added. The Biden administration released a $2 trillion infrastructure plan last month that includes a pledge to fix 10,000 bridges nationwide.\“I think there's still a strong commitment to do a transportation infrastructure package that will carry us into the future,” Wylie said. “How we get there, we're still in negotiation, and I think what the federal government does or doesn't do will help us come together on that.”\Policing\Democrats were able to pass a broad array of bills this session aimed at increasing police accountability.\While most passed along party lines, a few gained bipartisan support from Southwest Washington Republicans. A bill that improves data collection on law enforcement activity passed with unanimous support from the region's lawmakers.\Rivers and Rep. Paul Harris, the minority caucus chair, crossed party lines to support a bill that would require police officers to intervene if they witness a peer using excessive force. Sen. Lynda Wilson, R-Vancouver, supported a bill that would lay out a process for selecting arbiters in negotiations with police unions.\Wylie served as sponsor on two key bills that made it to Inslee's desk: a bill banning neck restraints, chokeholds and no-knock warrants, and a bill that lays out rules for officer use-of-force and de-escalation tactics.\“A lot of the communities of color wanted their leaders to be front and center on this, so I took a lot of my direction from people who are dealing with the situation on the ground. I have friends that have had some very unpleasant experiences right here in Vancouver. We were driven by data,” Wylie said. “We have a pattern of disproportionate impact and behaviors that don't stand the common sense test. … We've had a real problem, and to deny that is to be naive.”\The slate of police-reform legislation introduced and passed over the last 105 days also includes a bill that establishes a statewide Office of Independent Investigations to examine police use-of-force incidents, including shootings.\“I just think it's a redundant piece of legislation,” Hoff said. “This bill grows government for no reason.”\Democrats argue that the broad policing reform was long overdue, and that more work will continue in future sessions.\“For the record, I don't know of any Democrats in Washington who want to defund the police,” Wylie added.\Calley Hair: 360-735-4558; calley.hair@columbian.com; twitter.com/calleynhair \CREDIT: Calley Hair The Columbian"

Stops made for all crimes
\
To the editor -- The Oct. 24 article, ""YPD reports results from interdiction on highways,"" says that criminal interdiction is ""primarily traffic stops intended to look for drug trafficking than bad driving."" That is incorrect. Criminal interdiction is not intended to be a subterfuge for drug interdiction. Criminal interdiction encompasses all crimes.
\
All street officers conduct criminal interdiction at some level, such as the officer who pulls over a car with a headlight out and then through training and experience recognizes the driver is intoxicated.
\
More highly trained and experienced officers who specialize in the field of criminal interdiction make the same legal traffic stops, and during the course of conducting legal business they may detect indicators that would lead them to believe that criminal activity is afoot. A criminal interdiction officer will notice those things that are outside the realms of what they are used to seeing from the innocent motoring public.
\
Highly trained criminal interdiction officers and patrol officers answering calls handle all crimes. Criminal interdiction officers have even stopped terrorist activities based on traffic stops. Timothy McVeigh was stopped for a vehicle equipment violation by a patrolman and arrested.

Irresponsible driver flees
\
To the editor -- The person who hit an elk on Oak Flats just west of intersection with Highway 410 caused additional damage and could have caused a death by not stopping and warning other drivers that the animal was still alive in the middle of the eastbound lane.
\
Shortly after the driver left this scene, another woman trying to avoid this elk swerved into the ditch, causing extensive damage to her vehicle and injury. Additional vehicles also hit the animal, causing damage to their vehicles. It caused delays in the dark for those coming home on State Route 410.
\
The elk was lying with her head up thus was not dead when the driver left the scene. It however, did meet its demise after several vehicles hit it. Thank God for that.

Get involved or keep quiet
\
To the editor -- By the time this gets published, the election cycle will be over. The debate on whether same-sex couples have the same rights as biblically correct ones concerning tax laws will have been settled temporarily.
\
The point that most tax laws are uniformly unfair goes unchallenged.
\
Why should someone who chooses to get married and propagate get a tax break? Why should anyone who willingly takes on risk and responsibility get a tax break?
\
Income tax is constitutionally questionable at best. The government isn't a separate entity but all of us. If you are not involved, then you have no right to complain. We are the government. By the people for the people.

Voting is not a right. It is a responsibility. If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.

Anyone who complains but is not involved is irrelevant.

Know facts about wolves
\
To the editor -- The Oct. 22 article about the wolf management plan forum suggests that the attendees at the forum should check out the facts at http://wdfw.wa.gov.
\
Rather than being ""man eaters,"" wolves generally are fearful of humans. There has been one human death from a wolf in the past 60 years. With respect to concerns of hunters, elk populations in other states with wolves have remained mostly stable. And ranchers may be reassured to know that wolves killing livestock in states with wolves is low compared to deaths from weather, disease and other predators such as coyotes. Historically, wolves played an important role in keeping populations of elk, deer and moose in balance with the available habitat.
\
The state management plan is a reasonable option. But decide for yourself. You can review the plan and make comments until Jan. 8, 2010, at the same website as above.

Strong argument for water
\
To the editor -- ""Mission: To manage water resources to meet the current and future needs of the natural environment and Washington's communities."" Department of Ecology website.
\
""There will be a 60-80 percent loss of snowpack by 2060. In a basin like Yakima, there isn't enough water to go around. To take that much runoff out of the equation causes problems for existing water users such as farmers, and it also creates issues for growth."" Jay Manning, former state Ecology director.
\
The agency charged with protecting our water resources is telling us there will be no water for junior rights holders and 50 percent supply for senior rights holders in 50 years. Recommended solution? Cap and trade, which will reduce the volume of carbon atoms in the atmosphere by 10 percent. This will change the overall makeup of the atmosphere by 1/1000th of 1 percent and will reverse global warming, thereby protecting our snowpack and water supply.
\
Just in case cap and trade doesn't work, wouldn't it be wise to implement an alternative plan that would provide adequate water for our future? Nobody ever made a more compelling argument for Black Rock reservoir than Jay Manning using Ecology research. Farmers, how much is your land worth without water?

Common-sense health care
\
To the editor -- The Nov. 1 front page Associated Press article, ""Much ado about nothing,"" about the health care bill implies that the Democratic Party's public option is less an issue than conservative Republicans say it is because only about 2 percent will enroll in it, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
\
The government will offer the lowest premiums to gain subscribers and ultimately control all U.S. health care. For example, if private insurance is $200 a month and the government offer benefits equal or better for $125 a month, which policy would we buy? Our government will undercut private insurance premiums at taxpayer expense. That is how this administration will control health care and increase their power. The result will be a cumbersome, inefficient government-run program full of special interest politics and pork.
\
We will be better served by improving our health care within the free enterprise system, with government's role as a watchdog for constitutional correctness. Our health care does need changes to make it better, less costly and more accessible to all citizens. Our government can best serve us on this by keeping politics and special interests out of it, and good common sense and judgment into it.

Easy health-care solutions
\
To the editor -- Mark Delagasse was spot on in his Nov. 4 letter, ""Fault intervention."" It is ridiculous that you can buy car insurance from a company in Alabama, but can't go out of Washington to purchase health insurance. Allowing people to go across state lines to buy insurance would be a no-cost fix that would create a real free market system. Two other no-cost changes would help as well: Allowing like small businesses to group together to bargain for insurance rates -- maybe then they could afford to give their employees health benefits.; finally, tort reform!
\
These three changes don't cost a lot, but would go a long way to making insurance more affordable. The changes could be instituted for some immediate relief, and then Congress could take their time coming up with a sensible and affordable health care delivery system.

Show us love, hypocrites
\
To the editor -- In my last letter, I tried to show the difference between socialism and national socialism, or fascism. To answer my critics, socialism does not take from others without their permission, people, and tyrants in fact take from others, if you study world history and are not ignorant of the facts.
\
Next, Obama did get big campaign contributions from corporations, just like any other candidate has for many years now. He is a capitalist, even though some of the decisions to bail out GM and Chrysler, along with the banks (which began with Bush), might be perceived as socialistic.
\
Perhaps people are referring to the recent debate about health care, you can go back some years, to 1974, then President Nixon, a conservative also spoke on the need for health care reform, and this was 35 years ago!
\
This nation is full of hypocrites. We are a supposed Christian nation, but from what I have seen, a lot of resistance to health-care reform is coming from these folks who claim to love God. That's all good and well, but you people have obviously forgotten the story of the ""good Samaritan."" Or perhaps that Jesus said, to love your neighbor. Where is that love?

Government-botched care
\
To the editor -- With the recent debacle of the swine flu vaccinations, what makes us conclude that the government takeover of health care can do better? There were shortages, long lines and misinformation for just one simple shot! What makes us think that a government-run health care option can work, especially when you consider the cost to taxpayers?
\
What really makes the public-option popular is everyone thinks they will be getting something free or at a lower cost. Just wait for your next tax bill, especially to those few middle-class taxpayers who are left.

The entitlement mentality
\
To the editor -- I am sick and tired of all the people in our society who want something for nothing. Seem to think the world owes them a living, as my dad says.
\
They want protection from bad guys but think it should be free. Little or no taxes.
\
They want to to lie, cheat and steal their way to the top and limit regulation or government intervention that protects their victims. Keep government small and out of the picture.
\
I even have a friend who has told his kids they don't need to study hard because ""grandpa and grandma"" are rich and will take good care of them. Just what we need. More rich imbeciles.
\
We must ask ourselves how well this old mentality that President Obama confronts has been working.
\
The reason we have an elephant in our living room (a gigantic illegal work force that strangles and paralyzes our society) is that many Americans are unwilling, incapable or simply too ignorant to get up off of their soft lazy behinds to provide for themselves.

Clamp down on gangs
\
To the editor -- In the last few weeks, I have noticed in the newspaper that stabbing and shootings were committed by known gang members. Maybe we should make just being a gang member a crime, and treat all shootings or stabbings as attempted murder.
\
Why not take the gang member home to his parents, and tell them if they don't get their kids in order, they will all go to jail. How can we not have this already taken care of? There are so many ways to deal with this, and it is only getting worse. How can we expect to have people move to Yakima, when it is to dangerous to walk on the streets?

Bullying postal service
\
To the editor -- Recently I received a letter from the U.S. Postal Service requesting me to move my mailbox by a certain date, or they would place my mail on hold. I was told that selected locations were chosen based on key factors including the risk of mail theft, and safety of the letter carrier and the general public and outdated mail receptacles.
\
I called the supervisor who sent the letter and said I am at no more risk of mail theft than most mailboxes, there are no safety issues with the letter carrier and the general public, my mailbox is only a few years old and it has been in the same location for 35 years with no problems.
\
After calling the post office, the supervisor then told me that the postmaster is arbitrarily telling customers to move their mail boxes.
\
There were no regulations quoted, so I asked that I be informed of the rules that they think I am violating and I would correct them if any.
\
The general public needs to know that they can not be bullied by the postal service, and that the postal service employees need to worry about performing their jobs like the American people wants them to. It is called customer service!

The agency charged with protecting our water resources is telling us there will be no water for junior rights holders and 50 percent supply for senior rights holders in 50 years. Recommended solution? Cap and trade, which will reduce the volume of carbon atoms in the atmosphere by 10 percent. This will change the overall makeup of the atmosphere by 1/1000th of 1 percent and will reverse global warming, thereby protecting our snowpack and water supply.
\
Just in case cap and trade doesn't work, wouldn't it be wise to implement an alternative plan that would provide adequate water for our future? Nobody ever made a more compelling argument for Black Rock reservoir than Jay Manning using Ecology research. Farmers, how much is your land worth without water?

Common-sense health care
\
To the editor -- The Nov. 1 front page Associated Press article, ""Much ado about nothing,"" about the health care bill implies that the Democratic Party's public option is less an issue than conservative Republicans say it is because only about 2 percent will enroll in it, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
\
The government will offer the lowest premiums to gain subscribers and ultimately control all U.S. health care. For example, if private insurance is $200 a month and the government offer benefits equal or better for $125 a month, which policy would we buy? Our government will undercut private insurance premiums at taxpayer expense. That is how this administration will control health care and increase its power. The result will be a cumbersome, inefficient government-run program full of special interest politics and pork.
\
We will be better served by improving our health care within the free enterprise system, with government's role as a watchdog for constitutional correctness. Our health care does need changes to make it better, less costly and more accessible to all citizens. Our government can best serve us on this by keeping politics and special interests out of it, and good common sense and judgment in it.

Easy health-care solutions
\
To the editor -- Mark Delagasse was spot on in his Nov. 4 letter, ""Fault intervention."" It is ridiculous that you can buy car insurance from a company in Alabama, but can't go out of Washington to purchase health insurance. Allowing people to go across state lines to buy insurance would be a no-cost fix that would create a real free market system. Two other no-cost changes would help as well: Allowing like small businesses to group together to bargain for insurance rates; maybe then they could afford to give their employees health benefits. Finally, tort reform!
\
These three changes don't cost a lot, but would go a long way toward making insurance more affordable. The changes could be instituted for some immediate relief, and then Congress could take its time coming up with a sensible and affordable health care delivery system.

Show us love, hypocrites
\
To the editor -- In my last letter, I tried to show the difference between socialism and national socialism, or fascism. To answer my critics, socialism does not take from others without their permission, people, and tyrants in fact take from others, if you study world history and are not ignorant of the facts.
\
Next, Barack Obama did get big campaign contributions from corporations, just like any other candidate has for many years now. He is a capitalist, even though some of the decisions to bail out GM and Chrysler, along with the banks (which began with Bush), might be perceived as socialistic.
\
Perhaps people are referring to the recent debate about health care. You can go back some years, to 1974 and then-President Nixon, a conservative also spoke on the need for health care reform, and this was 35 years ago!
\
This nation is full of hypocrites. We are a supposed Christian nation, but from what I have seen, a lot of resistance to health care reform is coming from these folks who claim to love God. That's all good and well, but you people have obviously forgotten the story of the ""good Samaritan."" Or perhaps that Jesus said to love your neighbor. Where is that love?

Government-botched care
\
To the editor -- With the recent debacle of the swine flu vaccinations, what makes us conclude that the government takeover of health care can do better? There were shortages, long lines and misinformation for just one simple shot! What makes us think that a government-run health care option can work, especially when you consider the cost to taxpayers?
\
What really makes the public option popular is everyone thinks they will be getting something free or at a lower cost. Just wait for your next tax bill, especially to those few middle-class taxpayers who are left.

The entitlement mentality
\
To the editor -- I am sick and tired of all the people in our society who want something for nothing. They seem to think the world owes them a living, as my dad says.
\
They want protection from bad guys but think it should be free. Little or no taxes.
\
They want to to lie, cheat and steal their way to the top and limit regulation or government intervention that protects their victims. Keep government small and out of the picture.
\
I even have a friend who has told his kids they don't need to study hard because ""grandpa and grandma"" are rich and will take good care of them. Just what we need. More rich imbeciles.
\
We must ask ourselves how well this old mentality that President Obama confronts has been working.
\
The reason we have an elephant in our living room (a gigantic illegal work force that strangles and paralyzes our society) is that many Americans are unwilling, incapable or simply too ignorant to get up off of their soft lazy behinds to provide for themselves.
\
This attitude of entitlement that people bemoan extends from the top down. Not the bottom up.

You reap what you sow.

Clamp down on gangs
\
To the editor -- In the last few weeks, I have noticed in the newspaper that stabbings and shootings were committed by known gang members. Maybe we should make just being a gang member a crime, and treat all shootings or stabbings as attempted murder.
\
Why not take the gang member home to his parents, and tell them if they don't get their kids in order, they will all go to jail? How can we not have this already taken care of? There are so many ways to deal with this, and it is only getting worse. How can we expect to have people move to Yakima when it is too dangerous to walk on the streets?
\
Just enforce the laws that are already on the books, or don't make the laws. People are losing respect for everything and everyone in charge.

Human life for profit

\
All the talk of early release, alternate methods of punishment and rehabilitation and reviewing three-strikes cases may all be for naught. We taxpayers can continue to pay through the nose while hope for the many unjustly incarcerated (many for life) is down the drain.

Bullying postal service
\
To the editor -- Recently I received a letter from the U.S. Postal Service requesting me to move my mailbox by a certain date, or it would place my mail on hold. I was told that selected locations were chosen based on key factors including the risk of mail theft, safety of the letter carrier and the general public. and outdated mail receptacles.
\
I called the supervisor who sent the letter and said I am at no more risk of mail theft than most mailboxes, there are no safety issues with the letter carrier and the general public, my mailbox is only a few years old and it has been in the same location for 35 years with no problems.
\
After calling the post office, the supervisor then told me that the postmaster is arbitrarily telling customers to move their mailboxes.
\
There were no regulations quoted, so I asked that I be informed of the rules that they think I am violating and I would correct them if any.
\
The general public needs to know that they cannot be bullied by the postal service, and that the postal service employees need to worry about performing their jobs like the American people wants them to. It is called customer service!

46,"
OLYMPIA - The Washington Senate passed a climate change bill Wednesday that supporters called ""historic.""
\
""This bill puts Washington at the forefront of addressing global warming and will ensure Washington state plays a prominent role in shaping the national climate debate,"" said Bill LaBorde, program director for Environment Washington.
\
""I'm very pleased that the state Legislature has taken action to address the largest threat to our environment and economy,"" Gov. Chris Gregoire said after the vote. The legislation, which she requested, now goes to her desk for her signature.
\
Washington joins California and New Jersey in placing limits on greenhouse gas emissions.
\
House Bill 2815, a top priority of environmentalists, also starts the process of enacting a regional cap-and-grade system that is intended to reduce the state's carbon emissions by at least 70 percent over the next 40 years.
\
The Senate bill passed on a largely partisan 29-19 vote after an identical bill passed the House 64-31 on Feb. 19.
\
Republicans representing rural areas of the state introduced a string of amendments intended to weaken the measure.
\
But even some Democrats said the state might be entering uncharted territory by setting goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions without understanding how achieving those goals would affect the lives of Washington residents.
\
The bill has several parts.
\
It would require the state's largest industries and energy utilities to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions, to join a national registry of polluters, and eventually to live with new statewide emission caps.
\
It would direct the Department of Ecology to design a cap-and-trade system for limiting carbon emissions that would be presented to the 2009 Legislature, and that could become a model for a regional system covering several Western states and Canadian provinces.
\
It would require the Department of Transportation to adopt statewide goals for reducing per capita vehicle miles traveled by the year 2050.
\
And it would direct the Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development to survey the employment potential in clean-energy businesses. The state has already set a goal of creating 25,000 ""green-collar"" jobs by the year 2020.
\
Neither the House nor the Senate budget includes the $250,000 the governor requested to pay for that study, however. Without that funding, said Becky Kelley of the Washington Environmental Council, the green-collar jobs part of the bill is meaningless.
\
The bill mandates that the state reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, to 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2035, and to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
\
Sen. Jim Kastama, a Democrat from Puyallup, introduced several amendments that would have slowed the process by requiring state agencies to come back to the Legislature with specific plans showing how the state will meet those targets.
\
""Nobody knows what that mandate means in this state,"" Kastama said. ""No one knows the consequences."" Once the Legislature has a better grasp of the consequences, he said, it can decide whether to move forward.
\
""I can't see that we can bring ourselves back to those 1990 levels. There's no way,"" said Sen. Tim Sheldon, a Democrat from Potlatch. He noted that the population of the Puget Sound region is expected to grow by 1.5 million, or 40 percent, in coming decades.
\
""We really have to be realistic in our goals . . . and not just pick a goal we can't reach,"" he said.
\
Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, who led the Senate campaign for the bill and also prime-sponsored last year's climate change bill, disagreed.
\
""These are good goals,"" he said. ""We passed them last year. They were attainable then, they are attainable now.""
\
He noted that the precise language of the bill ""was very carefully negotiated"" and was agreed to by all stakeholders, including the industries that would be regulated under the measure.
\
Pridemore said the bill before the Senate ""simply lets us begin collecting the data"" on greenhouse gas emissions and establishes a framework for Washington to use in its negotiations with other members of the Western Climate Initiative.
\
Kastama was unconvinced. ""To make good public policy, you have to know the consequences,"" he said. ""It's important we know what we can manage and what we can't manage and lay that all out before us.""
\
Kastama's amendments failed.
\
Republicans took aim at language in the bill that calls for reducing driving statewide.
\
They said any effort to limit driving would unfairly discriminate against residents of rural areas who have to travel long distances for school, jobs and health care.
\
""You're not going to get chemotherapy in Ferry County,"" said Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville. ""Many of the services we need are 50 miles away.""
\
Sen. Jim Honeyford, a Republican from Sunnyside, near Yakima, said there's no way people in his part of the state can reduce their driving because they have to travel farther and have no access to mass transit.
\
""The only way you're going to do that is to take away the keys,"" he said.
\
""There's nothing in this bill that regulates the number of miles people can drive,"" countered Sen. Jim Hargrove, D-Hoquiam. Instead, he said, the bill asks the transportation department to suggest statewide strategies to reduce driving, such as encouraging telecommuting and flexible work schedules.
\
Sen. Dan Swecker, R-Rochester, said he would have been able to support the bill if it had focused on ways to get more fuel-efficient cars on the road. ""This issue of vehicle miles traveled is the wrong indicator,"" he said. ""We would have been better off to pick fuel efficiency.""

47,"We're being scammed\The Republicans are scamming us. Their tax plan delivers benefits to the rich through major cuts to programs needed and supported by the shrinking middle class. The tickler they offer is that U.S. corporations located overseas are encouraged, but not required, to relocate back in the U.S. to provide jobs. It's called trickle down, but more accurately it's trickle up. It was invented by President Reagan. It didn't work then, it won't work now.According to Factcheck.org and Politifact.com, by 2027, middle earners will pay more taxes, and the top 1 percent will pay less. It's time for middle-class folks to stop voting Republican.\David Irwin\Vancouver\GOP makes things worse\Currently, the national debt is $20 trillion, and that is expected to increase to $30 trillion by 2027, with deficits running nearly $1.5 trillion that year. This sounds bad, but the Republicans have a solution. Cut taxes and make it worse! If you're drowning in debt, cutting your income is the obvious solution. Right?To fund their $1.5 trillion tax cut, Republicans are writing IOUs for our grandkids to pay off. Running up a bill you have no intention of ever paying is just plain theft. Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, is proud of her vote. Seems to be the new normal for the Republican Party.If the Republicans truly wanted to stimulate the economy, they would be supporting a rebuilding of our infrastructure, which we know would create jobs here at home, and the grandkids would have something to show for the debt they're getting stuck with.Please vote in 2018.\Robert Neal\BATTLE GROUND\Programs are not handouts\The Dec. 6 editorial, “In Our View — CHIPS Not a Handout,” mentioned a word too often left out of discussions about certain social programs. This is a way to negate the importance of those programs and label them as giveaways when, in fact, they are part of a larger plan to assist certain segments of our population. Republicans see these programs as entitlements when, in fact, they're insurance programs.Social Security insurance began as help for the elderly. Medicare created a health insurance plan for retired folks. The Children's Health Insurance Program provides insurance to children whose families can't afford it. We pay for Social Security and Medicare from our wages and deserve the benefits we receive.CHIP gives kids a chance to stay healthy, helps financially stressed families and provides an alternative to using an emergency room for a primary pare appointment.Should CHIP remain unfunded, I wonder how much of their tax cut they'll reinvest in the working people of America.Will Rep. Herrera Beutler hold a town hall meeting for a panel with three empty chairs?\Randolph A. Cate\Vancouver\Pike is blind to the truth\Rep. Liz Pike's Dec. 7 opinion piece, “State's burdensome business climate drove G-P to flee,” got my attention. Given Pike's penchant for playing loose with the truth, let us review.She states Georgia-Pacific's “official” reason for curtailing some operations, i.e., lack of demand, and then takes eight bullet points to describe the “unofficial” reasons, i.e., sick leave for workers, cap-and-trade on carbon, tax rates, water-quality standards, something about Millennium Bulk Terminals, growth management, and last but not least, those pesky Democrats.First, if there were additional reasons for G-P's partial closure, don't you think G-P's management would want us to know what they were? Yes, they would. Moreover, most of Pike's unofficial motivations for G-P's decision have been coming down the, ahem, pike, for years now.You would think that G-P's management would've spoken up before now if indeed they were burdensome; they didn't, and Millennium Bulk Terminal's problems have nothing to do with G-P. As for those pesky Democrats? You gotta love 'em.Pike insists that if we'd “read between the lines” we would see the truth of the matter as she does. It must be nice to have Pike's microscopic X-ray vision.\Charlie Chappelle\Vancouver\Train decision trumps safety\An OPB story, “Trump administration rolls back oil train safety rules” (Dec. 7, The Columbian), reports that the Trump administration is killing Obama-era train safety regulations designed to combat train derailments and explosive spills such as happened in Mosier, Ore.The reason provided is that the cost of installing the new technology braking systems exceeds the value of the benefit received. It seems to me that we settled such ridiculous thinking years ago, when Ford was revealed to have decided to let their Pinto proceed to the public, because their payout over litigation resulting from fiery crashes would cost less than a recall and retool to fix the hazardous fuel tank problem.Since then, automaker recalls have been the rule, rather than the exception. The point being — safety — whether of the individual, the community, or the environment is paramount and without cost barrier. Corporations have proven, historically, that they will ignore such factors. Thus, government is required to implement regulations. We see it time and time again throughout our history. So, now we have an administration ordering that our lives, our communities, and our environments be less safe.One has to wonder — just how does this Make"
48,"Less than two months after Gov. Chris Gregoire and other state leaders proposed a groundbreaking law to combat climate change, political opposition has whittled the plan down to a shell of its former self.\""It's essentially a bill that does nothing,"" environmental lobbyist Clifford Traisman said Wednesday night, shortly after the Senate approved a much-amended version of the plan. ""They basically passed a bumper sticker.""\But the battle's not over, he and other proponents say. They're hoping to strengthen the bill as it moves through the House of Representatives in the next few weeks.\""It's up to the Legislature now to show leadership,"" said Jessica Finn Coven, with the group Climate Solutions.\Republicans and business groups have criticized the plan, calling it an expensive local approach to an international problem.\""Our economy is bleeding jobs. Why would we send our employers any message that a huge new tax is looming?"" said Sen. Janea Holmquist, R-Moses Lake.\Sen. Jerome Delvin, R-Richland, blasted ""this whole greenhouse gas fraud."" He told Democrats that he wasn't surprised that the bill had been toned down. ""That tells me that you've read the polling, too, that tells you people are all for the environment - until you tell them that it's going to cost them,"" said Delvin.\Lawmakers last year set standards for reducing Washington's greenhouse gas emissions. This year's bill would have set up a ""cap and trade"" system to measure pollutants, enforce limits and set up a way for industry to swap pollution credits.\In January, Gregoire criticized the Bush administration for ""dragging its feet"" on fighting global climate change. ""We choose action,"" she said at the time. ""...We must save the planet for our children and for our grandchildren.""\In the past two months, however, political opposition has stripped away much of the bill. What's left, both sides say, is largely a study of how to meet the goal set last year. But proponents argue that as the federal government moves ahead on the issue, the state must be ready.\Washington can't stand on the sidelines and be shut out of whatever national plan emerges, said Sen. Chris Marr. ""We can't afford inaction just because this bill is not perfected,"" he said.\Sen. Jim Hargrove, D-Hoquiam, compared the situation to the spotted owl debates in the early 1980s. Far better, he said, to be at the table when such decisions are made. ""We resisted like crazy, and we basically got run over,"" he said.\Credit: Richard Roesler Staff writer"
49,"
A Clean Air Rule announced last week by the state Department of Ecology appears to strike a reasonable balance between environmental and economic concerns.But much discussion and much work remains in the continuing debate over how much is too much or too little when it comes to adjusting regulations for a changing climate. While Gov. Jay Inslee long has made reducing carbon emissions a cornerstone of his administration, he has had difficulty securing buy-in from the Legislature and from many business interests throughout the state.One example can be found in the wrangling over the Clean Air Rule. In February, Inslees administration withdrew a draft proposal in the wake of criticism. At that time, a consortium of industries warned the governor that the plan could result in some of these sectors looking to other jurisdictions with more favorable manufacturing regulatory policies.Therein lies the need for balance. While a vast majority of climate scientists believe that human activity is playing a role in climate change, there also can be negative impacts to imprudently requiring a reduction in emissions. To use an extreme example we wouldnt expect or desire state government to outlaw the use of automobiles; the economy would collapse. At the other extreme, giving emission-producing industries free rein would irreparably damage the air and water in Washington and beyond.The new rule would apply initially to about 20 industries that annually release at least 100,000 metric tons of carbon, requiring them to reduce emissions by an average of 1.7 percent per year. Oil refineries and importers will bear much of the burden, being responsible not only for their emissions but for the carbon released by vehicles. The result likely will be an increase in gas prices for consumers.Meanwhile, the Department of Ecology made some concessions from its earlier draft proposal. For example, a Kaiser Aluminum plant near Spokane would receive credit for having cut emissions over the past decade. For another example, power-intensive industries facing overseas competition would receive credit if they already are more efficient than their industry average.Reaction has been mixed. Some environmentalists said the rules are a step in the right direction, while others chastised state officials for inaction. A Kaiser Aluminum spokesman said his company was cautiously optimistic while a spokesman for the Association of Washington Business said, We remain concerned about the potential economic damage. That is a good sign; understanding that no regulatory action can please everybody, the logical goal should be to please neither side.Inslee has made fighting climate change his primary platform but has been met with opposition in the Legislature, which failed to pass an ambitious cap-and-trade plan for cutting carbon emissions. While the Clean Air Rule can help reduce emissions in the state, meaningful action depends upon lawmakers.Such action should be at the forefront of legislative priorities. Although many conservatives dispute the scientifically accepted notion that human activity is leading to climate change, the issue is not solely about the climate. There are myriad benefits for the environment and for the health of Washingtonians to be gleaned from a reduction in carbon emissions, and our current leaders should view leaving a healthy ecology for future generations as a moral imperative.The Department of Ecology has taken a reasonable step in this regard, but much work remains.
"
50,"
Late last year, while stumping in support of his state budget proposal, Gov. Jay Inslee touched upon the difficulty of thinking outside the box. Innovative ideas, the governor noted, require time to take hold, grow roots, and extend their branches. In other words, sometimes patience is required for ambitious legislative agendas.All of that is relevant as Inslee takes a reasoned and measured approach in pursuit of his environmental goals for the state. On Tuesday, the governor directed the state Department of Ecology to develop a plan for capping carbon emissions throughout Washington, and to increase enforcement of existing pollution laws. Carbon pollution and the climate change it causes pose a very real and existential threat to our state, Inslee said in a statement.This is headline-worthy news, and the mention of climate change is certain to draw disagreement from some circles. Yet Inslees action reflects the patient statesmanship the contentious issue requires. According to the governors office, the plan to cap emissions would ensure that the state meets carbon limits set by the Legislature in 2008 and signed into law by then-Gov. Chris Gregoire. It also will take about a year for the Department of Ecology to devise new rules, giving the Legislature time to address the issue next year. And, finally, Inslee said he will not pursue a low-carbon fuel standard, which was the subject of a poison pill in the transportation package passed this year by lawmakers.The fuel standard Inslee had proposed would be designed to reduce carbon emitted from vehicles by 10 percent over 10 years. But legislators painted him into a corner when they included a provision in the $16.2 billion transportation bill that would transfer hundreds of millions of dollars from non-vehicle programs to roads funds if the governor issues a fuel standard by executive order. It was smart politics from those opposed to the fuel standard; it is wise for Inslee to drop his pursuit of the standard for now. Had he swallowed that poison pill, Inslee would have coughed up dollars for projects that expand upon his desired goal of environmental responsibility, and he would have expended much of the political capital he garnered in signing the bill.Instead, Inslee is pursuing his climate goals incrementally, which is the pragmatic approach. Directing the state to devise ways to cap emissions differs from his preferred cap-and-trade program in that it will not charge emitters for carbon pollution, and it sets an agenda for the state while leaving room for input from the Legislature. Moving forward on a regulatory limit on pollution will ensure that Washington addresses carbon pollution and maintains a robust investment in transit, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, ferries and other important transportation choices, Inslee said.That investment is crucial to the future of Washington. While critics fear negative economic impacts from such attention to environmental concerns, the overriding question is what kind of state we wish to create for future generations. As we move forward in assuring that a quality environment is there for our grandchildren, we also must keep looking for that sweet spot that also assures a strong job market.Inslee is on the right side of history regarding carbon emissions, but history often moves at a glacial pace. It requires time for ideas to be cultivated and watered and tended to before they are ready for harvest. His action this week amounts to the planting of seeds that now require care to ensure they blossom for the benefit of all.

Yakima County officials are unsure why the Terrace Heights landfill is included among the state's largest industrial polluters, a group that will be required to reduce carbon emissions by 5 percent every three years, under a proposed rule released Wednesday by state regulators.
\
Announced Wednesday by the state Department of Ecology, the proposed rule targets the largest emitters - power plants, refineries and manufacturers - in an effort to cut greenhouse gases.
\
Facilities that release more than 100,000 metric tons of the greenhouse gases that drive climate change would be subject to the new regulations. But the Terrace Heights Landfill produces around 85,000 metric tons, said Yakima County Solid Waste Manager Wendy Mifflin.
\
""Honestly, we don't know why we are on their list,"" Mifflin said. ""We're not even close to that, so we've been confused all along.""
\
Several other large landfills in Klickitat, King and Cowlitz counties are also on the state's list of facilities that would be covered by the new rule. The greenhouse gas methane, which is more powerful than carbon dioxide, is generated at landfills as waste decomposes.
\
A spokeswoman for the Ecology Department said that because the pollution limit will go down every three years, facilities that are under the 100,000 ton cap now would be subject to it in the future. The cap will be 70,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases by 2035.
\
""We thought best to ensure these organizations had this on their radar so it didn't come as a surprise,"" said Camille St. Onge.
\
But the Terrace Heights Landfill may also have made the list because the federal Environmental Protection Agency says it emitted 107,000 metric tons in 2014. The discrepancy between the 85,000 metric ton figure provided by the county and the one available on the EPA's website was not immediately clear.
\
Mifflin said that the county was waiting for more information from the state about the proposed rule before figuring out what the implications will be.
\
Under the proposal, regulated facilities would have several options for meeting the emission cuts: reducing their own direct emissions, buying credits from other entities that are reducing emissions, or investing in projects that cut emissions elsewhere in the state.
\
Other South Central Washington facilities that would be affected include Puget Sound Energy's Goldendale Generating Station, Boise Paper in Wallula, the Agrium Fertilizer plant in Kennewick, and two food processing plants, J.R. Simplot and McCain Foods, in Othello.
\
State officials say the rule is needed to protect human health and the environment from climate change.
\
""It's important that we act now to protect our water supplies, infrastructure and economy for future generations,"" Ecology Director Maia Bellon said in a prepared statement.
\
Environmental and other groups applauded the draft rule as a crucial step in addressing climate change. But business groups and others have worried the efforts could hurt the state's ability to attract and retain industries.
\
The draft rule comes after Gov. Jay Inslee failed last year to get legislation passed on his ambitious cap-and-trade plan that would have charged industrial facilities a fee for carbon emissions. In July, Inslee directed Ecology to limit carbon pollution using its existing authority under the state's Clean Air Act.

52,"OLYMPIA - A state agency didn't have the legal authority to order Washington utilities and oil refineries to come up with ways to reduce the pollution their products eventually emit when used by other people.\Such ""indirect emissions"" from the use of gasoline and natural gas weren't covered by the law passed by the Legislature in 2015, a majority of the court said Thursday.\""The issue is not whether man-made climate change is real - it is,"" Chief Justice Debra Stephens said in the majority opinion signed by four other justices.\The issue was whether the Department of Ecology has the authority to expand its standards to cover indirect emissions as well as the source of direct emissions. The department said it did, but ""Ecology is mistaken,"" Stephens wrote.\""The Legislature has not empowered Ecology to do whatever Ecology deems best for the environment,"" she wrote.\The department's regulations designed to gradually reduce greenhouse gas over time were challenged by the Association of Washington Business and various industry groups representing food processors, truckers, farmers, pulp and paper manufacturers and the petroleum industry, as well as Avista and other utilities. Groups including the Washington Environmental Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council weighed in on the side of the department's regulations.\Indirect emissions from natural gas and petroleum products account for half of all greenhouse gas emissions in Washington. They include the air pollution in the exhaust from cars and trucks, and from the use of natural gas in homes, small businesses and vehicles.\But the large businesses that distribute or sell those products do not control the amount of fuel or gas burned, and the department acknowledged they can't make direct emissions reductions, the court majority said.\""The rule requires these businesses to pay to offset the emissions caused by third parties using their products,"" Stephens wrote.\Gov. Jay Inslee said the majority's opinion that climate change is real and action is needed should end any debate on those points. But he disagreed with the conclusion the department can't regulate indirect emissions.\""This ruling will significantly affect our ability to reduce emissions,"" he said, and it should add urgency to legislative efforts this year to fight climate change.\The ruling should ""re-energize"" his proposal for clean fuel standard that would gradually reduce the amount of pollutants in gasoline and diesel, Inslee said at a news conference shortly after the opinion was released. His staff is reviewing the court ruling for other possible action, and one option could be asking the Legislature to pass a law giving the department the authority to regulate indirect emissions, which the court said could have been spelled out in the law, but wasn't.\Critics hailed the decision as striking down onerous rules on oil refiners and natural gas suppliers that would have led to higher prices for consumers.\""The Inslee administration overstepped its authority when it decided to force a 'cap and trade' program on the state of Washington without a vote of the Legislature,"" Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, said. ""This case was a classic example of government arrogance and overreach.""\Contact the writer:\(360) 664-2598\jimc@spokesman.com\Emissions\CREDIT: Jim Camden The Spokesman-Review"
53,"Washington lawmakers have little time remaining to invest in our state and prepare for a prosperous post-pandemic future. The end of the 105-day legislative session is Sunday, setting the stage for a busy week of defining the priorities of the state's residents.\Of course, a special session is possible; but whether the end arrives this week or during an overtime session, legislators should deliver a comprehensive transportation package. They should adopt a plan that would invest $17.8 billion over 16 years to boost mobility while also making progress in reducing carbon emissions.\Clark County residents know all too well the impact of infrastructure investment— and the lack of such investment. For years, we have needed a new Interstate 5 Bridge that is seismically sound and that keeps the local economy moving. The cost of an outdated bridge is evident with every minute sat idling in traffic; the price is paid by individuals as well as companies that rely on the transportation of goods and services.\As The Seattle Times writes editorially: “A diverse coalition of business, union, environment and government interests have urged lawmakers to get a transportation deal done, now: from Amazon, Microsoft and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan to Climate Solutions and the Washington State Labor Council. This package would make crucial infrastructure improvements while leveraging a cap-and-trade mechanism to cut the state's greenhouse gas pollution, an achievement that has long eluded Gov. Jay Inslee.”\Climate initiatives long have been a political football, even in our environmentally conscious state. But corporations are increasingly recognizing the need for quick and robust climate action, belying the well-worn trope that reducing carbon emissions will have a negative impact on the economy.\The need for investment is self-evident. According to the federal Bureau of Transportation, only 72 percent of Washington highways were in acceptable condition as of 2019; and according to the Washington State Department of Transportation, deferred repairs costing $14.8 billion over the next decade will be required to sustain “minimally acceptable condition” for the state's infrastructure.\While President Joe Biden's proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure investment over the next 10 years has received much attention, the plan before the Legislature is a reminder that all politics is local. Investment here will put people to work in our state on projects that will directly benefit Washington residents and businesses.\More than $5 billion for the construction plan would come from a carbon pricing bill that already has passed the Senate; it would reduce emissions while investing in cleaner transportation. Additional funding would come from a gas-tax increase of 9.8 cents per gallon, fee increases and new debt.\Any proposed increase to the state gas tax, which already is the fourth-highest in the nation, understandably will grab the attention of voters. Nobody likes paying higher taxes.\But the primary argument in favor of a gas-tax increase is that it is a user fee; unlike many other taxes, revenue directly benefits those who pay the tax — people using the roads. If we can agree that roads and bridges are a wise investment, it makes sense for the people and businesses who use them to pay for the bulk of that investment.\Regarding infrastructure and climate initiatives, Washington is at a crossroads. Lawmakers should invest in the future, focusing on the long-term"
54,"Ken Burns' latest documentary, ""The Dust Bowl,"" provides a timely reminder that junk science once compelled Americans to commit ruinous acts against nature. ""Rain follows the plow"" was the conventional wisdom of yesteryear. The mere act of turning the soil in the Great Plains would be enough to produce sufficient rainfall to sustain a comfortable farming life, or so the theory went.\That's all the purveyors of Manifest Destiny needed to hear, and so Native Americans and vast buffalo herds were removed with brutal swiftness. Then it was up to the land speculators and other hucksters of the day to sell ancient grasslands as an agricultural wonderland. As it turned out, there was a reason few people lived there, and Mother Nature delivered a decade-long reminder during the Dirty Thirties.\Fast forward to today, and we have mounds of research that shows human activity is altering the climate. But it's gathering dust.\Every relevant scientific academy concurs, but it isn't politically correct to do much about it. Potential profits triggered the tragic plowing of the Great Plains. The prospect of losing money has sparked successful attacks on climate science.\The Heartland Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute and others like them spread information that consistently raises doubts about global warming. Their funding comes from individuals and industries that would be hurt if the government were to ever act. It's similar to the campaigns waged on behalf of Big Tobacco when the link to cancer was denied with a straight face.\In a 2007 Pew Center Research Poll, 63 percent of Republican respondents said there was solid evidence of global warming. Three years later, 53 percent said there wasn't. Among tea party adherents, 70 percent are nonbelievers.\When President Barack Obama first took office, many corporations had already signed up for a partnership with the government on how to deal with the problem. Cap and trade won out over a carbon tax, because that strategy had the free enterprise elements businesses prefer. But the bill was stymied in Congress, and Obama didn't put up much of a fight.\Then Hurricane Sandy hit, and now many East Coast Americans are beginning to wonder whether this is their future. BusinessWeek quickly came out with a cover story on global warming urging leaders to act. The article noted what scientists have been saying for years: While no individual storm can be linked to global warming, an amped-up climate is going to deliver more unusual weather.\U.S. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., is the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works. He calls global warming a hoax. U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who is the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is a moderate who used to work on bipartisan emissions bills. But, recently, a ""Frontline"" reporter asked him, ""Do you think climate change is causing the earth to become warmer?"" He replied, ""I'm sorry, I'm just not going to answer that.""\Meanwhile, Democrats might as well be changing the subject, because they haven't made the issue a priority.\Insurance actuaries don't need votes; they look at the data and adjust rates accordingly. They are treating global warming as a fact. Transportation planners would like to do the same, but they rely on political processes for approval. They're worried that future bridge, rail, highway, shipping and mass transit projects are not being adjusted for the inevitable impacts of climate change.\The campaign against global warming has effectively cowed politicians, but nature isn't going to knuckle under. Rain didn't follow the plow. Policy hasn't followed the science. Our descendants will curse our selfishness.\Wayne Lewis, who was a child of the Dust Bowl, summed up the lesson in the documentary: ""We want it now, and if makes money it's a good idea. But it isn't necessarily a good idea if the thing we're doing is going to mess up the future.""\Associate Editor Gary Crooks can be reached at garyc@spokesman.com or (509) 459-5026.

55,"Rep. Liz Pike\It felt like a gut punch — the kind that bends you over in shock and agony. A Georgia-Pacific representative called to tell me company officials decided to permanently shut down a major portion of the Camas paper and pulp mill, ending some 300 family-wage jobs. G-P will continue tissue-manufacturing operations that support 140 local jobs, but will redirect paper operations to its Louisiana mill.\I'm thankful the entire Camas operations will not close but devastated for this loss to our community. Operating since 1884, five years before Washington became a state, the Camas mill has provided a steady paycheck for thousands of workers, including some in my family. With an average hourly rate of $27, G-P has contributed more than $46 million annually to our local economy. It has also invested tens of millions of dollars to clean emissions and ensured minimal impact to our environment.Officially G-P says, “Economic impacts from the continuing decline in demand for communication papers make it necessary to discontinue operations” in Camas.Unofficially, it's not difficult to read between the lines. Employers tell me it is increasingly impossible to do business in Washington. Many feel they are under attack. Why shouldn't they? Consider this:n Come January, employers will be required to provide all workers with paid sick leave and by 2020, paid family and medical leave. Gov. Jay Inslee has ordered the Department of Ecology to implement a cap-and-trade rule strictly limiting carbon production from 68 entities, including the Camas mill, with fines of up to $10,000 per day. I'm for green energy jobs, but how do we reduce carbon if we must import those goods back to Washington from the other jobs we've chased away from our state?n Inslee wants a carbon tax against employers. Now that the Legislature is under Democratic control, many believe a new carbon tax is likely. The governor vetoed a lower tax rate for manufacturers, ending hope that those resources could be used to expand and attract manufacturing jobs in Washington. New water-quality standards are expected to cost paper mills and other factories millions of dollars to upgrade their technologies to ensure water returned to rivers, lakes and streams is cleaner than when they received it. After years of forcing Millennium Bulk Terminals to navigate a lengthy regulatory process for construction of an export terminal in Longview, DOE denied a water-quality permit based on criteria unrelated to water, killing the project. It demonstrated the bureaucratic nightmare of obtaining a permit to operate in Washington. Restrictions under the Growth Management Act have artificially reduced available land for development and excessively prolonged the permitting process, especially in the rural, economically distressed areas of Washington. My efforts to allow limited industrial development along several short-line railroads in our state (House Bill 1504) were originally met by Gov. Inslee's veto pen. It was only after we reduced the bill to Clark and Okanogan counties that the governor finally agreed to sign revised legislation (Senate Bill 5517) — and even that miniscule GMA reform was met with resistance and required intense negotiations. The Democrats' new majority in the Legislature clears the way for the possibility of a new capital gains tax, increased business and occupation taxes, and increased real estate excise taxes. They are also testing the state constitution for an income tax.Employers may be able to handle some of these individual challenges. Collectively, it's no wonder why G-P, Alcoa and other companies have charted exit strategies from Washington into business-friendly regions where they can fairly compete.G-P's mill closure in Camas is a gut-wrenching lesson in the realities of our state's economy. Either we improve our business climate or it won't be long before someone erects a sign reading, “Will the last employer leaving Washington please turn\CREDIT: Rep. Liz Pike"

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee gives his annual State of the State speech Tuesday in the House chambers before a joint session of the Legislature in Olympia.
\
Washington Supreme Court Justices, from right, Mary Yu, Sheryl Gordon McCloud, Steven Gonzalez, Charles Wiggins and Debra Stephens applaud during introductions prior to Gov. Jay Inslees speech Tuesday before a joint session of the Legislature in Olympia.
\
Gov. Jay Inslee used his State of the State address on Tuesday to promote familiar themes: the importance of investing in early childhood education, forcing polluters to pay and the states need for a transportation package.
\
The state is at a crossroads, the governor said during his speech. One path leads to a thriving economy and a healthy environment.
\
The other leads to a slow erosion of our shared prosperity, a widening gap of inequality and a deterioration of our clean air and water.
\
House Speaker Pro Tempore Jim Moeller, D-Vancouver, said the address resonated with his party.
\
Inslee proposed a 7 percent capital gains tax on the sale of stocks, bonds and other assets, with some exceptions, and a cap-and-trade program that would have the states top polluters pay for carbon emissions.
\
He outlined the whole idea behind the capital gains tax very well and made very good progressive statements, Moeller said.
\
Although the governor addressed proposals hes introduced before, Moeller said Inslees approach stood out in his address.
\
Rather than the usual suspects of the sales tax and the (business and occupation) tax and so forth, this governor is really thinking outside of the box to make sure Washingtons tax system is fairer for everyone.
\
Republicans quickly responded to the governors speech and voiced concerns his proposals would hurt the states economy.
\
I love the governors optimism, Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, said. I think its wonderful, and I hope to capture some of that optimism and energy to come up with something that really works and that will not damage the working families of this state.
\
Sen. Linda Evans Parlette, R-Wenatchee, said looking at the tax system needs to be done holistically and not during the legislative session.
\
Inslee said the capital gains tax hes proposed would apply to less than 1 percent of the states residents.
\
A new teacher pays three times more in taxes, as a percentage, than our wealthiest citizen, Inslee said.
\
The governor also used his speech to advocate for an end to cutting services and a focus on raising revenue.
\
Weve reached the place where multiple courts have said we cut too much or neglected to fund adequately and have now ordered us to do a better job on foster care, mental health and protecting vulnerable children, Inslee said.
\
The states top court ruled in September to hold the Legislature in contempt for not moving swiftly enough to adequately fund the states public education system. Lawmakers have until the end of this session to make sufficient progress or they could face sanctions. In another ruling, the court also ended psychiatric boarding, the practice of holding mental health patients in emergency rooms. That means the state needs to find more resources for adequate treatment and more mental health beds.
\
The governor also called upon lawmakers to pass a transportation package.
\
Without action, Inslee said, bridges will become structurally deficient or functionally obsolete and commute times will continue to rise, robbing us of time with our families.
\
In the past couple of years, lawmakers have failed to pass a transportation package. On Tuesday, Republicans again said they are in favor of a transportation package but not without reforms and a renewed trust in the state Department of Transportation.
\
Despite the caveats, Senate Republican Leader Mark Schoesler, R- Ritzville, said he believes a package could pass this session.
\
Im an optimist, he said.

WASHINGTON -- President Bush asked Congress Tuesday to approve his plan for reducing pollution from power plants, trying for a second day to revive legislation that has stalled for more than a year.
\
His task grew more complicated when three House members, including a Republican, introduced legislation they said would reduce air pollution faster than Bush's plan. It would also regulate industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, which scientists blame for global warming and which Bush does not address in his initiative.
\
On a cloudless afternoon, Bush stood in the East Garden of the White House and said: ""The sky is clear and we intend to keep it that way.""
\
Bush first proposed a plan he dubbed Clear Skies in February 2002, but it has gone nowhere in Congress, even as Republicans have taken control of the House and Senate.
\
The legislation only got its first hearing in the House in July of this year. Bush said he had lobbied Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman Environment and Public Works Committee, on the Truman Balcony to help pass the legislation in the Senate. But Democrats might be able to block Clear Skies by protesting that it does not tackle carbon dioxide.
\
Bush did not mention that criticism Tuesday.
\
Instead, he met with an array of people who support the plan, including state and local officials, power plant managers and business leaders. Bush also met with the executive director of the Adirondack Council, an environmental group that has backed Clear Skies in the past, angering other environmental groups.
\
The Clean Air Trust, which seeks to educate the public about the Clean Air Act, took the unprecedented step of declaring the Adirondack Council its ""clean air villain of the month"" last year for backing Bush's plan.
\
But John Sheehan, spokesman for the Adirondack Council, said his group supports Clear Skies because it expands the Clean Air Act's Acid Rain Program by requiring deeper cuts in sulfur dioxide than the Clean Air Act. Even given the new flexibility granted to power plants under Bush's plan, it would ""stop the damage acid rain is doing in the Adirondacks and elsewhere,"" Sheehan said.
\
Bush's proposal calls for a cap-and-trade system. It would establish a ceiling, or cap, on the amount of emissions from power plants that are major sources of two kinds of dirty air: nitrogen oxide, which causes smog; and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain.
\
Utilities that exceeded the limits could purchase credits from other energy producers whose emissions are lower and that choose to sell their ability to pollute.
\
Bush says his goal over the next 15 years is to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 73 percent, nitrogen oxide emissions by 67 percent and mercury emissions by 69 percent.
\
""It'll make it financially worthwhile for companies to invest earlier in controls and therefore pollute less,"" Bush said. ""And by taking this action, and I urge Congress to take the action, we'll have more affordable energy, more jobs and cleaner skies.""
\
But the Clean Air Trust said Bush's proposal ""would shred current Clean Air Act protections.""
\
""The president appears to be trying to breathe new life into a bill that appears dead in the waters because so many people oppose it,"" said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust.
\
""The Bush 'Clear Skies' initiative is a plan endorsed by the nation's biggest polluters because it gives them huge breaks,"" O'Donnell said in a statement. ""The Bush plan would postpone deadlines for meeting clean air standards and would eliminate safeguards in current law designed to protect local communities from health problems caused by dirty air.""
\
The White House said Clear Skies would impose the first nationwide cap for mercury emissions. But the Clean Air Trust said Bush's plan would repeal controls on mercury pollution due to take effect by late 2007.

To the editor -- This is in response to Ed Patton's Dec. 28 letter.

We hear alarmists shouting Al Gore statements about melting polar caps and glacier retreats based on scientific data; data that has been ""doctored"" according lately to public admissions from the scientific community. There is a vast and growing literature of extremely well-qualified skeptics who doubt the very premise behind the international hysteria -- that fluctuations in human-caused CO2 emissions have anything much to do with either global or regional temperature trends. Most have noticed that the trends coincide much better with solar cycles, beyond human control. It all boils down to another government program (called cap-and-trade) to control us more.

Drinking water is safe
\
To the editor -- John Putney's Jan. 4 letter may have created unfounded concern about the city of Yakima's drinking water system. However, ongoing testing clearly demonstrates that Yakima's drinking water is safe.
\
In 1992, the federal Environmental Protection Agency began requiring the city to test both its drinking water delivery system and individual home plumbing systems for lead. The EPA standard for acceptable lead content in drinking water is 15 parts-per-billion.
\
Over the past 17 years, periodic tests have shown that the lead content in the city's drinking water delivery system has averaged about 2 PPB, far below the EPA standard.
\
Of the 307 homes tested since 1992, 135 have shown no detectable lead in their individual plumbing systems. Test results from the remaining 172 averaged 2.8 PPB.
\
Mr. Putney may have been referring to test results from 2006 in which one home's individual plumbing system appeared to have lead levels slightly above the EPA standard. However, that same home was retested a month later and registered just 2 PPB.
\
Based on hundreds of tests, including lead analysis, conducted each year, Yakima's drinking water consistently ranks among the safest in the nation. The city of Yakima is proud of that record and the quality service it provides to customers.

Hockey isn't new, but it would be new to the Valley. This town has always been a baseball, basketball, football town. However, hockey is something new that we could embrace and fall in love with. I went to a Tri-City Americans game a few years ago and was blown away by the product on the ice. It was obviously a fan-friendly environment for all ages. I am now a season-ticket holder who drives 160 miles round trip 40-plus times a season to see my team play. I would gladly give up that drive to have my own home town team, and I'm sure there are plenty of others out there who would do the same.

Replacing outdated equipment is a regular business decision at Shields Bag & Printing that also has environmental benefits.
\
So for the Yakima-based plastics company, the market is a better driver for reducing emissions than Gov. Jay Inslee's proposed Carbon Pollution Accountability Act.
\
""I think there are a lot of other ways to go about it,"" said Derek LaFramboise, Shields' environmental service manager.
\
For example, some of Shields' customers won't do business with companies that haven't taken documented steps to reduce carbon emissions.
\
""We have customers that require us to report improvements to our processes,"" LaFramboise said Friday in a telephone interview.
\
Under Inslee's proposal, outlined earlier this week, business entities in the state with emissions equal to or exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide would need to pay one ""allowance"" for every metric ton of greenhouse gas released. The revenue would be used to fund education and transportation.
\
The carbon tax is part of Inslee's more comprehensive plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles, cleaner fuel standards and research on renewable energy.
\
For now, local businesses leaders and industry groups are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach toward the idea, though they have plenty of questions about how it would be implemented and are skeptical there would be any real impact on the environment.
\
About 135 facilities statewide, including fuel refineries and distributors, utilities and transportation companies, are among the businesses that would be regulated under the Carbon Pollution Accountability Act.
\
The state Department of Ecology, which would administer the program, has published a preliminary list of entities with major greenhouse gas emissions. None of them is headquartered in Yakima County, though a few, such as Pasco-based Connell Oil Inc., have operations here. The agency has said other entities will be added to the list.
\
Shields Bag & Printing is not on the list; its emissions are well below the 25,000-metric-ton mark. Still, LaFramboise doesn't think it would be immune from the effects of the proposed tax, namely through its use of fuel and other raw materials.
\
While going after the major emitters makes sense from a political standpoint, the question is whether companies will reduce emissions significantly in response, he said.
\
In a policy brief, the governor's office said major emitters such as refineries would have the choice to either invest in cleaner technology or pay for allowances that would be more costly over time.
\
Given the sizable investment to purchase new equipment or fund other operation changes, many entities, at least in the short term, will likely opt to pay the tax and pass on the cost to customers, LaFramboise said.
\
That's when consumers are likely to see the impact at the gas pump or in the cost of raw material used by manufacturers, including Shields.
\
Inslee claims the impact at the pump would be about 2 cents per gallon by 2020. But Lea Wilson, executive director of the Washington Oil Marketers Association, based in Olympia, said that's a difficult number to predict.
\
""I don't know the real (price impact),"" she said. ""I'm not sure if anyone knows the real number.""
\
Gary Christensen, CEO of R.E. Powell, a Grandview company that distributes fuel to more than 250 gas stations in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, said the increase at the pump could be significant, especially if other aspects of Inslee's plan, such as requiring a lower-carbon fuel standard for vehicles, are implemented.
\
Currently a majority of gas in this state, especially this side of the state, comes from refineries located outside Washington. If the Legislature implemented a lower-carbon fuel standard, those refineries may not play along since most states they ship to do not have a similar standard, Christensen said.
\
That could create a supply problem that, when combined with costs passed through from a carbon tax, would result in a large increase in fuel costs for consumers and businesses.
\
""We all know this is just a soft sell, another way to tax Washingtonians at a minimum benefit to the emissions situation,"" Christiansen said.
\
Still, Wilson and many others in the business community say Inslee's proposal is in the early stages.
\
""Just like everyone else, we're trying to understand it,"" Wilson said. ""Clearly we have, in my opinion, an entire legislative session to discuss this. This is (Inslee's) first stab.""
\
David McFadden, president of New Vision, Yakima County's economic development arm, said he feels Inslee wanted to put something on the table, but he expects the proposal to be fully vetted in the months to come.
\
""Given the political divide, I think we're going to be reading about these cap-and-trade options in May and June,"" he said, referring to the Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled House.
\
A broader discussion and debate on whether such policies are best at either the state or federal level, is also needed.
\
""I can imagine some of the frustration from some of the interests of waiting on Washington, D.C.,"" McFadden said. ""But I'm not sure (a state carbon tax) is the best approach versus other options, (such as) a broader federal option.""

Sharon Wylie, R-4\Clark County lawmakers outline priorities for session\When the Washington Legislature convenes Monday, it will be for a session unlike any other in the state's history.\The starkest change: Jan. 11 will likely be the only day that lawmakers actually convene in Olympia. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to rip through the state — nearly a year to the day after a Washington resident was diagnosed with the first case of the virus in the country — and nearly all the work of government will be conducted remotely in the coming months.\“We in the House will arrive for the purposes of official business that we have to do according to the constitution,” said Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, who will again serve as the House majority floor leader. That business includes electing the speaker, speaker pro tem and chief clerk, as well as adopting a temporary set of rules that will allow the House to govern from home.\“We will reconvene the next day from our remote offices,” Stonier said.\COVID-19 will dominate not just the format of the session, but also the content. The pandemic will weave through most major decisions that the Legislature will need to grapple with, steering discussions around everything from passing a budget to prioritizing a transportation package.\On Page A4, read about the top issues to watch for in Washington's upcoming legislative session.\Education\In interviews with The Columbian, lawmakers from both parties said that getting students back on track is their top priority.\Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, said experts are reporting some students have lost up to two years of progress. Rivers, who was recently elected as the Republican Senate caucus chair, added that she'd be open to pursuing a bill that would establish a temporary year-round school calendar or a more robust summer school option once in-person instruction is safe.\“We have to figure out how we're going to make up that learning loss,” Rivers said. “We cannot just carry on as if nothing happened.”\“One thing that we've done already is we've applied pressure to move up vaccinations for teachers so they can feel safe in their work environment,” Rivers added. “They've now moved up, but we have to make sure they're verified and have access to the vaccine.”\As to when kids can head back into their classrooms across the state, that's still up in the air. Stonier, who serves on the House Education Committee, pointed out that there's little that the Legislature can directly do to get kids back in the classrooms.\“The Legislature doesn't have the level of decision making there that folks sometimes think they do. The local health departments determine when schools can open,” Stonier said.\State lawmakers can, however, fund programs to create environments that could make classroom learning safer. Stonier said she plans to support legislation that would provide more personal protective gear, better systems for contact tracing, and more school staff so that students can cohort in smaller groups in the case of an outbreak.\She also plans to promote an under-addressed side of the pandemic in the upcoming session, Stonier said.\“You're going to see investments in behavioral health, mental health services,” Stonier said. “It's something that's already necessary, but we don't have a way to get to kiddos when they're not already in school.”\Infrastructure\Rep. Sharon Wylie, D-Vancouver, who serves as vice chair of the House Transportation Committee, said the group plans to present a 16-year transportation infrastructure plan no later than two weeks into the session.\The plan sprung from 90 remote meetings hosted by Wylie and five other representatives. They heard from stakeholders that included environmental groups, business organizations, cities, ports and unions.\Washington residents should expect to see an ambitious plan this year, Wylie said.\“We are going to try to do as much as possible, because transportation packages are huge economic benefits, both short and long term. They get people back to work in a whole lot of different ways,” Wylie said, pointing to the employment rate that continues to lag behind pre-pandemic levels. “Having all parts of our state working, transportation-wise, is critically important to our recovery.”\Funding for the Interstate 5 Bridge Replacement Program will continue into the year, though that revived effort to replace the span is still in early planning stages and will require more collaboration with local and federal lawmakers in both Washington and Oregon.\The Legislature may also look to expand broadband access this year, treating internet access as a public utility in the same category as roadways, Wylie said.\Most of the funding in the package will focus on repairing and caring for assets that already exist. Roads and bridges built during the state's 1950s transportation infrastructure boom are falling into disrepair, and will get more expensive to fix with every year that passes.\Maintenance isn't as exciting as a shiny new project, Wylie said, but crucial for the state's overall economy.\“People like to cut ribbons,” she added wryly.\Health care\COVID-19 has exposed the cracks in the state's public health system that leave the most vulnerable populations without coverage, said Rep. Paul Harris, R-Vancouver.\Harris, who sits on the House Health Care and Wellness Committee, said he favors dipping into the state's $2.5 billion rainy day fund to fully fund a more robust public health option.\“Public Health has come and advocated funds, and we've given them a pittance,” Harris said. “In the last four or five years, they've asked for $60 to $70 million. We've given them $5 million.”\Distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will also top the Legislature's priorities in the upcoming session. While state lawmakers hold little authority in dose dispersal — that responsibility lies with local health authorities, following instructions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — they have a role to play in logistics and communication, Harris said.\It's vital that leaders engender confidence in the vaccine's safety among the general public, he continued.\“If they would give me the vaccine today, I would absolutely take it. … We need to get over the politics of the vaccine because it isn't political,” Harris said.\“Our communities that need it the most, who are African American, Black or Hispanic, they are getting the disease disproportionately more than others, and probably they have the least confidence in our system. I think we need to double our efforts in those areas.”\In their last session, the Legislature expanded telehealth options. Since then, Harris said, telemedicine visits have “skyrocketed to the tune of about 700 percent.”\Stonier, who also serves on the House health committee, said the upcoming session will focus on further expanding telehealth options and closing loopholes to ensure that those visits are reimbursed at the same rate as in-person appointments.\Both Harris and Stonier said that improving broadband access in underserved and rural areas is directly related to health care, and another key priority this year.\“The disparity of those who have good broadband access falls along the same lines of those who have experienced the worst of COVID,” Harris said.\Budget\Washington is currently bucking apocalyptic predictions that arose early in the COVID-19 outbreak, when budget forecasters told lawmakers to plan for an $8.8 billion deficit through 2023.\Stronger-than-expected returns on tax collections have pared that figure down to a more manageable $2.4 billion. Aid from the federal government as part of the latest round of pandemic relief funds helped further cushion the blow.\In late 2020, Gov. Jay Inslee unveiled a proposed budget that suggested recouping some of that lost revenue with a new capital gains tax. The tax would collect 9 percent of profits (above $25,000 for single filers) earned from selling assets like stocks and bonds starting in 2022. His office predicts the tax would collect $1.1 billion in 2023, and impact around 2 percent of the state's households.\“It's a very limited request to help a lot of people,” Inslee told The Columbian's Editorial Board in December. “We think it is a reasonable thing.”\The Democratic governor's budget also proposes implementing a cap-and-trade carbon pricing program. If implemented, it's too soon to calculate the long-term impact on the budget. The sponsor of its companion bill, Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, has said it could raise up to $1 billion annually.\Both proposals received strong pushback from Republicans in both the House and the Senate. Harris, who also serves as the House minority caucus chair, said that House Republicans plan to present a counterproposal early in the week that would fully utilize the state's rainy day fund in lieu of new taxes.\Washington's budgetary outlook is still relatively healthy, said Sen. Lynda Wilson, R-Vancouver, and the leftover deficit is small enough that it could be absorbed by the state's rainy day fund.\Wilson, who serves as ranking minority member of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, said she and many of her colleagues won't support any tax increases in the coming legislative session.\“They're nonstarters, for me and for most Republicans,” Wilson said.\That doesn't mean they're dead in the water. Washington's majority-Democratic Legislature could pass both a carbon pricing program and a capital gains tax. Inslee said he expects the capital gains portion to be challenged and upheld in the state's court system.\Rivers, who also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, has a different prediction.\“The capital gains income tax is unconstitutional,” Rivers said. “Especially with the money coming from the feds, we're in very good shape. We don't need to raise taxes.”\Accountability\Legislators have had limited influence over the state's pandemic response. Many GOP lawmakers — and a handful of Democrats — have expressed frustration with the emergency executive orders from Inslee that steered Washington's response to the virus.\Wilson said her top priority in the upcoming session is balancing the governor's power with a stronger check from the Legislature. She has filed legislation that would require all of the governor's emergency orders to be approved by the House and Senate after 30 days. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Mark Mullet, a Democrat.\“It doesn't limit (Inslee's) powers — it just adds us to the conversation,” Wilson said. “We've become largely irrelevant in the last 10 months, and that's not how our Legislature should be.”\The remote format of the session is also drawing condemnation from some members, who claim that halting all in-person meetings creates hurdles for transparency and government accessibility.\The state's public affairs channel, TVW, will broadcast the session on cable and online.\Wilson said she worries about the fallibility of the technology needed to broadcast the session. She also wonders about how some less tech-savvy Washingtonians — “Like my mother, her generation, she doesn't do computers,” Wilson said — will adapt to the new format.\Lawmakers can debate in good faith about how best to maintain transparency, Stonier said. But she disagreed that the remote forum was limiting for government access, countering that it actually grants more people the opportunity to participate and contribute because they don't need to make the commute to Olympia. Wylie expressed a similar point of optimism.\“I have noticed in the committee meetings we've had virtually, we've actually had more people able to participate, able to watch live, and offer input,” Wylie said. “In some ways, I'm really grateful for the technology th\CREDIT: Calley Hair The Columbian"

Consider fareless routes for C-Tran
\
Heres a solution that could save billions of dollars and move people across the Interstate 5 Bridge efficiently and inexpensively when compared to light rail. Make C-Tran buses fareless for all routes. Please stop and think about it before pooh-poohing the idea.
\
The fares charged by C-Tran pay little of the actual operation costs. Taxpayers have already spent millions of dollars just on studies for the Columbia River Crossing. It seems that once a study is done another one starts. With fareless rides on all routes, the need to spend billions of dollars for a new bridge, light rail and its operation will not be necessary.
\
More buses will be needed and labor to operate them but it will never come to the billions of dollars that light rail will cost just for building it, let alone operating it. The environment will be much better served as well. C-Tran has done a great job in procuring energy-efficient buses. No ugly overhead lines are needed to operate them and roads wont be torn up for years, as in building a new bridge and light rail.
\
Nothing is free, but this solution is considerably cheaper than light rail, billions of dollars cheaper.

Interpretation of free speech conflicts
\
I was just sickened to read the Sept. 29 story High court to decide free speech vs. cruelty, about videos of animal torture being protected by free speech laws. If an act is against the law, as animal cruelty and torture is in all 50 states, how could the video of such acts not be against the law also? Are we such a sick society that we dont see this as wrong?
\
Interestingly enough, right next to the story was the report of, Facebook poll asks if Obama should be killed; probe launched, about a poll asking the question, Should Obama be killed? That poll was pulled from Facebook and rightly so. However, it leads me to ask why is that not infringement of First Amendment rights and publication of animal torture video is being considered as infringement?

Bairds effort is too little, too late
\
I wholeheartedly endorse the idea of at least 72 hours to review and think about a bill that congressmen are asked to vote upon. Sponsoring a bill to do that may take some courage, but I am sure it is common for a congressman to sponsor a bill that is in the best interest of the country and then have it die.
\
If Rep. Brian Baird, D-Wash., were truly courageous, he would have stood on his principles and voted no on the stimulus bill, the cap and trade and health care bills while making it clear that he could not vote for a bill he and his staff did not have time to read.
\
Sponsoring a bill that probably will not pass may make good press now and at election time, but I dont find it very courageous.

Declare victory and depart
\
An Oct. 1 story reported, Obama officials split on Afghanistan. First of all, common sense says that I should not be writing this after just returning from a 27-hour flight from Kabul, Afghanistan. But, in collecting my newspaper from the porch this early morning, I found the above-mentioned article on the front page and the following ensued.
\
My comment (based only on only one very introspective month in Afghanistan) is thus: We have already won the four major cities. Kudos to us and the Afghans. Declare victory now and depart. Why expend more dollars and lives into pacifying the frontier, which absolutely no Afghani wants pacified or occupied? Their thoughts and memories of this remote and untamed frontier is not unlike our own longings for the good old American West.

More mess with more change
\
President Obamas ego took a major hit when he was rejected by the International Olympic Committee concerning bringing the Olympic games to Chicago. I was personally delighted to see it. He will meet the same fate when he meets with Iran. Hillary Clinton was right: He is a complete novice when it comes to foreign policy.
\
What was Obamas wife doing there with him? She is not an elected official. I believe a first lady should be seen and not heard. Obama takes this trip on taxpayer money while thousands of people are losing their jobs and some their unemployment benefits. Now there is change you can believe in. Health care is a mess, Afghanistan is a mess, Iran is a mess. All these things are things you can believe in. As Rev. Jeremiah Wright said, Americas chickens are coming home to roost.

The transformational president
\
President Barack Obama truly is transformational. I realized this after reading Ann Donnellys Oct. 1 opinion column, Local rally recalled earlier revolution. As I interpret Donnellys column, millions of my fellow citizens who for the last eight years either ignored or condoned the profligate and unpaid-for spending and tax cuts are now rising up to protest the necessary spending now required due to the negligence, mismanagement, incompetence and malfeasance of the Bush administration and its Republican Congresses.
\
Continuing this transformation, these people now want to Stand up for the Constitution. And Donnelly says that its about the principle of Constitutional government. This surely means that they are finally realizing that warrantless wiretaps, unlawful detention, torture and political meddling into the Justice Department are wrong and unconstitutional. So people, welcome to the transformation. See, it is change we can believe in.

Examine our priorities

I keep hearing Medicare and Social Security are going broke, yet our government wastes billions every year in foreign aid and fighting wars in places where we have no business interfering. Virtually nothing is made or grown in the USA these days, our precious farmlands are rapidly being turned into strip malls and housing developments. Whats wrong with this picture?
\
Movie and TV stars are being paid millions for pretending to be someone else, the people who produce our so-called music these days (which is full of four-letter words and not at all musical) are being paid millions. Professional athletes are paid millions for playing childrens games. All while jobs in the USA are being outsourced to India and ordinary people like policemen, firemen, teachers, and the checker at your neighborhood market are struggling to get by.

Build bridge without further delay
\
I have been following the process of constructing a new Interstate 5 bridge for almost 15 years, online and reading stories in the The Columbian.
\
I see no rational reason for not using user fees (tolls) to help cover the cost of the new bridge. In fact, I dont see how the bridge can be financed without tolls. Current fuel taxes cannot cover the cost and, as more drivers start using high-gas-mileage vehicles, hybrids and electric vehicles, gas and diesel taxes will not provide for usual road maintenance, let alone the needed bridge replacement.
\
The current I-5 bridge is, without a doubt, obsolete and not up to standards for earthquake safety or for efficient traffic flow. Mass transit via light rail is also a good choice for efficient and cost-effective solutions to future cross-border travel. Light rail is safer than buses and has a better record of being on time than buses.
\
The bridge replacement, as described in the Sept. 29 Columbian story I-5 bridge might be built in phases, should go ahead without further delays.

Display sacrifice by publishing photos
\
As a daughter and niece growing up on military bases, I daily worried about friends and family members serving in Vietnam. As a sister and cousin, I watched and worried as my siblings and their spouses joined the military in order to protect our country. As a mother and aunt, I have again watched and worried as my son and his cousins followed the call to serve their country. As a mother, I stayed strong as my son served in conflict but finally broke into tears (of relief) after receiving the call that my son was once again safely back in the states after his third tour of duty in the Middle East.
\
Yet, as I read Catherine Cait Needhams Sept. 28 letter, Publishing photo was in poor taste, I was completely taken aback. The citizenry of this country need to see these flag-draped coffins in order to understand, honor, and respect the sacrifices made by our service members and their families. Ignoring this ultimate sacrifice by hiding the image of our fallen is a disservice to these brave souls.

I understand that some people find the image of the flag-draped coffin to be uncomfortable. However, as it has been often said, A picture is worth a thousand words.

Lets all help clean up our river

One small step for a neighborhood; one giant leap for our river.

Environmental leaders advocate spending millions of dollars to cleanse and purify over 1,000 miles of our Columbia River all the way from its headwaters to its confluence with the Pacific Ocean. A Sept. 27 story reported How to clean a river: EPA working group provides a blueprint for reducing pollution in Columbia River. Thats a giant leap for our river.

As the Columbia washes against the shores of the Esther Short neighborhood, we must allow no carelessly tossed plastic, cigarette butt or toxic waste to clog the drainage system and enter this once free-flowing stream that nourishes our land. Thats one small step for residents of our downtown community.

Innuendo does not sway vote
\
The Sept. 26 opinions regarding the pros and cons of Initiative 1107 drove me crazy. The editorial to vote yes talks about widespread business failures in this state, that the states food producers have been hurt by these new taxes, and that if we could ask them they would confirm how much they hurt. I would ask that some of the major businesses, large employers, and the names of the food producers affected by this tax be identified.
\
Heidi Piper Schultz of Corwin Beverage talks about the tax being levied on thousands of common grocery products ... products that Washington families put in our grocery carts every week. Paola Maranans rebuttal blames the American Beverage Association for promoting the initiative and calls it a tax break for the beverage industry. Schultz and the Columbian tell us the tax puts food producers out of business and taxes the grocery products we put in our carts every week.
\
If you want to sway my vote, give me the real facts concerning Initiative 1107 that are supported and documented with actual names and identity of the companies affected and the products they produce, not insinuations and innuendo. Then suggest a reasonable alternative measure for us to consider.

Businesses burdened by legislation
\
As a former successful business general manager, I can say my hands would be tied as I try to wrestle with the uncertainty of health care and financial reform on business. All will raise the cost of doing business; the dust has not settled on the total impact. Before I would commit to growth or expansion I would need to know.
\
The president and his political partys hostility toward business also baffle me. I view the rhetoric as demeaning to my motives. It reflects a negative view of business leaders and owners. What is next on his agenda? Cap and trade will be destructive.
\
I do not differ from many of the business leaders nationally and in Clark County. I have been committed to building strong and viable businesses that reflect a commitment to my employees, the community, stockholders, and the environment and future growth.
\
I strongly support the need for health care reform but not in its current form. We have legislation that was not well thought out but was developed out of expediency. The Democrats are responsible for this monstrosity that sits in front of us. I hold the Democrats responsible for their lack of courage in not challenging legislation that has handcuffed our economic recovery.

As I read the Sept. 28 story Farm work fails to entice Americans, I couldnt help but remember how this work was accomplished back in the 1920s and 30s when I helped to do it. I can tell you exactly, since my maturity dates from 1916.
\
Unemployed parents, usually mothers, escorted us into the fields and the work was done. Farmers had all of the workers they needed. We were introduced to real life. We learned that if we were to live, we had to produce.

Cheer chance to enhance river access
\
My soul sings with the possibility that there is an alternative to the proposed intense brick and mortar development along the last vacant space along Columbia River near Vancouver.
\
Please, Mr. Mayor, city councilors and planners, consider suggestions by Project for Public Spaces and its president, Fred Kent. Please look, for example, to Vancouver, B.C.s Granville Island where an eclectic mix of uses employs 3,000 people and provides amusement and activities for year-round locals and visitors, according to Kent.
\
As one who gives thanks for the almost milelong uninterrupted-by-development space along Columbia Way (from Who Song & Larrys to densely spaced condominiums spliced between the railroad tracks and the Columbia River), it was cheering to learn in the July 12 front page story A sure thing or a game of chance? that there are inventive, unusual methods for preserving river access and also enhancing Vancouvers image as an attractive, unique and prosperous city on the waterfront.

Definite bias in weighty sentences
\
I agree with what Samuel Ferguson had to say in his June 29 letter, Race colors degree of charges, about being African-American in the so-called flawless legal system of Clark County. I, too, am African-American and was tried and convicted of two counts of kidnapping, one count of second-degree assault, and a fourth-degree assault. I was given a 30-year sentence when no one was seriously hurt or killed. On one charge, I was given what they would give a person for first-degree murder in Clark County. My sentence was handed down after the alleged victims, one who is white and my fiance, testified on my behalf and told the truth on the stand.
\
Ferguson has made a valuable point about being African-American in Clark County. Its very sad that its about being treated as guilty until proven innocent. The sentences handed down by these judges are uncalled-for, unfair and most definitely biased against African-Americans.

Abuse requires stricter ordinance
\
The 4th of July is a time in which Americans celebrate the independence of this country, pay tribute to those who founded this great country, and thank those who continue to preserve our freedoms. Many celebrate with fireworks, whether that be watching or setting them off themselves.
\
Here in Washington, its legal for residents to ignite some fireworks. However, its not legal to destroy or litter another persons property, which can happen through igniting fireworks. I find it disheartening that anyone would have so little common sense as to disregard another persons property when exercising the right to ignite fireworks.
\
On July 5, I walked outside only to find my yard, roof and brand-new vehicle covered with the debris of fireworks. The hood of my vehicle was marked with black-powder burns; the local auto body shop estimated the paint repair at $431 because of someone elses poor judgment.

I feel its time for an ordinance in the city of Battle Ground to prevent this from happening again. Common sense, sound judgment and common courtesy for ones fellow neighbors should prevail in such circumstances.

Call for tort reform
\
A lot is being done to reduce the costs of health care. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are being pressured to reduce the cost of drugs. Hospitals are being pressured into reducing the costs of hospitalizations and now doctors are going to be pressured into reducing their fees.
\
Out of all of this there is not a single call for tort reform.
\
Serious tort reform can reduce the cost of health care by up to 40 percent (as in California, when it introduced tort reform in the health care industry) without reducing any quantity or quality of medical care.
\
Any doctor or medical facility can be sued for malpractice when a medical procedure does not cure an injury or illness, regardless of degree of fault. When there is a medical malpractice suit filed, the attorney will have taken the case on a contingency basis, meaning they will take 35 to 55 percent of the final settlement plus all expenses. This means the injured patient may get as little as 20 percent of the final settlement. In multi-million-dollar class-action suits, the injured parties may only see a few hundred dollars apiece and the legal team receives millions.

65,"Also today\Washington legislators return to Olympia on Monday expecting more money to flow into state coffers than ever before, but with demands to spend even more.\After a decade in which Republicans reduced large Democratic majorities in the House to a razor-thin margin and even put together a coalition in the House to force a coalition government, Democrats have comfortable majorities in both chambers and a governor pushing a progressive agenda on health care, environmental protection and workplace policies.\But Gov. Jay Inslee doesn't seem to be positioning himself to be the first governor in nearly a half-century to seek a third term. His sights may be set higher, at the other Washington on the other side of the country. Inslee, for his part, contends that his agenda is driven by the state's growing population, previously established but expensive improvements to the public school system and programs that were cut drastically in the recession and should now be restored.\""To govern is to choose,"" is likely to be Inslee's mantra for the session. The array of choices will be large and varied starting with the budget, which as lawmakers are wont to say, is really a policy document. Here are some issues to watch in the next few months:\Money\For the first time in history, Washington is on track to spend more than $50 billion in its general operating budget over the next two years. A strong economy means the state can expect to collect about $4 billion more in taxes and fees than it did in the 2017-19 biennium. But Inslee's budget office says that extra money is more than consumed by the rising cost of public schools, demand for services and proposed raises for state workers. Inslee's new proposals to expand education, environmental and mental health programs could run another $4 billion. To balance a budget with all those new and existing programs, he's proposing an increase in the business and occupation tax for service industries, and instituting a capital gains tax on annual investment income of more than $25,000 for an individual or $50,000 for a couple.\What to watch: What tax plans the House and Senate budgets have when they are released in March.\Education\For the first time in nearly a decade, a new Legislature convenes without the threat of Washington Supreme Court sanctions for inadequately supporting public schools hanging over its collective head. Lawmakers approved a massive education overhaul, known as the McCleary fix after the court case, in a marathon 2017 session and adjusted the property tax provisions that accompanied the fix last year.\Legislators acknowledged McCleary was a start, not a finish. They will have proposals to improve or expand special education, early childhood programs, school counseling and workplace training programs, expand training for high school graduates who aren't seeking jobs that require two- or four-year degrees, and wish lists from the state colleges and universities.\What to watch: Some school districts are struggling under the new property tax rules and will be seeking relief this year, and some legislators will try to lower the majority needed for school construction bonds to 50 percent.\Mental health\The state faces a federal judge's order to limit the time a person under arrest and facing court-ordered psychiatric examination can remain in jail before that testing begins at a secure mental health facility. Slots for such ""forensic"" services are limited at Eastern State and Western State hospitals, but expanding them and upgrading the aging facilities is expensive. Inslee has an extensive multiyear plan to shift in-patient mental and behavioral health services from the two large state hospitals to smaller community-based facilities. Washington also has a shortage of trained mental health professionals available to meet the needs of the state facilities and plans to increase their numbers range from creating a new teaching psychiatric hospital to improving the process for certifying workers from other states interested in coming to Washington.\What to watch: Democratic efforts to increase spending could be met with Republican criticism of how tens of millions of dollars in recent years has been spent without satisfying court orders.\Environment\For the first time in several years, there's no proposal for a financial penalty aimed at cutting the use of fossil fuels, like a carbon tax, carbon fee or cap-and-trade system. Instead, Inslee is proposing a series of regulations and incentives to reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase cleaner energy sources like solar and wind generation and electric vehicles. The Legislature already has several proposals to limit the use of plastics, including statewide bans on plastic grocery bags and single-use plastic straws.\The southern resident orca population is dropping to dangerous levels, and to save it Inslee has an array of proposals to clean up the Puget Sound, restrict tourist access to that particular pod and increase the orcas' main source of food, salmon. Inslee also wants a task force to study whether removing Snake River dams would lead to a significant increase in salmon runs, weighing it against the loss of dams that are not powered by fossil fuels and seeking input from supporters and opponents of breaching the dams.\What to watch: Whether the Legislature will address environmental concerns piecemeal with a series of targeted bills or an omnibus plan.\Guns\Voters approved new restrictions on the sale of semi-automatic rifles and requirements for safe storage of firearms in the home. But lawmakers could consider other gun-related legislation, including a bill to allow the Washington State Patrol to destroy guns it confiscates, a ban on magazines that carry more than 10 rounds, a ban on untraceable guns created by 3D printers and a proposal to allow schools to allow employees to carry firearms on campus after an approved training program.\What to watch: House Democrats had slim majorities in recent sessions without the votes to pass gun-control measures with no GOP support. Their new majority is larger and fueled by progressive freshmen who may be more likely to vote yes.\Initiatives\Two initiatives - one to make $30 the limit once again for vehicle license tabs and one to re-establish some affirmative action policies - probably have enough signatures to be sent to the Legislature. If lawmakers don't pass them, they go on the November ballot; if they think they have a better alternative, the original and the revised versions go on the ballot. They will try to amend last year's initiative on police use of deadly force, which voters passed in November.\What to watch: The deadly force alternative may have the two-thirds majority needed to amend a newly passed initiative. The House is set to hold a hearing on it the first day of the session. Initiative 1000, the affirmative action proposal, might get a vote. Initiative 976, the car tab measure, probably will go to the ballot, although the Legislature may consider separate bills that cover some of the same ground, like the motor vehicle excise tax levied in Snohomish, King and Pierce counties for Sound Transit.\Contact the writer:\(360) 664-2598\jimc@spokesman.com\Legislature\CREDIT: Jim Camden The Spokesman-Review"

Try Internet education
\
To the editor -- Here's something to consider for people deciding how to vote on the Yakima School District bond measure. We began home schooling our son because we felt local school districts were failing to meet his needs and put the blame on him. We use the Internet Academy via the Federal Way (Wash.) School District. He now has a B-plus average and sailed through the Washington Assessment of Student Learning for seventh-graders. It's an excellent, free program. No new taxes for our community. All you need is Internet access.
\
Think about it. No more worries about drugs and violence at school. No more gangs or bullies. No more child care expenses during all the breaks and teacher administrative days.
\
Give yourself a break and spend more time with your kids at home. Do what the teachers say: Take responsibility for your child's education.
\
We need to tighten our belts. We don't need more teachers and schools. With programs like the Internet Academy, we would not need more school buses or free lunches. Think of how much we could save instead of how much we could spend on new high schools.
\
I suggest people vote no on the Yakima School District bond measure.

Cast of characters

To the editor -- For several years I have enjoyed the comic strip adventures and misadventures of ""Dilbert"" and ""Non-Sequitur"" (Yakima Herald-Republic), and ""Rhymes With Orange,"" (online, Seattle Post-Intelligencer). Each features quirky, often clueless characters whose exploits have provided me with chuckles and outright laughter for several years.
\
Upon returning to Yakima after a half dozen years in the Puget Sound area, I especially missed my daily fix of the ""Rhymes With Orange"" characters and have lamented that the Herald-Republic doesn't run it on its Comics page.
\
I am delighted to read that the Herald-Republic is now carrying The Puppet Master, a tale of equally quirky characters who fancy themselves as the Above-the-Law and Below-the-Belt Guardians of the Public Trust. The cast features a shallow character who fancies himself a master politician, an acid-tongued follower whose real skill is sniping from the safety of her e-mail account, and the main antagonist, who doesn't bother to run for public office, but who would rather be the ""power behind the throne.""
\
While I eagerly await continued developments from this misguided group of community ""leaders,"" I do wonder who is going to actually do the pen and ink drawings?

A tax is a tax
\
To the editor -- Every time a school bond measure comes up, my blood begins to boil. Currently, 38.1 percent of my tax assessment goes to the Yakima School District, which is way too much! The district's propaganda consistently uses the same falsehood time after time. It states that the bond measure is not a new tax. Yes, it is! The old bonds will be soon paid off, and our property tax rates will by necessity go down. Therefore, any time a tax continues into the future it is very much indeed a new tax. The district recently adopted resolution No. 03.08.09, to put the bond measure on the ballot, which specified the following power: ""and to levy property taxes annually in addition to regular property taxes.""
\
The district's same 2009 question-and-answer pamphlet states that if the new tax is not approved by the voters, those funds ""for essential building and technology needs would have to come from the district's general fund budget."" I should hope to shout!
\
It's about time the Yakima School District start weeding out the many overpaid administrative employees in order to start paying for more useful items such as school buildings. The new superintendent should take a definitive stance, but I will not hold my breath!

However, I want to say I admire Neil McClure for resigning. I used to work as a temp for Neil many years ago and he was an awesome boss and person. It is so refreshing to see a person get into politics and actually stand up for what is right.
\
If I may quote William Penn, ""Right is right, even if everyone is against it, and wrong is wrong even if everyone is for it.""

Student safety at stake
\
To the editor -- I am a parent in the Yakima School District. I am writing in response to the upcoming bond issue.
\
There are many schools in the Yakima School District that need repair. These repairs are not just for cosmetic reasons, they are for safety reasons. Both high schools are overcrowded and the environment is not healthy. I have talked to a high school student who said she was in the bathroom at the high school and while she was using the restroom, water was dripping on her head. This is not acceptable for our students.
\
Davis is also very open. Students have to move from class to class outside. This is not safe. If someone were to attack this school, they would be able to get to the students very easily.
\
The Yakima school bond measure is not raising your tax rate, it is just renewing what you have voted on in the past. Please vote yes for our children's future safety.

No state $$ for UW sports
\
To the editor -- Thanks for your May 12 editorial reminding people of the daunting challenges we all face in trying to maintain access to high quality higher education programs in our state. No one relished having to raise tuition to these levels, but given the loss of projected state revenue, the alternatives were just unthinkable.
\
One point, though, with regard to our swimming program. Its discontinuation has nothing to do with the state budget, as our athletic department is entirely self-sustaining and receives no money whatsoever from the state. It is responsible for generating all of its operating revenue. The department is facing increasing costs across all fronts (including the increasing cost of tuition; every time tuition goes up, it represents a budget cut for the athletic department, since it is responsible for paying tuition for scholarship student-athletes) as well as declining investment and ticket sales revenue. It projected a $2.8 million gap it had to close. But it is not a function of the state budget or anything that transpired in Olympia.
\
I'm afraid the editorial may reinforce the misconception that we use state funds for athletics, which we do not. We're the only institution in the state that doesn't.

President Obama wants to go green. A report by Spain's Professor Gabriel Caizada Alvarez states that the USA going green would be a disaster -- 2.2 regular jobs are lost for each job created. Only 1 in 10 green jobs become permanent. We are purchasing wind machines from Spain. The stimulus bill was to stimulate American economy, not Spain's!

President Obama's cap and trade would tax all of us into oblivion and put us back into the dark ages.

'Cross' movie is heartfelt
\
To the editor -- It's not often when I'm the only person in a movie theater, so it was a good thing my daughter sat next to me as together we watched a low-budget documentary movie simply titled ""The Cross."" It's the story of Arthur Blessitt, who walked more than 38,000 miles through 315 countries over a period of 40 years carrying a 12-foot cross. He walked through wars, revolutions, jungles, mountains, deserts and valleys, risking his life. He carried a cross with the profound message of God's love. To many, the cross is divisive or simple jewelry, but to Arthur it was the ultimate manifestation of the gift of salvation, the gift of God's love and forgiveness.
\
This heartfelt movie has a message for everyone, no matter what you believe as evidenced by how people of various faiths and religions treated Arthur and related to the cross, even in the Muslim world. It's a must-see movie!

Why do people go to such a place to enjoy the great scenery and then trash it? They will haul all their food up there and their beer and sodas, but then just toss it aside. Shame on these people!

The deception continues
\
To the editor -- Tell the truth, Yakima Diocese! Father Mitchell was investigated by the FBI for possession of child pornography. Stop minimizing the horrific nature of child pornography, which victimizes the children in the photos. The FBI determined that the images did not meet the standards for a criminal indictment, but they are child pornography -- frontal nudes of boys, ages 8-16, and illegal to possess. Mitchell was also investigated by the diocese for ""imprudent"" behavior with teenage boys. These two facts mean that Father Mitchell cannot work with children and youth. What's this nonsense: ""We don't view him as a threat to children, but we didn't want this to be a distraction""?
\
Diocesan officials have not insisted that Father Mitchell tell the truth about what he did, apologize for the trauma this brought to the community, and exonerate the man who turned in the pictures, whose job was later eliminated.
\
So the diocese continues the church's pattern of misinformation and deception that has brought us to this place of great shame and scandal. It's time to change: tell the truth!

What does illegal mean?
\
To the editor -- I was reading the Yakima Herald-Republic online and saw the article about the Yakima City Council voting down a proposal to require city contractors to adhere to the E-Verify system. That is very, very disappointing.
\
When is illegal really illegal? Just what does illegal mean? If drugs are deemed illegal by state and federal authorities, can we now expect the Yakima City Council to legalize the sale of marijuana within the city limits? How about that South First Street gentleman's club that the planning commission thought was ""incompatible overall with neighboring businesses?"" The quote came from one of 120,000 hits I found on Google under ""Yakima Strip club."" Based on the council's E-Verify vote, will anyone bet against the Yakima City Council approving the ""gentleman's club?""
\
Actually, following the Yakima City Council's lead, the United States could save lots of money by doing away with the issuance of visas, all the money spent on controlling our borders and building that wall between the United States and Mexico. Go council!

Editorial missed the point
\
To the editor -- A Wenatchee World editorial by Tracy Warner published May 12 in the Yakima Herald-Republic decries a lack of visas for foreigners who want to enter legally. It betrays the author's ignorance of the purpose of visas by missing the point.
\
Visas are not issued for the convenience of those wishing to come to the United States. No alien has a right to demand or expect that he will be allowed to come to this country or any other. To permit it is the sovereign decision of the country he wishes to visit. Those decisions should be reached based on how the United States perceives its national interest, not the desires of the foreigner or his government. That he cannot earn a living at home is an issue between him and his government; it is not the job of the United States to provide him with one.
\
Some argue that it is in our national interest to bring foreign workers here. Not so. The United States has nearly 25 million people looking for jobs now. Instead of importing foreigners to fill U.S. jobs, American employers should seek workers from among those 25 million before they look abroad. Recruit in Michigan, for example, not Michoacan.

The feds don't listen. We are radicals and racists for standing up to them. Notice how Obama wants to make changes quickly (I can't prove it, but it seems he has been on the campaign trail more than in the Oval Office). He is doing whatever it takes (backroom deals and nontransparency administration) to justify the end -- a socialist state. He and his progressive liberal left believe the Constitution is an ""evolving document.""

By using his big-government programs to eventually make us all dependent, our country will look and feel like the current socialist European nations (which have labor violence, runaway debt, and economic ills -- our future?). You like the illegal immigrations, more stimulus bills, cap and trade, ""universal"" health care, more federal control and less state rights, redistribution of wealth, corporate bailouts?

Chemical-free alternatives
\
To the editor -- Many people think there is better living through chemicals, especially when applied to pesky mosquitoes, but there are chemical-free, sustainable alternatives. Peopled educated about breeding grounds can take steps to reduce breeding opportunities for mosquitoes. Attracting and keeping mosquito predators would also reduce the mosquito population.
\
As for personal protection, there are many natural homemade remedies to be found on the Internet.
\
I teach science and currently have students working on projects to reduce the mosquito population at a pond near some Toppenish schools.
\
A couple of students are building bat boxes to attract bats to feed on the adult population. We are waiting for permission to transplant local native fish from the Yakima River to the pond to feed on the larval mosquito population. Students looking for extra credit have the option of making educational fliers for the surrounding neighborhood to educate the residents about reducing their risks of mosquito bites.
\
I enjoy a chemical-free pond in my own back yard, surrounded by irrigated lands. Dragonflies, toads and tree frogs are abundant as well as wild birds yet mosquitoes aren't a problem. We can learn much from nature.

When it comes to legislating complex issues, the best option is not always the most practical. Take Initiative 732, which is now in front of the Legislature. Ideally, lawmakers would devise their own alternative; realistically, however, they would be best advised to pass the measure along to voters in November.I-732 is an innovative and creative approach to cutting carbon emissions throughout the state and yet it is flawed. On the positive side, it brings to the forefront an essential discussion and takes aim on an area on which many citizens should agree. While most scientists who have studied the subject believe that the emission of greenhouse gasses is contributing to climate change, such a belief should not be a prerequisite for a desire to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Reducing carbon emissions will have myriad benefits for the environment and for the health of the populace in addition to combating human-caused climate change.Initiative 732, supported by grass-roots group Carbon WA and designed to be revenue-neutral, would reduce carbon emissions by creating a statewide carbon tax of $25 per metric ton of fossil fuel emissions; electricity created from hydro, wind, or solar sources would not be taxed. For household consumers, the carbon tax would raise the price of gas by about 25 cents a gallon, and taxes on electricity and natural gas would be increased. For emission-producing industries such as steel mills or food-processing plants, the cost would be much larger.Overall, those costs would be offset by tax reductions elsewhere. The state sales tax would drop from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent; the state business tax would be essentially eliminated; and tax rebates would be provided for the working poor, who some critics say would be inequitably impacted by the carbon tax.The idea is to leave state revenue at current levels while providing incentives for a reduction in carbon emissions, but this is where I-732 falls short. Looking at the four-year impact of the measure, the Office of Financial Management estimates that state revenues would be reduced by $914 million. Carbon WA leaders dispute that finding, but Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Burien, chair of the House Environment Committee, said: I think theres agreement that I-732 isnt workable because of how much it would reduce state revenues. We have to trust the experts.I-732 was sent to the Legislature in late January, when the secretary of states office certified that a petition drive had garnered enough signatures. That doesnt leave lawmakers much time to decide on a course of action: Approve the measure as is; send I-732 to voters as is; or offer an alternative plan and place it on the ballot alongside I-732. Given the fact that this years session is scheduled for 60 days and that many other pressing issues are on the docket, sending the measure to voters would appear to be the most likely scenario.Regardless of the outcome, I-732 is worthy of consideration. While critics reflexively claim that taxing carbon emissions would harm the economy and prove costly to businesses, a similar tax instituted in 2008 in British Columbia has met with mostly positive reviews. The question, therefore, is how damaging I-732 would be to revenue and the overall stability of the state.There are many reasons to support a reduction in carbon emissions, and lawmakers would be wise to examine and tweak the plan. Unfortunately, that might not be practical during a short legislative session.

What if we could decrease the release of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere, stabilize our climate and grow our economy at the same time? A proposed carbon tax and rebate legislation could utilize market forces to push the transition to a green energy economy and decrease our dependence on fossil fuels.
\
George Schultz, former Secretary of State, agrees: ""We have to have a system where all forms of energy bear their full costs ... and to me the most appealing way is a revenue-neutral carbon tax."" Importantly, this system places no burden on the consumer. A carbon tax and rebate system gives the end consumer 100 percent of the proceeds of the carbon tax to help pay for the transition to clean energy.
\
How it works: A carbon tax is collected on fossil fuels that contain carbon such as oil, gas and coal. The carbon tax starts low and increases yearly until green technology is competitive with fossil fuel. Green technology is any technology that reduces waste, increases energy efficiency or produces low or no carbon energy. The collected tax is distributed equally to all consumers in the form of a rebate, protecting them from increasing costs associated with the carbon tax. Knowing that the cost of fossil fuels will increase over time will motivate citizens to decrease their use of fossil fuels in different ways, such as upgrading insulation in their home, changing an old oil furnace, or even buying an electric car. In this legislation there are also adjustments to protect manufacturers, importers and exporters.
\
To remain competitive, businesses over time will need to reduce their use of fossil fuels and become more efficient. In this system, the free market picks the winning and losing technologies rather than the government. As we transition to green technologies and green energies CO2, emissions will decline.
\
British Columbia has successfully instituted a carbon tax and rebate system. The provincial economy continues to grow and the citizens and businesses have had their taxes reduced. We need to adopt a carbon tax and rebate now. Since the beginning of the industrial age we have been pumping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal. This blanket of gases is changing our climate and acidifying our oceans. We are seeing the signs with melting glaciers, droughts, forest fires, extreme storms and coral bleaching. The U.S. is one of the largest contributors to these gases and as such, we have the opportunity to make a dramatic change to stabilize the earth's climate and strengthen our economy - a win-win for businesses and the environment.

A week before the November election, Cody gathered with other volunteers in a Vancouver real estate office serving as the campaign's regional headquarters as they prepared to knock on the doors of voters to make their case for the initiative.\“People weren't having 732,” said Cody, who wore a toothpaste tube Halloween costume out canvassing. “1631 is much more mobilized in Southwest Washington. I don't think you can pass climate change policy without the involvement of Southwest Washington. Seattle can't carry it alone.”\Since I-732 lost, supporters of the new initiative have launched a more expansive organizing campaign. Locally, the campaign for the initiative has sought to tap into volunteers and energy left over from last year's costly and politically charged Port of Vancouver commission race. The initiative has already drawn some enthusiasm from this corner of Washington. Local activist Don Steinke gathered 2,444 signatures for I-1631, more than anyone else in the state.\The campaign's efforts could work. A recent poll found support among 50 percent of those surveyed.\The big differences between 2016's I-732 and this year's I-1631 are in how they're designed and the political support they're designed to attract. I-732 measure was meant to be revenue-neutral in hopes of attracting support from moderates and conservatives. It reduced existing taxes in exchange for a tax on carbon emissions. But many environmental and progressive political groups refused to back it because it didn't invest new money into renewable energy projects.\This year, the initiative has the support of those groups and from the Alliance for Clean Jobs and Energy, a large coalition of organizations in Washington seeking action on climate change. I-1631 places a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon emissions beginning in 2020. The money generated from it would go to renewable energy projects.\“This initiative has a much better shot because of the lack of a split in the environmental community,” said Mark Stephan, an associate professor of political science at Washington State University Vancouver.\He said that the initiative needs support outside of the Puget Sound area to pass. While he said that he doesn't expect it to get much support in Eastern Washington, there could be enough supportive votes among Southwest Washington's growing population for it to pass.\Meridian Green said that she voted for I-732 but was “a little ambivalent.” She said that in August of last year, she attended a presentation by the Alliance for Clean Jobs and Energy at St. Luke's Episcopal Church. She said that she was struck by the solution to climate change presented and how it had support from a broad coalition of businesses, as well as groups representing public health, faith and labor.\“That's where I went from being a low-key participant to all in,” said Green, who is now a Vancouver-based field organizer for the campaign.\The fault lines for the initiative have fallen along those similar to last year's Port of Vancouver Board of Commissioners election, which centered on a proposal to build the country's largest oil-by-rail terminal at the Port of Vancouver.\Kris Greene, who expressed varying degrees of support for the terminal, raised over $500,000 for his bid for port commissioner, the majority of it coming from companies with a direct interest in the project. Don Orange, who prevailed in the race, centered much of his campaign on opposition to the terminal and a desire to create clean energy jobs. Orange relied heavily on support from a political group associated with the Washington Conservation Voters.\The campaign opposing the I-1631 has been largely funded by the four companies that operate the state's oil refineries, according to a report in The Seattle Times. The companies have given more than $25 million in opposition to the measure, the paper reported.\Dana Bieber, spokeswoman for the opposition campaign, said that her group has also held community and events designed to educate voters. She didn't have numbers on how many events it's held in Southwest Washington, but she said they've been focused on how the initiative, if passed, will raise prices and harm consumers.\Nick Abraham, communications director for Yes On I-1631 campaign, said that the campaign has 22 offices across the state, including Southwest Washington. He said that the campaign used networks created through Orange's campaign. He said that the “yes” campaign's strategy relies on volunteers making direct contact with voters to convince them to vote for the initiative.\“It definitely starts with folks that are trusted in the community, that live there that people know,” he said. “That opens up the door.”\Orange said that he strongly supports the initiative and has done some campaigning for it. He said that while the remnants of his campaign didn't directly become part of I-1631, they have similar foundations and his race showed just how concerned people in Clark County are about the environment.\Mary Slowik Siciliano, retired college professor, is one of those people. She said she worked on Orange's campaign before volunteering for I-163. She said it was easy to get involved.\“The structure was there,” she said. “We didn't have to start from scratch.”\Jake Thomas: 360-735-4515; jake.t\CREDIT: Jake Thomas Columbian staff writer"
72,"Washington voters will decide whether to approve the nation's first carbon tax in November, a measure supporters say would help the state cut its greenhouse gas emissions and could set precedent for a national climate policy.\""The pitch is that climate change is real, and we should do something about it,"" said Yoram Bauman, founder of Carbon Washington, which is promoting Initiative 732. ""We have an approach that works for families and businesses across the state.""\But I-732 has failed to gain support from some of the groups that would typically back efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Both the state's Democratic Party and the Sierra Club have opposed the initiative, saying it isn't the right approach to climate policy.\Business and labor groups also are lobbying against it, saying I-732 would be a ""job killer"" that would shift employment to other states and countries.\Some of the loudest opposition is coming from Spokane Valley, where Kaiser Aluminum employs more than 900 people making aluminum products for the aerospace industry and other manufacturers.\Kaiser's Trentwood facility uses natural gas-fired furnaces to heat aluminum to its melting point, around 1,200 degrees. The energy-intensive process puts the company on Washington's short list of top carbon polluters. Each year, the plant releases more than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.\Kaiser has become one of the largest contributors to the campaign to defeat I-732, with a $50,000 donation.\""We're not saying that we shouldn't be working on carbon emissions,"" said Kyle England, a company spokesman.\But company officials say the carbon tax, as proposed, would cost Kaiser millions of dollars annually, undermining the company's ability to compete in a global marketplace. Ultimately, the tax would shift jobs overseas to coal-fired factories that produce more of the heat-trapping gases responsible for climate change, they said.\MODELED AFTER CARBON TAX IN B.C.\Bauman, who is leading the I-732 campaign, has a doctorate in economics and an unconventional career.\The Seattle resident, who earns his living as a writer and speaker, said he's probably the world's only stand-up comedian focusing on economic issues. He's the co-author of several books, including the ""Cartoon Introduction to Economics.""\Bauman helped write I-732, which is modeled after a similar carbon tax in British Columbia. He said it's a fair, market-driven approach to reducing carbon emissions that spreads costs across both households and businesses. He also takes issue with Kaiser's position that the initiative would reduce the company's global competitiveness.\Bauman described the initiative as a ""tax shift"" that raises the cost of carbon but also mitigates the effect on manufacturers and Washington families, who would pay more for gasoline, heating fuel and electricity.\Under I-732, each ton of carbon produced in Washington would be taxed by $15 beginning in July 2017. The tax would increase to $25 per ton the next year, and would rise annually until it hits a maximum of $100 per ton.\But Washington residents would see a 1 percentage point drop in the state's sales tax over two years if the initiative is approved. Most households would see a change of up to $200 in their annual expenses, which could be either a savings or an extra cost, according to Bauman. Initiative opponents argue that most families would pay more. And low-income families could qualify for refunds in the state sales tax they paid to offset higher gasoline prices and utility bills.\Kaiser and other manufacturers would get a break on the state's business and occupation tax, which is levied on companies' gross income.\If the initiative passed, Kaiser would pay about $1.5 million next year in carbon taxes, a figure that would increase to about $10 million annually if the company's emissions remained steady at 100,000 metric tons per year.\Kaiser doesn't reveal proprietary information, including how much the company pays in business and occupation taxes, said England, Kaiser's spokesman. But company officials said the proposed reduction in B&O taxes under I-732 is a negligible amount for Kaiser and wouldn't offset the cost of carbon taxes.\Since Kaiser won't ""put numbers on the table,"" it's hard to know how the company would fare under the initiative, Bauman said.\However, if Kaiser can demonstrate that it isn't getting an equitable break in B&O taxes, ""we will go with them to Olympia to fix the policy,"" Bauman said.\Opponents cite impacts to revenue\Other opposition to I-732 has centered around the potential impacts to the state's budget.\While the I-732 campaign is touting the initiative as revenue-neutral by swapping out one type of tax for another, the state Department of Revenue estimates that the initiative would cost the state about $800 million in lost tax revenues over four years.\The state's Democratic Party and the Sierra Club both listed revenue concerns in their statements against I-732. Lowering tax revenue would complicate the state's budget troubles when Washington is already \struggling to make court-ordered investments in education and mental health services, they said.\Bauman called the revenue issue a ""red herring."" The I-732 campaign disagrees with some of the Department of Revenue's methodology that resulted in the projected loss of $800 million in state revenue, he said.\Another study done by Sightline Institute, a liberal think tank in Seattle that hasn't taken a position on the initiative, calculates an $80 million annual decrease in tax revenues, or about $320 million over four years.\But both forecasts have significant uncertainties, based on future unknowns, the Sightline analysis said.\""The forecast depends on statewide carbon emissions and statewide sales tax revenue that could change by hundreds of millions of dollars a year,"" the Sightline analysis said.\If revenue shortfalls occur, Bauman said, the gap could be addressed through tweaking I-732's tax-swap formula.\Last year's drought and record wildfire season should be a wake-up call for Washington residents, Bauman said. Without action to curb climate change, the conditions experienced last summer could be typical for the state by 2060, he said.\CLEAN-AIR RULE PREDATES I-732\Kaiser is already a leader in reducing the ""carbon intensity"" of its products, company officials said.\Each pound of aluminum produced at Trentwood requires about 15 percent less energy than in 2010. Kaiser continues to work on energy efficiency, but the company hasn't found a way to replace its gas-fired furnaces, which remain the best way to melt aluminum, England said.\Both Kaiser and the local affiliate of the Steelworkers Union worked closely with the state Department of Ecology on Washington's recently adopted clean-air rule. The rule creates a cap-and-trade system for carbon \emissions, which Kaiser must comply with.\The administrative rule was created after the Legislature failed to act on Gov. Jay Inslee's earlier cap-and-trade proposal. It provides some flexibility for energy-intensive manufacturers that compete for customers with companies from other countries. Under the rule, Kaiser would get credit for previous work on energy efficiency.\Kaiser is ""cautiously optimistic"" that it can meet the requirements of the clean-air rule while continuing to expand its production, England said.\""We want to produce every pound of aluminum possible in Spokane, which is in one of the greenest states in the nation,"" England added.\That's good for both Washington's economy and the environment, he said.\INITIATIVE 732 AT A GLANCE\The carbon tax: Would start at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted, effective July 2017. The rate would rise to $25 per metric ton a year later, then it would increase gradually until the rate reaches a maximum of $100 per metric ton.\Reductions in other taxes: The state sales tax rate would drop from 6.5 percent to 6 percent, effective July 2017. It would drop to 5.5 percent in July 2018. The state business and occupation tax rate for manufacturing would drop to 0.001 percent in July 2017 from the current rate of 0.484 percent for most manufacturers.\Credit for low-income families: Low-income taxpayers could get a refund for some of the state sales taxes they paid during the year.\Supporters include: Audubon Washington, Cascadia Climate Action, Citizens Climate Lobby, Seattle Electric Vehicle Association.\Opponents include: Association of Washington Business, Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO, Washington Farm Bureau, Washington Environmental Council, state Democratic Party, Sierra Club.\Revenue question: I-732 is intended to be revenue-neutral. However, a state Department of Revenue analysis says it will reduce the state's tax revenues by about $800 million over four years. A study by Sightline Institute says the revenue reduction is closer to $80 million each year for four years.\Panel discussion in Spokane: Oct. 20 at 7 p.m. Walgreens Auditorium (PBS 101) at WSU Spokane, 205 E.

73,"OLYMPIA - Washington residents would pay more at the gasoline pump and more on their utility bills as the state tries to reduce its carbon pollution under a proposal unveiled Tuesday by Gov. Jay Inslee.\A tax starting at $20 per ton of carbon emissions, with adjustments for inflation, would be put in place July 1, 2019, and generate an estimated $1.5 billion every two years to pay for programs that would reduce the pollution, which experts say is a major factor in climate change.\Inslee said Washington would join California, British Columbia and other parts of Canada, along with European countries, in having a detailed plan to reduce carbon pollution.\""We don't have to invent the rocket ship here,"" Inslee told reporters in the afternoon after meeting with business, utility and environmental leaders, including Dennis Vermillion, president of Avista. ""This is not the first time this has been done.""\Avista later released a statement saying it ""welcomes the opportunity to work with the governor and the Legislature on an approach that supports our customers' needs, creates technological advances and considers the economic impact, even beyond the state's borders, with the goal to improve the environment.""\Republican leaders were sharply critical of the proposal after Inslee talked about it in his State of the State address earlier in the day. Senate Minority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said Inslee calling for a new tax in his annual address was predictable.\House Minority Leader Dan Kristiansen, R-Snohomish, described it as ""extremely tax-heavy and policy-short."" Republicans would be proposing legislation that stressed policies to reduce carbon pollution without a major tax increase, he said.\The taxes would hit hardest on the middle class and lower-income residents who would see increases for fuel, utilities and many consumer items, Kristiansen said.\Inslee said he hoped businesses like Avista and Puget Sound Energy, another major investor-owned utility in the state, would help ""open the doors of optimism"" among Republicans.\Before he discussed it in his annual address to a joint session of the Legislature, Inslee's policy experts explained the state would invest money raised by the taxes in a series of initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and provide exemptions and credits for some businesses, agriculture operations and low-income residents.\Although the tax would be imposed on producers of fuel and utilities, consumers would likely see a 6 to 9 percent increase in gasoline prices at the pump, as well as an increase of 4 to 5 percent in their electric bill and 9 to 11 percent in their natural gas bill.\Such shifts are in line with normal fluctuations in fuel and energy prices, said Lauren McCloy, a senior policy adviser to Inslee on energy.\Diesel fuel for agricultural uses would be exempt, as would aviation fuel and certain biofuels, McCloy said.\Half of the money raised would be used for programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including clean energy and transportation programs. Another 35 percent would be used to support programs to improve water management and storage systems and to reduce wildfires through better forest health.\Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, sponsor of the legislation in the Senate, said he sees a growing recognition among lawmakers and other state leaders of the need for an energy strategy, and Inslee's proposal is the place to start, with a committee hearing next week. Republican proposals will also be considered, Carlyle said.\Correspondent Rachel Sun contributed to this report.

Adjust to what existed first
\
Ive lived in Felida, for nearly 40 years, in one of the last houses before you drop down to the Northwest 122nd Street railroad crossing. I also hear the warning sounds of the trains, but unlike the people complaining about what they call noise, I actually informed myself before moving to the area. Its like when people move near an airport and start complaining about the airplanes flying over, or moving near a dairy farm and complaining about the smell.I personally dont like car horns that are electronically activated when locking the car doors or loud, rude people talking on their cellphones in public places. The list goes on, but I am adjusting.It seems odd how for decades we never heard anyone make much noise about the trains and yet in recent years with all the castles being built, we now do. Maybe, just maybe, these people should do a little research before purchasing a home near train tracks. Or maybe learn to adjust to your surroundings. Or maybe, just maybe, move.

Bridge idea is joke on commuters
\
So Clark County Commissioner David Madore wants to build a bridge from 192nd Avenue across the Columbia River, funneling traffic onto Airport Way in Oregon and later onto Interstate 84.He has got to be kidding. Does the man ever drive on Airport Way or I-84? Does he not know that these two roadways are already over crowded? Maybe he should get out of his county and find out what goes on around him before proposing such an outlandish idea.

Improve crossings between states
\
The traffic congestion between Clark County and Portland on both the Interstate 5 and Interstate 205 bridges is getting much worse. Recently I was traveling from Yacolt to Portlands Veterans Affairs Medical Center.When I approached the freeways, there was massive traffic congestion so I had to reroute to Harbor Drive to get to Airport Way to approach the on-ramp to the I-205 bridge. It took one hour and 39 minutes to arrive home.I spoke before the Clark County Board of Commissioners and stated that before any bridge proposals, this traffic congestion problem needs to be resolved immediately. It affects the commuters, and it affects the trucking industry in lost time and profits. Any bridge will work, but the bickering over the last bridge didnt gain any traction and wasted valuable funds that could have been used for purchasing more buses to relieve traffic congestion on both bridges in the short term. What is needed is more jobs in Clark County and not giving all the jobs to Oregon.My family purchased a 9-acre property in Yacolt, where the environment is peaceful and our grandchildren have decent friends. Back in Gresham, Ore., their former friends got involved in drugs. Here they have a better future with a better education system.We want better things for our new state and a better future for our family.

Lobby legislation for carbon tax
\
Kudos to state Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, for acknowledging the need for climate action while describing some plans drawbacks. Cap and trade cause rising prices. Administratively imposed regulations feel dictatorial and are inefficient.Unfortunately, Rivers omitted an option that costs the public nothing, doesnt involve administrative tyranny, is transparent and allows the free market to decide between hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear and other non-emitting options. Henry Paulson, George W. Bushs secretary of the Treasury, advocates for a carbon tax. Rivers omitted this option perhaps because it includes the word tax. If fossil-fuel producers pay a carbon tax on their fuels, the free market will develop alternative fuels to avoid the taxes.If tax revenues are returned to the public in rebates, well be protected from energy price increases.A rebated carbon tax will reduce emissions. The public wont suffer. Only fossil-fuel companies will suffer. Honestly, though, the only way to slow climate change is via lower emissions, which ultimately hurts fossil-fuel companies.As for Rivers concern about China, Congress can make Chinese manufacturers pay our carbon tax until China enacts its own. Guess how long that will take.I encourage Rivers to lobby Republican members of Washingtons congressional delegation to sponsor national carbon tax and rebate legislation.For information on the many ways carbon taxes benefit the economy, contact Citizens Climate Lobby.

Where is July 4 celebrated for months on end? You guessed it in Clark County. I live just a few blocks outside the city limits. Fireworks in my area of the county started in mid-June. Im still hearing them, and were now into August.It appears that the M&M boys, Clark County Commissioners David Madore and Tom Mielke, are dead set against listening to the people who actually vote. The majority of voters in the fall of 2013 wanted to restrict fireworks to the Fourth of July only.In a poll in The Columbian, the majority also wanted it restricted to the fourth. So now the M&Ms want to waste even more taxpayer dollars and do their own survey? Well, you can be sure that the voters will remember this when they are up for re-election.

Replacing outdated equipment is a regular business decision at Shields Bag & Printing that also has environmental benefits.
\
So for the Yakima-based plastics company, the market is a better driver for reducing emissions than Gov. Jay Inslee's proposed Carbon Pollution Accountability Act.
\
""I think there are a lot of other ways to go about it,"" said Derek LaFramboise, Shields' environmental service manager.
\
For example, some of Shields' customers won't do business with companies that haven't taken documented steps to reduce carbon emissions.
\
""We have customers that require us to report improvements to our processes,"" LaFramboise said Friday in a telephone interview.
\
Under Inslee's proposal, outlined earlier this week, business entities in the state with emissions equal to or exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide would need to pay one ""allowance"" for every metric ton of greenhouse gas released. The revenue would be used to fund education and transportation.
\
The carbon tax is part of Inslee's more comprehensive plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles, cleaner fuel standards and research on renewable energy.
\
For now, local businesses leaders and industry groups are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach toward the idea, though they have plenty of questions about how it would be implemented and are skeptical there would be any real impact on the environment.
\
About 135 facilities statewide, including fuel refineries and distributors, utilities and transportation companies, are among the businesses that would be regulated under the Carbon Pollution Accountability Act.
\
The state Department of Ecology, which would administer the program, has published a preliminary list of entities with major greenhouse gas emissions. None of them is headquartered in Yakima County, though a few, such as Pasco-based Connell Oil Inc., have operations here. The agency has said other entities will be added to the list.
\
Shields Bag & Printing is not on the list; its emissions are well below the 25,000-metric-ton mark. Still, LaFramboise doesn't think it would be immune from the effects of the proposed tax, namely through its use of fuel and other raw materials.
\
While going after the major emitters makes sense from a political standpoint, the question is whether companies will reduce emissions significantly in response, he said.
\
In a policy brief, the governor's office said major emitters such as refineries would have the choice to either invest in cleaner technology or pay for allowances that would be more costly over time.
\
Given the sizable investment to purchase new equipment or fund other operation changes, many entities, at least in the short term, will likely opt to pay the tax and pass on the cost to customers, LaFramboise said.
\
That's when consumers are likely to see the impact at the gas pump or in the cost of raw material used by manufacturers, including Shields.
\
Inslee claims the impact at the pump would be about 2 cents per gallon by 2020. But Lea Wilson, executive director of the Washington Oil Marketers Association, based in Olympia, said that's a difficult number to predict.
\
""I don't know the real (price impact),"" she said. ""I'm not sure if anyone knows the real number.""
\
Gary Christensen, CEO of R.E. Powell, a Grandview company that distributes fuel to more than 250 gas stations in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, said the increase at the pump could be significant, especially if other aspects of Inslee's plan, such as requiring a lower-carbon fuel standard for vehicles, are implemented.
\
Currently a majority of gas in this state, especially this side of the state, comes from refineries located outside Washington. If the Legislature implemented a lower-carbon fuel standard, those refineries may not play along since most states they ship to do not have a similar standard, Christensen said.
\
That could create a supply problem that, when combined with costs passed through from a carbon tax, would result in a large increase in fuel costs for consumers and businesses.
\
""We all know this is just a soft sell, another way to tax Washingtonians at a minimum benefit to the emissions situation,"" Christiansen said.
\
Still, Wilson and many others in the business community say Inslee's proposal is in the early stages.
\
""Just like everyone else, we're trying to understand it,"" Wilson said. ""Clearly we have, in my opinion, an entire legislative session to discuss this. This is (Inslee's) first stab.""
\
David McFadden, president of New Vision, Yakima County's economic development arm, said he feels Inslee wanted to put something on the table, but he expects the proposal to be fully vetted in the months to come.
\
""Given the political divide, I think we're going to be reading about these cap-and-trade options in May and June,"" he said, referring to the Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled House.
\
A broader discussion and debate on whether such policies are best at either the state or federal level, is also needed.
\
""I can imagine some of the frustration from some of the interests of waiting on Washington, D.C.,"" McFadden said. ""But I'm not sure (a state carbon tax) is the best approach versus other options, (such as) a broader federal option.""

76,"The decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to classify greenhouse gases as ""pollutants"" subject to the Clean Air Act effectively ends the government's resistance to putting a price on heat-trapping emissions that exacerbate global warming. This time, the nation must take this seriously, because the EPA now has the authority to act if Congress does not. This means the nation needs a comprehensive strategy that melds energy and environmental concerns.\Previous efforts have suffered from quick power outages. Propelled by the OPEC-led oil shocks of the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter took to the airwaves and implored the nation to conserve energy and explore alternative fuel sources. But the cardigan sweater and dour message were extinguished by ridicule. Then oil prices dropped, and the nation shifted back into no-problem mode. In 1993, President Bill Clinton introduced the idea of a BTU tax on energy sources based on the amount of heat they generated (as measured by British thermal units). This was the first instance of acknowledging the environmental price of our traditional energy sources. But the idea couldn't generate enough backing.\Now, the nation has no choice, but it does have better options than turning this over to EPA regulators. The Clean Air Act was not written with greenhouse gases in mind. The nation needs a regulatory regime that takes the best ideas from wide-ranging interests based on today's realities. The EPA is not known for its cost-benefit analyses, but that's exactly what we need. Killing emissions is easy. Killing them while maintaining a healthy economy is not.\The most popular bill in Congress proposes a complicated ""cap-and-trade"" system, which would set a limit on emissions for smokestack industries and then allocate permits to pollute that would be bought and sold. Another bill, by U.S. Rep. John Larson, a moderate Democrat from Connecticut, would impose a carbon tax. It states up front what the cost will be. This definitive price signal would be the basis of subsequent business decisions and consumer choices. This bill is the underdog, because of truth in labeling: It is a tax.\But so is cap-and-trade, because the costs will be passed along to consumers. In hiding that fact, cap-and-trade would be a more complicated system that could be gamed by insiders and contorted by powerful interests. A growing number of lawmakers are beginning to see this, including U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's energy subcommittee. She prefers a cap-and-dividend system, whereby industry is charged for pollution credits and dividends are distributed to consumers to help offset increased energy costs.\The best system would probably be a straight carbon tax, which would quickly give rise to investment in energy alternatives. It would be important to take the proceeds and pour them into alternative energy research, development and production, which includes wind, solar, nuclear, a high-tech grid and energy storage. As new technology kicks in, the tax could be lowered.\Whatever the course, we cannot laugh off or ignore the problem any longer. The nation needs a plan."
77,"OLYMPIA - Lawmakers should create a legacy of a cleaner environment, a stronger democracy and safer workplaces in their 2018 session, Gov. Jay Inslee said Tuesday. And they should come up with money to speed the improvements they approved last year on public schools.\In his annual State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature, Inslee urged lawmakers to find the money to start all changes to the state's public school system by this fall, in line with a state Supreme Court decision that the last year's improvements pass constitutional muster but the timing does not.\""It is crucial that we implement the McCleary plan now, because a child is only a third grader once and you don't get that year back,"" Inslee said, referring to the name of the court ruling on the need to improve public schools.\Republican leaders indicated they might ignore the court's order to speed up payments, saying they came up with the best way to cover costs in a complicated system.\""I would say there's no urgency at this time,"" Rep. David Taylor, R-Moxee, said of the GOP's attitude toward the court's mandate. ""My personal opinion is we ignore the court and thank them for their input.""\Senate Minority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said the plan meets the intent of the state's constitutional duty on education. ""We are the body that writes the budget,"" he said.\In a speech punctuated by applause about a dozen times from his fellow Democrats - but less enthusiasm on most points from Republicans - Inslee urged lawmakers to buck the Trump Administration's decision to walk away from an international agreement on climate change and enact a state tax on carbon pollution.\He quoted former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in saying the state must be victorious over climate change because ""without victory, there is no survival.""\""We are joined across geography, across age and across political interests,"" Inslee said. ""Now is the time to join in action and put a price on carbon pollution.""\Inslee also asked legislators to pass a $4.4 billion capital construction budget as their ""first order of business."" That budget stalled at the end of last year's record overtime and did not get final approval. It has money for projects all over the state, and would support 19,000 jobs, he said.\Republican leaders, however, said they have not wavered from last year's demand that a vote on the capital budget be tied to a revision in state water law to address problems with the ability of landowners to get permits to drill wells for projects in rural and suburban areas.\Schoesler said any reference to that problem, known as the Hirst decision after the court case, was ""totally missing"" from Inslee's speech.\""It's not even mentioned, something that impacts families in all 39 counties,"" he said.\House Minority Leader Dan Kristiansen, R-Snohomish, said the Hirst decision affects the ability to add low-income housing in rural areas.\Although the session is scheduled for only 60 days, the governor's ""to-do"" list for legislators is extensive. Beyond his call for a carbon tax and more money for schools, Inslee asked them to:\Pass a Voting Rights Act, as well as laws to allow automatic voter registration and Election Day registration. Guarantee reproductive parity and contraceptive rights for women. Commit to safe workplaces where everyone is safe from sexual harassment and assault. Protect so-called Dreamers - undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children - and make sure they will have access to college scholarship programs even if the federal government won't renew their deferments. Pass gun control legislation that includes a ban on bump stocks, make it tougher to purchase military-style semi-automatic rifles and require safe storage of firearms in homes.

78,"Spin Control\State law calls for Washington to reduce carbon pollution in the coming decades. It sets standards for how much, and how soon. It doesn't say how though.\To fill in that blank, lawmakers this session have what might be described as a shotgun approach to pollution reduction. They have introduced an array of proposals for new fuel standards, incentives, taxes or fees.\Into this mix, the Senate Environment, Energy and Technology Committee last week considered a ""cap-and-trade"" system that would set up requirements for some large businesses and utilities to limit and gradually reduce their carbon emissions with new technologies or programs, or to pay others for the reductions they've achieved.\If that sounds vaguely familiar, it's probably because versions of a cap-and-trade system have been introduced in previous years, but never passed. The hearing showed it remains controversial.\One common complaint is that it's complicated. The Association of Washington Business questioned whether there was enough time left in the legislative session, scheduled to end April 28, for an in-depth discussion on the cap-and-trade proposal, spokesman Peter Godlewski said. Maybe lawmakers should study it after the session ended, and come back next year, he suggested.\One of the group's concerns was higher costs to businesses could lead to ""leakage"" - moving jobs to other states to avoid those costs, he said.\The Legislature worked on a carbon tax bill for two years that tried to address the leakage issue, Sen. Guy Palumbo, D-Maltby, said. Did the AWB support that bill when it was introduced?\Before his time with the organization, Godlewski said. He'd have to check.\""I'll answer it for you. They didn't,"" Palumbo said. Legislators, it should be noted, have long memories for people who vote against things they like.\Kaiser Aluminum also worried about leakage of jobs from its Spokane Valley rolling mill to places outside Washington where aluminum is processed. It could support a cap-and-trade system if the mill was granted an allowance as an operation that has large emissions, but faces foreign competition, something known as EITE for emissions intensive trade-exposed, spokesman Kyle England said. Aluminum mills aren't specifically mentioned as EITEs in the bill, and there's a lack of clarity on the allowances, he added.\Dan Wilson, of the United Steelworkers, which represents 900 Kaiser workers in the Valley, also made a pitch for a permanent EITE designation. The mill makes products with a lower ""carbon footprint"" than plants elsewhere, he added, so leaking those jobs to other mills would be bad for the environment.\Committee Chairman Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, said the bill doesn't name companies but sets up a process for the Ecology Department to determine EITE. ""It's not that we're not including you,"" he said, they're trying to do it in ""a responsible policy way.""\The oil industry was divided on the proposal.\It lacks transparency, consumer protections and certainty for business, said Dan Coyne, a spokesman for Phillips 66, which has a refinery in Ferndale. If the Legislature does pass a plan to limit carbon pollution, the company favors a well-designed carbon tax over cap-and-trade, he said. It would be more transparent, provide certainty to businesses, and keep revenue in the state.\""I think we're all impressed with Phillips 66's new religion on carbon tax,"" Carlyle said.\Last year, Phillips 66 gave $7.2 million to the $31.5 million campaign against Initiative 1631, which opponents denounced as a carbon tax.\Oil producer BP, another major donor to the campaign against I-1631, supports the cap-and-trade bill. Bob Allendorfer, the manager of its Cherry Point refinery, said the company believes it could bring an effective carbon-pricing program to the state, reducing emissions and be applied consistently across the state, he said.\The Washington Farm Bureau is against just about any type of carbon-pricing mechanism, spokesman Tom Davis said. Buses and Priuses are fine for people in Seattle, he said, but you need a pickup truck on the farm, and raising the price of gasoline or diesel is going to raise the price of production.\Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Auburn, said he was worried the Legislature has so many carbon reduction ideas that several will pass and add so many taxes and fees on fuel, that will raise the cost of everything that needs fuel to be made, powered or transported.\What about the higher cost of health care and a degraded environment if they don't reduce carbon pollution, countered Sen. Joe Nguyen, D-White Center.\The committee has yet to vote on the proposal but the hearing showed one thing about carbon is as true in politics as chemistry: It can be a great source of heat.\Contact the writer:\(360) 664-2598\jimc@spokesman.com"
79,"School funding will be among the more contentious issues confronting lawmakers when they convene in Olympia on Monday for the start of the 2018 legislative session, but how they will solve the $1 billion question remains to be seen. \Democrats now control the House, Senate and governor's office thanks to November's special election that flipped the previously Republican-held seat in the 45th District to Democrats, giving the Senate Democratic coalition a one-vote margin in the Senate. That could bode well for passage of a Voting Rights Act, which was prompted as cities grappled with the aftermath of a federal court order mandating the way Yakima City Council elections are held. But it could also stymie efforts to change a landmark state Supreme Court decision regulating water rights - always a prickly issue in Eastern Washington. \Here are a few things to watch in the next 60 days of the session, along with a few predictions from several Eastern Washington lawmakers: \McCleary Fix\* What it is: A public-school spending plan passed by the Legislature last June that provides funding to schools by raising state property taxes for schools and pays teacher salaries based on local housing costs. The plan came in response to a 2012 state Supreme Court ruling known as the McCleary Decision that said the Legislature had failed to provide adequate funding for public schools and needed to provide more. \* Why it's important: Instead of relying as much on local levies for funds, school districts will be largely funded by the state. But teacher salaries will be based in part on the local cost of living, which means many Yakima Valley teachers will receive less than their counterparts in Seattle and many other areas of the state. That worries some local administrators who say they will have trouble attracting teachers. Also, the Supreme Court says the state still needs roughly $1 billion more by next September to adequately fund school districts. It is unclear if lawmakers will agree on a funding source. \* What to look for: Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, and Rep. Gina McCabe, R-Goldendale, say McCleary is likely to be one of the two most dominate issues lawmakers will face this session.\Given opposition to the teacher pay issue, plus concern that districts can raise more with levies than they will get from the state, King said he anticipates changes to address those two issues. But it is unclear exactly what changes can be expected, he said. McCabe says the biggest hurdle is deciding where the $1 billion will come from. \Gov. Jay Inslee wants to take the money from budget reserves and then backfill that with his proposed carbon tax, which could face heavy opposition in the Legislature. McCabe said the passage of a carbon tax depends on what Inslee's proposals are, but should it fail, she said the best option is to wait for the plan to be implemented despite a daily $100,000 fine being placed on the state by the high court.\Hirst Decision\* What it is: A 2016 state Supreme Court ruled that Whatcom County failed to protect water resources by allowing new wells to reduce flow in streams for fish and other uses. The high court ordered counties to develop their own plans for regulating water to ensure adequate supplies for landowners, irrigators and wildlife. Yakima County recently approved such a plan, but not without angering some who objected to its fees and permits.\* Why it's important: The decision affects water rights and determines who ultimately controls the state's water. It has a large effect on rural landowners seeking to drill wells on their property. In the wake of the high court's decision, some frustrated property owners complained they'd spent thousands of dollars preparing building lots only to discover they couldn't get a building permit. Some counties say they don't have the resources to conduct the hydrological studies required under the ruling. Republican lawmakers forced a stalemate on a capital budget last session when the Legislature was unable to reach agreement on a remedy.\* What to look for: Requiring rural landowners to obtain a permit to drill domestic wells has drawn the most vitriol. Rep. Bruce Chandler, R-Granger, and King said any legislation will likely address that issue, although exactly how remains unclear. McCabe said some Democrats may try to keep restrictions on drilling as required by the court ruling in place, but Republicans would argue to remove them. \""How this is determined will determines the future of rural Washington,"" Chandler said. ""If it's implemented further, it will be disastrous for rural communities throughout Washington."" \Voting Rights Act \* What it is: A measure to allow certain cities to switch from at-large to district voting for local elected officials. Proponents say voting by district creates city councils that more closely reflect the makeup of a city's population. In 2014, a federal judge ordered Yakima to move to district only voting, saying the at-large system had disenfranchised Latino residents. After that ruling, Pasco and Wenatchee attempted to move to district voting to avoid a similar legal challenge, but they were hampered by state law making it difficult. \* Why it's important: Proponents say it's a fairer election process that results in a council members who better reflect their districts. Under that system, adopted by court order in Yakima, three Latinos were elected to the council for the first time. \* What to look for: Bills dealing with this issue have stalled in the past. But with Democrats in control the measure has a far better chance of passage. McCabe predicts the measure has a better chance of passing because more people are paying attention to what happened in Yakima. ""There's more awareness because of What happened in Yakima,"" she said. ""Yakima was key in creating more discussion in the rest of the state."" She said she's heard of at least two such bills - one in the Senate and one in the House - that lawmakers will begin discussing in the upcoming session. \Gun control\* What it is: In the always volatile issue of gun control, there may be signs of a bipartisan support to ban ""bump-stocks,"" devices that allow a semi-automatic rifle to fire so rapidly it approaches the speed of an automatic rifle. A Democratic-controlled Senate might be more likely to consider bills, such as more extensive background checks for semi-automatic military style rifles and safe storage requirements, but passing them will still be difficult.\* Why it's important: Supporters of gun control say stringent gun laws make communities safer by keeping firearms out of the hands of people considered potentially dangerous. They note that a bump-stock was used in the Las Vegas mass shooting last October that killed more than 50 people. Opponents say placing regulations on guns infringes upon citizens' constitutional rights and makes communities more dangerous by impeding people's ability to defend themselves. \* What to look for: King anticipates Democrats will introduce one or two bills banning bump-stocks or other similar modifications to firearms, which he says some Republicans will likely support. McCabe said she's heard Democrats plan to push safe storage requirements. But given the short session, they said it's unclear whether legislators will have the time or willingness to pass any gun control measures. \Carbon tax \* What it is: Last month, Gov. Inslee announced he will propose a tax on carbon pollution to replenish the roughly $1 billion withdrawal from budget reserves he wants legislators to make to fund school spending. He's refused to give details on the plan, saying it will be rolled out some time this month. A similar initiative in 2016 - which voters rejected - sought to place a tax of $15 per metric ton of carbon emissions on farms and businesses, with the tax increasing yearly until it capped at $100 per metric ton of emission. \* Why it's important: Supporters of the tax say it would be a major help in preserving the environment by significantly reducing the state's production of carbon - a main driver of global warming. Opponents say the tax would raise gas prices and would be a financial detriment to farmers and businesses \* What to look for: Lawmakers say what happens is contingent on the details of Inslee's proposal, McCabe said it could see bipartisan support. ""We all care about the climate, and I don't think there would be hardcore opposition to a carbon tax as long as it struck a balance between the environment and the economy,"" she said. ""I'm not a fan of new taxes, but I'm also not a fan of not negotiating.""\Credit: By Alec Regimbal | Yakima Herald-Republic"
80,"
Democratic and Republican lawmakers don't agree on how to improve education or teacher pay, protect the environment, reduce health care costs or make government more efficient.
\
But they seem to agree their upcoming two-year budget-writing legislative session, which starts Monday, should not approach the brinkmanship of the last two-year budget cycle.
\
Caucus leaders and budget writers staked out their opening positions last week, claiming they're optimistic the upcoming session won't go into extra innings this year.
\
""I believe that we are going to get out of here in 105 days,"" said Rep. Bruce Chandler, R-Granger, at The Associated Press Legislative Preview in Olympia on Thursday. ""And I believe we will have a budget that makes everyone unhappy.""
\
The talking points about beginning the session in good-faith negotiations were similar in 2013, when the last two-year budget was drafted. But that session ended in June, well beyond the regular 105-day session, with government agencies scrambling for contingency plans in the event of a shutdown.
\
""If we are doing our duty for the citizens of the state, we won't go there again,"" Senate Minority Leader Sharon Nelson, D-Maury Island, said Thursday.
\
The sunny outlook comes in spite of historic pressures from court rulings to increase funding to education and pay for the proper care of mental health patients, while Democrats also say it's time to give teachers pay increases for voter-mandated cost-of-living adjustments that have been deferred for the last six years.
\
At the same time, Gov. Jay Inslee has put forth a capital gains tax proposal to meet those demands as well as a cap-and-trade program and carbon tax that would demand more from the state's biggest polluters.
\
Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, has already stated he ""can't support"" the cap-and-trade proposal. The most Republicans could support, he said, would be creating market incentives to reduce carbon output that don't put new costs on businesses.
\
Meanwhile Chandler, the Republicans' chief budget writer in the House, has said any tax increase would ultimately find its way to the ballot for voters to decide.
\
""If we simply pass a tax increase and don't put a referendum on it, there will be an initiative and the voters will put it on the ballot themselves,"" Chandler said in an interview Friday. ""The voters are going to be heard on this and I think they should be heard first rather than last.""
\
Remy Trupin, executive director of the liberal policy group Washington Budget & Policy Center, said state officials and voters will be educated on the hard realities facing the state's education and transportation systems, and he thinks they'll see the value in Inslee's tax proposals.
\
""If the public gets what the impact of these things are, I think it's all possible,"" Trupin said.
\
But before that would happen, both parties will also have to come to terms on whether new revenue is needed to solve any of the challenges facing government services in the coming biennium and beyond. Senate Republican budget writer Andy Hill of Redmond has stated emphatically that there is no budget deficit in terms of meeting the state's constitutionally mandated functions because revenue will grow in the biennium.
\
But that is something his Democratic counterparts don't see when they do the math.
\
""It's a myth that the budget deficit is a myth,"" said Senate Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Karen Fraser, D-Thurston County.
\
Projected revenue for the upcoming biennium is nearly $37 billion, according to the Office of Financial Management, almost $3 billion more than the previous biennium from 2013-15. Democratic leaders say as much as another $3 billion on top of that may be needed if the Legislature doesn't defer voter-approved Initiative 1531, which would require between $1.2 billion and $2 billion to reduce class sizes in K-12 education.
\
The Legislature would need a two-thirds majority vote to put off the implementation of that initiative. House Democratic budget writer Ross Hunter, D-Medina, whose caucus has the most members that support the initiative, indicated he doesn't see any room for it in the 2015-17 budget.
\
""When you look at things that can't be funded, they won't be,"" Hunter said Thursday.
\
Jason Mercier, of the conservative Washington Policy Center, said in an interview he expects the class-size initiative voters approved in 2014 to be the foremost hang-up in successfully drafting a budget. He said he doesn't think there are enough Democrats at the moment to help make up the two-thirds vote needed to defer the initiative.
\
""What passed at the ballot box will not be implemented this session,"" Mercier said. ""The question is in suspending that or putting it back on the ballot with a corresponding tax source.""
\
Lawmakers have until June 30, when the 2013-15 biennium officially ends, to approve a budget without forcing a government shutdown. The next biennium begins July 1.
\
The carbon tax discussion has all but derailed talk of a gas tax increase that was the center of transportation talk over the last year, Mercier said. Chandler said he's not sure what the governor's proposals mean for the prospect of a transportation package.
\
""I'm a little bit confused by the governor on whether it's a choice between the carbon tax and the gas tax or whether he's advocating both,"" Chandler said.
\
Inslee spokeswoman Jaime Smith said the governor has dropped the gas tax proposal in favor of his carbon tax plan, which charges businesses that emit 2,500 metric tons per year, with that threshold being lowered over time and a goal of reducing emissions overall. Businesses can purchase carbon emission allowances from others as part of the cap-and-trade program in order to avoid penalties.
\
Smith said the governor's proposal would raise $12 billion over 12 years, roughly the same estimate associated with last year's gas tax proposal.
\
But the gas tax remains an option for Senate Transportation Chairman Curtis King, R-Yakima, so long as a package of Republican reforms to cut costs to the state is included. King said a new revenue source is needed and he prefers the gas tax because that money is protected by the state constitution from being diverted to unrelated projects.
\
""There's no guarantee a carbon tax will go entirely to roads and bridges and highways,"" King said Friday.
\
While the budget and new revenue proposals will dominate the session, they won't be the only high profile or important pieces of legislation lawmakers will consider. What follows are some issues of importance to the Yakima Valley that are likely to come up.
\
Agriculture
\
Many growers in the fruit industry have concerns about Inslee's proposed efforts to limit carbon emissions, said Jon DeVaney, president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association based in Yakima.
\
""His direction to the Department of Ecology to draft a new state low-carbon fuel standard could substantially increase fuel and energy costs, which is a concern for the transportation-intensive agricultural sector,"" DeVaney said in an emailed statement.
\
While Democrats have sought to close tax breaks in order to generate revenue, most of the agricultural community hopes the Legislature keeps a variety of tax breaks for the industry, said Steve George, president of the Yakima County Farm Bureau.
\
""We have some tax preferences we'd certainly like to keep because that generates more business and stimulates the economy,"" he said.
\
As one example, businesses can qualify for a sales-and-use tax exemption on equipment and facilities used in livestock nutrient management. And certain replacement parts for farm machinery and equipment, and related services, enjoy exemption from sales taxes.
\
Mike Gempler of the Washington Growers League, a Yakima-based association that focuses on labor issues, said some growers seek more funding to train farm laborers to safely handle pesticides. Growers also want continued support of farm worker housing construction.
\
The Washington Growers League plans to ask for roughly $500,000 to double the scope of the state Department of Agriculture's farm worker education program, said Gempler, adding he's realistic about getting it.
\
""Asking for any kind of money is difficult,"" he said.
\
Agriculture is expected to oppose a bill proposed by the Agriculture Department that might apply specifically to Yakima County and two west side counties where dairy manure has been linked to water pollution problems.
\
The proposal would make farmers who buy manure from dairies and apply it as a fertilizer subject to similar regulations as dairy farmers. Currently, once manure leaves the dairy, there are no regulations to ensure that manure is applied at appropriate times and at rates that crops can use.
\
The goal is to protect surface and groundwater from manure run-off. It's already controversial. The plan has been criticized by the agricultural industry as unnecessary over-regulation and by some environmentalists as a way for the state to avoid enforcing existing water-quality laws.
\
Natural resources
\
The Department of Ecology has requested $30 million for capital projects that are part of the 30 year, $4 billion Yakima Basin Integrated Plan.
\
The request is comparable to federal funding for the plan - a joint proposal by Ecology and the federal Bureau of Reclamation - expected over the next two years, said Derek Sandison, Ecology's lead on the issue.
\
The request includes: $9.5 million for work at Kachess and Keechelus reservoirs; $9.5 million for fish passage at Cle Elum Dam and Tieton Dam; $5 million for agricultural and municipal water conservation; $5 million for habitat improvement work; and $500,000 each for water bank development and a groundwater storage pilot project.
\
But Inslee's capital budget proposal calls for $15 million for the Integrated Plan's projects.
\
Meanwhile, Sen. Jim Honeyford, R-Sunnyside, is sponsoring legislation that would create a funding mechanism for water infrastructure projects around the state, including water supply, flood control and storm water projects.
\
The details are still being worked out, but basically a new program would give local governments an opportunity to compete for grants and loans to fund needed water infrastructure projects.
\
Forest thinning across Eastern Washington and the funds to do it will be pushed by the Department of Natural Resources in order to reduce the risks of catastrophic wildfires.
\
The department is asking for $20 million for the next biennium - up from the current funding level of $4 million - to reduce the wildfire hazards in unhealthy forests.
\
Recent studies have shown that 3.5 million acres in Eastern Washington are in need of thinning work that has been proven to reduce wildfire severity - that's more than 5,000 square miles.
\
State Forester Aaron Everett told the Herald-Republic in December that the current pace of restoration work isn't keeping pace with the growing need, which leads to escalating wildfire danger.
\
According to the National Resources Department, $20 million could treat 45,000 acres, including state lands and private lands in partnership will small forest landowners.
\
The governor's budget also includes $2 million for the management of the 50,000-acre Teanaway Community Forest, created by the Legislature as part of approving the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan in 2013.
\
Social services
\
Meanwhile, local social service providers are keeping close watch that their budgets aren't tapped to help fund other needs.
\
""We're on high alert,"" Lori Brown, director of Yakima-based Aging and Long-Term Care of Southeast Washington, said in a recent interview with the Herald-Republic.
\
State-only funding for programs at Entrust Community Services in Yakima are also at risk, according to Mark James, community relations director at the Yakima program. Entrust provides a range of services, including employment support and training, for adults with disabilities.
\
Nursing homes, meanwhile, received $22 million in Medicaid dollars last year, but are still operating at rates well below cost. They are hoping for another adjustment.

"
81,"The mound of trash is piled four stories high, filling one of the bays at the city of Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant.\The bulging garbage bags, tattered textiles, discarded food, and broken furniture and toys represent about four days' worth of trash from Spokane-area residents.\""I think a lot of people put it out at the curb and forget about it,"" said Gina Dempsey, the plant's manager. The garbage ends up at a West Plains incinerator, where it's burned to produce electricity.\City officials say the Waste-to-Energy Plant performs a valuable service, consuming 800 tons of trash daily and generating enough electricity to power 13,000 homes. But Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant also has a darker side: It's one of Washington's top emitters of greenhouse gases.\In 2014, the plant released more than 105,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It ranks on the lower end of a list of 35 Washington factories, oil refineries, power plants and other facilities that are jointly responsible for 60 percent of the heat-trapping gases released in the state.\Under new rules being developed by the state Department of Ecology, the city would have to cut carbon emissions at the Waste-to-Energy Plant by 5 percent every three years beginning in 2017, or find other ways to offset the emissions.\That's a tall order for Spokane, which doesn't have a lot of options for garbage disposal, said Marlene Feist, a spokeswoman for the city's utilities division.\""I don't anticipate that we would build another landfill for this community,"" Feist said.\The $110 million Waste-to-Energy Plant opened in 1991. It was built to replace a leaking landfill and help protect the Spokane Valley/Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, the sole source of drinking water for more than 500,000 of the region's residents, Feist said.\Trucking the city's waste to a distant landfill would create its own carbon footprint. And there are trade-offs to burying garbage versus burning it, she said. Landfills produce methane, a greenhouse gas that has 25 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon when measured over a 100-year period.\While city officials support the state's goal of environmental stewardship, Spokane also needs a practical, cost-effective way to dispose of garbage, Feist said.\Given the number of low-income households in the community, ""we'd like to keep utility rates affordable,"" she said.\The state rules are being developed under Washington's Clean Air Act at the direction of Gov. Jay Inslee, who has made climate change a centerpiece of his administration but failed to get a cap-and-trade system and carbon tax approved by last year's Legislature.\State officials said the new rules would gradually reduce carbon dioxide, methane and five other heat-trapping gases that contribute to global warming. Washington is already experiencing the effects of a changing climate through smaller snowpacks, increased flooding and rising sea levels, according to a 2015 report by the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group.\The proposed rules apply to facilities that release more than 100,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually. In the future, smaller polluters would also have to comply. Beginning in 2020, the compliance threshold would drop by 5,000 metric tons every three years until it reaches 70,000 metric tons in 2035.\The approach isn't as sweeping as Inslee's earlier legislation, but the proposed rules still face hefty opposition from Sen. Doug Erickson, R-Ferndale, chairman of the Senate Energy, Environment and Telecommunications Committee. He's the author of Senate Bill 6173, which would prohibit the Department of Ecology from restricting carbon emissions without legislative action. The bill passed out of Erickson's committee last week.\Meanwhile, the city has asked the Department of Ecology for flexibility in complying with the proposed rules.\Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant is one of only two in the Northwest, Feist said. The other is in Salem.\Waste-to-energy plants are more common on the East Coast, where there is less space for large landfills.\By virtue of what they burn, the plants are high carbon emitters, said Wayne Krafft, an Ecology Department section manager in Spokane. Items such as carpets, shingles, and the foam found in cast-off couches and mattresses contain high amounts of fossil fuels. Burning food waste, such as bacon grease, also releases carbon, he said.\In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, burning waste is better than burying it, city officials wrote in a letter to the Ecology Department. They cited models developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which estimated that sending municipal garbage to a waste-to-energy plant instead of a landfill actually reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\State officials don't disagree with the models, but said it's hard to make direct comparisons. Burning garbage releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere immediately, while landfills release emissions over decades.\In addition, ""it really depends on how they manage the methane,"" said Neil Caudill, the Department of Ecology's greenhouse gas reporting specialist.\Many landfills are required to flare the methane produced from the decaying garbage, which reduces greenhouse gas outputs, he said. Some landfills also generate electricity from the methane, which also lowers the impact.\Under the proposed rules, the city has several options for bringing the Waste-to-Energy Plant into compliance, Caudill said. Stepping up recycling efforts to reduce the amount of garbage burned might be the simplest way to reduce carbon emissions, he said.\The city could also buy credits from other polluters who cut their carbon emissions to levels below what the state requires, Caudill said. The Department of Ecology would also accept credits from several out-of-state carbon trading markets.\Earlier this month, crane operator Eric Vangemert sorted the wet garbage out of the refuse coming into Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant. After the garbage dried out, it was headed for nine-story-tall boilers, where it would be burned at temperatures reaching 2,500 degrees. Steam produced by the boilers is forced through turbines, creating electricity.\Employees at the Waste-to-Energy Plant take quite a bit of pride in the work of turning trash into energy, said Dempsey, the plant manager.\""I would love it if more people knew what we do and why we do it,"" she said.\TOP EMITTERS\A coal-fired electric plant, transportation fuel suppliers and oil refineries are the six largest emitters of greenhouse gas in Washington, according to 2013 data. Spokane's Waste-to-Energy Plant ranks in the top 35. Here are the top six, listed with the amount of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted.\TransAlta Centralia Generation, Centralia: 7.5 million\BP West Coast Products (transportation fuel): 6 million\Tesoro Refining and Marketing (transportation fuel): 5.7 million\Equilon Enterprises, dba Shell Oil Products (transportation fuel): 3.6 million\BP Cherry Point Refinery, Blaine: 2.6 million\Shell Puget Sound Refinery, Anacortes: 2 million\GRAPHIC: Map of area.\Credit: Becky Kramer beckyk@spokesman.com, (208) 765-7122"

Warren/Associated Press \Gov. Jay Inslee takes a question from a reporter Thursday during the Associated Press' annual Legislative Preview at the Capitol in Olympia. Inslee and other Washington leaders slammed the Trump administration's move to roll back Obama-era leniency on legalized marijuana, saying they'll defend the will of the state voters who approved the initiative five years ago. \Rep. Rep. David Taylor, R-Moxee, right, speaks as House Majority Leader Pat Sullivan, D-Covington, left, listens during the education funding panel of the Associated Press' annual Legislative Preview, Thursday, Jan. 4, 2018, at the Capitol in Olympia, Wash. (AP Photo/Ted S. War\The $4 billion CAPITAL BUDGET, that contains funding for construction projects, is being held up by a dispute over a state Supreme Court decision.\The HIRST DECISION requires building permit applicants to demonstrate they have a legally available water source, an issue Republicans want resolved before passing the capital budget.\Passage of a new $43.7 billion, two-year supplemental budget will likely need to address an accelerated timeline to comply with the MCCLEARY DECISION.\REPRODUCTIVE PARITY ACT, a bill that would require insurance companies providing maternity coverage to also cover abortions, will likely come up.\VOTING RIGHTS ACT, which could require redistricting of local elections, will be revived.\When the Washington Legislature meets today a central goal will be finishing their work in the session's 60 days.\Last year, the Legislature went into record overtime as lawmakers hammered out agreements on school funding and unsuccessfully sought a compromise on construction projects and water rights. During the short session, lawmakers will contend with many of the same issues while also trying to get traction on new ones.\“There are two things that need to happen,” said state Rep. Sharon Wylie, D-Vancouver, referring to the loose ends with school funding and the capital budget. “And whatever it takes to make those things happen will be the devil in the details.”\Although the Democrats now control the Senate, it's a slim 25-24 majority. They hold a similarly slim 52-48 majority in the House. In this closely divided environment, Clark County's legislative delegation has prided itself as a model of bipartisan cooperation, holding regular dinners together.\“We are planning to get together as the session resumes so I expect that to continue,” said state Rep. Vicki Kraft, R-Vancouver.\Sen. Annette Cleveland, D-Vancouver said they already have the dinners scheduled.\Capital budget and Hirst\One of the first orders of business the Legislature is expected to take up is the capital budget. It's a $4 billion pot of money that contains funding for construction projects across the state. According to numbers from the state Office of Financial Management, the House version contained $105.7 million for projects in Clark County that have since been delayed.\“Certainly, what concerns me is the inability to move forward with constructing schools that we desperately need,” said Cleveland.\Although it was passed on a 92-1 vote last year, it stalled in the Senate, where Republicans (who controlled the chamber) linked its passage to a fix for the state Supreme Court's Hirst decision. The decision requires building permit applicants to demonstrate that they have a legally available source of water. Although Clark County has remained largely unaffected, other counties have seen development halt as a result of the ruling. Speaking at the Associated Press Legislative Preview, House Speaker Frank Chopp, a Seattle Democrat, said that both parties have been working on a compromise on Hirst.\Democrats now control the Senate by one vote as a result of a special election in November, but Republicans still have leverage. Speaking at the Associated Press Legislative Preview, state Senate Minority Leader Mark Schoesler, a Ritzville Republican, pointed out that passing the bonds to support the capital budget requires approval from 60 percent of lawmakers in both houses.\“The Hirst fix is as critical to our state and its economy as anything we can do,” said Schoesler.\Sen. Lynda Wilson, R-Vancouver, said that a temporary fix to Hirst isn't enough and said she's willing to hold off on approving bonds for the capital budget until the issue is resolved.\“I don't see where we get 60 percent of the votes,” said state Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center. “I don't see that happening because that's how egregious Hirst is.”\Supplemental budget\The Legislature will pass a supplemental budget, which will make adjustments to the current $43.7 billion, two-year budget.\Gov. Jay Inslee has proposed using $950 million from the state's reserves to hasten the timeline for a school funding package and backfill it with a new tax on carbon emissions, the details of which are forthcoming.\Last session, lawmakers passed a school funding package that directed billions more toward education in an effort to comply with the state Supreme Court's McCleary ruling, which mandated that the state fund basic education. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the package complied with its ruling but faulted it for going into effect for the 2019-2020 school year, missing the September 2018 deadline.\“You're only in the first grade once and if you lose that year it doesn't come around again,” said Inslee speaking at the Associated Press Legislative Preview.\Inslee said that the state's budget reserves are healthy and the Legislature should honor the court's ruling. “I have no doubt what is right here,” he said.\However, Schoesler, as well as House Minority Leader Dan Kristiansen of Snohomish, said that the reserves should be saved for hard times. Sen. Christine Rolfes, a Kitsap County Democrat who chairs the budget committee, also noted during the preview that the budget will need to be bipartisan in some scope or scale.\Kraft, Wilson and Rivers were not supportive of the governor's proposal and said the Legislature should stay the course. These legislators, as well as state Rep. Liz Pike, R-Camas, weren't supportive of a carbon tax, citing its potential adverse effect on business.\“I think that it's an artificial construct,” said Rivers, of the court's ruling. “I think the Supreme Court has forgotten who they are.”\Vancouver Democratic Reps. Monica Stonier and Wylie, as well as Cleveland, all said they were open to the idea but would want to evaluate its details before committing to it.\“I'm certainly sensitive to (how it would affect businesses),” said Stonier. “But Washington state is a leader in this area for a reason because we do things that are difficult sometimes.”\Schoesler said a carbon tax was problematic because it would fall disproportionately on different parts of the state and different industries. But he suggested he might be open to the proposal if it included safeguards for rates and offsets enshrined in the constitution.\Inslee remained optimistic about the prospects of a carbon tax and saw an opening given that legislators hadn't given an “absolute no” on the idea and that business leaders were increasingly accepting the idea.\When asked if a carbon tax would hurt the state's pulp and paper mills, Inslee said that other states, as well as Canadian provinces, have implemented controls on the pollutant without damaging their industries.\“The world has successfully shown that carbon pricing systems are totally compliant with economic growth,” said Inslee. “And it is very difficult to find a place where you've seen an industry be lost because of a carbon-pricing system.”\Other issues\Rivers said that with the Democrats in control in Olympia that there will be more legislation on social issues. She said that she expects the Reproductive Parity Act, a bill that would require insurance companies providing maternity coverage to also cover abortions, to come up. She also said the Voting Rights Act, which could require redistricting of local elections, will be revived.\“I'm sure that gun issues will be brought up, but I'm not sure the political will exists in the House to actually move anything out,” said Rivers.\During the legislative preview, Senate Majority Leader Sharon Nelson, D-Maury Island, said there will be a hearing on bump stocks, an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to emulate the rapid fire of a fully automatic weapon. A bump stock was used in the Las Vegas mass shooting last year. Nelson said the Senate will discuss additional background checks for “assault rifles.”\Inslee also said that he would support legislation intended to address the Federal Communications Commission vote to undo net neutrality, which prohibits internet service providers from slowing down or blocking specific content or users.\The Senate Democrats have also signaled their support for the DISCLOSE Act, which has the support of Cleveland, and will require nonprofits involved in politic\CREDIT: Jake Thomas Columbian staff writer"

How about toll roads?
\
To the editor -- Nationwide, our roads and bridges need improvements. With the ever-increasing costs of materials and labor, the gasoline tax is not providing enough revenue to fund necessary improvement projects. One such project is the Valley Mall exit, with the governor's proposed budget pushing that back to 2017. Tunnels across Snoqualmie Pass have been deemed too expensive.
\
Hybrid cars, alternative fuels and fewer miles driven have put a big hole in state and federal budgets. Perhaps it is time to look at new ways to fund such projects. Some states are looking at taxing miles driven. That could negatively impact rural America, forcing many to stay home and reducing dollars spent at retail and food outlets. Another source could be toll roads, where the users pay for the projects. The new Tacoma Narrows Bridge is a toll road. The tunnels could be toll roads until paid for, as could any other project deemed necessary but short on funding.

Keep the school open
\
To the editor -- The proposal to close the Yakima Valley School because it costs ""$17.7 million a year"" is at best a very weak argument. This is not about money; it is about continuing care for those who are unable to take care of themselves. It is about their families, many of whom have been relentlessly devoted to them and their health all their lives. It is about a highly experienced and talented staff that would become unemployed.
\
This is an institution that feeds, nurtures and cares for those who do not have the mental and/or physical capacities to learn how to feed themselves, that is, ""to fish."" However, if they had the capacity to express their wills, I would surmise they would want to learn how ""to fish"" for themselves and not depend on others all their lives.

Potential in Toppenish

To the editor -- I read the Jan. 9 article on the Toppenish school board with interest. Just last month, Toppenish High School was honored as a Silver Medal School by U.S. News and World Report. It is a great honor and only a small percentage of high schools in our country achieve the award. Listening to the educators and students that spoke at the assembly celebrating this achievement, I heard spirit and innovation. It reflected an environment where good ideas are encouraged and acted upon. I was impressed with the variety of new approaches and student input that brought this success. The pride of the students and the staff was palpable as they spoke of their goals and accomplishments.

It's just a game, folks
\
To the editor -- My congratulations to the regents at Western Washington University, and shame on the same group at the University of Washington. If the university never wins another football game the world will be just as well off, but if the UW must cut programs, raise tuition or cut staff salaries just to pay millions for an assistant football coach, something is wrong with society's priorities.
\
Now the UW wants to build or rebuild the football field with taxpayer dollars. Don't get me wrong; I am a retired football coach and do enjoy the game. But really, it's just a game. Does Seattle really need two state-of-the-art football fields at taxpayer expense? I'll gladly pay additional taxes for education, but not games.
\
We need to take stock of where this country is going and ask ourselves what kind of people will pay millions of dollars for games and at the same time allow children to be underfed, ill-housed and poorly educated. There was a time when we did value the things that mattered: What happened?

Animal Control issue
\
To the editor -- Over the past month I have made at least four phone calls to the Animal Control Office regarding a pack of stray dogs that has been running wild in my neighborhood, with no reply or action on their part. I have specifically asked them to return my phone calls with an explanation, but have heard nothing back. These dogs constantly run up on pedestrians, chase bicyclists down the street, bark incessantly and generally detract from the neighborhood. Not to mention that they are probably spreading disease around the neighborhood.
\
Does it really take a child getting mauled, like happened in Wapato, to get these people to act? These dogs are easy to find, so that should not be an excuse. They can be seen any hour of any day.
\
I'm not about to risk putting four stray dogs I don't know in my car and drive them down to the shelter. That's not my responsibility.
\
If Animal Control refuses to do their job, why do we continue to keep it open and pay their salaries? And if this is not their job, then why can't they simply return my phone calls and tell me whose responsibility it is?

It's about saving lives
\
To the editor -- I support the emergency medical services levy.
\
My wife, Stephanie, needed help Jan. 31, 2008. The fire department responded first, followed by the ambulance crew about five minutes later.
\
Five minutes can make all the difference. The ambulance paramedics did almost bring her back, and were able to try different things than the fire emergency medical technicians could.
\
I believe in my heart that Stephanie would still be here if the fire department had paramedics.
\
This is not about duplication of services. That would be true only if there was the same response time, and there is not. Yakima for once should follow the tried and true lead of the rest of the state and be willing to pay for better service. I happened to be on the scene when the motorcycle cop was hit. I was astounded it took so long to get him to the hospital. All our loved ones deserve better.
\
This levy is about saving lives. We all want the best chance to survive in a medical emergency and better equipping our fire department would help.

I will always remember my wife's doctor saying ""If only we could have got to her sooner."" Don't let it happen to you.

Storage solutions
\
To the editor -- Jay Manning, Washington Department of Ecology chief, had a very interesting teleconference with Yakima Basin Storage Association on Jan. 14. He once again refused to endorse state participation in advancing the only storage solution that meets the Yakima Basin's needs. The major reason given was that YBSA has no public support, tribal support or irrigation support (also cited in the Bureau of Reclamation's decision to take no action).
\
When asked if his cheaper, more reasonable program would handle the 76 percent reduction in summer stream flows forecast by the U.S. Geological Survey, he told us that we should not use those facts to support ""our project.""
\
He went on to explain that his solution to the problem of climate change (which encompasses the issue of diminished water supplies in our basin) would be appropriately addressed with Ecology's plan to charge polluters for hydrocarbon emissions. This will reverse climate change and provide more reliable water supplies. He affirmed that Ecology does have the support of the Yakima River Basin, including the irrigators and the Yakama Nation. There will be no new storage built under Jay's watch. His solution is the carbon tax, and he recommended that YBSA solicit Yakima Basin support in passing this legislation to protect our water supply.

Say no to alcohol
\
To the editor -- Alcohol sales in Washington state are up 5 percent, according to a Page 3B Dec. 30 Yakima Herald-Republic article. Tragic statistic!
\
Alcohol is an addictive, mind-altering drug, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and medical experts. Although alcohol kills thousands each year through accidents, disease (cancers and cirrhosis) and violent crime, our society winks at this drug as harmless.
\
Forty percent of young people who start using alcohol before age 15 become alcoholics, according to a 1997 study cited in the Journal of Substance Abuse. Why is alcohol use a major problem among high school and college-age young adults, resulting in hundreds of deaths and lifelong alcoholism? Two major factors: peer pressure and parental/adult example.

If we really want a drug-free society, let's choose and model a vibrant alcohol-free lifestyle.

First Degree Hypocrisy
\
To the editor -- If Hurricane Katrina was God's way of disapproving of fair treatment of gays, then the timing and locations would suggest that Hurricane Gustav was God's way of disapproving of Sarah Palin and Hurricane Ike was God's way of disapproving of the Bush administration (it hit Texas first).
\
This type of ""logic"" seems specially prevalent during this political season. The degrees of hypocrisy are staggering. It seems that Third Degree Hypocrisy is: Say one thing, do another. Second Degree Hypocrisy is: Say one thing, do another and then criticize others who do the same thing. What we are seeing now is lots of First Degree Hypocrisy: Preaching one thing, doing another, blasting anyone who criticizes that fact, and then loudly proclaiming self-righteousness and being staunchly and blindly defended.
\
Low-income and minority women who get pregnant before they are married are ""tramps,"" but Sarah Palin and her daughter are examples of ""family values.""

I've heard many say that anyone who doesn't support President Bush and the Iraq war is unpatriotic. In that case, anyone who doesn't support Barack Obama is a racist!

To the editor -- I have been hearing and reading a lot about cell phone usage while driving. I can drive down the street, road, highway, etc., with a cell phone in my ear and wave at a cop and he can't do a thing about it. If I cause an accident, then he can write a citation as a secondary offense.
\
Excuse me! He can only write a citation after an accident or any other infraction. Let's take care of this problem before something happens. I see absolutely no reason why city councils can't write an ordinance making cell phone usage, while driving, a primary offense, within the city boundaries, as long as it is stronger than the state law. In this case it certainly would be.

Trauma would last
\
To the editor -- Few families have not been touched by a child's disability. And remember, not all of them have been born yet. In every population, about 2 percent to 3 percent of children will not function with what is called ""normal"" capability. So the families who have not been touched by this are a small and temporary number.
\
Thus, the care of these unfortunate children is ongoing. The Yakima Valley School has established a care level that should be the envy of almost every community.
\
I suggest, in attempting to balance the budget, let us not afflict the ones who cannot protest. Let us instead invite whoever will be in charge of the new national administration of health systems to come to Selah and observe the quiet capability of the staff members who provide such loving care. It could be a model for other communities and states.
\
The trauma to those individuals and families with the closing of that school would echo for a long time. Above all, let us do the right thing to care for those unable to care for themselves, either from birth or accident. They are not the ones to have to adjust to the stringent circumstances of the current economic conditions.

The major reason given was that YBSA has no public support, tribal support or irrigation support (also cited in the Bureau of Reclamation's decision to take no action).
\
When asked if his cheaper, more reasonable program would handle the 76 percent reduction in summer stream flows forecast by the U.S. Geological Survey, he told us that we should not use those facts to support ""our project.""
\
He went on to explain that his solution to the problem of climate change (which encompasses the issue of diminished water supplies in our basin) would be appropriately addressed with Ecology's plan to charge polluters for hydrocarbon emissions. This will reverse climate change and provide more reliable water supplies. He affirmed that Ecology does have the support of the Yakima River Basin, including the irrigators and the Yakama Nation. There will be no new storage built under Jay's watch. His solution is the carbon tax, and he recommended that YBSA solicit Yakima Basin support in passing this legislation to protect our water supply.

Say no to alcohol
\
To the editor -- Alcohol sales in Washington state are up 5 percent, according to a Page 3B Dec. 30 Yakima Herald-Republic article. Tragic statistic!
\
Alcohol is an addictive, mind-altering drug, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and medical experts. Although alcohol kills thousands each year through accidents, disease (cancers and cirrhosis) and violent crime, our society winks at this drug as harmless.
\
Forty percent of young people who start using alcohol before age 15 become alcoholics, according to a 1997 study cited in the Journal of Substance Abuse. Why is alcohol use a major problem among high school and college-age young adults, resulting in hundreds of deaths and lifelong alcoholism? Two major factors: peer pressure and parental/adult example.
\
If we really want a drug-free society, let's choose and model a vibrant alcohol-free lifestyle.

Bear hunting is fine
\
To the editor -- Re: The Jan. 16 letter, ""Don't glorify this,"" from Brian McKenna. Hunting is a very useful form of population control. It is used to help eliminate disease and starvation. Mr. McKenna seems to be from the same group of people that voted out bear and cougar hunting with dogs because it was ""cruel,"" but now are complaining about cougars being in their yards and want something done about it.
\
This is Eastern Washington: We hunt, fish and log here. I believe you would be much more comfortable about 130 miles to west with the rest of the tree-hugging population.

First Degree Hypocrisy
\
To the editor -- If Hurricane Katrina was God's way of disapproving of fair treatment of gays, then the timing and locations would suggest that Hurricane Gustav was God's way of disapproving of Sarah Palin and Hurricane Ike was God's way of disapproving of the Bush administration (it hit Texas first).
\
This type of ""logic"" seems specially prevalent during this political season. The degrees of hypocrisy are staggering. It seems that Third Degree Hypocrisy is: Say one thing, do another. Second Degree Hypocrisy is: Say one thing, do another and then criticize others who do the same thing. What we are seeing now is lots of First Degree Hypocrisy: Preaching one thing, doing another, blasting anyone who criticizes that fact, and then loudly proclaiming self-righteousness and being staunchly and blindly defended.
\
Low-income and minority women who get pregnant before they are married are ""tramps,"" but Sarah Palin and her daughter are examples of ""family values.""
\
I've heard many say that anyone who doesn't support President Bush and the Iraq war is unpatriotic. In that case, anyone who doesn't support Barack Obama is a racist!
\
I don't personally believe any of these things, but it drives me crazy to hear all those who make such thoughtless arguments.

Let the cities try
\
To the editor -- I have been hearing and reading a lot about cell phone usage while driving. I can drive down the street, road, highway, etc., with a cell phone in my ear and wave at a cop and he can't do a thing about it. If I cause an accident, then he can write a citation as a secondary offense.
\
Excuse me! He can only write a citation after an accident or any other infraction. Let's take care of this problem before something happens. I see absolutely no reason why city councils can't write an ordinance making cell phone usage, while driving, a primary offense, within the city boundaries, as long as it is stronger than the state law. In this case it certainly would be.
\
If the state won't do anything, maybe the cities can do something positive.

85,"
STOCKHOLM, Sweden With few exceptions, the world's big industrialized nations are struggling to meet the greenhouse gas reductions they committed to in the embattled Kyoto pact on climate change.
\
Western Europe is veering off course, Japan is still far from its target and Canada has given up.
\
The latest figures of heat-trapping gases spewing out of chimneys and tail pipes are grim news for the agreement's supporters and welcome ammunition for the told-you-so camp in such non-Kyoto nations as the United States and Australia.
\
""I think there was entirely too much blue-sky optimistic economic estimates that came out of the pro-Kyoto planning departments,"" said longtime Kyoto critic Kenneth Green of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
\
""It's becoming clear that the U.S. policy, which was based on harder-headed economic analyses, is being borne out by what other countries are experiencing.""
\
Pro-Kyoto activists say the targets are within reach if nations try just a bit harder.
\
The U.N. climate treaty's Kyoto Protocol, negotiated in that Japanese city in 1997 and effective as of last year, calls for an average 5 percent drop in greenhouse emissions by 2012 from the base year 1990. At a treaty conference next month in Nairobi, Kenya, the Kyoto nations will discuss cutbacks beyond 2012.
\
A broad scientific consensus agrees that greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, contribute to global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere. How quickly and badly the climate will be disrupted remains an unknown.
\
The United States, the world's biggest greenhouse-gas generator, dropped out of the Kyoto accord, complaining it would hurt the U.S. economy, and that such big-polluter developing nations as China and India were not included.
\
Other nations decided to forge ahead regardless, and the latest U.N. figures show that as a group the 36 countries committed to the pact can meet the 5 percent target. That progress came mainly from a one-time boost in the 1990s, however, when ex-communist Eastern European states cut emissions dramatically by shutting down or modernizing heavy-polluting Soviet-era industries.
\
Elsewhere, the situation is more dire.
\
Yvo De Boer, head of the U.N.'s climate change secretariat, said industrialized countries needed to ""take a lot of action at home"" to meet their targets.
\
""But fortunately they do still have a number of years to meet those targets because in a number of cases it's not going to be easy,"" he said.
\
Among the worst off is Canada, the current president of U.N. climate change talks, which this year became the first country to announce it would not meet its Kyoto target of a 6 percent emissions cut on average over the years 2008-2012. Canada's emissions have ballooned by 29 percent instead.
\
With oil production growing in the tar sands of Alberta, the Conservative government saw no other option than to jump the Kyoto ship. Environment Minister Rona Ambrose has stated interest in a rival, U.S.-led pact, the Asia-Pacific Partnership, which has no targets, and said the government was working on a ""made-in-Canada"" solution.
\
Japan, too, has a long way to go to meet its 6 percent reduction goal. If no additional measures are taken, U.N. forecasts show Japan's emissions will grow by 6 percent.
\
Aiko Takemoto, an official at the Environment Ministry's climate change division, noted that the bulk of increased emissions came during the 1990s and emissions are forecast to fall over the coming years.
\
He said the government's Kyoto Achievement Plan, implemented last year, will help Japan achieve the target rates by 2012. It calls for conserving energy, cutting carbon emissions in other ways, improving the efficiency of emissions-free nuclear power plants, and investing in forest projects that are ""carbon sinks,"" absorbers of carbon dioxide.
\
The impact of this new, more aggressive approach will be measured and assessed between now and 2008, at which point the government will take stiffer measures, Takemoto said.
\
""We are sure that we will achieve the target,"" Takemoto said. ""If we judge that the present plan is not enough, we will introduce more stringent measures. We won't give up.""
\
The government has also introduced low-tech solutions like asking workers to leave their ties at home to cut down on air conditioning during hot summer months, or wearing sweaters in the office in wintertime. And in June it announced a bold plan to try to pump carbon dioxide into underground storage reservoirs.
\
The European Union, perhaps the biggest champion of the Kyoto pact, is doing better. But even here, the latest statistics are cause for concern.
\
The EU believes it can meet its target of cutting emissions by 8 percent by 2012, but only with the full implementation of an emissions trading scheme and two big ""ifs.""
\
First, countries including Germany and France must introduce environmental policies that are currently only in the planning stages. Second, many must make full use of carbon credits for investing in clean technology projects in developing countries.
\
The European Environment Agency said emissions increased by 18 million tons, or 0.4 percent, between 2003 and 2004 in the 25- member bloc.
\
Spain was the biggest offender, releasing 19.7 million tons of greenhouse gases more in 2004 than the year before. Part of the increase was attributed to a switch to fossil fuels to make up for a shortfall in hydro power caused by drought.
\
But there are a few bright spots.
\
Britain, which has benefited from a switch from coal power plants to natural gas, and Sweden are predicted to meet their targets with current policies.
\
The Swedes even expect to overachieve on their Kyoto target, which allows for an emissions increase of 4 percent.
\
It is not clear whether Sweden's new center-right government, which took office Oct. 6, will stick to that goal, but it has said it is committed to Sweden's target under Kyoto.
\
The Swedes credit a carbon tax and investments in alternative energy sources. The carbon tax, introduced in 1991, has boosted the use of biofuel in heating, but some say the effect on emissions has been limited because it was not imposed on electricity production. This year, the government launched an ambitious plan to break Sweden's oil dependency by 2020.
\
Kyoto supporters say Sweden's success should be an example for the laggards, because it has introduced environmentally friendly polices while keeping the economy rolling: Gross domestic product grew 5.5 percent in the second quarter.
\
""The answers are out there and the measures are out there,"" said Catherine Pearce of Friends of the Earth. ""Kyoto is in fact working.""
\
Elements of the Kyoto Protocol on Global Warming
\
GASES: Seeks to control emissions of six heat-trapping gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.
\
TARGETS: Assigns numerical targets for reducing or limiting emissions, compared with 1990 benchmark, for 36 industrialized countries among 140 nations that ratified pact. The United States hasn't ratified.
\
TRADING: Allows emissions trading among the 36 countries. Industrial plants that emit less than allotted can sell resulting ""credits"" to those that exceed their allowances.
\
FOREIGN CREDITS: Allows a nation to earn credits for financing emissions-reduction projects in another country subject to Kyoto controls.
\
CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM: Allows country to earn credits via emission-reduction projects in developing nations, which are not obliged to cut emissions.

86,"OLYMPIA - Annual temperatures may rise by 2 to 8 degrees, average snowpack may drop by 41 percent by 2050 and the sea level for the Washington coast could rise by anywhere from 4 inches to 56 inches by 2100, all while coastal waters become significantly more acidic, a panel of environmental experts warns.\To combat these changes, Washington should adopt a more comprehensive strategy to reduce carbon pollution and store carbon in safe places in the environment, Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz urged Thursday in a letter to legislative leaders.\""While we still have much to learn, we know with certainty that climate change will impact our wildfires, forests, soils and waters, and the timber, fish, shellfish, crops and wild plants that sustain our communities,"" she said.\Some of those changes are detailed in a new report on the risks of climate change to Department of Natural Resources lands, which Franz oversees. A panel of experts on environmental science, climate and aquatics from Washington State University, the University of Washington and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration compiled a list of possible impacts of increased carbon pollution and climate change through 2100.\Franz urged legislators to find ways to reduce greenhouse gases, including a system to reduce carbon pollution through a cap or a penalty. That money should be spent directly on projects to reduce carbon pollution, she said.\That could put her at odds with fellow Democrat Gov. Jay Inslee, who next week is expected to unveil a carbon tax or fee that could be used partially to replenish a state reserve account he would like to tap to meet a state Supreme Court mandate on paying for public school improvements. Franz's proposal wouldn't allow carbon money to be used that way.\""I'm urging that any carbon policy is smart ... and makes sure there's a nexus with carbon reduction,"" she said in an interview.\Smart carbon policy would focus on several areas, including reductions in wildfire danger and improving forest health, she said. The department and Legislature have committed to treating 1 million acres of forest over the next 20 years.\""Any money we're spending now will be significant money saved in the long run,"" Franz said. Washington's record wildfire season of 2015 cost the state $500 million, she added.\The state should also invest more in water retention projects in Eastern and Central Washington, to help combat erosion and topsoil loss in hotter, drier summers, she said.\Legislative leaders gathered for a preview of the upcoming session acknowledged that carbon pollution deserves attention, but weren't sure if a comprehensive policy could be developed in 2018. A possible state initiative to impose a carbon tax is possible if the Legislature doesn't act.\Senate Minority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said he'd be against any carbon tax that has a disproportionate impact on different parts of the state, different individuals or businesses. He also would want a constitutional amendment to limit the tax.\House Minority Leader Dan Kristiansen, R-Snohomish, said the Legislature should pay attention to efforts to prevent wildfires, which when they occur are the largest producers of carbon pollution. But he wants to be sure any proposal isn't ""tax heavy but policy short.""\Senate Majority Leader Sharon Nelson, D-Maury Island, said she has members working on a carbon policy, which some data shows is the biggest issue for millennial voters. But the 2018 session is only scheduled to go 60 days, and a carbon policy ""is a big lift,"" she said.\Carbon\Credit: Jim Camden The Spokesman-Review"
87,"istock.com \iStock.com \The Columbian \Motorists cross the Interstate Bridge from Portland into Vancouver on Friday afternoon, June 5, 2020. \iStock.com \Associated Press files \Carolyn Long, Democratic candidate for the 3rd Congressional District, speaks during the Goldendale Grange Hall candidate forum on Wednesday night, Oct. 17, 2018. (Nathan Howard/The Columbian) \The Columbian files; iStock.com and National Institutes of Health photo \Carolyn Long, left, and Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground.\Two days before Election Day, five-term Republican U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Democratic challenger Carolyn Long are on the offensive. More than $1 million in outside spending poured into the race in October, manifesting as attack ads and mailers.\Long, a political science professor at Washington State University Vancouver, ran against Herrera Beutler in 2018; she lost by 5 percentage points.\In the interest of divesting from race-horse election coverage, The Columbian presents summaries of where each candidate stands on major issues. Each summary includes recent, on-the-record comments from the candidate outlining her stance and additional context or fact-checking when relevant.\Environment and climate change\Herrera Beutler: President Donald Trump made the right decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord in 2017, she said, adding that the agreement imposed a disproportionate burden on America compared with China.\“I'm not going to support agreements either at home or internationally that are going to be paid for on the backs of working-class citizens,” she said in an Oct. 23 interview with KGW-TV. She said she backs the USE IT Act, which aids in the development of carbon-capture technology. “I won't support a carbon tax on the American workers,” she said.\Long: “I think it was a mistake for us to yield our position of leadership when we withdrew from the Paris climate accord, and I think it's something that we should rejoin,” Long said during an Oct. 8 debate. She was also critical of rollbacks to environmental protection laws under Trump's administration. “I'll be a steward for our climate by focusing on bipartisan legislation that will actually address the climate crisis,” Long said. “I won't pit our environment protections against jobs.” She said she did not support Washington's 2018 carbon tax proposal, and that “we shouldn't move toward taxes and fees” as a way of stemming climate change. She said she wants to develop more jobs in the clean-energy sector.\The record: Herrera Beutler occasionally crosses party lines to maintain environmental regulations (notably last year, when she voted to ban oil drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico). In 2017, she voted to postpone implementing pieces of the Clean Air Act, and voted to repeal a rule requiring oil and gas companies to reduce emissions. Rankings from the League of Conservation Voters, which tracks how often lawmakers cast votes that benefit the environment, gives the congresswoman a 10 percent lifetime rating, and a 24 percent rating last year (the House average is 56 percent). The league endorsed Long in February.\Interstate 5 Bridge replacement\Long: Is critical of Herrera Beutler for failing to get the I-5 Bridge replacement project funded. She points to rising construction costs that make the project much more expensive now than it would have been had the Columbia River Crossing project not disintegrated in 2014. “The more important question is, why hasn't this been fixed in 10 years?” she told KGW-TV in an Oct. 23 interview. She added that she doesn't support tolling to pay for the bridge. “I've never supported tolling on the I-5 Bridge. My record is very clear on that.” If elected, she said she'd work to attract federal infrastructure dollars.\Herrera Beutler: The Columbia River Crossing was a bad plan, Herrera Beutler said in an interview with KOIN-TV. “They were going to build it too low, and they were also going to put light rail on it, which is something Clark County didn't want,” she said. In August, Herrera Beutler wrote a public letter to the project's new administrator and pledged to work toward appropriating federal gas tax funding for a new I-5 bridge. “The project, like the CRC, will fail if one state dictates to the other, or if transportation officials only pay lip service to stakeholders' concerns while making decisions behind closed doors,” she wrote in the letter.\Also, she strongly opposes a proposal that would collect tolls from motorists using Portland-area freeways, including Clark County commuters, to fund Oregon transportation projects.\Fact check: Was the proposed bridge replacement too low? Initially, yes, but the Coast Guard in 2013 issued a bridge permit after the bridge was redesigned to be 21 feet taller.\Health care and insurance\Herrera Beutler: Since 2011 she has joined House Republicans dozens of times and voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. She says she wants to maintain health insurance coverage for people with preexisting medical conditions. “A passion of mine is health care,” she said during a meeting with The Columbian's Editorial Board in August. “My oldest child has a kidney transplant. She will forever be a part of the health care system. She has a preexisting condition. I get my health insurance off the ACA. I would never vote to strip her or any person in my district's access to health care.” She pointed to a bill she co-sponsored in 2019 that would protect preexisting condition coverage if the ACA is overturned (the bill never advanced to a vote). She denounces Long's position, claiming the Democrat had previously championed a “Medicare for All” plan.\Long: The top priority of Long's platform in both 2018 and 2020 has been shoring up the protections offered under the Affordable Care Act and creating a public health insurance option. She told The Columbian's Editorial Board: “The framework that I use to address health care is, try to get health care coverage for as many people as possible as quickly as possible while maintaining the element of choice, and with an eye toward affordability. That has always been my position,” Long said. “If somebody chooses to do so, they can buy government-provided health insurance … if you don't want to do it, you don't have to do it.” She's critical of Republicans' sustained efforts to repeal the ACA. “It protects tens of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions,” Long said. “They've brought that issue to the courts in the middle of a global pandemic.”\The record: Herrera Beutler voted to repeal or amend the ACA more than 80 times over the last decade. She's focused on piecemeal maternal and prenatal health legislation, as with her MOMS Act, which encouraged states to extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers up to one year postpartum. In December, she was one of two Republicans to split from her party and vote for a prescription drug pricing bill championed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\Fact check: Ads from Herrera Beutler's campaign claim that Long supported “Medicare for All” during her first run for Congress. The ads cite a June 2018 interview with The (Longview) Daily News, when Long said she'd vote for a “Medicare for All” bill if Democrats won control of Congress.\“I think the way to address the health care crisis as quickly as possible given the climate that we're in is to repair the ACA and the damage that's been done by the Trump administration as a starting point,” Long told The Daily News. “You should look at my (position) within the context of who's in control of the White House, and the Democrats' relative control in Congress. It's viable because it has bipartisan support in Congress.”\Long has since said that the Herrera Beutler campaign took her 2018 quote out of context. She's reiterated her position on a universal single-payer plan — she doesn't support it — in multiple public forums over the course of her current campaign.\National politics and Trump\Long: Voted for Joe Biden. The Democratic nominee also endorsed her bid for Congress. Long doesn't discuss Trump frequently, though she'll criticize the president on certain points, like when she issued a statement denouncing a controversial statement from Trump in the first presidential debate. “The president called on white supremacist groups to ‘Stand back, and stand by' rather than take an opportunity handed to him to denounce hatred in these difficult times. This has to stop now,” Long said.\In December, Long also issued a statement on Trump's impeachment: “The voters expect us to have a basic sense of right and wrong and to always put the interests of our country ahead of petty politics. After taking the time to review the facts, evidence, and articles of impeachment, I can say that if I were in Congress today — having taken an oath to uphold the Constitution — I would vote for the articles of impeachment,” Long said.\Herrera Beutler: Voted for Trump this year. That's a departure from what she said 2016, when she said “I refuse to accept this is the best we can do” and wrote in then-House Speaker Paul Ryan for president. In June, Herrera Beutler said in a PBS interview that she measures Trump's comments on a “cringe meter.” “Do I think the way the president presents his ideas or his opinions is appropriate? Not always,” Herrera Beutler said. But she said that the president's tax policy and hard-line stance against China make him a better leader for the country.\In December 2019, she voted against the two articles of impeachment accusing the president of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, citing lack of evidence. “They had to prove it. They didn't even come close,” Herrera Beutler said. “To me, it felt like it turned into a political weapon for one party to take out a president they didn't like.”\Tax policy\Long: Says she'd seek to replace the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In an Oct. 15 interview with KOIN-TV, she said the bill disproportionately benefited corporations and the wealthy, and added $2 trillion to the national deficit “Our tax reform should instead prioritize tax cuts for small businesses and working families.” She was echoing what she told The Columbian's Editorial Board in August: “Trickle-down economics has never worked historically,” Long said. “What we saw big corporations do, and the biggest beneficiaries of the tax bill, was buy back stocks and give dividends to their shareholders.”\Herrera Beutler: Is a strong proponent of the 2017 tax bill. She sparred with The Columbian's Editorial Board over the topic, and claimed that the cuts were already starting to pay for themselves before the coronavirus pandemic sank the economy.\“The reality is we were seeing that come back into the economy,” Herrera Beutler said. “We were bringing in more in tax receipts, hundreds of millions of dollars — it had started.” She points to data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury indicating that the cuts increased average annual household income by an estimated $4,000.\Fact check: According to a report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bill is expected to increase the projected national deficit by $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028. The same (pre-pandemic) report also estimated that the tax cuts would add 1.1 million jobs over the decade.\COVID-19\Herrera Beutler: Is focusing her efforts on restoring the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers emergency loans to businesses that can be forgiven if the business maintains its payroll. The PPP expired in August, and she has been trying to force a standalone House vote to extend it. (Congress is currently adjourned.) She called the program “a bridge for almost 9,500 small businesses in Southwest Washington alone,” adding “if we fail to extend it immediately, it will have been a bridge to nowhere because small businesses remain on the brink of survival.” Herrera Beutler also joined her House colleagues in a unanimous March voice vote to pass the CARES Act, which sent direct relief checks of $1,200 to every adult citizen.\Long: Released an overarching pandemic recovery plan in September. The 17-page document focuses on health care (highlighting her aforementioned Affordable Care Act plus public option proposal), infrastructure and emergency unemployment aid. It also takes a broader view on rebuilding the economy, and proposes a graduated $15 federal minimum wage, expansion of the Child Care Development Block Grant program and guaranteed paid sick leave.\“We have people still talking about a CARES Act that was passed five months ago. Congress hasn't done its job,” Long told The Columbian at the time.\Calley Hair: 360-735-4558; calley.hair@columbian.com; twitter.com/calleynhair\By the numbers\Election cycle-to-date fundraising totals:\(as of Oct. 14)\Herrera Beutler: $4.11 million\Long: $3.74 million\Cash on-hand totals:\(as of Oct. 14)\Herrera Beutler: $590,850\Long: $105.605\Election cycle-to-date spending totals:\(as of Oct. 14)\Herrera Beutler: $3.18 million\Long: $3.66 million\August primary results\Districtwide\Herrera Beutler: 135,726 56.24%\Long: 95,875	39.73%\Clark County\Herrera Beutler: 74,969 51.15%\Long: 66,165	45.14%\2018 General election\Districtwide\Herrera Beutler: 161,819 52.67%\Long: 145,407	47.33%\Voting\Clark County residents can register to vote up to and including until 8 p.m. Nov. 3. \CREDIT: Calley Hair The Columbian"
88,"Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler \R-Battle Ground \Carolyn Long \Democratic challenger\Candidates in 3rd District aggressive, confrontational\U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, and Democratic challenger Carolyn Long faced off in a virtual debate Friday afternoon, sparring on topics including health care, environmental policy and a replacement for the Interstate 5 Bridge.\The hourlong event was the first-ever formal debate between the two candidates, who are in the midst of their second contest for the 3rd Congressional District seat. Herrera Beutler defeated Long in 2018 to secure a fifth consecutive term representing Southwest Washington.\The debate proved to be highly confrontational, with each candidate aggressively attacking the other's record. Long argued that Herrera Beutler obfuscates her policy positions and condemned her for failing to stand up to President Donald Trump. Herrera Beutler sought to cast Long as a supporter of left-wing causes such as defunding the police and “Medicare for All.”\“What you saw is what I said you'd see in the opening: someone who lies,” Long said during her closing statement.\“She wants the federal government to run your life and spend your money the way she thinks it should,” Herrera Beutler fired back in her own final remarks.\KXL-FM radio journalist Steve Leader moderated Friday's debate, which was hosted by three local branches of the League of Women Voters along with The Columbian, The Daily News of Longview, the Skamania County Pioneer and the Goldendale Sentinel. Staff from each of the papers took turns asking questions submitted by Southwest Washington residents.\Environment\Multiple questions focused on climate change and other environmental issues, particularly the record-breaking wildfire season that the West Coast has endured this summer.\Long called the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement a mistake and called for Congress to reverse environmental policy rollbacks enacted under the Trump administration. She said she would pursue legislation to address climate change through carbon sequestration measures and support for jobs in the clean-energy sector.\Herrera Beutler said that the Paris Agreement would have put a financial burden on American taxpayers without adequately reining in carbon emissions from China, and said she wanted to work on reducing carbon emissions by incentivizing now technology like renewable energy sources.\She also declared her opposition to a carbon tax, arguing that the financial burden would fall on taxpayers, and sought to pin Long down on the issue as a carbon tax supporter. Long denied advocating for a carbon tax that would raise taxes on consumers, reiterating that her focus was on carbon sequestration and other reduction methods.\Herrera Beutler called for improved management of federal forests through techniques like thinning and prescribed burns in order to decrease the amount of fuel on the forest floor. She at one point argued that environmental lawsuits have prevented timber from being harvested in a sustainable way.\“Passing those (forests) on to the next generation is a priority of mine, and I'll fight to do it,” she said.\Long didn't dispute the need for forest management, but argued that the main cause of increasingly devastating wildfires is climate change, and again criticized Herrera Beutler for the environmental policy rollbacks during the Trump administration.\Protests and policing\Racial justice, policing and First Amendment protest rights all came up over the course of the debate, including questions about right-wing extremist groups. Both candidates expressed support for the right to protest and offered denouncements of racism and racial injustice — and called for reforms to provide greater police accountability.\Herrera Beutler stressed that unlawful violence shouldn't be tolerated, and declared that she would oppose defunding the police outright. She repeatedly challenged Long regarding the latter's endorsement from the Vancouver chapter of the advocacy group Indivisible, whose parent organization has called for defunding the police.\Long countered that she has never called for defunding the police and doesn't adopt every policy position from the groups that have endorsed her. She argued that Trump has further inflamed racial injustice and said that Herrera Beutler and other congressional Republicans have enabled his actions by failing to directly confront him about it.\Interstate 5 Bridge\Long questioned Herrera Beutler's record on the issue of a replacement for the Interstate 5 Bridge, arguing that the incumbent congresswoman hasn't effectively used her position to move the project forward despite the inadequacies of the current structure and the rising cost of replacement over time. Long pledged to get the federal dollars necessary to build a replacement crossing.\Herrera Beutler countered that she has in fact secured federal funds for the region, pointing to the news from just a few weeks ago that the federal government had allocated $5 million to fund early work on a replacement for the Hood River-White Salmon Bridge, as well as another federal $5 million that went to the Pioneer Street extension in Ridgefield.\She pledged to secure funding for the I-5 Bridge too, but said that the process needed to be handled carefully in order avoid a repeat of “what happened last time” — a reference to the defunct Columbia River Crossing project.\Health care\Long called health care her No. 1 issue, declaring that she favored extending coverage by improving the Affordable Care Act and defending it from court challenges, as well as adding a public option that would allow American to choose between employer-provided insurance or a government plan.\“I don't think the Affordable Care Act goes far enough,” she added. “I'm strongly in favor of a public option.”\She also criticized Herrera Beutler for taking donations from pharmaceutical companies and accused her and the Republican Party at large of seeking to eliminate protections for patients with pre-existing conditions — a claim that Herrera Beutler denied, declaring that she pushed for legislation to maintain protections regardless of what happens to the Affordable Care Act.\Herrera Beutler also said she had fought to bring down drug prices, and said she had been attacked by the pharmaceutical industry for doing so.\She also repeatedly sought to cast Long as a supporter of Medicare for All, meaning a fully government-run health care system rather than just a public option. Long disputed that characterization, arguing that she only supports a public option and stating at various times that Herrera Beutler was either lying or cherry-picking old comments.\Anthony Macuk: 360-735-4547; anthony.macuk@columbian.com; twitter.com/anthonymacuk \CREDIT: Anthony Macuk The Columbian"
89,"ELECTION 2018\Initiative campaigns in Washington frequently have one side or the other that is low on funds and claims to be David fighting Goliath. Initiative 1631, which proposes that Washington place fees on carbon pollution, isn't one of them.\One side of the campaign has deep pockets, the other side even deeper. Both have shown an ability to reach into them to support or oppose a sweeping plan to fight pollution by collecting an estimated $2.3 billion by 2023, and setting up a system to spend that money for a wide range of projects.\Clean Air Clean Energy Washington, the proponents, have support from local, regional and national environmental organizations, including The Nature Conservancy, the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club. They say those projects will create good-paying jobs in the growing clean-energy sector while taking carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases out of the environment to fight global warming.\""Climate pollution is affecting real people right now,"" said Mark Vossler, a Seattle cardiologist and member of Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility, when the campaign turned in its petitions this summer.\They've raised more than $4.8 million so far, and while they spent some of that to gather the signatures needed to qualify for the ballot, Public Disclosure Commission reports show they had more than $2.2 million on hand at the start of the month and more money flowing in.\While that amount is substantial, it's dwarfed by the No on 1631 organization, which collected at least $3 million each from Phillips 66, BP and Andeavor, which was formerly Tesoro. Although the No on 1631 campaign describes itself on its website as ""a growing coalition of small business owners, farmers, community leaders, organizations and individuals,"" oil companies account for all but about $100,000 of the campaign's $11.4 million in contributions. Only about $2 million of that had been spent by the beginning of September.\The Association of Washington Business, which functions as a state Chamber of Commerce for large and small companies, also opposes the initiative.\""We share the goal of protecting the environment, but this initiative will raise the cost of energy for families and employers while offering little assurance it will result in meaningful reductions of carbon emissions,"" AWB President Kris Johnson said in a news release announcing the group's opposition.\The system proposed in I-1631 is different from other proposals to rein in carbon pollution, which have been introduced in the Legislature only to languish and die. Sponsors appear to have developed the initiative to answer some of the main concerns about those previous ideas.\The first difference is that it proposes a fee, not a tax. Although the No on 1631 campaign is more likely to call it a tax, under Washington law there's a distinction. Money raised by a tax can be used for a wide variety of government programs. Voters turned down an initiative for a carbon tax in 2016.\Faced with a court order to spend more on education, Gov. Jay Inslee proposed a carbon tax in 2017 that would use some of the money raised for public schools. It failed to get legislative support, but Inslee, who has made fighting climate change one of his signature issues, is backing I-1631.\Money raised by a fee must be used for activities related to the source of the fee. I-1631 would put the money in a Clean Up Pollution Fund, and after administrative expenses would put 70 percent into a fund for Clean Air and Energy projects, 25 percent into a fund for Clean Water and Healthy Forests projects and 5 percent into a fund for Healthy Communities projects.\State agencies would administer the projects, but a public oversight board appointed by the governor would adopt all the policies, procedures and rules, and each fund would have an investment advisory panel.\Supporters say the board would be made up of a wide range of people in science, business, health and community organizations to come up with the best projects. Opponents say the board would be made up of unelected appointees not answerable to voters.\The initiative also exempts certain businesses and fuels. It exempts the state's only coal-fired power plant, TransAlta in Centralia, which is scheduled to shut down by 2025, and electricity from the Colstrip power plant in Montana, which is also set to shut down by the end of that year and provides some power for Washington utilities. It exempts pulp mills, some metal and chemical companies and aircraft manufacturers. While that could blunt opposition from some large employers, the No on 1631 campaign contends it's unfair and doesn't make sense.\The fees would fall mostly on gasoline and other motor fuels sold in Washington, and electricity that utilities generate with fossil fuels, although the companies could get credit for investing in approved clean energy investments. The fee would start at $15 per metric ton of carbon content in 2020, and rise at least $2 a year until certain targets in state law for reducing greenhouse gases are met, and then would be adjusted only for inflation.\Opponents say the oil companies and utilities will pass those costs on to their customers, raising monthly electric bills and the price of gasoline at the pump in a state that already has some of the highest gas taxes in the country.\If the oil companies really thought they could pass all the costs to consumers, they wouldn't be spending so much money to fight the initiative, said Jacob Johns, an Eastern Washington field organizer for the campaign. The price of gas at the pump already varies widely from month to month, and the added costs for the carbon fee will be within that range, he added.\Contact the writer:\(509) 879-7461\jimc@spokesman.com\CREDIT: Jim Camden The Spokesman-Review"

Of course, there has been scant proof of any of the accusations against Russian President Vladimir Putin contained in the cartoon, even though it's widely thought to be true. Less proof, actually, than the data supporting climate change (data ExxonMobil gathered and substantiated years ago), which Ramirez continually rails against.\Could it be Ramirez has finally shown his true colors - those of a corporate stooge, a syndicated mouthpiece who reaches millions of biased ears? After all, his cartoons are printed in Investor's Business Daily, which sees Republican candidate Donald Trump for what he truly is: a guaranteed vote for the Democratic presidential nominee.\That could spell the beginning of the end for corporate welfare at the cost of quotidian taxpayers, which means his wallet takes a hit? Just gleefully curious.\STEVE LACOMBE\SPOKANE VALLEY\OIL SPILL HEADLINE MISLEADING\I was dismayed to see your Dec. 19 headline ""Oil spill risk rated low.""\Headlines are powerful things. Folks might merely read the headline and their takeaway would be that the chance of an oil spill or derailment here in Washington is low, even though the body of the article goes on to explain that there is plenty of credible disagreement about it. The Spokesman-Review's headline was irresponsible, especially in light of the struggle to inform the public of the very real dangers involved in our use of fossil fuels.\I urge your readers to attend the public meeting being held by the Washington Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council in Spokane on Jan. 14, 5 p.m., at the Centerplace Regional Event Center in Spokane Valley, so members can hear testimony from us, the public, about our objection to a plan to build a crude oil facility on the West Side. This facility would result in a great increase of train traffic through our area, with innumerable negative effects on our environment and our way of life.\Our many voices can make a difference, so please come and add yours.\JENNIFER CALVERT\SPOKANE VALLEY\MASS SHOOTINGS A CONCERN\I have read the Congressional Research Service (CRS) report ""Mass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013"" referenced by Tom Stanton in his Dec. 27 letter to the editor, and found he cherry-picked and marginalized the information presented in the study to support his opinion.\Of the 66 mass public shootings (greater than four deaths) between 1999-2013 that resulted in 446 deaths, 27.3 percent were committed using assault-type weapons. Stanton's statement that mass shootings are rare ignores the CRS study that reported 317 mass shootings that resulted in 1,554 deaths, and an average of 21 mass shooting incidents per year for the study period; almost two per month.\Regarding the trend in mass shootings, the CRS study reported that the mass public shooting murder victim rate per 10 million of population has trended upward for the 1999-2013 reporting period. I am a gun owner and welcome discussion on gun-related violence. Opinion and thought should be presented and discussed based on all the information that is available.\DON NICHOLS\SPOKANE\SPEED CAUSES ACCIDENTS\Regarding the Dec. 30 story ""Senator pushes road fixes"": Well-meaning state and local leaders are asking for more money to improve the two routes to Washington State University in Pullman for ""making if safer for our kids to drive our highways."" Bull roar.\Yes, four lanes are safer than two lanes, but it's not the roads that kill our WSU students (and others). It is speed, going too fast. Passing unsafely. Speed. If our students (and others) would just slow down, there would be way less of a problem.\Our students, our brightest and best, do not realize this? So, so sad, and most tragic accidents are so, so avoidable.\DONNA POTTER PHILLIPS\SPOKANE\POSITIVE IMMIGRANT STORY\I just read the article about Ghulam Ghaznawi, an immigrant from Afghanistan who helped at the Christmas Bureau by providing translator services. He acted as a translator for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2008 to 2014, which led to death threats against him and the murder of his brother. He and his family (most likely Muslims) came to the United States for safety. He says he loves the U.S. and has not seen any discrimination. ""I'm part of the U.S. now, and a resident here.""\I sincerely hope that he and his family do not experience discrimination. I also hope that some of Donald Trump's supporters read this article and were shamed to realize that, if Trump had his way, this family would not have been able to come here for safety, and this brave man who helped our military might well be dead now.\MARIAN ORTIZ\COLBERT\MARKET-BASED SOLUTION\Joseph R. Mason's vision for America's full energy potential (Dec. 27) included only fossil fuels extracted from our national lands and waters. He predicted more jobs and growth, but his simplistic analysis ignored most costs. What are the costs to the environment and tourism when a mountaintop is removed to extract coal? Who pays when offshore oil rigs explode? How much are losses to homes damaged by earthquakes from fracking? His report included none of these.\Mason also ignored costs from pollution and greenhouse gases when fossil fuels are burned, such as costs from flooding more of Miami with rising sea levels. What about costs from Defense Department projections of higher national security threats? What are losses from bigger forest fires? What will costs be to local ski resorts, which are already buying more snow-making equipment (Dec. 20)?\There is a better, more comprehensive solution: a carbon tax. Regional Economic Models and Synapse Energy Economics analyzed a revenue-neutral, fee and dividend carbon tax. It would increase economic growth, jobs and renewable energy, while reducing pollution, premature deaths and greenhouse gasses. Learn more from Citizens' Climate Lobby about this market-based solution, which even Mason promoted (2009).\VIRGINIA LOHR\PULLMAN\SAFETY-FREE ZONES\Regarding the Nov. 7 ""Shoot straight on guns"" letter by Doug Floyd: It appears that Floyd does not have an accurate understanding of a mass shooting and armed person scene.\Most mass shootings have been at a location that was designated a ""gun free zone."" In these situations, the perpetrators were free to carry out the killing mayhem without any opposition. If there had been any armed persons present, whether citizens or employees, the attackers would have changed their minds.\Most likely, the armed persons would not even have had to shoot, since just the presence of defensive persons with firearms is enough to deter any attackers. Mass shooters are definitely crazy and evil, but not stupid.\However, what is crazy, evil and stupid is to set up killing scenes by posting signs designating such locations as gun-free zones.\BILL HAVERCROFT\SPOKANE"

92,"Remember, this is what we wanted.\Well, maybe not you. And maybe not me. And maybe not your neighbors or friends or co-workers. But some people wanted it, and there were enough of them to make Donald Trump the president. So when you ponder Trump's dismantling of the Environmental Protection Agency, keep in mind that somebody somewhere is happy about this.A report by The Oregonian/OregonLive last week detailed some of Trump's budget proposals for the EPA. You know, stuff like reducing funding for restoration work on Puget Sound from $28 million to $2 million. Or slashing funding for fighting water pollution on the Great Lakes from $300 million to $10 million. Or eliminating money for the testing of water quality on the nation's beaches, which is kind of meaningful in this part of the country but might not play well in, say, Nebraska.All of this should come as no surprise, considering that Trump's EPA administrator would just as soon gas the entire agency and just be done with it. Or considering that part of the EPA staff is Clark County's own noted environmental expert, Don Benton. In case you aren't familiar with Benton, that was sarcasm.But while Trump's scorched-earth approach to the environment is exactly what his supporters wanted, it leads to head-shaking disbelief about what in the world has happened to the Republican Party.You see, it was a Republican, Richard Nixon, who signed the Environmental Protection Agency into existence. It was Nixon who approved a bill to ""create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony."" Today, that would lead the true believers to call him a RINO; in 1970, it generated bipartisan support because even members of Congress realized that emissions belching from smokestacks might not be all that healthy for residents and local wildlife.\A conservative approach\This dichotomy between then and now is particularly interesting in the wake of a recent guest editorial in the Wall Street Journal. George Schultz and James Baker, writing on behalf of the new Climate Leadership Council, put forth a conservative approach to dealing with climate change.Considering that Schultz and Baker both served as secretary of state under Republican presidents, they have pretty good conservative credentials. But writing that a carbon tax upon polluting industries would be preferable to cumbersome regulations - and claiming that a tax ""would free companies to find the most efficient way to reduce their carbon footprint"" - just might get them kicked out of the club. Heck, simply postulating that climate change might be a real issue is enough to get their membership cards revoked.Schultz and Baker both served under Ronald Reagan, and they note that Reagan played a leading role in the Montreal Protocol to help protect the ozone layer. But that was then. Now, even Reagan's conservative credentials would be called into question.Sure, we can argue all we want about climate change - and we have. Meanwhile, Antarctica hit 63 degrees this week. That's a record, in case you were wondering.So, while we ponder whether or not climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese, it is instructive to remember that somebody somewhere is happy to have the EPA drawn and quartered by the new administration. Reports say that Trump hopes to slash 3,000 jobs from the agency and cut its budget by $2 billion. Who needs clean air and clean water when we can boost a military budget that already is larger than the next seven countries combined?All of this represents the typical wrangling that goes on in Washington, the push and pull between competing agendas. And the fact is that those who win the elections set the agendas and their supporters get to be happy about it.In the end, despite the apoplectic reaction from opponents, it will all work out. The sky will not fall with Donald Trump as president; it will just be a little dirtier.\Credit: GREG JAYNE"
93,"COUNCIL FIRED STELLAR MANAGER\After a lot of testimony by citizens, including former mayors of Spokane Valley, regarding Mike Jackson's honesty, integrity and commitment to Spokane Valley citizens, four very ambitious, like-minded council members voted to fire an honest and effective city manager.\The City Council makes city policy, period. Perhaps their lust for empowerment over hiring and firing of city staff and influencing city contracts led them toward replacing this well-respected city manager with a ""puppet"" manager they could control.\This firing process was not a normal three-touch system, where public comment is heard twice before the council, and then the council makes a decision. Hanging a notice on the front door, sending select emails and starting the council meeting 15 minutes early doesn't constitute being forthright. Perhaps they place themselves above previous processes, even above accountability to the citizens.\Since November, these four council members have melded into, what I consider, an organized ""gang of four."" Having the majority vote, they still bully or intimidate council members who oppose their view or request additional information.\It's concerning to me that if Mike Jackson's honesty and integrity doesn't fit into their ""new direction"" for our city, what sort of city are they proposing?\JAMES POLLARD\SPOKANE VALLEY\DREAM OR NIGHTMARE?\I woke up recently at about 3 a.m. from a dream. President Obama had just appointed (not nominated) a new U.S. Supreme Court justice using his executive powers to bypass the Senate.\Thank goodness it was just a nightmare ... or was it?\ROY CALDWELL\SPOKANE VALLEY\FILL THE MEDICAID GAP \Almost all our Idaho legislators are for the economic and personal health benefits for Idaho citizens by filling the Medicaid gap. This will be proven when they pass it next year.\It is only because all those who vote against filling the gap or fail to push to bring it to vote have no courage to be a statesman that it is not being passed this year. Those Republicans who vote no or do not push for filling the Medicaid gap fear, as they have in the past, primary competition.\Next year's vote will show those legislators who didn't have the courage to be a statesman.\My belief in the economic and health benefits of filling the gap to Idaho citizens has been publicly known since this issue arose.\Gentlemen and ladies, enough is enough. Be a statesperson. You owe it to yourself and to the citizens of Idaho.\ERIC K. PETERSON\REPUBLICAN PRECINCT COMMITTEE MEMBER LEWISTON\QUICK RESPONSE DETERS\I would like to thank the city officials for their timely and decisive response to the attempted intimidation of North Indian Trail residents. I emailed copies to City Council President Ben Stuckart and our two council representatives after our meeting, and received responses in 15 minutes and 55 minutes.\I emailed copies to Jonathan Mallahan, director of neighborhood and business services, Heather Trautman, director of the Office of Neighborhood Services and Code Enforcement at 7:40 a.m. the next day. Heather responded at 8:09 a.m. All replies said action would be undertaken immediately By early that afternoon, a conference call with both developers, our neighborhood council chair, Stuckart and city staff led to the issuance of a press release in which all parties condemned the letter and called for ""thoughtful discussion and civil discourse.""\I think that this response was an outstanding example of a prompt and very appropriate way to handle such an incident. It should be a deterrent to future attempts at intimidation. If any should occur, the citizens will know that promptly bringing it to the attention of the city will bring results.\JIM BAKKE\SPOKANE\WHAT'S WRONG WITH TRANSPARENCY?\So, Tom Keefe disapproves of Spokane City Council President Ben Stuckart's wanting full cooperation with the investigation into Mayor David Condon's handling of sexual harassment in his police department.\That Keefe, a friend and supporter of Condon, would ""bristle"" at Stuckart's advocacy for openness over silence, and for honesty over deception isn't surprising. It's laughable that he thinks the rest of us agree with him. As a ""taxpaying citizen of Spokane,"" I agree with Stuckart's attempts to pierce the veil of silence and intimidation shrouding City Hall.\In a classic case of ""gaslighting"" - distorting reality - Keefe quotes Stuckart out of context in attempt to villainize him. Keefe omitted these sentences: ""Council is very committed to getting to the bottom of everything and making it as transparent as we can make it. Trust is the most important thing at this time."" (The Spokesman-Review, Tuesday, Feb. 9) What, exactly, is wrong with this? The pursuit of justice is not something to ""bristle"" at. Contrary to Keefe's assertions, truth-telling is a quality Spokane citizens want in our elected officials. We should thank Ben for standing up and demanding transparency and honest, open leadership from our mayor.\ANNIE SZOTKOWSKI\SPOKANE\CARBON TAX IS NEEDED\It's imperative that the Washington Legislature takes action on Initiative 732, a revenue neutral carbon tax that will move us away from dirty fossil fuels and toward a cleaner, healthier world. This measure will balance increasing fossil fuel costs with a reduction in the sales tax so that most Washington families will actually benefit financially, while we begin to tackle climate change's dangerous impacts on our environment.\If we don't start moving away from fossil fuels, the end results are clear and unambiguous. Our air will get dirtier, our rivers will go dry and our health will deteriorate. If you look around our community, you will see that it is already beginning to happen. Last year's record wildfires, hottest temperatures and lowest snowpack will become the new normal.\We owe it to our grandchildren to make a clear statement that it's time to move beyond fossil fuels and power the planet with energy sources that don't destroy the environment. Call your legislators today and tell them to do the right thing. Pass I-732 and accelerate the switch to affordable, clean energy sources that keep our lights on and our money in our local communities.\JOHN COVERT\SPOKANE\ADD TWO COMMISSIONERS\I support your Jan. 20 editorial supporting the legislative bill to increase the Spokane County Board of Commissioners by two members.\Since inception, Spokane County has had three commissioners. Today, as the fourth-largest county in Washington, and with a population nearing 500,000, we still have three commissioners. I believe we need more representation of our varied neighborhoods and communities within Spokane County. With three commissioners, elected by the entire county, I don't believe this representation can happen.\I voted against the measure last fall to add two commissioners because it did not improve our representation. The reason this legislation is so much better is that the commissioners would be elected by districts instead of being elected countywide.\In addition, the provision for drawing district lines by a bipartisan committee is more fair than having those commissioners who are running for office draw the lines.\This is exactly the updated government I've been waiting for and that Spokane County needs.\TOM BRATTEBO\LIBERTY LAKE\BUNDY BUNCH SIMPLY LAWLESS\Anarchy is often referred to as a far-left ideology of a society or group of people who reject authority - the curtailment or abolition of established government. Force without freedom and established law would be barbarism. It is similar to the way that animals live in the wild, with everyone looking out for themselves ""might makes right.""\People should be allowed to live and freely associate, without being subject to any nation or governmental rules or regulations. This system of governance does not currently exist, in the United States or any other country and for many good reasons, i.e., health and safety of the governed.\The Sovereign Citizen Movement in this country, coupled with Cliven Bundy and the Bundy Bunch, buy this as their path to salvation. A local Stevens County theocracy, founded on Dominionism (""blacks were far better off when they were owned by others"") and Barbarism ... it just doesn't make sense to me. But then their mindset is more than acceptable to the notion and premise that federal laws do not apply to them.\The Bundy Not So Wild Bunch has found reason to believe that they are above the law.\As their hoofs might perhaps cool behind bars, they might consider that those who they have blindly followed are only in this for the bucks, public control over federal land that they do not own, and very temporary headlines.\JAMES PERKINS\UPPER COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS COALITION COLVILLE\NURSE PRACTITIONERS CAN FILL GAP\Thank you for your Feb. 16 editorial on staffing shortages in mental health. As you described, Washington is in the midst of a mental health care crisis, but at least one solution is readily available.\There are 601 licensed psychiatric/mental health nurse practitioners in Washington. These are trained graduate and doctoral level specialists who evaluate, diagnose and treat psychiatric illness through a variety of therapeutic interventions parallel to those provided by psychiatrists. These independent nurse practitioners provide commensurate services to other state and federal agencies; however, we are currently excluded from state hospital facilities.\The Association of Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurses, the Washington State Nurses Association and ARNPs United of Washington State are working with the governor's office to amend Department of Social and Health Services policies. We advocate for an inclusive solution, removing barriers impeding our ability to practice at Western and Eastern state hospitals.\We hope that these efforts will lead to conversion of current vacancies to ARNP positions in an effort to provide quality and timely care to our communities.\ANNE KOOMEN\PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF ADVANCED PRACTICE PSYCHIATRIC NURSES\NANCY LAWTON\PRESIDENT, ADVANCED REGISTERED NURSE PRACTITIONERS UNITED OF WASHINGTON STATE\AVISTA REQUEST IS GREEDY\Regarding the Avista rate increase: The rub here is that Avista impacts every consumer, liberal or conservative, without any representation to support the consumer.\The state regulators are a bad joke, approving more than 10 rate hike ""requests"" in the past 10 years, according to KREM 2 News. Profit is good, and I believe in capitalism, but I don't readily support monopolies that take advantage of the necessities of life in a modern world.\Avista apparently never plans for any adverse contingency. Any weather that is outside the norm is an act of God that requires more money from its customers to keep its stockholders happy. Kind of reminds me of the European fiefdoms, and we're the serfs. This is an act that places the needs, actually wants, of the stockholders well above the needs of the people who provide the profits for those stockholders.\That's not very good business. That's pure greed. Avista should be a PUD (public utilities district).\DAVID BRAY\SPOKANE\SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CHIP IN\I read that Avista plans to request a rate hike, in part, because of the costs associated with repairing the damage from the Nov. 17 windstorm. I did not read in the article that the shareholders were going to take a hit.\As a regulated utility, I understand that profits are limited. However, as a private corporation with a monopoly on a critical utility (electricity), I assume that shareholders still assume a risk, and their profits are not guaranteed at the expense of the captive customers who suffer when their electricity is cut off by storm damage.\It seems fair that shareholders should shoulder part of the costs. If shareholders want a guaranteed dividend, they should put their money in a federally insured bank.\DONALD BARDEN\SPOKANE"

Shelly Short, and local county officials have decided that a polluting coal- and wood-fired silicon smelter is just the thing for Newport and the surrounding area.\Annual toxic smelter emissions will include 320,000 tons of carbon dioxide, 1,400 tons of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (acid rain), 111 tons of particulate matter (silicon dust and other particulates), plus other emissions. The carbon footprint will be tremendous.\Citizen health, the environment, and the recreation attributes of this area (hunting, fishing, camping, etc.) will be laid to ruin.\The lack of transparency of government and HiTest officials is unconscionable. And what about the climate change and carbon tax initiatives being pushed by our governor? Didn't the state of Washington learn anything from the still toxic effects from the Tacoma smelter?\John M. Endres\Newport\The other side of methadone use\I'm a 64-year-old vet who is disabled and on pain management for the past 19 years. All you see on TV and the news is that we have an opioid pandemic, which is true. The people like me and others who take these medications do so to live with more quality of life.\These doctors who prescribe extreme high doses of opiates to anyone coming into their office are to blame. Now, for we who actually need them, it is becoming so hard to receive them. Have you ever woke up in the morning in so much pain that you just want to die? Well I have and it's a horrible way to live.\Be fair on this issue. Tell how this problem has caused pain and suffering to those who really need these medications. Another thing, are the methadone clinics going to stop giving drug addicts methadone? Why can a drug addict go to their local clinic and get up to 160mg of methadone daily?\Fix the real problems and stop hurting those who really need them to have any quality of life.\Michael Lee\Deer Park\More awareness for child abuse\Thank you to Shawn Vestal for writing about the sometimes monstrous failure of our communities in dealing with even obvious physical and psychological abuse of children (""Alleged abusers not only failures,"" Jan. 21).\With 911 and the state Department of Child and Family Services and citizen volunteer CASA programs and seeming public awareness of child abuse, it seems inconceivable that such a years-long (lifetime) hell as little Wyatt received from his parents could still occur. I don't see any way in which a person having been convicted of such abuse could have been reasonably deemed rehabilitated to lovingly parent the child in such a short amount of time.\This will happen again. If only there was a #Movement with zero tolerance for an adult physically battering children that injures their bodies, and committing psychological and emotional abuse that injures their souls.\Paul Unger\Spokane"
95,"Rep. Liz Pike\It felt like a gut punch — the kind that bends you over in shock and agony. A Georgia-Pacific representative called to tell me company officials decided to permanently shut down a major portion of the Camas paper and pulp mill, ending some 300 family-wage jobs. G-P will continue tissue-manufacturing operations that support 140 local jobs, but will redirect paper operations to its Louisiana mill.\I'm thankful the entire Camas operations will not close but devastated for this loss to our community. Operating since 1884, five years before Washington became a state, the Camas mill has provided a steady paycheck for thousands of workers, including some in my family. With an average hourly rate of $27, G-P has contributed more than $46 million annually to our local economy. It has also invested tens of millions of dollars to clean emissions and ensured minimal impact to our environment.Officially G-P says, “Economic impacts from the continuing decline in demand for communication papers make it necessary to discontinue operations” in Camas.Unofficially, it's not difficult to read between the lines. Employers tell me it is increasingly impossible to do business in Washington. Many feel they are under attack. Why shouldn't they? Consider this:n Come January, employers will be required to provide all workers with paid sick leave and by 2020, paid family and medical leave. Gov. Jay Inslee has ordered the Department of Ecology to implement a cap-and-trade rule strictly limiting carbon production from 68 entities, including the Camas mill, with fines of up to $10,000 per day. I'm for green energy jobs, but how do we reduce carbon if we must import those goods back to Washington from the other jobs we've chased away from our state?n Inslee wants a carbon tax against employers. Now that the Legislature is under Democratic control, many believe a new carbon tax is likely. The governor vetoed a lower tax rate for manufacturers, ending hope that those resources could be used to expand and attract manufacturing jobs in Washington. New water-quality standards are expected to cost paper mills and other factories millions of dollars to upgrade their technologies to ensure water returned to rivers, lakes and streams is cleaner than when they received it. After years of forcing Millennium Bulk Terminals to navigate a lengthy regulatory process for construction of an export terminal in Longview, DOE denied a water-quality permit based on criteria unrelated to water, killing the project. It demonstrated the bureaucratic nightmare of obtaining a permit to operate in Washington. Restrictions under the Growth Management Act have artificially reduced available land for development and excessively prolonged the permitting process, especially in the rural, economically distressed areas of Washington. My efforts to allow limited industrial development along several short-line railroads in our state (House Bill 1504) were originally met by Gov. Inslee's veto pen. It was only after we reduced the bill to Clark and Okanogan counties that the governor finally agreed to sign revised legislation (Senate Bill 5517) — and even that miniscule GMA reform was met with resistance and required intense negotiations. The Democrats' new majority in the Legislature clears the way for the possibility of a new capital gains tax, increased business and occupation taxes, and increased real estate excise taxes. They are also testing the state constitution for an income tax.Employers may be able to handle some of these individual challenges. Collectively, it's no wonder why G-P, Alcoa and other companies have charted exit strategies from Washington into business-friendly regions where they can fairly compete.G-P's mill closure in Camas is a gut-wrenching lesson in the realities of our state's economy. Either we improve our business climate or it won't be long before someone erects a sign reading, “Will the last employer leaving Washington please turn\CREDIT: Rep. Liz Pike"

Free speech applies at all times
\
Joseph Markee, (Holiday and political statements, Letters, July 8), seems to think The Columbian intentionally used the July 4 holiday for political purposes. I disagree. The Columbian simply reported the news as it occurred, including opinions about the news written expressly for the opinion pages.There is nothing wrong or evil about that, and it does not in any way dishonor our military, past or present. Markee essentially suggests that freedom of speech be avoided at a time when we specifically celebrate being a nation that allows free speech. That is much more reprehensible than a news headline one does not wish to read. I suggest Markee use his freedom each year at this time to forgo reading the paper, if he is afraid they might print something he does not want to see.My brother served in our military for more than two decades, and would defend without question The Columbians right to print the news as it has. He would say that limiting free speech is not why he enlisted. Free speech is not easy, and some will always be offended if the news is not what they want to hear. Freedom demands looking past that.Kudos to The Columbian for keeping us informed.

Time for No More Madore!
\
After reading recent front-page stories in The Columbian, Report: Madores charges false on July 7, and $100,218, on July 8, numerous questions beg to be asked.Does David Madore and his supersize ego still believe he can win re-election? Why isnt a Republican party official here locally asking Madore to gracefully withdraw his candidacy? And the bigger question is, if Madore thinks he can win re-election, does he believe he can be an effective Clark County councilor by making decisions in the best interests of all the people of this county, not just his loyal supporters? So far, hes only managed to make a name for himself and not a good one at that.I believe hes been the most ineffective Clark County commissioner/councilor to ever hold that office. In addition to that, hes cost the county about half a million dollars to pay for his mistakes and his false accusations, all while promising a bridge he cant deliver on, future tax revenue (as in next century) from a fee waiver program and by wasting time and money generating needless drama at every board meeting.Oh, did I mention the hate and discontent hes managed to spread among the staff working for Clark County?Its time for No More Madore!

Second Amendment has limits
\
The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. The scope of Supreme Court rulings regarding this issue have, over the years, been unclear and have been claimed as victories by both pro- and anti-gun advocates.As someone who has over 30 years military service and has handled everything from handguns to napalm to nukes, I can say that an AR-15-style rifle is not a defensive weapon.Any person, such as the man carrying such a weapon near Big Als bowling alley, obviously has not read all the cases which, if nothing else, say that laws may restrict the carrying of weapons in public places.Best thing would be for this person to join a well-regulated militia (i.e. the National Guard) where he can display his weapon properly and use it for what it was intended provided he is intelligent enough to pass the entrance exam.

Lead the way with carbon tax
\
Want to ease the tax burden on the poor and middle class, improve the environment, and improve the economy? We can do all three by voting yes on Initiative 732 this November. I-732 will:n Reduce the state sales tax by one full percentage point.n Fund the Working Families Rebate to provide up to $1,500 a year for 400,000 low-income working households.n Effectively eliminate the B&O business tax for manufacturers.n Institute a carbon tax of $25 per metric ton of carbon dioxide on fossil fuels consumed in the state of Washington.Fortunately, we dont have to depend on politicians for this one. We all get a chance to vote on Initiative 732 this fall. There will be no other opportunity in Washington state or for that matter in the United States to do this. Washington has a reputation for being progressive and forward looking. Voting yes on I-732 will help maintain our nationwide lead.

\
When veterans serve our country they are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. They are husbands, wives, sons, daughters, relatives, friends, neighbors, Democrats, Republicans and Independents.We need a voice in Congress to support veterans. David McDevitt, a retired member of the U.S. Army, is such a person. He is the only veteran running for the 3rd Congressional District. He will be a strong voice for this important group.Im voting for McDevitt in the upcoming Washington primary, because he will stand up for veterans. He will support improved health care, job training and services to reintegrate our veterans. Please join me in making David McDevitt our next member of Congress in Washingtons 3rd Congressional District.

I-732 is good for the state
\
Taxes are the price we pay for civilization. Unfortunately, here in Washington taxes tend to support the rich rather than the poor or middle class. We can change both this and our future by voting for Initiative 732.Tax money from fossil fuels would go not to the government but to the lower and middle class which most need it. In addition to finally getting serious about our moral obligation to take action on climate change, states with strict environmental laws (California, Washington, Oregon) do much better economically than states with poor environmental records (West Virginia, Louisiana, Alabama).Just the 1 percentage point reduction of the state sales tax will save hundreds of dollars per year for an average household in Washington. I-732 is revenue-neutral and will not give government more power or more money. This will provide more fair taxes for the poor and middle class while giving Washington citizens a healthier environment and a more competitive industrial base.I hope the reader takes time to check out the facts on I-732 for themselves at http://www.yeson732.org .

I-732 is bad for the state
\
Please vote No on Initiative 732. The carbon tax will not save the planet and it will be passed onto our utility bills and all other consumer goods.Politicians say they will save us from climate change. Historically there have been more than 50 significant climate changes within the past 4,500 years. During the 1980s, our politicians claimed we were going into another ice age. In the 1990s, they claimed the Earth was heating up to dangerous levels. Now, as we go through another cycle, they claim it's ""climate change.""Mankind has almost no effect on global climate. What affects our climate? The sun's cycles and the earth's orbit as it ""wobbles"" on its axis cause the majority of the effects now known as climate change. Greenhouse gases are mainly produced by volcanoes on land and under the sea. Decay and respiration from plants and animals are next. Mankind produces far less than 5 percent of all greenhouse gases.The supporters of the carbon tax wish to control you and take your money. They are the same people who created Obamacare, gun control, and limits to free speech through political correctness.

I-1464 halts tax cheats
\
With all due respect, The Columbian's premise on Initiative 1464 is fundamentally flawed. It assumes that people who claim to be Oregon residents shopping in Clark County actually are.For the most part, they are not. These are people living in Clark County who are still claiming to be Oregon residents (the same folks who are also cheating on their car tags) to cheat the system. I have lived in Clark County for 16 years and have been in line behind these supposed Oregon residents many, many times. Why would an Oregon resident cross the river to shop at Wal-Mart or the grocery store?Answer: They aren't Oregon residents but folks living in Washington state who are just trying to get by on the cheap. The cashiers know it. The folks who live here know it. Time to close the loophole for these folks who don't pay their fair share. Initiative 1464 won't hurt Clark County merchants. It will just get people who are pretending to be Oregon residents but who actually live in our county to pay their fair share.

In my mind, there was no question that Al Gore would win the election, so I could feel free to vote for Ralph Nader, who wouldn't be a great president but had some great ideas that needed exposure in the debates. History showed that Ralph Nader didn't get the needed percentage and Al Gore (with a little help from the Supreme Court) was defeated by George W. Bush.

The inability to take time off of work proves to be one of the largest barriers as it is tied to someone's financial well-being, paramount in the ability to establish independence.I want to create a Washington where everyone can live free of relationship violence and believe we all should vote yes on Initiative 1433!

98,"Iran takes principled stands\The recent U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord should cause the U.S. to be heavily penalized for breaking the agreement. U.S. officials have no intention of ever negotiating a fair agreement. They are using the withdrawal as a way to put a sanctions stranglehold on Iran indefinitely. It is similar to the way that Israeli officials have no intention of ever negotiating a fair agreement for Palestinians and have put a sanctions stranglehold on them.\The similarity of the Iranian and Palestinian situations smacks of underlying Jewish involvement in shaping U.S. foreign policy. It is somewhat similar to the way that the Irish once used the U.S. to fund IRA terrorism against England. Support for Israel's crimes violates U.S. sovereignty and decency.\Iran takes principled stands against Israel's crimes, and then unethical U.S. officials turn the truth upside down to claim that Iran is a sponsor of terrorism. Israel is the only nation in the world that is allowed to practice apartheid. U.S. officials should support American values. Palestinians should enjoy basic freedoms and deserve to return to their homes.\Stephen Franklin White\Vancouver\U.S. policy increases gas prices\Your $1,000 tax savings are going to the oil companies. Why have fuel prices risen so much? Look back a bit and the price per barrel was down, domestic production dropped the price and supplies were “a plenty.” OPEC decided to curtail production and — voila! — higher prices for everyone at the pump.\I see a bit past the real implications of lower supply — the price per barrel now makes it financially viable to produce domestically; fracking makes a profit if the price is about $65 a barrel. Instability in oil-producing regions adds to the price, too. U.S. foreign policy under the current administration is not helping.\Can you say $4 a gallon? Soon.\Michael Shawn Moore\Vancouver\Ask about cost of care\Please note: At urgent care, it is now wise to ask about your provider's credentials.\I recently went to urgent care, paid the $20 co-payment and saw a doctor. Unfortunately, for I generally receive good care from this local, well-known clinic, I received poor care. Thankfully, I work with surgeons who treated me properly within 24 hours.\Later, I received a bill. Upon inquiry, I was told that the provider I saw is a specialist, so I owe that amount instead of the urgent care co-pay. I did not need a specialist, was not informed of this change of billing procedure, and would have been happy to see a physician's assistant.\On one hand, $15 is a trip to Starbucks. On the other, according to my current grocery ad, $15 is enough to feed a family of four a healthy meal. I hope the family in the waiting room was not also bilked.\My insurance company calls this fraud.\Thus: upon your next visit to urgent care, ask about the actual cost. I sure will from now on.\Shawna Lamb\Vancouver\Support clean air, Initiative 1631\Initiative 1631 is the newest iteration of carbon pricing to come to the discussion around all things green and environmentally/financially responsible in our state. Unlike the recent carbon-tax proposal (SB 6203) or 2016's carbon-tax initiative (I-732), I-1631 will place more regulation on emissions as well as offset any disproportionate carbon pricing. This would allow our state to place more political investments in our resources such as our forests, water, and rural economic development.\If you're concerned about “clean air and clean energy” and would like to help continue our home state to be one of the most financially and economically educated and advanced in our nation, vote “yes” on I-1631.\Lauryn Anspach\Vancouver\Battle Ground needs new schools\Why is it that, after two tries, Battle Ground Public Schools has been unable to pass bonds? With the massive amount of houses and apartments being built in the southern end of its district, schools like Glenwood, Laurin, and Pleasant Valley are dealing with massive overcrowding. Glenwood is already 50 years old and Pleasant Valley schools are 40.\In the past two years, Laurin Middle School has added five portables to its campus, in a field off from the rest of the buildings. These portables house the fifth-graders, which brings up the question if it's safe for them to be so far away from the rest of the campus. Pleasant Valley just put a longhouse on its campus and it is already filled to capacity; next year they will still need to find space for more students.\These schools are old and highly overcrowded. Bonds need to pass so that we can build new needed schools in the southern part of the district to combat all the influx of new students.\R. Bryce Harris\Vancouver\Preserve fireworks for citizens\In 2015, Vancouver City Council decided to take away the Fourth of July's greatest hit: fireworks.\While the Independence Day Celebration at Fort Vancouver remains one of the largest fireworks shows in the nation, those in the city limits face a fine starting at $500 for the sale or use of any firework. Now, don't tell anyone, but not everyone is within the city limits.\The Fourth of July remains one of two celebrations where fireworks have been allowed. They have always been a big part of America's history of celebrating that day.\Closer attention to safety, and more supervision, will lead to a clean environment and a good time. Those steps should be taken before fireworks are completely removed.\Maso"

SUNNYSIDE - Looking over the enormous hole that will eventually become the Roza Irrigation District's new reservoir, Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday praised the project as an important step to combat climate change's impact on the region's water supply.
\
The $26 million project will allow the district to temporarily store up to 500 million gallons within the system until needed by farmers, rather than wasting water that flows unused through the canals. The irrigation district estimates the increased efficiency will save 2.7 billion gallons of water annually.
\
""We're not just sitting around waiting for climate change to bite us; we're investing in a smarter irrigation system,"" Inslee said of the project.
\
Inslee also toured the digester that converts dairy waste to energy at DeRuyter Dairy in Outlook and met with the Yakima River Basin Integrated Plan committee.
\
The visit is his fifth stop on a statewide climate tour, meeting with businesses and communities threatened by the changing climate and discussing potential solutions. Impacts of climate change range from drought to increasingly acidic ocean water, which threatens shellfish farming.
\
In the Yakima Basin, climate change could jeopardize the water supply. The mountain snowpack acts as the largest reservoir, but less snow and earlier melting are predicted. Data already show that the spring snowpack has declined 20 percent since 1950, and climate scientists predict the trend will continue, or worsen.
\
Droughts are predicted to become more frequent while the basin's water supply is already completely spoken for. The Integrated Plan, a 30-year plan for investing in water supply improvements that Inslee signed last summer, aims to help the basin adapt.
\
Members of the committee told Inslee about progress made on a variety of projects, including expanding the capacity of existing reservoirs.
\
But the governor is also pushing a policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say drive the atmospheric warming.
\
""We can't solve this with just re-regulation reservoirs alone,"" Inslee told the water committee and local leaders. ""We've got to get on top of the carbon pollution issue or the climate is going to keep changing on us.""
\
He urged them to talk about climate change when they talk about the plan's goals of protecting the region's agricultural economy and the environment.
\
""I want to work with you on educating the western side of the state about how important this is,"" Inslee said. ""We're talking major dollars, so we need major political support.""
\
Inslee might be in need of more support for the second half of his climate strategy: the policies to reduce carbon emissions.
\
So far, such a move has been unpopular. In 2008, the Legislature set a goal of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, but has not approved any measures to meet that goal.
\
Adaptation measures, such as expanding water storage capacity, might be politically easier than cutting emissions, but Inslee said Washington needs both.
\
In an interview after the meeting, he likened the state's situation to a house on fire. It's smart to put out the fire now and look for ways to prevent another in the future, Inslee said.
\
Earlier this year, Inslee created a task force of leaders from business, labor, health and environmental organizations to consider two options to cut carbon pollution: a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade system.
\
Inslee said a cap-and-trade system would create an absolute ceiling on emissions, but allow businesses that can't make reductions to buy allowances from businesses that can cut back.
\
It's a market-based solution, Inslee said, that has worked for other countries and has been effective in the United States trying to combat sulfur dioxide, the cause of acid rain.
\
A carbon tax would put a price on carbon, paid at the gas pump or on electric bills. Supporters say that with a revenue-neutral design, the state could return the money to taxpayers through cuts to sales or business taxes.
\
Both systems aim to create a financial incentive for reducing the use of fossil fuels. Inslee said his task force should make a recommendation by the end of the year, and he plans to put forward a policy in 2015.
\
He's optimistic that support is building for taking action against climate change, even if there's still debate over the details.
\
""In Yakima County, we've got pragmatic leaders willing to recognize the problem,"" Inslee said. ""We're seeing this now with our own eyes. This is not our grandchildren's problem, it's our problem.""

100,"Wayne Nelson \CEO and general manager of Clark Public Utilities \alisha jucevic/The Columbian files \Initiative 1631 likely would affect Clark Public Utilities' River Road Generating Plant in Vancouver, utility officials say\Clark Public Utilities' costs and electricity rates would increase if Washington voters approve charging a direct fee on carbon pollution to fight climate change, utility officials say.\Those are general predictions. But there's uncertainty about the specific impact of Initiative 1631, called “The Protect Washington Act,” on the utility, according to its general manager and two of its three commissioners.\One thing is certain: If approved, the initiative would affect the utility's natural gas-fired River Road Generating Plant near the Port of Vancouver and 100 other carbon emitters statewide, such as oil refineries and fuel distributors.\Initiative 1631 would charge industrial emitters that use or sell fossil fuels in the state for every metric ton of carbon emissions. The fee starts in 2020 at $15 per metric ton and increases $2 a year. It stops in 2035 if the state meets its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The fee would raise roughly $1 billion the first year.\If passed, money raised by the fee will pay for projects aimed at cutting pollution and protecting the environment, from solar power and zero-emissons vehicles to projects that store carbon and improve forest health.\The fee would cost Clark Public Utilities about $10 million the first year in added carbon costs, increasing annually to nearly $52 million through 2050, according to a memo produced for its board of directors. That's based on the fee formula and River Road's annual carbon output: 750,000 tons a year.\The carbon fee's potential impact to the utility's annual operating budget — which is now $378 million — would start at 3 percent in 2020, the first year collection would start, the memo says. For most residential ratepayers, that 3 percent — if it is passed along as a rate increase — would be about $3 a year, officials said.\In an interview Thursday, general manager Wayne Nelson stopped short of saying the carbon tax would require a rate increase. But his remarks tended to point that way.\“Whenever you ladle on another cost to the utility, that just increases the cost structure,” Nelson said. “And that just goes into the rate discussion as to whether or not we have enough money to afford or be able to pay for all the costs we incur throughout the year to provide the services we do.”\If the initiative is approved in November, the utility's commissioners would consider its impact in discussions in December 2019 for the 2020 budget, Nelson said.\“Bottom line,” he said, “if that initiative imposes an additional cost on us, we have to put that into the calculation as to what our total cost structure looks like and we budget based on all the costs we are facing … it adds pressure to the rates, it doesn't mean we have to raise rates.”\About 60 percent of the utility's electricity is purchased from Bonneville Power Administration, and most of that is from renewable sources, such as hydroelectric power. The River Road plant, which the utility built and which came online in 1997, contributes up to 40 percent of Clark Public Utilities' electrical supply. Depending on market conditions, the utility may purchase power from other sources. It also sometimes has excess electricity that it sells into the electrical grid.\A spokesman for the Yes on 1631 campaign, Nick Abraham, said Clark Public Utilities and other entities hit by the carbon tax could treat the expense as an opportunity. Abraham said the initiative provides the utility, and others that have to pay the tax, with a mechanism to spend the tax revenue on an energy conservation or renewables projects.\While that's true, Nelson said, he is concerned about what he called “the bureaucracy” the initiative would require. He said the initiative would create several boards that would consider proposals from Clark Public Utilities and others. He said there would be no assurance that the utility's desired use of tax money for a conservation or renewables project would ultimately be approved in a competitive arena for project approvals.\Neither utility staff nor its commissioners will take an official stand on the initiative. Nelson said the memo presented last week to commissioners was not intended to argue in favor or against the proposal. However, he said a resident at the commissioners' meeting contended that it was an anti-1631 statement.\Nelson says he told the resident: “If I was a proponent, I would take these numbers and tell the people who feel strongly enough about carbon that this is not a big enough rate increase. That you shouldn't be too concerned about it.”\While Clark Public Utilities will not take a position, four other public utility commissions in the state have come out opposed to the initiative, said Dana Bieber, spokeswoman for the No on 1631 campaign.\Two of the three commissioners on Clark Public Utilities' board stopped short of saying how they would vote on the initiative.\Commissioner Jim Malinowski said he generally supports carbon taxes as a policy tool, but Malinowski, who has an electrical engineering background and worked three decades at Pacific Gas & Electric in roles including manager of transmission planning, said he's not certain how he'll vote. But he had some advice for Clark County voters.\“People have to recognize the initiative will cause our rates to go up,” he said in an interview. “If you think it's important that we reduce the use of fossil fuels, and you're willing to pay the price, then you should vote for it. If you think the rates aren't justified, you should vote against it.”\Commissioner Jane Van Dyke said in an email, “Clean air, clean water, and clean energy are important for everyone.” Van Dyke's statement also noted the potential cost to ratepayers.\Commissioner Nancy Barnes could not be reached Thursday.\Allan Brettman: 360-735-4699; allan.br\CREDIT: Allan Brettman Columbian staff writer"

McEntire won 33.6 percent.\Ballots for the election will be mailed out Oct. 19. They will need to be postmarked or dropped off at one of several ballot drop boxes in the county by 8 p.m. Nov. 6. Voters in the 15th Legislative District will also decide the outcome of a race for the district's Position 2 House seat, and a race for the district's single state Senate seat.\For this race, the Yakima Herald-Republic asked each candidate for their positions on issues that will likely arise in the next legislative session.\In light of higher teacher salaries and less local funding, what else needs to be done with the McCleary ruling?\Chandler: The challenge is that you have a different fiscal year for school districts and local governments than you do for the state. That creates a little bit of a gap in cash flow that we have to make sure we work through. It's important for us to be able to demonstrate that the money that goes away in local levies - that is, the local levy dollars that were previously used to fund basic education - will be replaced from the increase in the state property tax. That transition is awkward partly because of the different fiscal years, and partly because the differences among the 295 school districts in the state. We anticipated that in adopting the current budget, and it will take the next two budgets to really make sure that we have addressed all of the issues for all of the different school districts.\McEntire: We need to pay attention to the fact that we need more counselors in schools. We need to pay attention to class size as well. I'm also for universal higher education - if the kid can pass the entrance exam, they should get into the college or vocational school of their choice. McCleary was a good start, but we need to do more for the public education of our kids. There is nothing better that we can invest in than the education of our kids. Children need access to mental health professionals when appropriate, and I don't think teachers should be responsible for buying school supplies.\If voters turn down the carbon tax initiative, what should be the Legislature's next step? What if voters approve it?\Chandler: If they turn it down, I think that will be the last step. When the voters reject the carbon tax, which they've done repeatedly in various research surveys, I think we have to move on. The voters have the right to approve it, but I don't believe they will.\McEntire: I was trained in science and I definitely believe in the importance of protecting our environment. If it gets turned down, then, at least in our local area, we need to encourage recycling. We should make it easier to recycle and encourage recycling, at least. If we approve the initiative, then we need to see its effect. This is an exciting moment in that Washington state could be showing the way for others to move forward. But, if enacted, we need to be careful and analyze the effect of this law. I think the effect will be positive, and that it will help our state and area prosper.\Should the Legislature comply with the state's Public Records Act? Will you support recommendations coming out of the Public Records Task Force?\Chandler: It depends on who you're talking to as to what the public disclosure act is saying. I believe, first of all, that the Legislature failed to - in good faith - follow the standard legislative process in deliberating it last year. I believe it needs to be done thoughtfully and has to take into consideration the interests of our constituents. I don't know what the task force is coming up with, I don't think they've concluded their work. But that will certainly be the starting point for doing that work. I think there is public disclosure, it's not enough to satisfy everybody. Everybody wants to know something that nobody else knows, but we're going to do the best we can without compromising the interests of our constituents.\McEntire: Definitely. The legislators work for the people. We are their employees. When doing the people's business, we need to be as transparent and open as we can. If the recommendations coming out of the task force are for increased transparency, I would support them.\What can be done to reduce polarization and improve bipartisanship in the Legislature?\Chandler: There are times when both the Senate and the House are polarized, but overall I think it's been a lot less so than the way it's depicted. I think the differences aren't so much partisan as they are demographic. People in certain urban and metropolitan communities have become isolated from both the quality and nature of life in the rest of the state.\McEntire: We need to elect people who have lived the life of the majority of people in our area. We need working class people: Those who have worried about having to pay mortgages and worried about saving money to buy Christmas gifts for their children. People coming from that background understand what needs to be done and are willing to work beyond labels. If you don't have the background of the common man, I think you're less likely to be willing to compromise and do what we have to do to protect our future.\What can you do to respect gun rights while limiting gun violence? Do you favor regulating sales of ammunition or banning large-capacity magazines?\Chandler: I have not seen a proposal up to now that would improve safety or restrict people's right to own a firearm. I haven't seen any proposal that would justify compromising the constitutional rights of my constituents. I do not support regulating sales of ammunition or banning large-capacity magazines.\McEntire: We need universal gun registration, at least. I believe Second Amendment rights need some protection, but universal registration, a ban on bump stocks and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21 seem to be rather reasonable measures to me. Regulating sales of ammunition and banning large-capacity magazines are marginal issues. I'd rather pay more attention to things that affect the people here in the Yakima area.\Chandler\McEntire\CREDIT: alec regimbal"
102,"The Legislature fulfilled its obligation under the McCleary ruling on the funding of public education. But in light of higher teacher salaries and less local funding, what else needs to be done?\Corry: We threw more money at public education without providing clear intentions. Teachers felt money was allocated for salary increases. But district administrations didn't necessarily have the same viewpoint.\One of my goals is to provide a road map to funding that's clear and consistent so you can budget and forecast on it.\I also disagree with capping local levy rates. It ties the hands of school districts. If you're a district that wants to expand additional technical courses or whatever, you should be allowed to do that if voters are willing to support you.\We have a lot of work to do to make sure the funding is fair for everyone.\Bentley: Unless we can figure out a way to give more funding to the schools to cover the teacher salary increases that will continue, we need to lift the levy cap so local communities can choose to fund their schools again.\We also need to look at regionalization bonuses, especially in districts such as West Valley that borders Yakima.\Then we need to make sure we're funding education equitably. It's always been funded equally, but we need to make sure schools that need the most help get the most help so kids are starting out and graduating at the same level as every other student.\The best way to determine that is based on the poverty level of the kids and families attending the school because it shows parents don't have the same time and resources as families in other school districts.\If voters turn down the carbon tax initiative, what should be the Legislature's next step?\Corry: I hope voters turn down the initiative because it's a money grab that hurts families and doesn't do anything to change the environment.\I don't see raising prices on gas as a means to help climate change. People out here drive cars, not just for fun, but because we need to get to work. We're not in an urban setting where you can have mass transit like you can on parts of the west side.\We should look at incentives. You've seen some examples with solar or car incentives. We have to make sure the money you're investing is a long-term solution, not a short-term gain. But my biggest concern at the end of the day is making sure families have more money in their pocket.\Bentley: If it doesn't pass, we need to keep moving ahead with the goal of Washington state trying to be a climate leader. We still want the same outcomes as the initiative - reduce carbon emissions and change our economy from carbon-based to clean energy-based.\Even if it doesn't pass, I say we keep going in that direction. But I wouldn't say, ""Let's do a carbon tax."" There are so many other things we can do.\Should the Legislature comply with the state's Public Records Act?\Corry: Yes. But I want to do so in a way that protects the interests of our constituents and protects their privacy. I don't want there to be a chilling effect for them being able to come forward and work with us.\So as long as there are measures in place to protect that and it doesn't become an administrative nightmare where we're going to have ballooning costs to comply, I'm all in favor of it.\I'm an open person when it comes to government meetings, whether they're negotiations or whatnot, they should be open. We're using taxpayer dollars.\Bentley: Yes. There's already protections in the public records act to protect people's privacy. So using that excuse is ridiculous.\I'm running to be an open representative. So transparency is important to me in my office but also what we're doing - policy making, decision making, who we're talking to. That should all be open to public record.\What can be done to reduce polarization and improve bipartisanship in the Legislature?\Corry: I think there's a lot more bipartisanship that goes on than you hear about. I've seen a great example from our current state representatives and I plan on continuing that.\You can reach across the aisle and still protect your principles and values. It's about finding what's common ground for Washingtonians on both sides.\Not everyone is going to get everything they want. I also realize as conservatives, we're the minority party in the House. But we want to be part of the conversations.\If both sides won and lost some, it's probably the best outcome.\Bentley: I haven't really heard there's much polarization in the state Legislature. I've heard them say the opposite - what's happening federally isn't here.\But I'm running for collaboration with people, industry and between representatives. To do that, there needs to be more face-to-face communication and connections on a personal level.\As a Democrat, I'll also be a member of the majority caucus. I'll be in those meetings and be able to lobby and bring money back to our district - those investments that we need. I want to work with everyone and make sure rural Washington has a voice.\What can you do to respect gun rights while limiting gun violence?\Corry: If we want to eliminate gun violence, I say we focus on properly enforcing the laws we have on the books. I don't think we're doing a good job of that.\I hate starting task forces, but you're probably looking at starting one to review how those laws are enforced. We have plenty of laws and restrictions, both state and federal, that haven't been challenged and not shown to violate the Constitution. So we need to go through everything and see where we're at.\Bentley: Any legal, responsible adult should still be able to access guns. But there need to be some common-sense steps that a majority of our district can agree on.\One of those steps would be to change how assault rifles are classified.\Handguns are classified higher then hunting rifles, which includes assault rifles, meaning there are more background checks for handguns - thereby increasing the waiting period - and you can only purchase them if you're 21 or older.\So, we just need to move assault rifles from hunting rifles to more lethal weapons like handguns.\It's not creating more laws, it's just putting the gun in the right category.\We also need to look at suicides and accidents. There are mixed opinions on this but I want to study possible incentives for secure storage.\We have limitations on many rights for public safety reasons. And these are small steps we can take to improve public safety.\Inside\Details on the candidates, Page 6A\Note: Liz Hallock, candidate for Position 1, declined to be interviewed by the Yakima Herald-Republic.\Chris Corry\* Age: 35\* Party: Republican\* Occupation: Commercial insurance adviser\* Education: B.A. in political science from University of Washington\* Previously held office and volunteer work: Crime Stoppers board member; Yakima Southwest Rotary board member; Fostering Washington volunteer\* Website: https://www.chriscorry.com\Sasha Bentley\* Age: 30\* Party: Democrat\* Occupation: Law consultant; runs the nonprofit Klickitat Advocacy; owns Gently Games LLC, a company that created a card game teaching adults and children about government and politics\* Education: B.A. in political science from the University of Washington\* Previously held office and volunteer work: Leadership team of the Columbia Gorge Women's Action Network; chair of the Klickitat County Democrats in 2017; co-organized and volunteered at ""Connect to a Cause Fair"" in 2017\* Campaign website: www.sashaforstate.com\Corry\Bentley"
103,"
Yakima Republican Curtis King will take sole chairmanship of the Senate Transportation Committee in the 2015 Legislature, where he will preside over controversial proposals on funding transportation projects that have eluded compromise in recent years.
\
Whether he'll be able to use his new muscle to push Yakima Valley projects, such as the expansion of Interstate 82 into six lanes or a new interchange to enhance development of the old Boise Cascade mill site, remains to be seen.
\
But King said Friday he's generally ""optimistic"" about being in a position to benefit his district. Both projects have been on a wish list for several years.
\
King will lead without co-chairwoman Tracey Eide, D-Federal Way, who did not run for re-election.
\
Funding high-priority transportation projects promises to be just one flashpoint in what is expected to be a long and contentious session between the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-majority House.
\
King was named by Senate majority lawmakers who met earlier this week. They also renamed Sen. Jim Honeyford, R-Sunnyside, vice chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which keeps him in charge of developing the Senate's capital budget proposal. Honeyford has been instrumental in securing funding for the Yakima Basin Integrated Water Resources Plan.
\
Republicans now hold a 25-seat majority in the Senate but still operate under the flag of the Majority Coalition Caucus as one conservative Democrat, Tim Sheldon, continues to caucus with them.
\
""I think the caucus felt in some respects having two chairs worked very well, and in other respects it didn't,"" King said in an interview Friday. ""This year we decided to just do what's normal and have our members be the chairs.""
\
In addition to writing the state transportation budget for the next two years, the committee will have to address elements of a proposed carbon fuel reduction plan from Gov. Jay Inslee. The specifics of Inslee's plan are yet to be unveiled, but could include a carbon tax on fuel or caps on carbon emissions.
\
King said he believes such a proposal will put undo stress on consumers by raising the price of fuel. He said he believes the Legislature can approve other policies that both protect the environment and pay for transportation costs, but he didn't offer specifics.
\
He also could play a prominent role in the unresolved debate over a transportation revenue package first proposed by Inslee in 2013. State officials estimate another $10 billion is needed just to support the state's current transportation systems and fund maintenance to roads and bridges, and an increase in the gas tax remains one of the most prominent and controversial elements of that plan.
\
King has opposed a tax increase without first implementing reforms on the oversight of construction costs and the allocation of tolling funds. Some apply specifically to transportation in the state, including stormwater mitigation from runoff on highways and the contracting process for purchasing new ferries.
\
Others would affect permitting, hiring and spending practices of numerous agencies.
\
Meanwhile, the Legislature is under pressure from the state Supreme Court to dedicate billions more to funding public education, which some observers have said could derail discussions of a transportation revenue package altogether.
\
Honeyford, who will oversee the construction budget that lawmakers like to tap for local projects, said he will keep a close eye on public dollars.
\
""I feel strongly that taxpayers expect us to make sure that the monies we use for these projects are well spent and spent in the manner they were intended,"" Honeyford said in a statement.
\
Honeyford will also serve on Senate committees for Agriculture, Water and Rural Economic Development; Energy, Environment and Telecommunications; and Rules. King also serves on the Commerce and Labor Committee.
\
The 2015 legislative session begins Jan. 12 and is scheduled to last 105 days. However, it can be extended if the governor calls a special session, which has been common in recent years.

104,"Originally published Nov. 21\On Nov. 17, one day after the House passed its tax plan, U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, sent out a constituent email asking for donations to “help make our voices heard.” Meanwhile, her constituents used the vote as an opportunity to criticize her.\The email said “we are one step closer to lowering the tax burden on the Southwest Washington so that you can keep more of your paycheck.” (Emphasis Herrera Beutler's).\The Southwest Washington representative asked for $10 so they could tell the Senate to act on this bill.\Using legislation or a recent event to solicit donations isn't that uncommon, but it's possible Herrera Beutler's plea fell on deaf ears.\Comments on both The Columbian's website and Herrera Beutler's Facebook page show many 3rd District voters are displeased their representative not only voted for the tax bill, but was outspoken in her support of the legislation that will increase taxes in the long-term for most local residents.\“You forgot the part about kicking 13 million off health insurance. You know, like what you relied on to take care of YOUR family when needed. Others will now go without. Sleep well knowing that,” Chris Prothero commented.\“CBO score says that I will pay more tax and have fewer deductions. You should be ashamed of yourself for your vote. I hope you replaced by a compassionate, caring, and informed Dem in the 2018 mid-terms. I hope that you can sleep at night after the hardships you voted to impose on your middle- and lower-class folks that you represent. You should be ashamed of yourself and your fellow Repugnants,” Patti Erickson Walker commented.\Many used the opportunity to state their intention (and excitement) to look elsewhere when Herrera Beutler faces re-election in 2018.\“I can't wait until we proudly vote her out of office. She just voted to screw over her constituents #notmyrepresentative,” Tiffany VanNatta Mendez commented.\There are already four Democrats who have announced their intent to challenge Herrera Beutler next year. Given the feedback to this vote, tax cuts are almost certainly going to be a top campaign issue.\— Katy Sword\Rep. Pike, Sen. Rivers differ on what led to job losses at mill\Originally published Nov. 22:\On Nov. 14, the Georgia-Pacific paper mill in Camas announced it will shed up to 300 jobs.\Two state legislators who represent the area gave two differing statements regarding the news.\On Nov. 15, state Rep. Liz Pike, a Camas Republican who is running for Clark County council chair, issued a statement lamenting the mill's closure, which has been central to the town's economy and identity.\Company spokeswoman Kristi Ward told The Columbian that the mill was losing the jobs because of “a declining marketplace.”\“People just aren't using as much office paper as they used to,” she said.\However, Pike drew a different conclusion. In her statement, Pike wrote that despite the company's efforts to reduce its environmental footprint, Georgia-Pacific made the reductions in the face of an unfriendly regulatory environment in Washington.\From her statement:\“Georgia-Pacific has recognized that with the additional water and air standards foisted upon them from Olympia, and the possibility of new carbon taxes and more regulations, its future is limited in our state. The sad reality is that it's more economical for GP to expand existing operations in Louisiana where the business climate is more favorable, than to fight a losing battle here in Washington state.\“Over the years, extreme environmental regulations along Washington's coast decimated the timber industry. We've nearly lost Boeing. Alcoa has shuddered its Wenatchee aluminum plant and reduced its Ferndale operations. Amazon is looking elsewhere for another headquarters. And now my community will have to find ways to move forward without hundreds of mill jobs. When will we finally understand that the more roadblocks handed down from Olympia, the more manufacturers and other employers will vote with their feet? It's time our state leaders recognize this latest canary in the coal mine and begin working to keep jobs in Washington, rather than incentivizing our employers to seek greener pastures.”\Implementing a carbon tax has long been a goal of Gov. Jay Inslee. A special election earlier this month put Democrats in full control of the Legislature, potentially granting Inslee a freer hand to pursue that goal.\This week, State Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, issued a newsletter with a different take on the mill. Rivers noted that “Georgia-Pacific folks point to a drop in demand for certain kinds of paper …” and that it's part of a “competitive global market.” She also wrote that while the state's regulatory environment affects business leaders' decisions, she defended Inslee.\“Some lay the blame for all of this solely on Governor Inslee. He and I have very different political DNA, but such a claim is inaccurate and irresponsible.\“The Camas announcement is a perfect example of why we must always be looking for economic development opportunities — preferably to create jobs, but sometimes to replace jobs lost to the combination o"
105,"Editorial\Gov. Jay Inslee has been a fixture in state politics for three decades. Now that his second term as governor nears its end and his run for the Democratic presidential nomination has bombed, he should retire with grace. Next year, voters need to elect a governor whose political aspirations and interests are firmly focused on promoting the best interests of all Washingtonians, not one wistfully remembering the White House that could have been.\Washington has real problems that need real solutions and leadership. Inslee, however, was a single-issue candidate during his run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Climate change became his raison d'être.\But he and that signature issue didn't fire up the Democratic base. He might have suspected as much given that he had failed to sell Washingtonians on a carbon tax. We're not sure what made him think that after struggling to gain traction on the issue in this blue state he would fare better nationally.\So the 68-year-old called it quits and declared that he will run for a third term as governor. Watching a senior statesman cling to power rather than let new leaders rise with fresh ideas is dispiriting. The last thing Washington needs is four more years of a governor banging his head against the climate wall.\The state has crucial challenges. Some have lingered for years. Others are just emerging. All require new approaches.\Health care, homelessness and the nexus between them must be top priorities for the next governor. Washington needs to find more money for housing, for treating substance use disorders, and for better incorporation of mental, behavioral and physical health into the justice system. If the state wants to bring health care spending under control, it must address homelessness. According to a 2017 review by the federal Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, being homeless triples the likelihood that a person will go to a hospital ER at least once a year.\Washington also needs a fresh perspective and renewed attention to education. Inslee led the charge to deliver pay hikes that the teachers union wanted but didn't attach any strings. There was no accountability nor requirements that best practices be implemented systematically. Rather, the governor and his supporters in the Legislature simply threw money at schools, satisfying union supporters without improving education outcomes. Meanwhile, they target charter schools, some of which are producing astounding advances for students, for defunding and elimination.\Spokane residents know that for a champion of climate change, Inslee has a mixed record on the environment. He supported, and now opposes, a measurable standard for PCBs in the Spokane River. Now potential litigation threatens to impose huge expense on taxpayers and dischargers, with no beneficial impact on fish and human health. Full disclosure: Inland Empire Paper Company, a sister company to The Spokesman-Review, discharges a trace level of PCBs. Meanwhile, whether it's a pipe dream to remove dams on the Snake River or deferring to bureaucrats who cancel wolf outreach meetings, the governor has failed to lead. Washington can do better.\Economically, the state has done well during Inslee's tenure, but then the nation's economy has done well, too. Looking forward, Inslee's willingness to cater to the worst instincts of the Democratic base has created problems that will drag the economy down. A $13.50 per hour minimum wage (coming in 2020), an astoundingly high hourly pay threshold, might be reasonable for Seattle, but is an overwhelming burden in the rest of the state, where the cost of living and number of tech millionaires is 20-40% lower. The next governor needs to focus on economic growth outside the I-5 corridor.\Finally, Inslee has done little to improve the political environment in the state. Divisive partisanship still rules, and the majority Democrats show little interest in working across diverse issues, instead using legislative gimmicks to ram through tax surprises. The only time lawmakers seem to agree is around bad ideas like exempting themselves from the Public Records Act.\Washington voters deserve a chance next year to select from among fresh faces who will lead the state into a new decade. Up-and-coming Democrats, Republicans and independents could have an exciting debate about the future before the election. With Inslee, the campaign becomes just a referendum on a governor who wants to overstay his time."
106,"OLYMPIA - The Washington State Senate passed Thursday two controversial climate proposals that aim to reduce carbon emissions in the state: a ""cap-and-trade"" bill and a clean fuel standard.\Both bills have been proposed by Democrats and Gov. Jay Inslee for years, but neither has made its way through the Legislature. They're both pieces of what Senate Democrats call a ""grand bargain,"" which ties proposals that reduce carbon emissions to a transportation revenue package that funds new highways, roads and green energy initiatives.\The cap-and-trade bill, which passed 25-24 after a six-hour debate on more than 40 amendments, would put a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and force companies who cannot meet that cap to purchase carbon allowances from the state.\Four Democrats voted against the bill.\Bill sponsor Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, said the proposal is ""good economics and good environmental policy."" It looks at effects of carbon on the environment, as well as the effects on people most harmed by climate change, he said.\""It is a profoundly serious endeavor that this legislation embarks on,"" Carlyle said on the floor.\It would put a cap on emissions from large polluters by 2023. Companies who cannot meet the cap can purchase carbon allowances from the state. The revenue from those allowances would fund projects resulting in ""long-term environmental benefit and increased resiliency to the impacts of climate change,"" according to the bill.\Supporters say it will provide cleaner air across the state by reducing carbon emissions from the largest polluters in the state while generating some revenue for the state to spend on projects that could improve the environment.\Supporters also say it would invest in programs that would help those disproportionately affected by climate change, including people of color and low-income earners.\Opponents say the bill could result in working families paying more for fuel, electricity or food. Large corporations, they say, could find ways to avoid paying large fees.\""There is not a single person today in the state of Washington who will not be affected,"" said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.\An amendment proposed by Braun would have implemented a carbon pollution tax instead of the cap-and-trade program. It would have started with a $15 tax per metric ton of greenhouse gas emissions on the sale or use of fossil fuels in the state.\Republicans said this amendment would have broader support from business and corporations, but Democrats said the tax would not be enough.\Tax reform should be on the table, Carlyle said, but a carbon tax alone would not effectively reduce carbon.\""This is a climate bill, not a tax bill,"" Senate Majority Leader Marko Liias said.\Opponents also argued it has negative effects on manufacturing and farms, which could see loss of jobs or increasing costs. Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, said the proposal could have harmful effects on farms in Eastern Washington because it could drive up costs for many small farmers who use a lot of fuel.\Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, criticized the passage of the bill in a statement, saying farmers in the state use large amounts of fuel to produce crops and move them to market or ports.\""Farmers and growers are price takers, not price setters, which means they'll be hurt by higher fuel prices,"" he said. ""This bill will be very bad for ag, no question about it.""\The clean fuels standard bill passed 27-20 after a late-night debate. It aims to use progressively cleaner transportation fuels in the state, including those used in cars, trucks, boats, trains and aircraft.\If enacted, it would reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuel by 20% by 2035, according to the bill. To do so, the bill would incentivize the creation of alternative fuels in the state and penalize producers of transportation fuels that don't meet the standards.\Similar to the cap-and-trade bill, opponents say it would result in an increase in gas prices. Supporters say that in California and Oregon, which also enacted these standards, those price hikes didn't happen.\Inslee has tried to introduce both proposals for years, but they have never received enough support in the Legislature. He told reporters Thursday both the cap-and-trade and the clean fuel standard proposals would bring Washington in line with the rest of the West Coast.\""We need climate action this year,"" he said. ""We can't run or hide from it. We have to defeat it.""\Senate Democrats are trying to keep both the clean fuels standard and the cap-and-trade proposals tied to a new transportation package.\Last week, the Senate Ways and Means Committee attached an amendment to the clean fuels standard bill that requires at least $500 million more every two years for transportation before the new standard could go into effect.\That new funding could come from a new transportation package, written by Sen. Steve Hobbs, D-Lake Stevens. His plan looks to spend $17.8 billion over the next 16 years on new investments in highways, roads and green energy initiatives. To do so, it uses some money from the cap-and-trade bill, as well as a 9.8 cent gas-tax increase and other taxes and fees.\For Spokane, that package could mean finally funding the long-awaited Division Street Bus Rapid Transit system. The proposal currently has $50 million set aside for the project for the next 16 years.\But that package only passes if both the cap-and-trade and low carbon fuels standard proposals do. While they've now passed the Senate, they might not be as lucky in the House, where leaders have already indicated it could be too late in the game for such a large package to pass.\The last day of the session is April 25, just over two weeks away.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com.\SIDEBAR:\BILL INFORMATION\Senate Bill 5126 passed the state Senate 25-24.

107,"U.S. should lead climate fight\The United States is now sadly the lone holdout in the Paris climate accord (Syria recently signed up). When I posted this information on my Facebook wall, a commenter responded, ""The U.S. is the only sane country out of all of them. Why should we be expected to spend money on this issue?""My answer is that without a habitable Earth, money or nothing else really matters. Fossil fuels are not only polluting, they are finite, and will not last forever. Not being in the Paris climate accord is a missed opportunity for the U.S. to be the leader on renewable energy technologies that will give us hope to reduce carbon emissions. The U.S. can also follow in Canada's footsteps and enact a carbon tax and dividend that would encourage industries to use cleaner sources of energy and boost the economy as well.There are plenty of solutions out there - we need to finally get serious about this issue. Sustainable life on this planet depends on it.\Donna Roy\vancouver\Show the truth about history\I agree with a recent letter, ""Study history, don't remove it,"" regarding history and monuments (Our Readers' Views, Nov. 4). Accurate historical perspective is essential to avoiding past mistakes and build a sense of where we have come from as a nation.To that end, do not remove the proud statues of General Lee striding forward on horseback for the amoral cause he chose to align himself with. Let's accurately add proper historic context to these monuments: attach a chain from pommel to neck shackle of a slave trailing behind Lee's horse. Only then will the dark lesson of this country be complete.\Ian Sinks\ridgefield\Time to repurpose coal plants\Citizens of the Northwest have an opportunity to make an economic improvement that will also benefit the environment as well as assure the stability and diversity of the power grid. We should urge utilities, regulators, and legislators to switch three coal-fired power plants to use clean-burning natural gas, just like the River Road Generating Station here in Clark County. Those plants are in Centralia, Boardman, Ore., and Colstrip, Mont.Power production from wind and solar can fluctuate widely, so keeping these three power plants working will provide cleaner, dependable base-load generation for years to come. This transition will greatly decrease power plant emissions such as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide and particulates.This transition will also completely eliminate emissions from trains powered by diesel locomotives that carry the coal to these same power plants. Indeed, energy company Calpine has a proud history of purchasing coal-fired power plants around the country and switching them to operate on abundant, domestically produced, clean-burning natural gas, so the precedent has been set. We can set a good example for the nation and the world when we keep these power plants operating, and clean the skies as well.\Ron Rasmussen\vancouver\Herrera Beutler ignores input\I have tried several times to tell our congresswoman, Jaime Herrera Beutler, how I hope she will vote on important bills before the House. Not once have I received any acknowledgement of my comments - not even a generic form letter.Most recently, I urged the president, our two senators, and Rep. Herrera Beutler not to include in the current Republican tax reform and budget bill a provision to repeal the Johnson Amendment in respect to houses of worship. I received a boilerplate email response from the White House within a few seconds, from our two senators the following morning, and from Herrera Beutler - not at all.So I visited her Vancouver office the following Friday to submit the comment in person. A young lady there gave me a form to complete. I did so, and she promised to ""personally"" send it to the congresswoman. I stressed that I wanted a response, and she promised to pass that request on, too. It's been more than a week later, and there is still no response.By ignoring input such as mine, Herrera Beutler shows that she does not deserve our support. I know now against whom to vote in 2018.\James Maynard\vancouver\Environment wins in election\What an interesting election! Our ""Orange"" candidate who is really the ""green"" candidate beat ""Greene"" who is not really green. A nice win for people who care about our air and beloved Columbia River.\Judy Hubbard\vancouver\Stores should close on holidays\When I was a young girl all the stores closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas and if you didn't get everything you wanted then you were just out of luck. People need to get their supplies before the holiday so that they can enjoy the holiday with their families and friends. The employees need the day off. It's just that simple. So close the stores and enjoy your turkey and stuffing and sweet potatoes but most of all enjoy your families and thank God that you have them.\Toni Jacobson\battle ground\Nothing merry about Trump plan\President Donald Trump recently sent another shot across the bow in the so-called ""war on Christmas,"" pledging to restore our nation to its Judeo-Christian values.

108,"WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL ASK THE LEGISLATURE FOR NEXT YEAR TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES PREPARE FOR OR FIGHT WILDFIRES?\HILARY FRANZ\I'll make sure we actually have funding to have enough people on the ground to fight those fires and make sure that our local fire districts are ready as well with adequate support. We should be looking at how much we spent the year before on fire suppression, not looking back five to 10 years.\MARY VERNER\It's wonky, but I would ask the Legislature for action on the Forest Fire Protection Assessment, which is currently under review. Private landowners pay this assessment to fund state readiness to fight wildfires. For a 50-acre forested parcel, the fee is $17 annually. In Okanogan County, the assessment generated $472,000 in 2015. The cost of preparing for wildfires in the county was $2.6 million, which was the cost of stationing trained crews and equipment there.\STEVEN NIELSON\The most important thing I need from the Legislature is access to national forest lands, whether that's land transfers or state-run management of national forests. State and private forestlands are pretty healthy; the national forest is very unhealthy, and we need to focus on that. Wildfires really come down to preventative maintenance.\DAVE UPTHEGROVE\The short answer: Money. We need to give our first responders the resources they need to stay safe and keep communities safe. I think I can be the most effective advocate in working with the Legislature. We should also provide incentives to local governments to adopt development codes and regulations that will help reduce fire danger. That could include road access for fire response, or roofing and building materials that would help protect homes.\KAREN PORTERFIELD\It's going to be challenging to get a significant amount of money from the Legislature next year. I will focus on building bipartisan relationships with legislators. I would like to introduce a bill allowing firefighters onto private property to fight fires. I've talked to firefighters who said they were denied access by homeowners. The bill would define what kind of fire conditions would have to be in place for access.\STEVE MCLAUGHLIN\I will work with legislators in the firefighting caucus to take a hard look at what is needed in terms of equipment and training.\JOHN STILLINGS\Preventative funding to reduce the fuel loads. Training of the response teams and engaging everybody. There are loggers standing by with chain saws and all the equipment necessary and willingness to preserve the precious resource.\DO YOU SUPPORT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT CALLS FOR A CARBON TAX?\HILARY FRANZ\I strongly support policies that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, grow the clean energy economy, increase carbon sequestration and reduce climate change. With the current and projected budget deficit in Washington State, we need to make certain any policies we pass do not cut into critical funding for government services and education.\MARY VERNER\From what I know of it, I don't think it's the correct solution to the problem.\STEVEN NIELSON\No. If the intent is to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, encouraging private investment in biofuels is more effective.\DAVE UPTHEGROVE\No. I support putting a price on carbon, but the approach on this initiative isn't the right one.\KAREN PORTERFIELD\I support development of some kind of carbon market, though I don't know if this is the most effective one. In the 21st century, there is more than one way to make money off of a tree.\STEVE MCLAUGHLIN\No. A healthy forest and healthy forest products industry sequesters a lot of carbon.\JOHN STILLINGS\No. Stop wildfires if you want to reduce carbon emissions.\SHOULD THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES OPEN UP MORE LANDS TO HARVEST TO SUPPLY MONEY FOR SCHOOLS THAT NEED MORE CLASSROOMS BECAUSE OF REDUCED CLASS SIZES? IF SO, HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT WHILE PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT?\HILARY FRANZ\Our Legislature needs to step up and prioritize school funding. If we are not educating our children for tomorrow with the best education, we are failing our children, our economy, our environment and our society. The challenge is how we fund schools, with part of it coming from timber harvest. It's a volatile market, but kids' education needs are ever growing. We need to expand and diversify our revenue sources for education, including renewable energy sources on public lands.\MARY VERNER\I think we have enough land available to harvest, but we need to complete the process holdups that have been impediments to harvesting. We must harvest sustainably; it's mandated by law. We should not go in and overharvest because we have a school funding crisis. We owe it to the next generation to leave enough for them to harvest.\STEVEN NIELSON\Yes. I believe 100 percent of DNR lands should be set aside for business purposes. Lands set aside as preserves should be traded to state parks. That would leave DNR focused on creating a steady revenue source for schools and reducing the burden to the taxpayer.\DAVE UPTHEGROVE\I will do everything I can to generate as much return as possible, provided we do it in a way that is sustainable over the long-term. The constitution mandates that we ""show undivided loyalty"" to the trust. When the department deviates from that path, it faces litigation. The way we maintain environmental protections is spelled out through habitat conservation plans. We have controlling legal guidance to do our work.\KAREN PORTERFIELD\We will always have trees and we will always cut trees, but we need to expand revenue from other sources. We are probably going to see more state timber lands taken out of production to protect marbled murrelets and salmon, or to address steep slopes. Some low-value agricultural lands in Eastern Washington should be considered for renewable energy development leases. High-value lands near urban areas could be traded off for other forested parcels or kept for commercial development.\STEVE MCLAUGHLIN\Yes. It goes back to healthy forest practices and ways to increase productivity. If elected, I will have an audit of the state land trust done to see where the money is actually going.\JOHN STILLINGS\No, I think that's short-sighted. We need to ask for more return on our investment. Sell the trees for what they're worth; we have a booming building industry."

It's a partner in our economy. It's a partner in our society.""\The 6th Legislative District was dominated by Republicans for decades until 2006, when Democrats picked up two of the three seats in the district. But Democrats haven't won a seat in the district since 2008. And in the past two election cycles Democrats have lost the races in the 6th by at least 10 percentage points.\But in the August primary for House Position 2 in the 6th, which is being vacated by Republican Jeff Holy as he pursues a bid for the state Senate, Wilson and one other Democrat won more votes than Graham and one other Republican.\The 6th District encompasses a western wedge of the county, including western and southern parts of the city of Spokane, and all of Airway Heights, Medical Lake and Cheney.\Before this race, Graham worked to reform state law and extend the statute of limitations for prosecuting child sex predators. Graham and her siblings were abused as children. Now, in her first political campaign to join elective politics, Graham is aiming to dismantle some parts of the state government.\""Government is out of control. People are getting taxed out of their homes. They're getting taxed out of their businesses,"" she said at a recent debate. ""We are on track to becoming the highest tax state in the nation, and there's real and genuine concern in that.""\By getting rid of some of the state's taxes, Graham predicted greater protections for Washington families and more job growth in Eastern Washington. Graham also cited a lack of respect among elected officials that drove her to run for office.\Wilson, who ran as an independent for Congress in 2014 and 2016, is a former Republican who has said he became disillusioned with the party during the Iraq War, a divide that deepened with the formation of the reactionary tea party and the election of President Donald Trump. Now, as a member of the Democratic Party, his aim is to make government work for everyone.\""What people deserve is representation that is visible, accessible and responsive,"" he said. ""When I hear candidates, and especially officeholders, talk about tearing down government or obstructing government, I don't think that that's healthy. I think for society to work, for our economy to work, we have to have functioning government.""\Both agree that the Legislature they wish to join has left them wanting.\For Wilson, the Legislature's inability to confront climate change or the national scourge of mass shootings has led him to endorse two initiatives on the ballot this fall, despite his criticism of the initiative process.\""I'm not a fan of the initiative process. I believe it's the job of the Legislature to pass legislation,"" he said when discussing Initiative 1631, which would place a ""carbon fee"" on polluters for the right to emit carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases.\""Sometimes an issue is so divisive or such a controversial issue, the Legislature refuses to act,"" he said. ""It's apparent to me the Legislature is not going to do anything about this. We need to move the ball down the field. This moves the ball down the field. I think it's important that we get something passed in this arena, to address climate change.""\Wilson used similar logic when discussing Initiative 1639, which would raise the age limit to buy semi-automatic rifles to 21 and require firearms to be stored safely at home.\""In my mind, the pendulum has swung too far in the wrong direction. There aren't enough safeguards for society,"" Wilson said. ""I'm not anti-Second Amendment. I'm not anti-self-defense. But in my mind, this has nothing to do with self-defense. These are not drastic steps. These are small steps. We need to get the pendulum swinging back in the other direction.""\For Graham, it's less about what the Legislature's not doing, and more about its overreach.\Asked if she would support the creation of a state income tax if it reduced other state taxes like property or sales taxes, Graham said Washington was becoming too reliant on taxes.\""When you look at the state income tax, and then you start looking at the grocery tax, then you start looking at the capital gains income tax increase, and you start looking at the carbon tax that's coming up,"" she said. ""The mileage tax that they want to pass that's going to put a transmitter in your car to measure how many miles you go and get more information, where we're already in a day and age where you're getting red light tickets in the mail, and school zone tickets in the mail. When I'm going to the door, people are asking, how much is enough? We are on track to becoming the highest-taxed state in the nation.""\Graham mentioned a man she spoke with who said taxes were driving him out of business. He closed one restaurant, she said, and was close to shutting a second.\""There's only so much margin in a taco,"" she said.\Both candidates support Initiative 1634, which would bar local governments from taxing soda or other groceries.\Graham said the state also has become overregulated.

YATES\Yakima\Impressed by Mosbrucker\To the editor - Four years ago, I had the occasion to stay in Gina Mosbrucker's motel in Goldendale. This new candidate for state representative aroused my curiosity.\So, next morning I went up to the smiling young lady at the desk and asked what it was like to work for Gina. These are the phrases I remember: ""Oh, she helps us get better and better and then she promotes us!"" I call that a win-win type of capitalism. It won me over.\ELLEN VANDERWALL\Yakima\Proud to support Dufault\To the editor - As a U.S. Army veteran and a 15th District voter, I am proud to support Jeremie Dufault for the Washington State House of Representatives.\Jeremie is a major in the U.S. Army Reserve and has served his country in both Kuwait and Afghanistan. Although he is a nonpracticing lawyer in his civilian life, Jeremie is an active lawyer in the Army's Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps.\I have known him for many years as a personal friend, and I can attest to Jeremie's personal integrity and sense of honor and duty.\I am privileged to be able to vote for him as my next state representative, and I happily did so when I received my ballot.\SCOTT BLODGETT\Yakima\Coffey courageous, honest\To the editor - Kathy Coffey is the one.\Kathy is one of the strongest, most courageous, honest, hardworking, and results-oriented persons I've ever known. She is 110 percent devoted to ""better"" our (residents of the Yakima Valley) quality of life as exhibited by her noteworthy resume and service work. I continually see her take the high road and maintain a level head under duress. She is an unparalleled leader, a mentor, and one of life's heroes to me. She is second to none for this race.\ANNE MONEYMAKER\Yakima\Supports Soto Palmer\To the editor - I am writing in support of Susan Soto Palmer for Yakima County commissioner, District 3. I have known and worked with Susan for the past several years. Susan is dedicated to improving the quality of life for all residents of Yakima County. Quality of life services include community affordability in housing and services, quality of employment with living wages and safe working environments, and quality of the environment with clean water and air.\Susan will work for maintaining our agriculture economy while encouraging diverse businesses to locate here. A diverse economy will provide security and jobs for all residents. Susan seeks to bring experts to the table to assist in making wise decisions for the future of the county. Vote for Susan Soto Palmer for Yakima County commissioner, District 3.\DAVID POWELL\Yakima\Corry best candidate for job\To the editor - My husband, Joel, and I have never written a letter to the editor, but when it comes to supporting a candidate that we fully endorse, we are happy to do so! We fully support Chris Corry for District 14 state representative because we know and feel he would be the best candidate for the job.\We personally know Chris as a friend, father, husband, foster parent and active volunteer of the Yakima Valley. He is the right candidate because of what he stands for and believes in. He stands for lower taxes, upholding all constitutional rights, pro-life and is a foster care advocate. He is the type of person who is motivated and will strive to get whatever job, task or challenge put in front of him accomplished! His honesty, morals and ethics lead his decision-making and are exactly what we need in Olympia representing us.\Please join us in voting Chris Corry for District 14 state representative! MALLORY HUIBREGTSE\Wapato\What has Coffey accomplished?\To the editor - All of the campaign advertisements (written as letters to the editor) pertaining to Kathy Coffey appear to have been written by her friends. As memory serves, during the period since her emergence years ago, her resume seems to be orchestrated to present an image of competence.\However, where is any evidence of meaningful accomplishment? Can it be dissected from her City Council performance? The truth could be found in her voting record, with the spotlight on the current melee proposing to use prime downtown parking to erect the City Council's ""Look At The Downtown Gathering Place For The Homeless And Panhandlers We Are Cramming Down Your Throat"" dream.\The council members were presumed to possess the talents necessary to act on behalf of the community but fell far short.\When the council conceded to the people's wishes to have a say, Kathy Coffey, apparently inebriated by her self-image, obstinately insisted on denying the public its fair representation while simultaneously campaigning for a legislative position at the state level. Does she have the audacity to think her attitude should be rewarded by inflicting it on the entire state? If logic prevails, then clear-minded people who do their own thinking will undoubtedly vote for a Coffey Break.\MICK PHILLIPS\Yakima\Mosbrucker deserves support\To the editor - I am writing to express my support for Rep. Gina Mosbrucker and why I feel that she deserves the support of the residents of the 14th District. She has proven herself a strong legislator by sponsoring bills regarding the safety of those in the state with special needs, the needs of our veterans, and women missing from the reservation. These and many others are not ""softball"" issues as some may view them.\Mosbrucker has shown the strength of character to stand against the political establishment and protect her legislation from needless amendments and deal-making that often waters down good legislation. She has also shown the strength of character to work with those across the aisle to pass much-needed legislation and still hold strong to her core principles. In a time of mudslinging and name-calling in politics, Mosbrucker has kept to the high road running on the issues and experience. For these and many other reasons, Rep. Gina Mosbrucker has earned my vote.\DARREN KING\Wapato\Udell top pick for sheriff\To the editor - Bob Udell is the top pick for the office of Yakima County sheriff. I saw all of the candidates in action throughout my career, in many different situations and settings, and none of them exhibited the superior abilities to match Bob. He is a proven, successful leader.\From one-on-one counseling of an employee to intense critical incidents, Bob Udell has shown time and again that he has the skills needed for the office of sheriff. Now, as a private citizen, I know the future of county law enforcement will be in good hands as you join me in voting for Bob Udell for Yakima County sheriff.\KEN IRWIN\Yakima\Editor's note: Ken Irwin is a former Yakima County sheriff.\Soto Palmer honest, caring\To the editor - I recommend Susan Soto Palmer for Yakima County commissioner, District 3.\She stands for protecting precious resources like water, agriculture, and the diversity of our local economy, so that our children have a clean environment and professional opportunities at home after college. She will protect the legalization of marijuana that has provided Yakima County $12,026,481 in tax revenue since 2014, while also protecting many from the unnecessary perils of black markets. She has a passion for helping the most vulnerable, the homeless and other unfairly villainized populations being scapegoated in our current political climate.\I know firsthand that she is a real progressive thinker. She was one of the people who was instrumental in bringing Bernie Sanders to the SunDome, and as such, one of the people who inspired me to have a little hope in our political culture. It's because of honest, caring, hardworking people like Susan, motivated by sincere concern for the quality of life of everyone, including the most unfortunate, that people like me haven't given up politics. I hope everyone votes for Susan Soto Palmer.\NUNO FERNANDES\Yakima\Dufault smart, good listener\To the editor - I am proud to serve as mayor of Selah, a wonderful and growing community. I am also proud to support Jeremie Dufault for state representative.\Jeremie serves on the Selah City Council. He has done an outstanding job managing and representing our community. He is a good listener who knows how to build consensus without compromising his beliefs.\Jeremie is a smart person who uses his analytical skills to help the council make the right decisions and, often times, save money for the taxpayers.\I am voting for Jeremie Dufault. and I hope you do, too.\SHERRY RAYMOND\Selah\Vote - and vote for Bentley\To the editor - With mail-in ballots for the primary due at the post office by Tuesday, it is very important that everyone who can votes in this primary and coming election.\I am voting for Sasha Bentley for the 14th Legislative District, Position 1 because she is committed to ""people over politics"" - she is not a politician but a citizen who has been called to serve the people of this region. In a democratic society, that means the many, not the few - not the rich and powerful. Her economic policies include fairer taxes for the middle class; supporting unions and worker rights; ensuring a living wage and good jobs; providing rural transportation options; ensuring affordable, quality childcare options across the state; and supporting big business but stopping the monopolies to ensure a competitive business climate, among others. Go to her website at http://www.sashaforstate.com to read more.\We need fair and just representation that works for the majority. I support Sasha Bentley for the 14th Legislative District, Position 1.\And don't forget to get your ballots to the post office no later than Tuesday.\MARIA CUEVAS\Yakima\Dufault deserves vote\To the editor - Jeremie Dufault believes in open and honest government, which is why he supports requiring the Legislature to follow the same transparency rules required of every other elected body in the state. He deserves to be the next 15th District representative.\LARS HANSON\Yakima"
112,"We're being scammed\The Republicans are scamming us. Their tax plan delivers benefits to the rich through major cuts to programs needed and supported by the shrinking middle class. The tickler they offer is that U.S. corporations located overseas are encouraged, but not required, to relocate back in the U.S. to provide jobs. It's called trickle down, but more accurately it's trickle up. It was invented by President Reagan. It didn't work then, it won't work now.According to Factcheck.org and Politifact.com, by 2027, middle earners will pay more taxes, and the top 1 percent will pay less.

Seems to be the new normal for the Republican Party.If the Republicans truly wanted to stimulate the economy, they would be supporting a rebuilding of our infrastructure, which we know would create jobs here at home, and the grandkids would have something to show for the debt they're getting stuck with.Please vote in 2018.\Robert Neal\BATTLE GROUND\Programs are not handouts\The Dec. 6 editorial, “In Our View — CHIPS Not a Handout,” mentioned a word too often left out of discussions about certain social programs. This is a way to negate the importance of those programs and label them as giveaways when, in fact, they are part of a larger plan to assist certain segments of our population. Republicans see these programs as entitlements when, in fact, they're insurance programs.Social Security insurance began as help for the elderly. Medicare created a health insurance plan for retired folks. The Children's Health Insurance Program provides insurance to children whose families can't afford it. We pay for Social Security and Medicare from our wages and deserve the benefits we receive.CHIP gives kids a chance to stay healthy, helps financially stressed families and provides an alternative to using an emergency room for a primary pare appointment.Should CHIP remain unfunded, I wonder how much of their tax cut they'll reinvest in the working people of America.Will Rep. Herrera Beutler hold a town hall meeting for a panel with three empty chairs?\Randolph A. Cate\Vancouver\Pike is blind to the truth\Rep. Liz Pike's Dec. 7 opinion piece, “State's burdensome business climate drove G-P to flee,” got my attention. Given Pike's penchant for playing loose with the truth, let us review.She states Georgia-Pacific's “official” reason for curtailing some operations, i.e., lack of demand, and then takes eight bullet points to describe the “unofficial” reasons, i.e., sick leave for workers, cap-and-trade on carbon, tax rates, water-quality standards, something about Millennium Bulk Terminals, growth management, and last but not least, those pesky Democrats.First, if there were additional reasons for G-P's partial closure, don't you think G-P's management would want us to know what they were? Yes, they would. Moreover, most of Pike's unofficial motivations for G-P's decision have been coming down the, ahem, pike, for years now.You would think that G-P's management would've spoken up before now if indeed they were burdensome; they didn't, and Millennium Bulk Terminal's problems have nothing to do with G-P. As for those pesky Democrats? You gotta love 'em.Pike insists that if we'd “read between the lines” we would see the truth of the matter as she does. It must be nice to have Pike's microscopic X-ray vision.\Charlie Chappelle\Vancouver\Train decision trumps safety\An OPB story, “Trump administration rolls back oil train safety rules” (Dec. 7, The Columbian), reports that the Trump administration is killing Obama-era train safety regulations designed to combat train derailments and explosive spills such as happened in Mosier, Ore.The reason provided is that the cost of installing the new technology braking systems exceeds the value of the benefit received. It seems to me that we settled such ridiculous thinking years ago, when Ford was revealed to have decided to let their Pinto proceed to the public, because their payout over litigation resulting from fiery crashes would cost less than a recall and retool to fix the hazardous fuel tank problem.Since then, automaker recalls have been the rule, rather than the exception. The point being — safety — whether of the individual, the community, or the environment is paramount and without cost barrier. Corporations have proven, historically, that they will ignore such factors. Thus, government is required to implement regulations. We see it time and time again throughout our history. So, now we have an administration ordering that our lives, our communities, and our environments be less safe.One has to wonder — just how does this Make"
113,"Ken Burns' latest documentary, ""The Dust Bowl,"" provides a timely reminder that junk science once compelled Americans to commit ruinous acts against nature. ""Rain follows the plow"" was the conventional wisdom of yesteryear. The mere act of turning the soil in the Great Plains would be enough to produce sufficient rainfall to sustain a comfortable farming life, or so the theory went.\That's all the purveyors of Manifest Destiny needed to hear, and so Native Americans and vast buffalo herds were removed with brutal swiftness. Then it was up to the land speculators and other hucksters of the day to sell ancient grasslands as an agricultural wonderland. As it turned out, there was a reason few people lived there, and Mother Nature delivered a decade-long reminder during the Dirty Thirties.\Fast forward to today, and we have mounds of research that shows human activity is altering the climate. But it's gathering dust.\Every relevant scientific academy concurs, but it isn't politically correct to do much about it. Potential profits triggered the tragic plowing of the Great Plains. The prospect of losing money has sparked successful attacks on climate science.\The Heartland Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute and others like them spread information that consistently raises doubts about global warming. Their funding comes from individuals and industries that would be hurt if the government were to ever act. It's similar to the campaigns waged on behalf of Big Tobacco when the link to cancer was denied with a straight face.\In a 2007 Pew Center Research Poll, 63 percent of Republican respondents said there was solid evidence of global warming. Three years later, 53 percent said there wasn't. Among tea party adherents, 70 percent are nonbelievers.\When President Barack Obama first took office, many corporations had already signed up for a partnership with the government on how to deal with the problem. Cap and trade won out over a carbon tax, because that strategy had the free enterprise elements businesses prefer. But the bill was stymied in Congress, and Obama didn't put up much of a fight.\Then Hurricane Sandy hit, and now many East Coast Americans are beginning to wonder whether this is their future. BusinessWeek quickly came out with a cover story on global warming urging leaders to act. The article noted what scientists have been saying for years: While no individual storm can be linked to global warming, an amped-up climate is going to deliver more unusual weather.\U.S. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., is the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works. He calls global warming a hoax. U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who is the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is a moderate who used to work on bipartisan emissions bills. But, recently, a ""Frontline"" reporter asked him, ""Do you think climate change is causing the earth to become warmer?"" He replied, ""I'm sorry, I'm just not going to answer that.""\Meanwhile, Democrats might as well be changing the subject, because they haven't made the issue a priority.\Insurance actuaries don't need votes; they look at the data and adjust rates accordingly. They are treating global warming as a fact. Transportation planners would like to do the same, but they rely on political processes for approval. They're worried that future bridge, rail, highway, shipping and mass transit projects are not being adjusted for the inevitable impacts of climate change.\The campaign against global warming has effectively cowed politicians, but nature isn't going to knuckle under. Rain didn't follow the plow. Policy hasn't followed the science. Our descendants will curse our selfishness.\Wayne Lewis, who was a child of the Dust Bowl, summed up the lesson in the documentary: ""We want it now, and if makes money it's a good idea. But it isn't necessarily a good idea if the thing we're doing is going to mess up the future.""\Associate Editor Gary Crooks can be reached at garyc@spokesman.com or (509) 459-5026.

114,"Europe's left wing parties have been suffering ignoble defeats but could soon find a spark in Iceland, a tiny outpost of 340,000 people in the north Atlantic.\A collection of socialists, environmentalists and the Pirate Party are now in ascendance and looking to unseat the conservative Independence Party in a snap election on Oct. 28. Polls put the Left-Green Movement ahead of the Independents and nearly one in two Icelanders would like its down-to-earth leader, Katrin Jakobsdottir, to be the next prime minister.\The Independence Party may find it hard to cling to power again after surviving yogurt-hurling outrage over the Panama Papers leaks in 2016. Forced out after the financial collapse in 2007, the party called a snap election under the weight of yet another scandal (outgoing Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson resigned after his father vouched for the character of a convicted pedophile).\Jakobsdottir, a former education minister, is preparing for a transformation.\""We want to lead the next government, a government that will stand for social welfare and the environment,"" Jakobsdottir said in an interview in Reykjavik.\Europe's left wingers haven't been doing too well lately, taking a drubbing in recent elections in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Norway. But in Iceland, they could bring about significant change after four years of center-right rule (The Independents have taken part in nine out of Iceland's last 10 governments and in a total of 21 out of 32 since the country adopted a republican constitution in 1944).\Capital Economics expects a center-left government to push for an expansionary fiscal policy, which might in turn accelerate interest rate hikes.\On top of higher spending on health care and education, the Left-Greens are proposing tax increases for big corporations, a carbon tax and a crackdown on speculative investments. It also wants to keep Landsbankinn, the re-incarnation of failed bank Landsbanki, in state hands.\""The elections are close and the discussion is moving fast,"" Jakobsdottir said. ""But I believe our agenda will yield a good result.""\Iceland's election will see a dozen parties compete for seats in the 63-member parliament, the Althing. Should the Left-Green Movement emerge as the biggest party, it will have to go into a coalition with several others.\Its natural ally has taken a drubbing after helping clean up the country in the aftermath of the financial crisis: The Social Democratic Alliance, which wants Iceland to join the European Union and the euro, used to command around a third of the national vote but has seen its support shrink to single-digit figures.\The Left-Greens and the Social Democrats also see a potential coalition with the Progressive Party, a euro-skeptic party which has hovered between the left and the right. Its former leader, Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson, was the first high-profile victim of the Panama Papers, resigning as prime minister in April of last year.\Gunnlaugsson has since launched a new movement, the Center Party, which is polling at around 7 percent. A good chunk of that support comes from voters who would normally cast their ballots for the Progressive Party, further complicating the political picture.\The elephant in the room is the maverick Pirate Party. A year ago it looked like it was on the cusp of becoming the first direct-democracy movement to gain power in Europe, capitalizing on the anger directed at Gunnlaugsson. Its support has since dropped, but it is still polling at around 10 percent, giving it a potential role as kingmaker.\There's also the ascending People's Party, which wants to abolish poverty and has been polling at around 8 percent."
115,"Avista has joined the Chicago Climate Exchange to turn its greenhouse gas reduction efforts into a cash reward.\The exchange is based on trading what are called carbon credits, a free-market attempt that financially rewards businesses for cutting greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming.\To participate, Avista's emissions will be audited and the company assigned a number. If Avista's current emissions meet a target number below a baseline average taken from the years 1998 and 2001, the company can sell its surplus as carbon credits on the exchange, much like stocks are sold on Wall Street. Buyers would be companies that exceed pollution limits.\John Lyons, an Avista power supply analyst and adjunct economics professor at Gonzaga University, will spearhead the utility's efforts.\Since Avista's emissions already are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lyons anticipates a smooth audit process and surplus credits. The result, he said, should net Avista money. The money would likely be spent to curb emissions and on conservation efforts.\Buyers of carbon credits include the U.S. Capitol, which Monday spent $89,000 to offset the pollution sent into the atmosphere from its coal-burning power plant.\Richard Sandor founded the Chicago Climate Exchange, or CCX, in 2003. Time Magazine hailed him last month as one of 43 ""heroes of the environment."" Called the ""father of carbon trading,"" Sandor shared the accolades with former vice president and Nobel Prize winner Al Gore, former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev and others.\The CCX is attracting new members and includes many large manufacturers, chemical companies, utilities and governments.\Among them: Ford Motor Co. and Rolls-Royce, Dow Corning and DuPont, Eastman Kodak Co., Motorola and Sony, Intel, IBM, Bank of America Corp., Puget Sound Energy, King County, the city of Portland, and University of Idaho.\Federal lawmakers are expected to force U.S. companies to cut carbon dioxide and other gases, or, perhaps, buy so-called pollution credits, which are traded like stocks.\""We see emissions legislation coming down the pike,"" Lyons said. ""What this does is gives us real experience.""\Avista bills itself as one of the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases in the country among electric utilities, largely because much of its power is generated by dams. The company does own a piece of a coal-burning power plant in Colstrip, Mont., that provides a steady, cheap and uninterrupted supply of electricity for its customers in North Idaho and Eastern Washington. Coal is a leading cause of global warming.\Critics have warned that carbon trading is not enough to solve the threat posed by climate change. Some are pushing for a federal carbon tax to speed changes by big polluters.\Credits to offset the emissions of six greenhouse gases are traded on the exchange, Lyons said. Avista expects to sell carbon dioxide credits.\The price of the credits is driven by general economics, Lyons said, including market speculators.\Credit: John Stucke Staff writer"
116,"Spin Control\A new year stretches before us, full of possibilities, challenges and stupid stuff that we suspect will happen.\As it does most years, Spin Control likes to look into the crystal ball to see what might be ahead, rather than dwelling on the highlights and lowlifes of the year that's about to run out.\So, as Bullwinkle J. Moose would say, ""Eenie, meanie, chili beanie.""\Prediction 1: Gov. Jay Inslee will insert sports metaphors into his State of the State address. If the Seattle Seahawks are still in the playoffs, he'll use them as an example of how teamwork in the Legislature could bring them to a deal on a carbon tax or fee. Lawmakers will rule it an incomplete pass. If the Seahawks don't make the playoffs, he'll use the Mariners; lawmakers will balk.\Prediction 2: President Donald Trump will sign an order repealing an Obama administration order on the environment. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson will sue to protect Washington's air and water quality.\Prediction 3: In the midst of a record cold snap, people who don't believe in climate change will say, ""See, global warming is a hoax!"" - confusing the concept of weather with climate.\Prediction 4: Legislators will arrive in Olympia in January promising to be done in the legally allotted 60 days. They will put off their biggest task, how to come up with $1 billion needed for education, until around Day 58, necessitating a special session.\Prediction 5: President Trump will sign an order rolling back an Obama administration rule on consumer protection. Attorney General Ferguson will sue to protect Washington consumers.\Prediction 6: Initiative impresario Tim Eyman, along with Spokane confederates City Councilman Mike Fagan and his father, Jack Fagan, will file dozens of possible ballot measures, many of them iterations of familiar themes like tax restrictions or car tabs. After asking repeatedly for donations to do their sacred work, they will qualify - at most - one initiative for the ballot or Legislature.\Prediction 7: Fiscal conservatives will be on alert against a state income tax and will go to DEFCON 1 if any progressive legislator proposes a bill to create one. They won't lower the threat level even when reminded a state income tax would take a constitutional amendment, not just a bill, to enact.\Prediction 8: Social progressives will be on alert against any effort to limit abortion rights and will go to DEFCON 1 if any Christian conservative legislator proposes a bill to put time restrictions or parental notifications into law. They won't lower the threat level even when reminded that such proposals couldn't pass the Senate even when Republicans were in control.\Prediction 9: Sometime during a heat wave in the summer, people who believe in climate change will say, ""See, we told you so!"" - confusing the concept of weather with climate.\Prediction 10: Underscoring the difference between the two states' politics, Washington's two senators will vote no on any legislation of substance when Idaho's two senators vote yes, and yes on any when Idaho senators vote no.\Prediction 11: President Trump will sign an order repealing some workplace safety rules from the Obama administration. Attorney General Ferguson will sue on behalf of Washington workers.\Prediction 12: Television pundits will point to the result of every special election for Congress, the Legislature, city council or dogcatcher as proof that Democrats will or will not take over the U.S. Senate and House in 2018. In the end, all will have predicted both that control of Congress will and won't change hands. They will play the clip with the correct prediction the day after the election.\Prediction 13: National Democratic organizations that are usually ""all talk, no dollars"" about supporting a congressional candidate in Eastern Washington will put some money where their mouths are and give some to Lisa Brown. National Republican organizations will give more to U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers.\Prediction 14: President Trump will sign an order including extraterrestrials in the restrictions against immigration. Attorney General Ferguson will sue on behalf of Washington's future space alien community.\Contact the writer:\(509) 879-7461\jimc@spokesman.com"

Don't give up on climate plan
\
Now that the voters have spoken, Republicans will need to show they can govern. Many big issues await action. The next president has stated he will dismantle the federal actions taken to address the climate challenge (e.g. the Clean Power Plan). Our Congress needs to show leadership on this critical issue of our time.Fortunately there is an approach that has bipartisan appeal: a revenue-neutral carbon fee and dividend. This is similar to what we in Washington state voted on, though nationwide in scope and with a different mechanism for returning the carbon tax to the people. A price on carbon can influence people's use and waste of energy, and the circulation of revenue can stimulate the economy. The Citizens Climate Lobby is in contact with all congressional offices and has in-depth information on their website (https://citizensclimatelobby.org).

Stop the anarchy
\
America, beware the anarchists! This is how the Communists started in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1907. They protested the czar with marches, vandalism and violence. By 1917, they violently overthrew the government.Anarchists like to take advantage of upset people to use them for their own purpose. And don't kid yourself. The Democrat Socialists (that is what they called themselves) of a century ago were not all that different from the modern Democrat Socialists (as Bernie Sanders calls himself). Nationalizing all wealth-producing institutions is their way to level the field of all classes except the ruling class. They will have all the wealth and everyone else will be poor.The Democrat Party leaders have the responsibility to stop this anarchistic uprising.

Be wary of Prop. 1 results
\
With the passage of Proposition 1, let's hope the citizens of Vancouver find solutions to their ""affordable housing crisis.""Even though Lethene and her 1,800 senior friends (who were mentioned in a campaign flier) already have property tax subsidies, plus many other government transfer payments, let's hope they find a real difference in their daily lives.As a community, we should maintain a careful eye on our dollars. The city of Vancouver has no experience in housing, and the social service providers have many donor and government dollars.Let's hope these groups understand that the use of government resources can be counterproductive. Hopefully they will create a responsible path realizing:n The need for a large and varied housing supply, with equal treatment of public and private developers.n That there must be time limits on public housing, corresponding to welfare time limits.n That lack of housing is a symptom of greater problems: alcoholism, addiction, the teenage mother who has no job skills, affordable housing.n That there must be support for existing group homes that deliver a combination of shelter, guidance and treatment.Sadly, I do not see any of these options in Proposition 1's campaign literature.

Bring forth harmony and peace
\
Can you identify that sound? A single note; a vibration fills the air from floor to ceiling, followed by a hundred instruments - a thousand notes reverberate through the concert hall. An orchestra. It swells at the crescendo, then sinks softly at the decrescendo.The violinists and flutists sing the high notes in the melody, while the cellos and bassoons hum the low harmony, and with every strike of the bass drum or chime of the triangle, the percussionists hold the entire piece together. Every note and beat is essential. Without even one of the crucial elements, Mozart falls flat, Bach skips a beat and Beethoven loses his thunder. A multitude of different pitches, volumes and textures must weave together to complete the musical masterpiece.And so it is when living in this great country of ours. It takes many sounds, textures and volumes from each of us to blend and to get along with one another. I shudder watching these butt-headed dimwits riot. I'm certain their mentality could easily fit atop a pin head. Just think how many of us have the potential to blend and weave our talents and abilities to bring harmony and peace as opposed to evil doing. Just a thought.

Hold leaders to high standards

I hold these truths to be self evident:1) That a woman has the right not to be called ""p****"" or be treated like a piece of meat in the workplace.2) That all citizens have the right to freedom of affiliation, religion, sexual orientation and personal safety around their sexual organs and bodies.3) That humans of all races and colors, religion and beliefs will find a safe haven in America when under life-threatening persecution.4) That the same laws governing appropriate language and environment in the workplace as outlined by the EEOC will apply to those in public office and seats of power.5) That bullying will not be acceptable in government anymore than it is in our schools.Until these and other obvious rights can be respected, let us hold those in non-compliance responsible for the damage and repercussions of their actions in the same way we would in our schools, workplace and places of public gathering.In other words, if Billy Bush loses his job over unacceptable comments and vernacular, let us not accept such behavior in a politician and fire him.

While the TransAlta issue is more complex than critics would lead voters to believe, it does raise questions about the proposed carbon fee.\Because of those questions, The Columbian's Editorial Board recommends a “no” vote on Initiative 1631. As always, this is merely a recommendation; The Columbian urges voters to take a close look at this important measure before casting a ballot.\The need for examining the issue is represented by the TransAlta plant. While the facility — one of Washington's biggest polluters — is exempt from the fee, it also is scheduled to be closed by 2025. Opponents typically don't mention that, reflecting how 1631 is subject to strident opinions on both sides that don't always provide a complete picture of the issue.\With that in mind, we shall attempt to provide the basics of the ballot measure, but we encourage voters to fully study Initiative 1631.\To begin with, climate change is real, and it is exacerbated by human activity. A vast majority of climate scientists agree, and increasingly extreme weather events such as devastating hurricanes and wildfires confirm the science. We are past the point of placating naysayers who are prone to downplaying or denying the impact that burning fossil fuels has upon the global environment, but that does not mean that Initiative 1631 is the best possible approach.\I-1631 would charge emitting companies $15 for each ton of carbon they release, with the fee increasing over time. Notably, aviation and maritime fuels also are exempt, as are “energy-intensive, trade-dependent” businesses such as aluminum and steel.\Revenue would go toward efforts to reduce the state's carbon footprint, prepare for climate change, and help communities impacted by climate change. A commission would be formed to determine how funds are doled out, and because the revenue comes from a fee rather than a tax, it would be used only for climate and environmental projects and could not be diverted for other government expenses.\The state Office of Financial Management estimates that I-1631 would raise $2.3 billion in the first five years. While we support efforts to promote clean energy, it is reasonable to ask whether $2.3 billion can be spent on projects that actually pass a cost-benefit analysis. Raising money for effective projects is a worthy goal; raising money simply to target polluting industries can lead to unnecessary expenditures and can be harmful to industry in the state.\The question then becomes one of costs to consumers. State officials estimate that residential natural gas prices would increase by about 10 percent in 2020, gasoline prices would increase between 6 percent and 9 percent, and electricity costs also would rise. Industries would pay the bulk of I-1631's fees, but the pocketbooks of average Washingtonians also would feel the impact.\Washington would be the first state to impose a carbon fee on polluters, and we applaud efforts to place the state at the forefront of an important issue. British Columbia adopted a carbon tax in 2008, and while critics claim that tax has not reduced emissions, it likely slowed their growth and has not demonstrably hampered the economy of the province.\Because of that, and because of the urgency presented by climate change, we are intrigued by efforts to reduce carbon emissions. But Initiative 1631 has too many problems to warrant a rec"

120,"We are losing the battle to save our planet, and we have no one to blame but ourselves.\As the United Nations opens its 25th climate change summit in Madrid, leaders are seeking to put a brave face on a dismal situation. ""My message here today is one of hope, not of despair,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told journalists Sunday.\Hope, unfortunately, is not a plan.\""The last five years have been the hottest ever recorded,"" Guterres said. ""Sea levels are at the highest in human history."" And as for the crusade to keep global warming below the level of utter catastrophe, Guterres reported that ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and is hurtling towards us.""\History will condemn a host of villains, starting with President Trump. The United States, as the globe's leading economic power, is uniquely positioned to lead the world toward climate solutions. Instead, Trump is deliberately worsening the problem by pulling out of the Paris climate accord and actively encouraging the increased burning of fossil fuels, including coal. Decades from now, we may well see this as the Trump administration's worst legacy.\Chinese President Xi Jinping, unlike Trump, understands and accepts the scientific consensus about climate change. But China's greenhouse gas emissions continue to soar and are nearly double those of the United States. Xi continues to value rapid economic growth - fueled, in part, by new coal-fired power plants - over humanity's well-being in the long term.\India Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also sharply boosted his nation's carbon emissions. The European Union has seen its emissions decline, but only modestly.\At least China, India and Europe are projected to meet their initial emissions targets under the Paris accord; the United States is not. But those targets were meant to be just a beginning. If warming is to be held to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-Industrial levels by the end of this century - a level scientists consider awful but manageable - carbon emissions worldwide need to start dropping rapidly. Like, right now. Yet emissions last year reached an all-time high.\Despite what Trump and other ignoramuses might say, there is essentially no scientific disagreement about the fact that climate change is occurring or the fact that humankind is the cause.\A bulletin last week from the World Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency, reported that the concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by an incredible 47% since the Industrial Revolution. By examining the levels of various isotopes of carbon in the air, WMO scientists were able to show that the added carbon is of the kind emitted when coal and other fossil fuels are burned.\In other words, we've been found standing over the victim with the murder weapon in our hands.\At the Madrid climate summit - where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the highest-profile U.S. attendee - the assembled leaders will hear that prior assessments of climate change catastrophe were understated. Global warming is happening faster than predicted, with more dramatic consequences than previously imagined. Glaciers are melting. Seas are rising. Weather patterns have shifted in unpredictable ways, making monsoon rains unreliable, generating supercharged hurricanes and exposing once-temperate regions like Northern Europe to deadly heat waves.\The earth is immensely large, while each of us individually is very small. It may be difficult to imagine that we could have such a big impact on the environment. But look at photographs of the planet taken by astronauts and note how thin the atmosphere is. The air we breathe extends upward only roughly 10 miles - the distance many of us commute each day in our carbon-spewing SUVs and pickup trucks.\That issue of scale is one impediment to the kind of climate action we desperately need. An even bigger problem is the question of time.\We of the boomer cohort will long have returned to dust before climate change begins to feel like an everyday five-alarm crisis. Our children will feel it, though, and our grandchildren will suffer in ways we can only begin to grasp. Future generations will be mystified and furious. They will see from the historical record that we knew what was happening, that we knew of ways to at least slow it down - a carbon tax, for example - and that we did almost nothing.\Our benighted leaders fail to give us meaningful action on climate change because we fail to demand it. We can't look to the Madrid conference to save the planet. We must look within.\Eugene Robinson is a columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group.

121,"Gov. Jay Inslee made it official on Thursday, announcing he'd be seeking a third term in the governor's mansion in 2020.\Inslee made the announcement in an email to supporters and on Twitter, following Wednesday night's appearance on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" in which the 68-year-old said he was abandoning his campaign for the presidency.\""I want to continue to stand with you in opposing Donald Trump and rejecting his hurtful and divisive agenda, while strengthening and enhancing Washington state's role as a progressive beacon for the nation,"" Inslee said on Twitter on Thursday morning.\The governor's announcement that he would seek a third term was not unexpected, after multiple sources told the Associated Press on Wednesday evening that Inslee intended to defend his seat. Under Washington state law, there is no limit on the number of terms a governor may serve.\Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who has said publicly he was waiting for Inslee to make a decision about his political future before weighing in on a governor's run, also said Thursday he'd be seeking another term as the state's top lawyer, while lauding Inslee's singular focus on climate change in his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in a crowded field.\""Gov. Jay Inslee should be proud of his success promoting climate change as an urgent issue demanding immediate action,"" Ferguson said in a statement posted to Twitter.\""I support Governor Inslee's re-election, and I will pursue another term as Attorney General,"" the statement concludes.\Ferguson, too, will seek his third term in office after first being elected as attorney general in 2012. Since 2016, Ferguson has made a habit of challenging the Trump administration on issues including immigration, environmental regulations and student debt. There is no term limit for his post, either.\Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz, who had also spoken of an interest in running for governor, released a statement Thursday saying she, too, would support Inslee for governor and seek a second term as head of Washington's Department of Natural Resources.\""Washington faces major challenges, in both rural and urban areas, from protecting our environment to funding schools to creating economic opportunity for all workers. Jay Inslee has been a leader in tackling one of the biggest threats we face - climate change, and that's why I support his re-election for Governor,"" Franz said in a statement.\Inslee's presidential campaign has about $1.2 million cash on hand, according to the most recent filings with the Federal Election Commission. That money could be transferred to his state campaign for governor in accordance with federal and Washington laws, if his campaign receives approval from donors for the transfer and those donors have not yet met the $2,000 contribution limit to a candidate for executive state office established by law.\Inslee has raised $974,705 to support a run for governor, according to the Washington Public Disclosure Commission. But he's also racked up expenses totaling $1.2 million.\Tina Podlodowski, chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Inslee's re-election bid in a statement Thursday morning.\""I am thrilled that Governor Inslee is seeking a third term, as are Democrats across our state, and I believe Washington will continue to prosper under his compassionate and visionary leadership,"" Podlodowski said in the statement.\Caleb Heimlich, chair of the Washington State Republican Party, also issued a statement on Twitter indicating a fight from the GOP for the office.\""Welcome back to Washington State @Jayinslee! The voters here still don't want a state income tax, don't want a carbon tax, and would love to see some real leadership in addressing traffic congestion and homelessness,"" Heimlich wrote. ""That's why we are looking for new leadership in 2020!""\A handful of Republicans had already filed to run in 2020 before Inslee's announcement. They include state Sen. Phil Fortunato of Auburn, and Loren Culp, the police chief of Republic, who has pushed back on a voter-approved initiative to limit sales of semiautomatic guns.\Though there's no term-limit on governors in Washington state, a third term for Inslee would be an outlier. The last and only Washington governor to hold the office for three terms was Gov. Daniel J. Evans, a Republican who served from 1965 to 1977.\Contact the writer:\(509) 459-5429\kiph@spokesman.com\inslee\CREDIT: Kip Hill The Spokesman-Review"
122,"
It's a reflection of the Port of Vancouver's desire to do the right thing that it held a public workshop last week to discuss how to handle crude oil safely, including how to clean up potential oil spills in the Columbia River.
\
The discussion stemmed from a proposal by Tesoro Corporation and Savage Companies to haul up to 280,000 barrels of crude oil per day from North Dakota to the port. From there, the companies would ship the oil to refineries in Washington, California and Alaska for domestic purposes, including gasoline for cars and trucks.
\
Port commissioners asked thoughtful questions.
\
As I jotted notes, though, I wondered if anyone was going to ask another question: Is it a good idea to set up a crude oil operation at the port, one that will continue to feed our fossil-fuel addiction and that will pump more carbon dioxide into the air we breathe?
\
No one did. Why? My guess is that it has to do with the business model in which the port -- and the rest of us, for that matter -- are housed. Or, as some might see it, trapped.
\
That model says we ought to keep fueling our economy by fouling the planet. Yes, we've deployed good measures, from both the public and private sectors, to soften the blow of altering the environment. But the model, as it pertains to torching fossil fuels, has budged very little.
\
And the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere recently passed a grim milestone: 400 parts per million. That's a level not seen in several million years.
\
If we continue to push past it, we'll witness seas swamping populations and increasingly extreme weather shredding places to pieces. And that's just a taste.
\
We're all part of human-produced global warming. But some institutions in our economic system play a much bigger, far more powerful role in it. As environmental activist Bill McKibben recently wrote: ""If those of us who are trying really hard (to tread lightly on the planet) are still fully enmeshed in the fossil fuel system, it makes it even clearer that what needs to change are not individuals but precisely that system. We simply can't move fast enough, one by one, to make any real difference in how the atmosphere comes out.""
\
So, what would a healthier environmental model look like? China's investments in wind and solar are promising advances in renewable energy. A carbon tax to encourage clean energy innovation deserves a serious examination. Cleaner-burning natural gas may work as a bridging mechanism.
\
Some powerful businesses and governments are waking up. The global insurer Munich Re doesn't doubt global warming. It's supporting efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
\
The Port of Vancouver possesses a strong green streak by supporting strong environmental processes and working to handle cargo responsibly and safely. But its purpose is to facilitate commerce, Theresa Wagner, the port's communications manager, told me. It's not to make ""moral judgments about cargo.""
\
Understood. But I would argue that the port and its commissioners need, perhaps now more than ever, to grapple with the morality of how we live and do business on this planet.
\
At the very least, the port -- a local government driven by global market forces but overseen by public investors (also known as voters and property taxpayers) -- ought to be willing to tackle a question that never got raised last week.
\
Asking the big question could lead to big answers.

123,"Editorial endorsements\Voters in Washington's 6th Legislative District have clear choices when they step into the ballot box. Jeff Holy, Mike Volz and Jenny Graham would best represent the region.\Jeff Holy for Senate\Republican Rep. Jeff Holy, running for the Senate seat left open by Sen. Mike Baumgartner's decision to step down to run for Spokane County treasurer, is a far better fit for the conservative, rural 6th District than his Democratic opponent, Jessa Lewis.\Holy, who served three terms in the House, is an experienced legislator with a pro-business record. He has devoted much of his time in office to promoting legislation that will improve economic development. He is also a staunch advocate of charter schools.\Professionally, Holy is an attorney and former Spokane police detective.\Lewis is a political novice who believes her experience in nonprofit work and as a government employee will help her get up to speed quickly in the Senate, but we have our doubts. Her progressive political views - pro-choice, pro-gun control, pro-welfare - aren't likely to sit well with the district's voters.\Holy has been a solid legislator throughout his three terms. He has worked hard for the district and represents it well. He has earned the chance to do more good work in the Senate. We endorse Jeff Holy.\Two newly formed political committees funded by conservatives are trying to convince progressives to write in Joe Pakootas instead of voting for Lewis. Pakootas, who is the state Democratic Party vice chairman, is not running and is telling friends not to write in his name. (https://bit.ly/2O3Lnsp)\Mike Volz for Position 1\Republican Rep. Mike Volz is facing Democratic challenger Kay Murano as he seeks a second term. We have policy differences with both candidates but believe that Volz is the better choice.\We didn't favor Volz in his run in 2016 because we feared he was sympathetic to the populist strain exemplified by Brexit, Donald Trump and a retreat by some Republicans on free trade. Thankfully, he has not proved to be that kind of reactionary in office. Instead, he has been a solid pro-business Republican with a strong commitment to education.\That said, we do have policy differences with him. For example, earlier this year he voted for a public records bill that would have kept legislators' calendars and other records secret from the public. Even as a member of the committee tasked with coming up with a new version, he seeks to create a loophole for some communication.\But we have even sharper disagreements with Murano, who has served as the executive director of the Spokane Low Income Housing Consortium for three years. Her desire to upend the tenant-landlord relationship across the state is problematic. Her proposal would put the hand of government on the scale in favor of tenants, creating strong disincentives for property owners to lease their units other than as Airbnbs.\She also supports three bad initiatives on the ballot for carbon taxes, gun regulations and making it easier to prosecute police officers involved in shootings.\Mike Volz is clearly the better choice.\Jenna Graham for Position 2\Two novices are running to replace Jeff Holy. Both Republican Jenny Graham and Democrat Dave Wilson have small-business backgrounds, which would bring a welcome perspective to the House. Though we think her anti-tax rhetoric tends to be a bit too strident, we believe Graham would make the better representative.\Graham's views on a variety of issues - government regulation, public safety, education and the environment - would bring a dose of conservative common sense to the House. She thinks the state has overreached on regulation, and it has. She would be a strong advocate for business and industry.\Wilson, who has run before as an independent, used to be a Republican and now wants to bring a voice of moderation into politics. He is right that many people in the center don't currently have a voice in government.\We also agree with his criticisms of the initiative process, which too often brings to vote matters that should be handled by the Legislature. But we vociferously disagree with his decision to support the three initiatives mentioned above - imposing a carbon tax, increasing gun control regulations and making it easier to prosecute officers involved in shootings.\Wilson would most likely be a more moderate voice in the Legislature than Graham, and that has some appeal. But, in the final analysis, we believe Graham would take positions on a multitude of issues that would better represent District 6 and better serve the state."

Battle climate change with I-732
\
Climate change presents us with a moral imperative. California has a raging wildfire again. Louisiana has now routine 500-year rainstorms. Zika is headed north, and ice is melting quickly on the North Pole. Just to mitigate the consequences of our warming planet, our window of opportunity is closing. Its time to act on climate now, instead of waiting.Thanks to a committed grass-roots effort, Washington can vote yes on I-732 this November. Based on the 2008 carbon tax passed in Vancouver, B.C., I-732 would drop our state sales tax by 1 percent, and replace that state revenue with a new carbon fee paid by big-time polluters. Most families will save $200 a year, and 400,000 low-income families will get the Earned Income Tax Credit. Once a price signal is put on large-scale carbon emissions, green energy like solar and wind will be incentivized.Future generations are depending on us. We have a moral obligation to act on climate now. No one else in Washington has delivered on significant climate legislation yet. We can change that, by passing I-732. Its time to make history.

Time to end fight against casino
\
Thank you for your Aug. 21 editorial, Know When to Fold em, concerning the Ilani Casino Resort now under construction by the Cowlitz Tribe. The Editorial Board of The Columbian has made a mature decision to drop their opposition to the project. Concerns remain, but as stated in the editorial, it is time to shift efforts toward mitigating those negatives.While the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde want to take the Cowlitz project to the U.S. Supreme Court, I think most lawyers would advise against filing suits designed to protect a gambling monopoly (for Northwest Oregon and Southwest Washington) that is the result of federal government treaty-making mistakes in the mid-1800s. Look at the tribal casinos clustered around Puget Sound to see that protection of tribal gambling monopolies is not likely to appear on the Supreme Courts agenda.Many Clark County residents are looking forward to the casino. We already have the Cathlapotle Plankhouse at the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge. This was opened in 2005 to show Native American life along the Columbia River prior to arrival of European traders.A community/nature center is now being planned for the refuge. The Ilani Casino Resort is less than 4 miles from the plankhouse; hopefully, displays at the casino will help explain Cowlitz tribal history to area visitors and residents.Ralph C. Edwards

Evergreen school board disappoints
\
I am very disappointed in the way the Evergreen school board approached Tuesday nights board meeting. The public was not given a chance to raise issues. Those who tried were shut down.The boards website states, District voters elect the five board members to represent the publics views and The board asks for citizen comments to permit audience members to raise district issues not listed on the agenda. The board did not allow for public comments, nor did they seem to care about the publics views to be able to represent them.The district sent a letter implying the negotiations are stuck on salary, leaving out all other issues our teachers are negotiating such as: lawfully required special ed aides; more counselors; curriculum in all schools; enticing substitute teachers so our children dont miss library, P.E. and/or music classes; a better health benefits package. It is not just salary as the district implied.The teachers are requesting begging for the district to do whats best for students. When a strike happens, the students suffer. Teachers suffer. Parents suffer. The whole community suffers. I hold onto hope that the mediator can bring the administration and union closer together on all key points.

Smears of Clinton are inaccurate
\
Typical of most Donald Trump supporters who have little positive to say about their candidate and instead resort to smears, lies and innuendos to try to undermine Hillary Clinton, Robert Kerrs Aug. 23 letter, Trump is the better option, was true to form.Clinton is one of the most hardworking, dedicated, knowledgeable and prepared candidates to seek the presidency. On the other hand, Trump is lazy, ignorant and overall the most unfit candidate ever to run. On top of that, hes incredibly unlikable, rude and intemperate. Combine that with a hair-trigger temper and hes exactly the opposite of what America needs in the White House.If Kerr had bothered to do his homework, just like Trump, in fact, Democratic presidents have produced much stronger economies. Need I mention the recent George Bush economic disaster it has taken eight years to recover from?His accusations about Chelsea Clinton are also false. She receives no zero compensation from the foundation for her work there. The Clintons did donate $1 million. Well never know what Trump has donated to charity because hes afraid to release his tax returns.Donald Trump cant trust him, not fit to lead.

\
Christmas is over, but for many who follow the state Legislature, the start of the year is another time to unfurl wish lists.
\
Lawmakers will convene in Olympia on Monday for a 105-day regular session. A lot will be said about reforming the state's education funding system, which the state Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional in 2012.
\
Beyond that, business groups have a number of familiar requests for the state, from patching local roads and state highways to keeping taxes on businesses low. Fixing the flow of interstate traffic - which could include replacing the Interstate 5 Bridge - remains a major desire. The Columbian reached out to some local groups to gauge their concerns ahead of the session.
\
Infrastructure and workforce development
\
The Columbia River Economic Development Council, the Greater Vancouver Chamber of Commerce and Identity Clark County have whittled their priorities to four sectors: infrastructure, workforce and education, environment, and economic development.
\
In terms of infrastructure, the marquee project is the 100-year-old Interstate 5 Bridge between Washington and Oregon. The loudest voices say the bridge interferes with interstate economy, both in terms of freight and general traffic.
\
CREDC President Mike Bomar said he also hopes to see fixes extended to state highways and well-trodden arterial streets.
\
""If we have challenges even on our small state highways, creating better circulation throughout the county"" will help economic development, Bomar said.
\
One such move might be enacting current transportation packages sooner than they are scheduled, such as the Connecting Washington package that was passed by lawmakers last year but won't kick in until 2024-25.
\
The CREDC will be interested to see how well Washington State University fares when it asks for funding on three projects: $600,000 for its proposed Life Sciences building in Vancouver, $5 million to expand its engineering program and $10.8 million for its new medical school. Similarly, the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges is asking for capital funding, including $5.2 million to help Clark College build an advanced manufacturing building for its new Boschma Farms campus in Ridgefield.
\
Bomar said the requests, if granted, could result in more skilled workers for the region.
\
""Education is closely tied to workforce,"" he said. ""It's not all about workforce, but in reality, the skills gap is huge and we want to make sure the solution addresses it to the extent that we can.""
\
The groups will also be looking for tax breaks, including exemptions for companies that spend a lot of money on research and development. The state offered such a tax credit until it expired in 2015. The business groups also support tax breaks for technology and aerospace manufacturers.
\
Port district support is another big wish, particularly the Port of Vancouver's Terminal 1 project at the waterfront and a high-speed fiber optic network at the Port of Ridgefield.
\
""The ports are designed to be economic development engines,"" said Vancouver chamber President John McDonagh. ""If the infrastructure that they're requesting is dealt with, then the economy is supported.""
\
Taxes: B&O and carbon
\
The Association of Washington Business, an Olympia-based lobby representing businesses statewide, said it will keep a close eye on Gov. Jay Inslee's budget proposal and his plans to address education funding.
\
Washington has been fined $100,000 per day after the state Supreme Court ruled in 2012 the state violated its own constitution by funding local school districts largely through local levies.
\
Among other things, the governor's proposed budget aims to raise business and occupation taxes from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent. The move could raise $2.2 billion in the 2017-19 biennium, according to the governor's office.
\
The tax would impact thousands of businesses that provide services, including restaurants, law firms, tattoo parlors, auto body shops and everything in between.
\
Gary Chandler, vice president of the AWB, said the tax increase would disproportionately affect rural businesses, which have not boomed like those in Seattle.
\
""As the governor's looking at putting this large tax increase together, most of the state is looking to come alive and not be in the recession,"" he said. The AWB represents about 8,000 businesses across the state.
\
The governor's budget also calls for new taxes on capital gains and carbon emissions. Chandler said he worries the carbon tax would raise utility costs which, combined with upcoming minimum wage increases and mandatory paid sick leave, are making it tougher for businesses.
\
""That small-business guy out there, it gets tough to really make it and be competitive this way,"" Chandler said. The Moses Lake native said he did not expect the budget to pass as is.
\
""I don't believe so. I would hope not because it would have a negative impact on a lot of us,"" he said.

Oregon Iron Works has increased its work force in Vancouver to handle a string of energy-related projects, including this bright yellow float for a prototype wave-energy buoy.

\
Southwest Washingtons emerging clean-technology industry could face long-term setbacks if the U.S. Congress fails to pass a comprehensive energy policy this year, state and local leaders say.
\
Both the House and Senate this session have debated energy bills that seek to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in some form, whether by establishing a carbon cap-and-trade system or a national renewable energy standard. But the proposals have so far failed to move forward.
\
The federal inaction has few immediate consequences to the clean technology industry in Washington, which has its own renewable energy and efficiency standards and has benefitted from large federal recovery act grants for energy projects, said Rogers Weed, director of the Washington Department of Commerce. But many companies are looking toward federal energy legislation as a signal that their investments will yield growth long term, he said.
\
Its an important market signal that would trigger a lot of activity, Weed said.
\
Room to grow
\
Vancouver-based NCS Power, which makes high-efficiency LED street lamps and replacement tubes for fluorescent commercial fixtures, recently landed its first large international order for 5,000 LED tubes, a deal worth several hundred thousand dollars. And it has hired several new employees in the past few months, bringing its total employment to 12, said Chief Executive Officer Bart Adams.
\
But instituting a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would help the company sell more of its products, Adams said.
\
Clients make decisions based on how long it takes for energy savings to equal the cost of installing all new fixtures.
\
Historically, most companies have looked for a return on investment within three years. But many cash-strapped businesses have lowered their return-on-investment threshold to 18 months, Adams said.
\
Without a price on carbon emissions, few companies see carbon reduction as adding to their bottom lines.
\
But the carbon reduction is just one of about 10 metrics NCS Power uses to calculate the financial return on its lighting systems, and so the federal delays arent slowing NCS down. NCS is just not growing as fast as it could.
\
Its not costing us business, Adams said, but it all helps.
\
Similarly, Oregon Iron Works has increased its work force in Vancouver to handle a string of energy-related projects, including a prototype wave-energy buoy, eight new 1,000-ton lift gates for the John Day hydroelectric dam and a nuclear shield door for the Hanford power plant. Company managers expect energy-related projects, which comprise about 10 percent of its business, to rise in coming years as the country increasingly turns to renewable sources of energy, said David Gibson, renewable energy program manager at Oregon Iron Works.
\
But its clients would likely be placing many more orders for renewable projects if a national energy standard was in place, he said.
\
Theres a considerable amount of risk (in these projects), Gibson said. So anything to mitigate that risk would help us.
\
Growth potential
\
Both companies belong to a growing clean-energy sector in Southwest Washington that includes solar industry giants such as Sharp and SEH America, as well as longtime manufacturers, such as Christensen Shipyards and Columbia Machine, that are retooling to compete for renewable energy contracts. The potential for further growth a proposed SEH expansion could create as many as 1,000 jobs has gained the attention of state and local officials.
\
Gov. Chris Gregoire has pegged the clean energy sector as one of a handful of industries with substantial job growth and economic development potential in coming years. And the Commerce Department has set a goal to increase clean-tech manufacturing in the state and boost exports to Asia.
\
Southwest Washington, with its proximity to the Columbia River Gorge and two major rail lines, is well situated to capitalize on that growth. The Port of Vancouver has already boosted its wind turbine imports, which accounted for 220 jobs and 56,000 Longshoreman hours in 2009.
\
The Columbia River Economic Development Council is working with the states clean energy leadership council to build the clean-tech sector in this region and across the state, said Bart Phillips, CEO of the CREDC. A preliminary report will be available in September.
\
In the absence of federal legislation, the state strategy will focus on upping state mandates and purchases to meet its goals for the sector, Weed said.
\
Some argue that the states renewable energy standard has provided enough incentive to Washington businesses, however. What the states clean-tech industry needs now is a more favorable business climate in general, including lower taxes, said Gary Chandler, a lobbyist for the Association of Washington Business.
\
Competition has made it cheaper to import (wind turbines) than to make them, Chandler said. The state needs to look at policy here to make it a better environment for manufacturing. Wed have a lot more people employed in Vancouver right now if we made the technology here.
\
Lack of incentives
\
Regardless of the states economic development plans, the exact effects of a national comprehensive energy plan on the states clean-tech sector is unclear. The likelihood that carbon regulations will pass this year among a slowing economic recovery is increasingly slim. Supporters have so far failed to garner votes from states that still meet most of their energy needs with coal and natural gas-fired plants, which are among the largest carbon emitters. Leaders from these states argue charging extra for carbon emissions is too costly for utilities and businesses to implement.
\
At one level, a national cap and trade will have some increased costs to our businesses, Phillips said. It will (also) level the playing field, and without it, its going to be difficult to stimulate the clean-energy market for us to sell goods and services to.
\
Most state and local officials agree, however, that putting a price on carbon would spur more demand for clean technologies and help the industry grow. This would happen, in part, by offsetting federal subsidies that make it hard for renewables to compete with oil and gas. It would also lower the risk that companies face in investing in new manufacturing facilities and new technologies.
\
If theres no federal legislation, the incentives go away, said Rep. Brian Baird, D-Wash., during a recent visit to Vancouver. It sets us back economically. Its costing us jobs.

127,"Take action on climate change\I agree that the United States must act on climate change and our local politicians have the power and duty to do so. One important step that Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, could do is to join the House Climate Solutions Caucus. This bipartisan group is educating itself and other legislators on the science of climate change and common-sense solutions.She and her staff could also talk with the Conservative Climate Leadership Council about their carbon fee and dividend proposal. This is one of the carbon ""tax"" ideas being discussed as the most effective actions the nation could take. The group Citizen's Climate Lobby also proposes a carbon fee, not tax, to keep the money out of the hands of the government and go right back to households in the form of a check. Yes, we would all get a check in the mail. It's a great proposal that has growing national support. Vancouver will not escape the consequences of a warming planet.\Dawn Kropp\vancouver\Welcome investment at the port\The Columbian is not telling the whole story about the proposed oil terminal at the Port of Vancouver. All we hear about is jobs vs. the environment, plus the mud-slinging associated with the election (nothing new there).Oil and its products are an essential component of our economy. Everyone uses products from oil in one form or another, like fuel, lubricants, plastics and other chemicals, not to mention kayaks and rappelling lines.Vancouver Energy would help their cause by telling how the terminal project is economically worthwhile for the port and the region, besides jobs. How much is the port getting to handle the oil, partly compensating for the environmental risks?The NIMBY effect. The terminal is an attempt to get crude oil more efficiently to a market that is running out of supplies. If the terminal is unsuccessful, the oil will go through the other Vancouver, a significant economic loss for this Vancouver.The chilling effect that denying a major investment here would have on other projects that might come down the road. Some say they want only ""clean"" jobs, but we usually do not get to decide how and where others invest their money. These same people complain about jobs and investments exiting the United States. We are doing it to ourselves.\Robin Ruzek\vancouver\Tax cut is part of nefarious plan\The Republican tax cut bill slashes taxes for the rich and the corporations.

Bush slashed taxes the rich got richer, but all the middle class got was the Great Recession.But this is just the first part of a two-part plan. Next year, with the tax cuts firmly entrenched, the $1.5 trillion debt that is OK today will become completely unaffordable. And the tax cuts won't be the problem. The only way to save the country from ruinous debt will be to make big cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This is not an unintended consequence. It is exactly what they are planning in the back room. They may even think they can do it without Democratic votes.We need to stop this in its tracks. At the very least, we need to take the House of Representatives away from the Republicans in 2018. But it may be too late.\David Keith\vancouver\Herrera Beutler doesn't earn support\On Nov. 3, (Our Readers' Views) two writers both said the truth about our congressional representative, Jaime Herrera Beutler, although the authors disagreed whether she should be re-elected.Ron McKnight of Camas reminds us that she performs many services concerning citizens' needs, which is true, however this is a tactic to distract us from her primary goals of getting re-elected by getting financial support from the billionaire class.Robert Poole of Vancouver reminds us that she and her office staff are keeping their distance from us, her constituents, by refusing to meet or to answer inquiries beyond specific local requests. This is my experience also.Her true alliances are illustrated by her refusal to respond to inquiries about support for the GOP tax plan, which The Columbian reported as giving $1.5 trillion to corporations by lowering rates and abolishing the alternate minimum tax, and $867 billion to individual wealthy citizens by abolishing the AMT and the estate tax.I believe that most of us will not pass on an estate worth more than $11 million, nor are we affected by the AMT because our tax deductions are not creative. So if you have an estate over $11 million and have to pay AMT, please support her. Otherwise consider a less elite alternative.\Michael E. McGinley\washougal\Demand gun regulation now\Fueled since 1977 with power, money and incredible influence, the NRA spews a vile brew of lies, facile mantras, and forced annihilation of all who fail to hew to their catechism of guns, always guns, all kinds of guns, before reason, safety, common sense or reality. It has resulted in a pit filled with the blood of babies, first-grade children, high school students, young adults in college, all ages in movie theaters, shoppers in malls, politicians on ball fields, churchgoers in their pews, people walking, people driving, people sitting.When is enough enough for you? When will you demand that your government representatives pull up their grown-up pants and confront the bullies who now occupy the executive suites of the NRA and their acolytes in government.\Lois Murphy\vancouver"
128,"OLYMPIA - The 105-day legislative session in Washington state begins Monday, with lawmakers set to write a new two-year budget.\Unlike previous years, when satisfying a court mandate on education funding was their driving focus, lawmakers return to Olympia this year with a variety of costly issues on their plate.\While the latest forecast showed state revenues for the next two-year cycle increasing to $50 billion, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has said that additional revenue is needed to fund priority issues like mental health and other programs in addition to maintaining government services at current levels, including billions previously dedicated toward the state's education system.\A part of that ongoing cost is the investment the Legislature has made in basic education as part of a multi-year court case - known as the McCleary case - that was resolved last year.\As part of his budget plan unveiled last month, Inslee's revenue proposals included an increase in the business and occupation tax on services provided by accountants, attorneys, real estate agents and others and a new state capital gains tax, a proposal that is certain to face pushback from Republicans and even some Democrats.\Democrats increased their margins in both legislative chambers after the November election, and now hold a 28-21 majority in the Senate and a 57-41 edge in the House.\Leaders in the House and Senate will release their budget plans in the coming months and will work to negotiate a final budget before the session concludes at the end of April.\Here are some of the issues lawmakers will be grappling with this session:\MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING: Inslee has proposed $675 million in spending over the next two years to address the state's behavioral health system, including expanding treatment options and additional housing support. The governor's plan includes funding for his previously announced plan to move people hospitalized on civil commitments out of the state's two psychiatric hospitals and into beds at facilities in the community. Western State Hospital - an 850-plus bed facility in Lakewood - has been plagued with problems and has lost its certification by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and federal funding after it repeatedly failed health and safety inspections. Republican Sen. Steve O'Ban has said lawmakers must consider behavioral health policy and funding to be a ""McCleary-level"" legislative priority. Lawmakers in both chambers say there will be a bipartisan effort to address the problem.\EDUCATION: While the state Supreme Court no longer holds jurisdiction over the state's funding of K-12 education, the ongoing costs from final compliance with that multiyear lawsuit continue with the future budget. Lawmakers and Inslee have said there's more work to be done on basic education. There have been bipartisan calls for addressing special education program funding. Inslee's budget proposal calls for a $146 million increase in spending on special education in the next two-year budget. There will also be a push from some local school districts arguing that the current local tax caps that were part of the legislative plan on education are unsustainable and will lead to budget shortfalls in the districts.\ENVIRONMENT: Among the climate change measures Inslee has proposed is eliminating fossil fuels like natural gas and coal from the state's electricity supply by 2045. After voters rejected a carbon tax at the ballot in November, there doesn't appear to be any desire to take that up this year. Another major effort would implement a clean fuel standard - similar to a California program - by requiring fuel producers and importers to reduce the carbon emissions associated with transportation fuels. Inslee has included $268 million in his proposed two-year budget to pay for his clean energy initiatives. The efforts include boosting electric vehicle use, promoting more energy-efficient buildings and phasing out hydrofluorocarbon commonly used for refrigeration. Inslee also has called for increased funding for salmon recovery and water quality projects in part to help the state's struggling orca population. Democratic lawmakers in both chambers have already introduced bills on several proposals.\SEXUAL HARASSMENT: In the wake of the #MeToo movement, the House and Senate moved forward with work groups focused on addressing sexual harassment at the Capitol. Those groups have made a variety of recommendations, including the hiring of an independent human resources office where complaints can be lodged. In the past year, four lawmakers in the state have either lost re-election or announced their resignation following accusations ranging from rape to harassment. Sen. Kevin Ranker, a Democrat from Orcas Island, sent a letter to Gov. Jay Inslee's office late Friday saying that he was resigning ""with a heavy heart"" following allegations of improper conduct. He wrote that his resignation was effective immediately. Lawmakers have said they'll continue their work on the issue in the new session, including moving forward with a process to hire a nonpartisan human resources officer who can independently investigate complaints of harassment or discrimination.\PUBLIC RECORDS: A year after Washington lawmakers attempted to exempt themselves from the state's Public Records Act, a few have said they intend to address transparency at the Legislature this year. The debate over legislative records was sparked by last year's ruling by a Thurston County Superior Court judge, who found that while the Washington Legislature, the House and Senate were not subject to the Public Records Act, the statute was clear that the offices of individual lawmakers were covered by the law. That ruling has been appealed, and is awaiting arguments before the state Supreme Court. Inslee vetoed last year's exemption bill after a public outcry. A public records task force formed following the veto met four times last year, and agreed the Legislature should be more transparent.\CREDIT: RACHEL LA CORTE"
129,"Herrera Beutler is all talk\Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler's statement about Russian interference in our elections is about worth a stack of S&H Green Stamps. The U.S. House of Representatives, which she is a member of, now voted to not fund states with outdated voting machines. Forty states still use outdated machines and 13 states do not have paper backup. This puts our electoral process at great risk. Republicans for some reason have an issue with this, just like the con man president to whom they have sworn their allegiance. HR 6147, which Herrera Beutler voted against, would have used funds to help safeguard our upcoming elections.\As usual, she's all talk and no action. What do Republicans fear about having proper voting machines? Something's up.\Lynn Brown\Vancouver\Support Erickson for utility\As a capital project manager for Clark County, I recommend voting for Sherry Erickson as PUD commissioner because she has over 22 years of engineering and business experience, with emphasis being placed on transparency, accountability, fiscal responsibility and environmental stewardship. Erickson is not afraid of the tough questions, has a can-do attitude and will make herself accessible and approachable. She is an innovative, driven, self-motivating, working-class woman who has accepted this challenge to serve the people. Vote for Sherry Erickson if you'd like to see the utility landscape evolve, be challenged, be consistent, and, most importantly, affordable to all.\Scot Brantley\Vancouver\Boldt off base on marijuana\Reading the interview with the candidates for Clark County Council chair, specifically Marc Boldt's answer regarding the legalization of marijuana, tells me he isn't qualified to hold the position. There have been many studies, over a long period of time, about the health effects of marijuana, and the majority of them indicate it's much less harmful than alcohol and, especially, cigarettes, yet those are available everywhere. If he wants to keep his head in the sand, that's fine, but maybe next time decline to answer so as to not display his ignorance on a subject he apparently doesn't know much about.\Harold A. Lay\Vancouver\Support Kraft for Legislature\Vicki Kraft has been a responsive, dedicated representative voice in Olympia, proposing legislation to reduce tax and regulatory burden on small businesses, be tough on sex crimes, and allow farmers to retire without facing financial penalties. She helped defeat the carbon tax which would have resulted in higher gas and utilities prices. Kraft says “no” to tolls on Interstate 5. If re-elected, she will continue to work for funding a school resource officer in every K-12 school, property-tax relief, the effective use of education dollars, improving student outcomes, and targeting sex trafficking criminals.

130,"6th Legislative District Senate seat\A would-be newcomer to the Washington State Senate faces a former police officer and current state representative a race for what appears to be a close race in Washington's 6th Legislative District seat.\The seat has been held by a Republican since sitting Sen. Michael Baumgartner defeated Democratic incumbent Chris Marr in 2010. Republican Rep. Jeff Holy said his six years of experience representing the district in the House, as well as his work on the Higher Education and Public Safety Committee, has prepared him for the ""cowboy atmosphere"" of the Senate.\""I'm on my third term in the House and I think I've just achieved journeyman status,"" he said.\His opponent, Jessa Lewis, said she already knows how to navigate issues in Olympia due to her work in energy security at Joint Base Lewis McCord, her leadership experience at the Washington location for the nonprofit Healthcare for All, and environmental advocacy. She said she believes her governmental and nonprofit work will help her understand how the Senate operates, but her other work experience as a park ranger, cannabis delivery driver and food service worker will help her understand the practical needs of the people in her district.\""I'm able to draw on direct experience to actually inform my policy and where I see things need to go,"" she said.\The 6th Legislative District encompasses Cheney, Airway Heights, Medical Lake and western portions of Spokane. Holy, a former Spokane Police detective and lawyer, earned 62.9 percent of the district's vote in the last election, defeating Democrat Shar Lichty, an organizer at the Peace and Justice Action League of Spokane.\But he appears to be in a much tighter race this year. In the August primary, Holy won by 4.5 percentage pointage points over Lewis, taking 52 percent of the district's vote.\Holy said, if elected, he likely would end up on the Public Safety Committee because of his years working in law enforcement, but he would like to continue his work to make higher education more affordable for students from different backgrounds.\While in the House, Holy was the primary sponsor of a bipartisan opportunity scholarship bill that was introduced in 2017 and signed into law near the end of the 2018 session. Holy also has sponsored or co-sponsored several unsuccessful higher education bills, including a bill designed to strengthen privacy protections for survivors of sexual assault on college campuses and the Academic Bill of Rights, which would have codified more free-speech protections on campuses.\Both candidates said the Legislature's solution to the state Supreme Court's McCleary ruling, which found that the state was not properly funding K-12 education, may not be sustainable in the long term.\Lewis said the body should have explored other funding solutions, such as a capital gains tax, to adequately fund education.\Holy said the state's four-year budgeting requirement for school districts may not have been the type of oversight school districts need while negotiating salaries for staff, which the state will eventually have to pay for.\""They had the authority, we had the responsibility,"" he said. ""I don't see that long-lived.""\Holy had an excused absence when the Legislature voted for the 2017 budget that signficantly boosted education funding and revamped the calculations for how property taxes pay for schools.\Lewis said she grew up in the area and understands Republicans because she once identified as one. After an unplanned pregnancy she ended up homeless for a time, but through government assistance programs, access to higher education and help from friends, was able to give her daughter a better life.\""It was actually the social safety net that enabled my daughter and I to get back on our feet,"" she said.\She said she still has an independent spirit and holds many of the same values, but now supports more progressive issues, such as access to abortion and social programs.\Holy said he couldn't support abortion due to his Catholic faith and has co-sponsored several unsuccessful bills restricting it. He also co-sponsored Washington's version of the ""Bathroom Bill,"" which would have allowed businesses to restrict access to their facilities based on sex and gender. Holy said the bill wasn't designed to disadvantage people who identify differently from the sex they are assigned at birth, but rather for the comfort and safety of others using those facilities.\Of the initiatives on Washington's ballot, Lewis said she supported the carbon fee, 1-1631, and a new gun initiative, I-1639, which would require enhanced background checks for semi-automatic rifles, a one-day waiting period and firearms training course. It also would raise the age to purchase semiautomatic rifles to 21 and require gun owners to keep their weapons secured at home. Lewis said she is a gun owner, but wants to see more legislation to ensure firearms don't make it into the wrong hands.\Both Holy and Lewis said they would not vote for the grocery tax initiative, which would bar local governments from taxing basic food and toiletry items, saying the state shouldn't be telling local governments what taxes they are allowed to collect.\Holy said he would not vote for the carbon tax or I-1639, saying the safe-storage component could criminalize people whose fire arms were taken from their homes and used illegally and it may not stop gun violence.\Both said they would like to see more state investment in their district. Holy said he hoped his work would create an environment where young graduates from Spokane's colleges could feel like they would easily find employment in their industry if they stayed in the area. Lewis said she hoped to see more investment in policing and infrastructure in Medical Lake to support local governments where large state facilities like Eastern State Hospital are located.\Contact the writer:\(509) 459-5039\rebeccaw@spokesman.com\6th Legislative District Senate seat\Jeff Holy Party: Republican\Age: 62\City: Spokane\Career: Attorney.

131,"DO YOU SUPPORT A CARBON EMISSIONS TAX LIKE THE ONE PROPOSED IN INITIATIVE 732? WHY OR WHY NOT?\GOODSPACEGUY\No. Life on earth is carbon based and CO2 is really, really good for plants.\BILL HIRT\No. Carbon tax is a fraud and we get 70 percent of our power from hydro.\MARY MARTIN\No, all the taxes are regressive and shift the economic burden of capitalism onto workers.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\No. Believes in global warming. Thinks tax should be revenue neutral and doesn't think this one will be.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\No, state shouldn't tax a company because it puts out carbon. Thinks initiative is poorly written.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes. Also wants organic systems to take carbon from the atmosphere.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Some tax on carbon makes sense but a better idea is to stop drilling and put money into renewables.\JAY INSLEE\State must lead on climate change but this measure would have a net loss in state revenue and an unacceptable fiscal impact on education and other priorities.\BILL BRYANT\No. It's an untested and unpredictable source of funding that will have a negative impact on jobs with minimal improvements to carbon emissions.\WOULD YOU SUPPORT REPLACING THE BUSINESS AND OCCUPATION TAX ON GROSS RECEIPTS WITH ANOTHER TAX? IF SO, WHAT TAX?\GOODSPACEGUY\Yes. Would reduce overall tax burden and consider a ""head tax"" everyone pays.\BILL HIRT\No strong opinion either way.\MARY MARTIN\Debates around this have nothing to do with what the working class is facing.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\B&O tax is goofy. Would phase it out in favor of corporate and individual income tax and a simpler system overall.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\No. Some people complain about it but it's better than other states' systems.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes. Would replace with a speculation tax on the financial world and toxicity tax on industries that damage the environment.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Favors a constitutional amendment with an income tax on the top 10 percent, and bringing the sales and B&O tax down as the income tax revenue goes up.\JAY INSLEE\The tax is problematic but there's no obvious replacement with significant support. Should be part of larger discussion on modernizing tax system.\BILL BRYANT\It hits small business hard, particularly in communities like Spokane where almost 65 percent of employers have four employees or fewer. I would be open to considering alternatives.\DO YOU AGREE WITH THE STATE SUPREME COURT'S MCCLEARY DECISION THAT THE STATE HAS NOT PROPERLY FUNDED PUBLIC SCHOOLS? IF SO, HOW WOULD YOU PAY FOR CHANGES IN 2017-19?\GOODSPACEGUY\No. 50 percent of budget already goes to education and that's way too much.\BILL HIRT\Doesn't think the Supreme Court can dictate to the Legislature what to do.\MARY MARTIN\Education is a class-divided question. The state under capitalism is not interested in real education.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\Yes. Implement a capital gains tax and income tax to change the most regressive tax system and diversify it before the next recession.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\Yes. Don't need more revenue. If the budget was audited, the state would find all the money it needs.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes. If the system is restructured to promote home schooling, the speculation tax and toxicity tax would provide more than enough money for teacher raises.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Yes. State needs a new tax source but the poor and the middle class can't pay more. Any new tax should go first to education.\JAY INSLEE\State has already made bipartisan improvements to education but has more to do. Tough choices include not relying on local levies to fund basic education, boosting teacher pay and smaller class sizes.\BILL BRYANT\Calls inequities between rich and poor school districts morally wrong and unconstitutional, but calls for more leadership. Will propose a plan that ensures equal funding for every student, regardless of where they live and restructures high school.\DO YOU SUPPORT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION'S RULE THAT ALLOWS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE TO USE PUBLIC FACILITIES BASED ON THEIR GENDER IDENTITY?\GOODSPACEGUY\They should be able to use whichever facility they identify with.\BILL HIRT\No. Thinks that's an insult.\MARY MARTIN\Ambivalent. Defends the right of people to be free of harassment but believes parents are deeply concerned about predators.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\Yes. Although parents worry about their children and predators, doubts people will go through process of becoming transgender just to walk into the restroom of another sex.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\Believes state should encourage businesses to just build third bathrooms for transgender people.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes, although the best solution would be a third bathroom option.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Yes. They've been doing it for years without problems. It's a nonissue.\JAY INSLEE\Yes. State has always been a leader in fight against discrimination and can't go backward now.\BILL BRYANT\Commission overstepped its authority. Transgender people and children using restrooms both should be treated with dignity and that's the responsibility of the Legislature to develop in an open process.\DO YOU BELIEVE THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE RAISED, AND IF SO BY HOW MUCH?\GOODSPACEGUY\No. The minimum wage makes it difficult for people to get work and should be abolished.\BILL HIRT\No. It's good at the current level.\MARY MARTIN\The national minimum wage needs to go to $15 an hour, but workers need unions to negotiate contracts with higher wages.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\Yes. Supports $13.50 an hour by 2020, but would also support a little higher, a little faster.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\It should be raised, but on a sliding scale based on a company's revenue, because smaller businesses can't afford $15 an hour.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes. At least $15 an hour or more.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Yes, phased in to $15 over 5 years.\JAY INSLEE\Yes. Supports initiative to raise to $13.50 by 2020 and ensure paid sick leave for every worker.\BILL BRYANT\Supported increases in SeaTac and King County, but doesn't support one-size-fits all increase for entire state because it could cut workers' hours or benefits and could raise prices.\Note: Candidates David Blomstrom and Patrick O'Rourke declined to participate or did not respond in time for publication.

132,"Also today\Washington legislators return to Olympia on Monday expecting more money to flow into state coffers than ever before, but with demands to spend even more.\After a decade in which Republicans reduced large Democratic majorities in the House to a razor-thin margin and even put together a coalition in the House to force a coalition government, Democrats have comfortable majorities in both chambers and a governor pushing a progressive agenda on health care, environmental protection and workplace policies.\But Gov. Jay Inslee doesn't seem to be positioning himself to be the first governor in nearly a half-century to seek a third term. His sights may be set higher, at the other Washington on the other side of the country. Inslee, for his part, contends that his agenda is driven by the state's growing population, previously established but expensive improvements to the public school system and programs that were cut drastically in the recession and should now be restored.\""To govern is to choose,"" is likely to be Inslee's mantra for the session. The array of choices will be large and varied starting with the budget, which as lawmakers are wont to say, is really a policy document. Here are some issues to watch in the next few months:\Money\For the first time in history, Washington is on track to spend more than $50 billion in its general operating budget over the next two years. A strong economy means the state can expect to collect about $4 billion more in taxes and fees than it did in the 2017-19 biennium. But Inslee's budget office says that extra money is more than consumed by the rising cost of public schools, demand for services and proposed raises for state workers. Inslee's new proposals to expand education, environmental and mental health programs could run another $4 billion. To balance a budget with all those new and existing programs, he's proposing an increase in the business and occupation tax for service industries, and instituting a capital gains tax on annual investment income of more than $25,000 for an individual or $50,000 for a couple.\What to watch: What tax plans the House and Senate budgets have when they are released in March.\Education\For the first time in nearly a decade, a new Legislature convenes without the threat of Washington Supreme Court sanctions for inadequately supporting public schools hanging over its collective head. Lawmakers approved a massive education overhaul, known as the McCleary fix after the court case, in a marathon 2017 session and adjusted the property tax provisions that accompanied the fix last year.\Legislators acknowledged McCleary was a start, not a finish. They will have proposals to improve or expand special education, early childhood programs, school counseling and workplace training programs, expand training for high school graduates who aren't seeking jobs that require two- or four-year degrees, and wish lists from the state colleges and universities.\What to watch: Some school districts are struggling under the new property tax rules and will be seeking relief this year, and some legislators will try to lower the majority needed for school construction bonds to 50 percent.\Mental health\The state faces a federal judge's order to limit the time a person under arrest and facing court-ordered psychiatric examination can remain in jail before that testing begins at a secure mental health facility. Slots for such ""forensic"" services are limited at Eastern State and Western State hospitals, but expanding them and upgrading the aging facilities is expensive. Inslee has an extensive multiyear plan to shift in-patient mental and behavioral health services from the two large state hospitals to smaller community-based facilities. Washington also has a shortage of trained mental health professionals available to meet the needs of the state facilities and plans to increase their numbers range from creating a new teaching psychiatric hospital to improving the process for certifying workers from other states interested in coming to Washington.\What to watch: Democratic efforts to increase spending could be met with Republican criticism of how tens of millions of dollars in recent years has been spent without satisfying court orders.\Environment\For the first time in several years, there's no proposal for a financial penalty aimed at cutting the use of fossil fuels, like a carbon tax, carbon fee or cap-and-trade system. Instead, Inslee is proposing a series of regulations and incentives to reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase cleaner energy sources like solar and wind generation and electric vehicles. The Legislature already has several proposals to limit the use of plastics, including statewide bans on plastic grocery bags and single-use plastic straws.\The southern resident orca population is dropping to dangerous levels, and to save it Inslee has an array of proposals to clean up the Puget Sound, restrict tourist access to that particular pod and increase the orcas' main source of food, salmon. Inslee also wants a task force to study whether removing Snake River dams would lead to a significant increase in salmon runs, weighing it against the loss of dams that are not powered by fossil fuels and seeking input from supporters and opponents of breaching the dams.\What to watch: Whether the Legislature will address environmental concerns piecemeal with a series of targeted bills or an omnibus plan.\Guns\Voters approved new restrictions on the sale of semi-automatic rifles and requirements for safe storage of firearms in the home. But lawmakers could consider other gun-related legislation, including a bill to allow the Washington State Patrol to destroy guns it confiscates, a ban on magazines that carry more than 10 rounds, a ban on untraceable guns created by 3D printers and a proposal to allow schools to allow employees to carry firearms on campus after an approved training program.\What to watch: House Democrats had slim majorities in recent sessions without the votes to pass gun-control measures with no GOP support. Their new majority is larger and fueled by progressive freshmen who may be more likely to vote yes.\Initiatives\Two initiatives - one to make $30 the limit once again for vehicle license tabs and one to re-establish some affirmative action policies - probably have enough signatures to be sent to the Legislature. If lawmakers don't pass them, they go on the November ballot; if they think they have a better alternative, the original and the revised versions go on the ballot. They will try to amend last year's initiative on police use of deadly force, which voters passed in November.\What to watch: The deadly force alternative may have the two-thirds majority needed to amend a newly passed initiative. The House is set to hold a hearing on it the first day of the session. Initiative 1000, the affirmative action proposal, might get a vote. Initiative 976, the car tab measure, probably will go to the ballot, although the Legislature may consider separate bills that cover some of the same ground, like the motor vehicle excise tax levied in Snohomish, King and Pierce counties for Sound Transit.\Contact the writer:\(360) 664-2598\jimc@spokesman.com\Legislature\CREDIT: Jim Camden The Spokesman-Review"
133,"After ousting incumbent David Taylor from his state House of Representatives seat in August's primary election, voters in Washington's 15th Legislative District will decide who they want to replace him in next month's general election.\They must decide between Republican Jeremie Dufault and Democrat A.J. Cooper, two Selah residents who are vying for the Position 2 seat Taylor held for nearly a decade.\Dufault, a real estate developer, won 45.7 percent of the vote in August's primary election; while Cooper, a fitness instructor, won 26 percent. Taylor, a Republican from Moxee, won 23.2 percent.\The 15th District covers parts or all of Selah, Yakima, Terrace Heights, Moxee, Union Gap, Wapato, Toppenish, Zillah, Granger, Sunnyside, Grandview and Mabton. As of 2010, about 133,000 people lived in the district.\Ballots for the election will be mailed out Oct. 19. They will need to be postmarked or dropped off at one of several ballot drop boxes in the county by 8 p.m. Nov. 6. Voters in the 15th Legislative District will also decide the outcome of a race for the district's Position 1 House seat, and a race for the district's single state Senate seat.\For this race, the Yakima Herald-Republic asked each candidate for their positions on issues that likely will arise in the next legislative session.\In light of higher teacher salaries and less local funding, what else needs to be done with the McCleary ruling?\Dufault: We need to roll back property taxes from McCleary, impose the 3.1 percent cap on salary increases for teachers, reduce property taxes at the state level and keep the local levy cap in place. We also need to reform the way we fund school construction, and put in place operating efficiencies within closely located school districts so that we're not doing duplicated services like bus service and administrative services across geographically similar and proximate areas. I also feel we need a statewide salary schedule and that teachers in rural areas need to be given incentive to teach in rural areas. The way McCleary came down is that teachers get paid more in Seattle than they do in Yakima County, and I think that should be reversed. You want to attract good teachers by offering them higher pay, and you also want to give teachers a reason to teach in more challenging schools. A lot of our rural schools have more children below the poverty line, therefore those are the ones that are going to statistically have more disciplinary issues and be more challenging to teach in. You need to incentivize teachers to teach in those schools as opposed to schools in say, Bellevue.\Cooper: The McCleary ruling was about funding those basic educational needs. Now, I would like to see more done in the classrooms to meet every student's needs. We still have parents who have to move around to meet their child's needs because they're not fitting into the status quo classroom. Also, I would like to see some flexibility in the classroom. We have a lot of unique needs in the Valley. When it comes to education, it's not always just about funding. And we definitely need to make sure that teachers make a livable wage. They've gone years without a cost-of-living adjustment, so we need to make sure we keep up with the cost of living.\If voters turn down the carbon tax initiative, what should be the Legislature's next step? What if voters approve it?\Dufault: The next step should be nothing. But what will it be? They'll basically propose the exact same language as legislation in the next session. If voters approve it, the Legislature should reverse it. It's a very unwise mandate. All of the costs are going to be borne by the state of Washington, but whatever marginal, microscopic benefit that will come will be for the whole world. That does not make sense to me. It's a feel-good initiative and I understand the motivation behind it because I, too, want clean air for my children. I get the emotional argument, but the fiscal and nexus arguments are not there.\Cooper: We need to do something about climate change. I know there are some changes happening in the agricultural industry. Some industries are making those changes. Some of our smaller farmers in the area and some small businesses are taking those steps to be green, and I would like to see tax incentives for them. When I see taxes, I want them to be invested back into the state's economy and our environment. I really like these small and local business tax incentives. If we're going to have money flowing out, we're going to need to have money flowing in. I would live to also see some diversification in the state's revenue. Part of our problem right now is that we don't have diverse revenue. I would like to see some simplification in our government. I feel funding could come from making our government agencies more efficient. For example, we have eight agencies overseeing our foreign guest workers. I think one agency would be less costly and more efficient. If the carbon fee doesn't get approved, we have to look at more diverse streams of revenue. If it gets approved, let's see what happens and go from there.\Should legislators comply with the state's Public Records Act? Will you support recommendations coming out of the Public Records Task Force?\Dufault: Yes, there should not be a legislative exemption to the open public records and open public meetings acts for the Legislature. As for supporting recommendations from the task force, it would depend on what those recommendations are.\Cooper: Yes, I do not feel the Legislature should be exempt from that. As a legislator, I would be employed by the people and they deserve to know what I'm doing. I would have to see any recommendations before I knew if I could support them.\What can you do to respect gun rights while limiting gun violence? Do you favor regulating sales of ammunition or banning large capacity magazines?\Dufault: The Legislature can play a role in protecting our children in schools, which in my opinion is the most concerning aspect of gun violence. We need to focus on doing things at the schools themselves - such as providing common access points, which will prevent people from bringing guns into schools undetected - rather than focusing on the guns. I'm opposed to any new restrictions on responsible gun owners.\Cooper: Gun rights and reducing gun violence are not just a one-sided issue. With Initiative 1639, I like the parts about the gun dealers needing to keep their guns safely stored and holding people accountable. This issue tends to get linked a lot with mental illness. There are some issues when it comes to mental illness and gun violence, but that's not always the case. Again, having those safety precautions to keep the guns out of the wrong hands is one thing, but also dealing with our society is the other. I don't have a problem with gun ownership at all. But we need to start building a healthy society right now and that starts with our children. I support banning high capacity magazines, but when it comes to ammunition I'd need to see specific legislative language.\Dufault\Cooper\CREDIT: Alec Regimbal"
134,"6th Legislative District Senate seat\A would-be newcomer to the Washington State Senate faces a former police officer and current state representative a race for what appears to be a close race in Washington's 6th Legislative District seat.\The seat has been held by a Republican since sitting Sen. Michael Baumgartner defeated Democratic incumbent Chris Marr in 2010. Republican Rep. Jeff Holy said his six years of experience representing the district in the House, as well as his work on the Higher Education and Public Safety Committee, has prepared him for the ""cowboy atmosphere"" of the Senate.\""I'm on my third term in the House and I think I've just achieved journeyman status,"" he said.\His opponent, Jessa Lewis, said she already knows how to navigate issues in Olympia due to her work in energy security at Joint Base Lewis McCord, her leadership experience at the Washington location for the nonprofit Healthcare for All, and environmental advocacy. She said she believes her governmental and nonprofit work will help her understand how the Senate operates, but her other work experience as a park ranger, cannabis delivery driver and food service worker will help her understand the practical needs of the people in her district.\""I'm able to draw on direct experience to actually inform my policy and where I see things need to go,"" she said.\The 6th Legislative District encompasses Cheney, Airway Heights, Medical Lake and western portions of Spokane. Holy, a former Spokane Police detective and lawyer, earned 62.9 percent of the district's vote in the last election, defeating Democrat Shar Lichty, an organizer at the Peace and Justice Action League of Spokane.\But he appears to be in a much tighter race this year. In the August primary, Holy won by 4.5 percentage pointage points over Lewis, taking 52 percent of the district's vote.\Holy said, if elected, he likely would end up on the Public Safety Committee because of his years working in law enforcement, but he would like to continue his work to make higher education more affordable for students from different backgrounds.\While in the House, Holy was the primary sponsor of a bipartisan opportunity scholarship bill that was introduced in 2017 and signed into law near the end of the 2018 session. Holy also has sponsored or co-sponsored several unsuccessful higher education bills, including a bill designed to strengthen privacy protections for survivors of sexual assault on college campuses and the Academic Bill of Rights, which would have codified more free-speech protections on campuses.\Both candidates said the Legislature's solution to the state Supreme Court's McCleary ruling, which found that the state was not properly funding K-12 education, may not be sustainable in the long term.\Lewis said the body should have explored other funding solutions, such as a capital gains tax, to adequately fund education.\Holy said the state's four-year budgeting requirement for school districts may not have been the type of oversight school districts need while negotiating salaries for staff, which the state will eventually have to pay for.\""They had the authority, we had the responsibility,"" he said. ""I don't see that long-lived.""\Holy had an excused absence when the Legislature voted for the 2017 budget that signficantly boosted education funding and revamped the calculations for how property taxes pay for schools.\Lewis said she grew up in the area and understands Republicans because she once identified as one. After an unplanned pregnancy she ended up homeless for a time, but through government assistance programs, access to higher education and help from friends, was able to give her daughter a better life.\""It was actually the social safety net that enabled my daughter and I to get back on our feet,"" she said.\She said she still has an independent spirit and holds many of the same values, but now supports more progressive issues, such as access to abortion and social programs.\Holy said he couldn't support abortion due to his Catholic faith and has co-sponsored several unsuccessful bills restricting it. He also co-sponsored Washington's version of the ""Bathroom Bill,"" which would have allowed businesses to restrict access to their facilities based on sex and gender. Holy said the bill wasn't designed to disadvantage people who identify differently from the sex they are assigned at birth, but rather for the comfort and safety of others using those facilities.\Of the initiatives on Washington's ballot, Lewis said she supported the carbon fee, 1-1631, and a new gun initiative, I-1639, which would require enhanced background checks for semi-automatic rifles, a one-day waiting period and firearms training course. It also would raise the age to purchase semiautomatic rifles to 21 and require gun owners to keep their weapons secured at home. Lewis said she is a gun owner, but wants to see more legislation to ensure firearms don't make it into the wrong hands.\Both Holy and Lewis said they would not vote for the grocery tax initiative, which would bar local governments from taxing basic food and toiletry items, saying the state shouldn't be telling local governments what taxes they are allowed to collect.\Holy said he would not vote for the carbon tax or I-1639, saying the safe-storage component could criminalize people whose fire arms were taken from their homes and used illegally and it may not stop gun violence.\Both said they would like to see more state investment in their district. Holy said he hoped his work would create an environment where young graduates from Spokane's colleges could feel like they would easily find employment in their industry if they stayed in the area. Lewis said she hoped to see more investment in policing and infrastructure in Medical Lake to support local governments where large state facilities like Eastern State Hospital are located.\Contact the writer:\(509) 459-5039\rebeccaw@spokesman.com\6th Legislative District Senate seat\Jeff Holy Party: Republican\Age: 62\City: Spokane\Career: Attorney.

Cutting your personal carbon footprint?
\
Thats so 2007.
\
Ask any green-minded local government leader: The big new decisions about the future of the planet arent being made in car lots, corporate boardrooms or even Congress. Theyre being made by your city council.
\
The battle lines run straight through our daily lives: grocery bags, yard sizes, parking meters.
\
You know, the sorts of things that are too important for presidential candidates to talk about.
\
Heres the question: What can communities do for the environment that individuals cant do alone?
\
In the next two weeks, Vancouver plans to release a mountain of data on this question: the first estimate of the whole citys carbon footprint, said Mike Piper, the citys sustainability coordinator.
\
Until last year, Pipers job didnt exist. This spring, his counterpart Pete DuBois was the first in the same position at Clark County.
\
Now, with human-caused global warming atop the green movements hit list, the search is on to find simple, small policies that encourage individuals to save energy and to kick out the legal barriers that have made it hard for individuals to do so.
\
Solutions like that may sound good, at least to environmentalists. But they dont come without a downside.
\
How much will each cost? And how much good would each do?
\
By this time next year, well all be talking about carbon, Piper said.
\
Our whole language will change.
\
Read up. Theres an exam on the way.
\
Cottage zoning
\
Why do it?
\
A 1,000-square-foot house uses less than half the energy of a 3,000-square-foot home, but local development codes treat the two identically so small houses rarely pay off for builders. A few Washington cities already have laws giving developers permission to build several small houses on a lot instead of one big one.
\
Why we dont.
\
Itd be a headache: New codes would take months to write, said county traffic planner Steve Schulte. And more homes mean more traffic, no matter the size.
\
HOV lanes
\
Why do it?
\
Cars and trucks account for 20 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted in the United States; 77 percent of Americans get to work by driving alone. The biggest unused capacity in the transportation system, DuBois said, is the seat next to you.
\
Why we dont.
\
Washingtons DOT cant offer evidence that HOV lanes actually create new carpools, and an academic study has found that they make no difference. They may attract bus riders, but theres no proof of that, either. A brief HOV lane experiment in Vancouver shaved three to six minutes for bus commuters, but motorists mostly hated it.
\
Local carbon tax
\
Why do it?
\
If all these trade-offs make your head spin, youre not alone. But theres one sure way to guarantee less energy gets consumed: raise its price. A local gas tax would mean less driving.
\
Why we dont.
\
Set aside the complaints from citizens, especially poorer ones. Gas stations would scream enough for everybody. Last winter, Eugene hiked its gas tax 2 cents per gallon. Stations were so convinced itd send drivers outside city limits that they said theyd prefer a 14-cent hike in the statewide tax.
\
Expensive parking meters
\
Why do it?
\
Any commercial developer will tell you: free parking spaces arent. They occupy valuable space. Yet we subsidize drivers by making parking cheap. UCLA professor Donald Shoup figured that each free parking space at his school lured drivers onto the road an extra 727 miles each month.
\
Why we dont.
\
If meters dont appear everywhere, drivers cruise to find free spots and if everybody drives an extra half-mile, a third of the benefit disappears. We are still very much of a sprawl community, said the countys Pete DuBois. Youll always be able to find free parking somehow.
\
Car sharing
\
Why do it?
\
The typical auto is parked 23 hours a day. Counting wear, tear and insurance, its owner pays $26 for that one hour of driving. If you could sell your car and use a $9.50 Zipcar for errands, youd save lots and probably drive less. Cities might sweeten the deal by subsidizing car-share sites or putting special car-share/carpool parking spaces right next to handicapped parking.
\
Why we dont.
\
Car-sharing doesnt pay unless people can ditch their personal cars. Thats unlikely. This year, even King County is letting a Zipcar subsidy program expire.
\
Long east-west blocks
\
Why do it?
\
The U.S. Green Building Council extolls a simple concept: blocks that run mostly east-west instead of north-south will have more south-facing roofs and windows. The roofs are great for solar panels, and south-facing windows can cut winter heating bills by 30 percent.
\
Why we dont.
\
Developers hate restrictions on how to arrange lots, and with reason: more rules can mean fewer lots, and fewer lots mean less money. So they must make up the difference by charging more for each house, and buyers are price sensitive.
\
Bike lanes
\
Why do it?
\
Since 1990, Portland has tripled its bike lane and bike path network to 266 miles. In that time, its number of bicycle commuters grew 263 percent, compared with 11 percent nationwide. Today, Portland is the top bicycling city in the country. Interest could be high here.
\
Why we dont.
\
Bike lanes cost money (about $232,000 per mile just for paving) and occupy space (in Clark County, bike lanes consume 14 percent of each new major road). But even in Portland, only 3.5 percent of commutes are pedal-powered. In Clark County today, the bicycling rate is 0.6 percent, half what Portlands was in 1990.
\
Ban grocery bags
\
Why do it?
\
Paper? Plastic? It all took energy to make. If every household bought a few durable, nonwoven plastic grocery bags and reused them for a couple years, the energy savings would be about 180,000 British thermal units, about the same as running a TV for six months straight, an Australian study found.
\
Why we dont.
\
A ban, like San Francisco recently enacted, is harsh: What happens when you forget your bag? Other cities are adding taxes of 10 to 20 cents per disposable bag. The catch: Should it apply to Target? Battle Ground Pharmacy? Muchas Gracias?
\
Public loans for self-powered houses
\
Why do it?
\
In June, Berkeley, Calif., launched a program that could jump-start small-scale solar or wind production. The city uses its access to low interest rates to borrow money for residents to invest in solar panels. The government recoups the money by hiking the property taxes which are income tax-deductible. The combination makes solar panels dirt cheap.
\
Why we dont.
\
Vancouver aint Berkeley and not just because Hummers probably outnumber hippies. We get between 14 and 38 percent less sunlight. If a Clark County program couldnt attract buyers, it would flop.
\
Solar access
\
Why do it?
\
Even Clark Countys dim sunlight can power photovoltaic panels. A 100-square-foot roof panel here can put out 1,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power annually, according to Seattles Northwest Solar Center. But today, no law guarantees that their neighbors wont build (or grow) something that blocks the light.
\
Why we dont.
\
For the average family a rooftop panel would only cut the electric bill by 10 percent. But a solar access ordinance might make it harder to build tall, dense neighborhoods which can cut transportation costs by 30 percent, dwarfing any solar power benefit.

136,"OLYMPIA - After campaigning on carbon restrictions and pushing for a capital gains tax for two terms, Gov. Jay Inslee scored big wins in the Legislature this year.\Aside from addressing COVID-19 recovery and response, the Democratic-led Legislature passed many long-awaited, consequential proposals. Pushed by Inslee, Democrats made last-minute deals on climate change, capital gains, police accountability and drug possession.\Inslee told reporters Monday he had ""never seen a legislative session that was so productive.""\""Their efforts were so broad in the number of things that they worked on in such difficult circumstances in the middle of the pandemic,"" he said.\Since taking office eight years ago, Inslee has pushed for passage of proposals that would lower the state's carbon emissions and help fight a changing climate. His unsuccessful presidential campaign was dedicated to raising awareness on climate change, but until this year, no major policy changes on the issue had passed the Legislature.\In 2012, Inslee campaigned for a low carbon fuel standard, which he said would encourage the use of fuels that have less effect on the climate. In 2014, Inslee laid out plans to cut carbon emissions by implementing a ""cap-and-trade"" proposal that would collect a carbon tax on industries that pollute.\The proposals have been complicated and controversial, with opponents saying they would increase fuel prices and the general cost of living for residents. Some also worried that businesses targeted by pollution caps would leave the state.\But something changed this year. In the final days before the voting deadline, lawmakers reached deals on both climate bills.\Washington joins California, Oregon and British Columbia in adopting a clean-fuels standard, similar to what Inslee has introduced.\Beginning in 2023, fuel companies in Washington must start reducing emissions a little bit each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20% below 2017 levels by 2038. Fuel companies can either clean up their fuels by producing biofuels or mixed fuels. If they can't, they would be required to purchase ""credits"" to make up for emissions that go above the allowed amount.\The cap-and-trade program that passed this year would set a cap on emissions that large polluters in the state would have to meet by 2023. If they can't meet the cap, they could either clean up their work or purchase allowances from the state. The state would receive the revenue generated from those allowances, which it would use to invest in programs that help the environment and communities disproportionately affected by climate change, such as people of color and low-income earners.\Both the clean-fuels standard and the cap-and-trade program that passed over the weekend come with a tie to a 5-cent gas tax increase, meaning neither would go into effect until lawmakers pass a new transportation revenue package.\Inslee said Monday he did not agree with the provisions tying the climate policies to the gas tax increase, but he would not say whether he would be vetoing those lines.\He said he is committed to getting a new transportation package moving, although he did not say for certain whether he would call legislators back into special session.\In a Sunday news conference, Democrats attributed their success this session on so many issues to a variety of reasons. House Speaker Laurie Jinkins said House members were told early in session to limit the number of bills they introduced.\Members really wanted to prioritize consequential bills and move through the session with ""real urgency,"" she said. ""The pandemic pressed us to do bigger things.""\Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane, said lawmakers worked more during the interim this year than in previous years. The pandemic exposed many institutional problems, which built public and legislative momentum to push a lot of bills through.\Sen. Joe Nguyen, D-Seattle, attributed the success to the Legislature being the most diverse it's ever been with more members of color, women and LGBTQ members than before.\The party breakdown in the chambers did not change this year, but some long-term moderate Democrats were replaced with more progressive ones after last November's election.\Another example of where lawmakers were able to reach a deal after years of trying: the capital gains tax.\Democrats have pushed for the policy for years as a way to fix what they say is a regressive tax code in which low-income earners pay proportionately more in taxes than those whose income is higher. In 2014, Inslee introduced a capital gains tax into his budget.\As in other years, Inslee had proposed a capital gains tax in his budget plans in December. His version though looked a little different than the one that eventually passed. It would have implemented a 9% tax on annual investment earnings of $50,000 for a married couple.\The final proposal approved by the Legislature implements a 7% tax on capital gains, including from the sale of stocks, bonds, businesses and other assets, if the profits exceed $250,000.\Lawmakers could never get enough support through both chambers to get Inslee's initial proposal through, as they faced stiff opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats who called it an unconstitutional income tax.\The measure that passed will be signed by Inslee, but will likely face a court challenge.\Inslee's initial plan would have brought in more money for the state than the plan that passed Sunday, which brings in about $415 million in tax revenue.\Inslee acknowledged Monday the capital gains tax rate in the final measure will be lower than those in other states, but said he did not have plans to push for expansion of the bill passed on Sunday. Instead, he said he wanted to first ""celebrate the success"" of a proposal he's worked on for years.\""This will bring a good portion of fairness to our tax system,"" he said.\Along with Inslee's requests, legislators tackled other consequential issues, passing significant reforms in many categories. Here are some other notable policy changes made this session:\POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY\Lawmakers passed almost a dozen police accountability measures, a package that came together almost a year ago after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\Bills include creating a statewide database of use-of-force incidents, requiring officers to intervene when they see another officer use excessive force and easing requirements to decertify officers.\Two others, which received some of the most debate, address police tactics and the standard needed to use force. The police tactics bill prohibits the use of choke holds and neck restraints and limits the use of tear gas, police dogs and vehicle pursuits. It also bans law enforcement agencies from acquiring military equipment.\Lawmakers then changed the policy for when force is allowed. A previous statute allowed for ""any means necessary"" during an arrest. A bill that passed last week requires officers to prioritize de-escalation before employing force.\DRUG POSSESSION\Drug possession will now be treated as a misdemeanor in Washington, punishable by up to 90 days in jail, a $1,000 fine or both.\Prior to February, possession was a felony. But a state Supreme Court decision ruled Washington's drug possession law unconstitutional. Lawmakers began scrambling for a fix. Some wanted to see decriminalization of drug possession and a focus on treatment while others wanted to see at least some criminal penalty.\The compromise: making possession of a controlled substance a misdemeanor, at least for the next two years. In 2023, the criminal penalty will expire, meaning no more arrests for drug possession, unless legislators pass any further laws.\The final bill also focuses heavily on treatment for substance abuse disorder. Those possessing drugs will be diverted to treatment on their first two offenses. Their third offense would be a misdemeanor. It also increases funding for behavioral health services to increase community treatment and outreach programs for addiction.\OPEN CARRY AT DEMONSTRATIONS\Openly carrying firearms at the Capitol campus and at public demonstrations would be illegal, if Inslee gives his final signature.\The proposal came after a year of large armed protests at the Capitol. In January, protesters breached the governor's mansion gate. Last summer, two protests ended with shots fired.\The bill would ban open carry within 250 feet of publicly permitted demonstrations and on the state Capitol campus. People openly carrying a firearm on their private property are exempt, if a protest is occurring outside their home or business. Law enforcement officers are also exempt.\FOREST HEALTH\After years of fighting for more stable funding for wildfire fighting and forest health, Commissioner for Public Lands Hilary Franz garnered support this session for a bill to give substantial funding every two years toward the wildfire effort.\The bill passed unanimously and would set aside $125 million every two years for wildfire response, forest restoration and community resilience.\For wildfire response, it would allow the state to hire 100 more firefighters and expand the air fleet. The bill would also help fund the Department of Natural Resource's 20-year Forest Health Strategic Plan, which treats the state's forests to make them more wildfire resistant. Lastly, it would help communities across the state make investments at a local level to reduce wildfire risk, such as building fuel breaks or doing prescribed burns.\COVID-19 ECONOMIC RECOVERY\With the infusion of billions of federal stimulus dollars, state lawmakers turned their focus to helping the state recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\At the start of the session, lawmakers allocated $2.2 billion for rental assistance, school assistance, public health, food assistance and child care grants.\When Congress passed an additional $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package, lawmakers used about $10 billion of the state's share of funds in their budget for one-time costs related to the pandemic. The final budget allocated funds for vaccine distribution, school reopening and rental assistance.\A portion of the federal funds will assist child care providers across the state. As part of a broad package to address child care shortages statewide, lawmakers expanded eligibility and decreased co-pays for subsidy grants and increased the subsidy rate, supports and grants for providers. In the short-term, federal funds will pay for those expansions. In the long-term, funds would come from revenue generated by the capital gains tax.\Lawmakers also funded the Working Families Tax Credit, which provides between a rebate of $300 to $1,200 for low-income families, depending on how many children they have.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com.\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"
137,"
Craig Pridemore was a University of Washington student when he started his career influencing public policy. He and his friends made a road trip to Richland in the early 1980s to protest planned construction of five nuclear-power plants.
\
Now, the Vancouver state senator, who remains an environmentalist and successfully sponsored legislation this session to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, reluctantly concedes nuclear power might need to play a role in the monumental task of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in the United States -- he said so in testimony before a state House committee.
\
He's not the only one. U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Bainbridge Island (and former 4th District representative in Congress), who has been driving a Prius and talking about global climate change since before it was fashionable, also agrees that nuclear power might need to be part of the solution to curb greenhouse-gas emissions while managing new demand.
\
""Global warming is such a titanic challenge, all of us have to check our prejudices at the door,"" said Inslee. He has just finished a book, ""Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Revolution,"" that will be published by Island Press this fall.
\
Neither Pridemore nor Inslee is enthusiastic about the prospect of an expansion of nuclear power -- which accounts for about 20 percent of U.S. electricity -- because it has other problems. Though nuclear plants don't emit greenhouse gases, disposal of the radioactive waste stream is a challenge.
\
But the challenge of climate change is so daunting that it is already causing major policy reprioritization, whether federal, state or household. Gov. Chris Gregoire recently set ambitious goals, starting with reducing the state's greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels within 13 years. A high-powered stakeholders group, including utility representatives, industry executives and environmentalists, has begun meeting to figure out how the state will get there.
\
So far, the governor has taken a cautiously open-minded tack on a Tri-City Industrial Development Council (TRIDEC) proposal that, if successful, could expand nuclear activities in the state.
\
The community in southeastern Washington is among 13 candidates for the Department of Energy's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership program. TRIDEC, along with other community organizations, including the operator of the state's lone nuclear-power reactor in Richland, has proposed the community be part of a program to reprocess spent commercial nuclear fuel and recycle it, and also be the site of a new research reactor. Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell also are in a wait-and-see mode.
\
Such open-mindedness about nuclear power borders on heresy among many environmental organizations, especially in the Northwest, which has plenty of negative nuclear baggage.
\
First, there was the notoriety of the Washington Public Power Supply System default on $2.25 billion in bonds in 1983. Hugely overestimated need for power and the large capital cost of five planned nuclear-power reactors contributed to the breathtaking default -- a record for any public agency at the time. Though Washington state was not involved in the project, its bond rating fell by association. Only one reactor was completed -- in Richland -- and is still operated by the agency, since renamed Energy Northwest.
\
Second, there is the wince-evoking legacy of five decades worth of nuclear defense production -- and inept disposal of waste -- at the Hanford nuclear reservation on the elbow of the Columbia River. The last defense-production reactor was shut down in 1989, but the costly cleanup is expected to take decades.
\
Then there is the muscle of the Northwest environmental community, which has tended to use both the former and the latter episodes to argue against anything nuclear.
\
""Political feeling may be more raw in the Northwest because of the failure to build those four nuclear plants,"" says Rudi Bertschi, who also actively opposed nuclear construction in the early 1980s. He later served as chairman of the Energy Northwest board and helped play a role in the agency's turnaround. ""That was very traumatic for a lot of people.""
\
An economist and energy consultant, Bertschi says he's ""agnostic"" about whether new nuclear plants should be built, saying it will depend on the costs government associates with carbon emissions. ""A carbon tax would definitely change the economic formula,"" he said.
\
Nuclear technology fell so out of favor locally, the University of Washington terminated its nuclear-engineering department in 1992 for lack of student interest.
\
But now the conversation is changing. Environmentalists acknowledging nuclear might have a role in combating climate change are becoming, if not common, much less rare.
\
Greenpeace founder Patrick Moore has been the most vocal. The organization was founded to oppose nuclear weapons and warfare.
\
""... I think we made the mistake early on of lumping the peaceful use of nuclear in with the warlike use of nuclear,"" Moore said in a recent interview with E&ETV. ""And I've come to realize that it doesn't make sense to ban the beneficial use of technology just because that technology can be used for evil.""
\
Greenpeace remains fervently anti-nuclear, promoting instead an expansion of renewable energy and energy conservation. From its Web page: ""Greenpeace has always fought -- and will continue to fight -- vigorously against nuclear power because it is an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity. The only solution is to halt the expansion of all nuclear power, and for the shutdown of existing plants.""
\
Moore and former Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd Whitman are co-chairs of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, which supports nuclear as a clean-emissions energy source. Although some environmentalists denounce Moore, others with respectable environmental credentials are joining him in pushing nuclear to be considered as part of the solution. Among them are James Lovelock, creator of the Gaia hypothesis, which suggests Earth is a superorganism, and a member of Environmentalists for Nuclear Power; and Jared Diamond, Pulitzer Prize- winning author of ""Guns, Germs and Steel.""
\
Worldwide, more countries are embracing nuclear. France gets 78 percent of its power from nuclear -- and never has had an accident; all of Europe gets about 32 percent.
\
The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its fourth assessment report released May 4, included nuclear as a potential part of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Last month, finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized countries, including Britain, Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States, announced their support for nuclear power as a partial solution to global warming and easing dependence on fossil fuels. Also in April, the United States and Japan signed an agreement to conduct joint research on nuclear power, which includes the GNEP proposal.
\
The one serious U.S. nuclear accident, at Three Mile Island in 1979 (causing no injuries or death), triggered a safety revolution that led in 2006 to a median plant safety record of only 0.12 industrial accidents per 200,000 worker-hours, a record low, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.
\
Back in the Northwest, it will be interesting to see how this debate plays out, especially given the crunch between energy demand growing with population and the legal challenges to the Northwest's electricity mainstay -- hydropower.
\
About 60 percent of Washington's energy comes from the 31-dam federal hydro system, but four dams on the lower Snake River in southeastern Washington are under the jurisdiction of a federal judge. Environmentalists have prevailed in federal courts to press U.S. agencies to do more to restore endangered salmon runs affected by the Snake dams. Federal District Court Judge James Redden has said if the agencies don't satisfy his concerns, he might order the dams breached. Together, the four represent about 1,000 megawatts of power -- enough to keep the lights on in Seattle.
\
The same organizations that support dam breaching, including the Northwest Energy Coalition, successfully proposed Initiative 937, which requires most utilities to have at least 15 percent of their energy portfolio be produced by nonhydro renewable sources, such as wind and solar power. Also backed passionately by Inslee, the new law encourages energy conservation to lessen the need for new polluting power sources, which will help buy some time.
\
But many in the Northwest are skeptical of the changes going forward. Hydropower, which is created by letting water run through turbines, is particularly suited to ""shape"" -- or balance -- unlike the ups and downs of wind power. The wind doesn't always blow, after all.
\
That will mean, eventually, power plants with more-controllable energy production will be needed to fill in the power gap when the wind doesn't blow. And given passage of Sen. Pridemore's bill that essentially eliminates the possibility of any new coal plants, that means new natural gas plants or something that burns cleaner -- like, possibly, nuclear power.
\
Nuclear power has some major drawbacks. It is expensive and what to do with the waste stream remains an open, politically charged question. Energy Northwest, like other commercial reactor operators across the nation, has years worth of spent nuclear fuel intended for permanent disposal at the U.S. Department of Energy Yucca Mountain Repository that is years past opening. U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., intends to kill the repository in his state and, with his clout as Senate majority leader, just might be successful.
\
Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership proposal would reverse a more than 30-year-old U.S. policy decision and begin recycling spent nuclear fuels with ""proliferation-resistant"" technologies. The plan could entail spent nuclear fuel being shipped to Hanford from sites around the country for reprocessing and recycling, as well as a new power reactor.
\
At a public Energy Department siting hearing in Pasco in March, there was a lot of activist muscle memory in the room that drew more than 300 people. Many of the old guard in the community of Cold Warriors argued they had the expertise to help the nation reduce existing waste through the recycling mission and advance a new generation of safe nuclear power. Anti-nuclear activists, including Heart of America Northwest, raised the specter of Energy Department's indisputably atrocious record of defense-waste disposal from years ago. Clean up the mess before you add more, they argue.
\
There is some truth and reason on both sides. But GNEP might not even survive the next presidential election.
\
Inslee, who says he hasn't yet studied GNEP enough to have a position, has an important message for everyone, including polluters and environmentalists like himself: ""We are all going to have to get rid of our knee jerks.""
\
This is a shrewder world where climate change is a reality and humans are considering how to minimize their role in it. The solutions need to be more carefully pragmatic and less reflexively ideological.

138,"Franciscan Sister Pat Millen has been going through files and finding and repacking treasures and records from the time five Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia first came to Spokane in 1890 to open St. Joseph Orphanage.\Over the years, the ministry developed into the St. Joseph Family Center, which has provided counseling, classes, hospitality and spiritual care since the 1980s. Now it's closing.\A few weeks ago, Millen took the adoption files of orphans to the Department of Child and Health Services to be kept for people seeking information about their families.\The last day of programs and services at the St. Joseph Family Center was June 30, and the center will close for good Sept. 30.\Classes on anger management, parenting children in divorce and the Parent Project have been taken over by Northwest Mediation at 35 W. Main Ave., Suite 230. Two teachers will continue under that program.\Millen said most clients were on state insurance, which did not reimburse adequately to cover the cost of services - a major reason the center is closing.\""It was a sad decision, but the right one,"" she said.\The decision is still unfortunate, she said, because Spokane is losing a nonprofit that has served the community for over 125 years, and the people the center served may not find the same quality of therapy. Also, three members of the staff are still looking for new jobs, she said.\""It's also part of the times with fewer women in religious service in Spokane. At the cemetery, we can see the numbers of sisters who served the community,"" she said. ""We are the remnant.""\Millen will continue to serve in Spokane, leaving her role as director and beginning as part-time justice, peace and integrity of creation coordinator for the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia on the West Coast. By early November, she will work out of her apartment.\Millen already has been involved in several advocacy roles - the Spokane Low Income Housing Consortium's advocacy committee, the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance's public policy committee, the board of Habitat for Humanity, the board of Transitions, the Intercommunity for Peace and Justice Center board and its Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, and the City of Spokane Community Housing and Human Services Strategic Planning Committee.\Sister Elaine Thaden will still do vocational ministry in Spokane. Sister Joanne Clavel will stay in Spokane as director of the Franciscan sisters mission fund. Sister Florence Poch will continue at Kairos House. Sister Patty Novak is looking for a new ministry.\Passages Family Support has renewed its lease through next October. Sisters of Providence continue to rent a building.\The hospitality component will carry on under Sharon Eklund, the Franciscan Place director. People and groups can rent the space by calling her at (509) 995-7997. Clare House will still be available for visiting professors and private retreats through Dec. 30.\Counselors Lorraine Costanza, (509) 953-8100, and Ed Hinson, (509) 435-2756, will continue to serve clients through their private practices.\Millen came to the center in July 2010 after working 10 years with Catholic Community Services in Tacoma as director of the Family Center in Bremerton.\""As Franciscans, we respond on several levels,"" she said. ""Providence sisters focused on education and health care. Holy Names sisters focused on education. Franciscans have responded to diverse needs, particularly needs of low-income, blue-collar neighborhoods. They still have five health care hospitals in the Puget Sound area.\""As Franciscans, we respond to people who are not being served. That's why we offered counseling for the working poor and court-ordered classes on anger management.""\Millen sees her new ministry as responding to Pope Francis' call to care for the common home of people and the environment.\In this region, that will entail challenging coal and oil trains, and working for a carbon emissions tax.\She also will advocate for undocumented immigrants, refugees and Muslims.\CLOSING RITUAL THIS WEEKEND\A closing ritual liturgy for St. Joseph Family Center will be at 11 a.m. Saturday.\A reception will follow the service.\The ceremony, at 1016 N. Superior St., is for Sisters of St. Francis, companions, former members and people who served with them or were served by them.\For information, call (509) 483-6495, or (509) 892-9241 for clinical records, or (509) 995-7997 for hospitality."
139,"DO YOU SUPPORT A CARBON EMISSIONS TAX LIKE THE ONE PROPOSED IN INITIATIVE 732? WHY OR WHY NOT?\GOODSPACEGUY\No. Life on earth is carbon based and CO2 is really, really good for plants.\BILL HIRT\No. Carbon tax is a fraud and we get 70 percent of our power from hydro.\MARY MARTIN\No, all the taxes are regressive and shift the economic burden of capitalism onto workers.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\No. Believes in global warming. Thinks tax should be revenue neutral and doesn't think this one will be.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\No, state shouldn't tax a company because it puts out carbon. Thinks initiative is poorly written.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes. Also wants organic systems to take carbon from the atmosphere.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Some tax on carbon makes sense but a better idea is to stop drilling and put money into renewables.\JAY INSLEE\State must lead on climate change but this measure would have a net loss in state revenue and an unacceptable fiscal impact on education and other priorities.\BILL BRYANT\No. It's an untested and unpredictable source of funding that will have a negative impact on jobs with minimal improvements to carbon emissions.\WOULD YOU SUPPORT REPLACING THE BUSINESS AND OCCUPATION TAX ON GROSS RECEIPTS WITH ANOTHER TAX? IF SO, WHAT TAX?\GOODSPACEGUY\Yes. Would reduce overall tax burden and consider a ""head tax"" everyone pays.\BILL HIRT\No strong opinion either way.\MARY MARTIN\Debates around this have nothing to do with what the working class is facing.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\B&O tax is goofy. Would phase it out in favor of corporate and individual income tax and a simpler system overall.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\No. Some people complain about it but it's better than other states' systems.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes. Would replace with a speculation tax on the financial world and toxicity tax on industries that damage the environment.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Favors a constitutional amendment with an income tax on the top 10 percent, and bringing the sales and B&O tax down as the income tax revenue goes up.\JAY INSLEE\The tax is problematic but there's no obvious replacement with significant support. Should be part of larger discussion on modernizing tax system.\BILL BRYANT\It hits small business hard, particularly in communities like Spokane where almost 65 percent of employers have four employees or fewer. I would be open to considering alternatives.\DO YOU AGREE WITH THE STATE SUPREME COURT'S MCCLEARY DECISION THAT THE STATE HAS NOT PROPERLY FUNDED PUBLIC SCHOOLS? IF SO, HOW WOULD YOU PAY FOR CHANGES IN 2017-19?\GOODSPACEGUY\No. 50 percent of budget already goes to education and that's way too much.\BILL HIRT\Doesn't think the Supreme Court can dictate to the Legislature what to do.\MARY MARTIN\Education is a class-divided question. The state under capitalism is not interested in real education.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\Yes. Implement a capital gains tax and income tax to change the most regressive tax system and diversify it before the next recession.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\Yes. Don't need more revenue. If the budget was audited, the state would find all the money it needs.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes. If the system is restructured to promote home schooling, the speculation tax and toxicity tax would provide more than enough money for teacher raises.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Yes. State needs a new tax source but the poor and the middle class can't pay more. Any new tax should go first to education.\JAY INSLEE\State has already made bipartisan improvements to education but has more to do. Tough choices include not relying on local levies to fund basic education, boosting teacher pay and smaller class sizes.\BILL BRYANT\Calls inequities between rich and poor school districts morally wrong and unconstitutional, but calls for more leadership. Will propose a plan that ensures equal funding for every student, regardless of where they live and restructures high school.\DO YOU SUPPORT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION'S RULE THAT ALLOWS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE TO USE PUBLIC FACILITIES BASED ON THEIR GENDER IDENTITY?\GOODSPACEGUY\They should be able to use whichever facility they identify with.\BILL HIRT\No. Thinks that's an insult.\MARY MARTIN\Ambivalent. Defends the right of people to be free of harassment but believes parents are deeply concerned about predators.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\Yes. Although parents worry about their children and predators, doubts people will go through process of becoming transgender just to walk into the restroom of another sex.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\Believes state should encourage businesses to just build third bathrooms for transgender people.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes, although the best solution would be a third bathroom option.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Yes. They've been doing it for years without problems. It's a nonissue.\JAY INSLEE\Yes. State has always been a leader in fight against discrimination and can't go backward now.\BILL BRYANT\Commission overstepped its authority. Transgender people and children using restrooms both should be treated with dignity and that's the responsibility of the Legislature to develop in an open process.\DO YOU BELIEVE THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE RAISED, AND IF SO BY HOW MUCH?\GOODSPACEGUY\No. The minimum wage makes it difficult for people to get work and should be abolished.\BILL HIRT\No. It's good at the current level.\MARY MARTIN\The national minimum wage needs to go to $15 an hour, but workers need unions to negotiate contracts with higher wages.\STEVE RUBENSTEIN\Yes. Supports $13.50 an hour by 2020, but would also support a little higher, a little faster.\JOHNATHAN DODDS\It should be raised, but on a sliding scale based on a company's revenue, because smaller businesses can't afford $15 an hour.\CHRISTIAN JOUBERT\Yes. At least $15 an hour or more.\JAMES ROBERT DEAL\Yes, phased in to $15 over 5 years.\JAY INSLEE\Yes. Supports initiative to raise to $13.50 by 2020 and ensure paid sick leave for every worker.\BILL BRYANT\Supported increases in SeaTac and King County, but doesn't support one-size-fits all increase for entire state because it could cut workers' hours or benefits and could raise prices.\Note: Candidates David Blomstrom and Patrick O'Rourke declined to participate or did not respond in time for publication.

140,"Several ""green"" schools built in Spokane in recent years fall far short of their goals, an Olympia think tank says. Educators say the group is using premature and misleading data provided by the schools.\The Washington Legislature mandated in 2005 that state money be used only to build ""high performance"" schools - those intended to conserve energy and water, encourage the recycling of building materials, and provide more natural light and outdoor air.\Advocates said that despite higher building costs, taxpayers would save money through lower utility bills. Teachers would stay on the job longer, they said, and students would score better on standardized tests, suffer fewer allergy problems and have fewer absences - all because of better air circulation, more natural light and the use of more natural building materials.\""One California district has seen scores increase close to 30 percent in buildings with abundant daylight,"" says the narrator in a state video promoting the regulations. ""While other districts may see increases of lesser magnitude, the conclusion is still the same: Better light means better scores.""\But Todd Myers, director for the Center for the Environment at the Washington Policy Center, says the only certifiably green schools built so far - three in Spokane and several others in Western Washington - performed no better than other modern schools during the 2006-'07 school year. His study has caught the attention of national groups that say environmental regulations go too far.\The problem, Myers said, is that proponents of ""high performance"" buildings made too many promises. He doesn't contend that green construction techniques are bad - nor are bigger windows or more fresh air - but that such decisions should be made locally.\""Give the power to the people who have incentives to make improvements,"" he said.\Supporters of statewide standards contend the state has a stake in the matter, because it provides about 30 percent of the money that goes into school construction.\They also note that districts have a range of options. The standards acknowledge, for instance, that it's impractical for rural schools to be located within a mile of half their elementary students - an energy-efficiency standard that urban districts might easily obtain.\Out of a possible 80 points, schools must hit 40. Among a long list of standards that can earn districts points:\*Water-saving toilets and waterless urinals.\*Native landscaping, combined with trees that shade paved surfaces.\*Recreational space that doubles as neighborhood parkland.\*Reusing half of an existing building's structure and 30 percent of its furniture when it is replaced.\*Using some building materials made of ""rapidly renewable"" materials, such as poplar trees or bamboo, and some manufactured locally.\*Windows that open in each classroom.\*Heating and air-conditioning systems that self-adjust for open windows.\*Lights that self-adjust to natural light.\LOFTY GOALS\Legislators, health officials and educators tout the benefits of building green in the video on the state superintendent of public instruction Web site. Among them is Greg Brown, Spokane Public Schools director of capital projects, who was interviewed at Lincoln Heights Elementary, which opened for the 2006-'07 school year.\As a demonstration project and with financial incentive from the state, Lincoln Heights was built to green standards that exceeded those eventually adopted by the state. Two other Spokane elementaries, Lidgerwood and Ridgeview, have been built to the state standards.\Brown says that building to the state standards adds 3 percent to 5 percent to the cost of new projects, and that many of the costs can be recouped in the first 10 years through energy efficiency.\""We're probably going to save about $30,000 per year in utility costs in operating this building,"" Brown said on camera.\He and associate superintendent Mark Anderson noted Tuesday that ""sustainability"" was one of five attributes identified as important by Spokane constituents who attended a two-day conference about school design, after voters approved a 2003 bond issue for replacing some schools and improving others.\But other modern demands on the buildings drive up energy use. Among them: assuring the buildings are better suited for after-hours use by the community; assuring that each school has a unique design; offering lots of technology; and providing modern safety features.\Providing bigger windows and more fresh air also adds to utility costs, Brown acknowledged.\All of those factors make it hard to determine how much energy savings can be attributed to any particular building technique. But Brown said he stands by a prediction he made in the video: that the state standards would mean 30 percent cheaper utility costs at Lincoln Heights. He clarified, however, that he meant 30 percent cheaper than if the same building had been constructed to meet minimum energy-efficiency codes.\Brown thinks some predictions for student performance may have over-reached or are unverifiable. A Seattle school administrator, for example, predicts in the video that students in classrooms on one side of a hallway would score 8 percent higher than those on the other side because of the difference in sunlight.\No such specific student-performance predictions were made in Spokane.\But, Brown said, Lincoln Heights staff and students are happier in the new building. And there have been fewer complaints about health problems that staff and parents previously attributed to the stuffy old building.\""I believe that by building better buildings you will build better learning environments,"" Brown said.\SCRUTINIZING THE NUMBERS\Data that the Center for the Environment's Myers obtained from Spokane Public Schools show that Lincoln Heights, Ridgeview and Lidgerwood elementaries performed no better during the 2006-'07 school year than the only other elementary school built this decade, Browne Elementary.\In fact, Browne, which opened in 2001, had significantly lower utility costs that year than the three green schools. The numbers: 87 cents a square foot at Browne, compared to an average of $1.14 at the three others.\Furthermore, students in the green schools showed no greater improvement in WASL scores than other elementary schools in the district.\Absenteeism is more difficult to compare, Myers acknowledges, but it appears there was little effect when the green buildings replaced their predecessors.\""This is not to say that the health of the building doesn't matter (for test scores and absenteeism); it's just to say that there are other things that matter much more,"" such as poverty, Myers said.\Although they provided Myers with the figures he's using, district administrators say there are several problems with his comparisons. For one thing, they said, Browne Elementary gets less after-hours use than the others. And a new building typically has higher utility costs its first year because employees are still learning the most efficient ways to operate all the various systems for heating, air-conditioning, lighting and irrigation.\On Tuesday, Brown and Anderson provided figures showing that the square-footage cost of energy was nearly identical at the four schools in May, and that all of them used less energy than older schools.\Browne Elementary, they said, is similar to the newer buildings in many ways, even though it was designed several years before the 2005 Legislature mandated ""high performance"" standards and is not green certified. Its classrooms are flooded with natural light, for instance.\""We decided early on, based on the studies that were presented to us, that day-lighting was the way to go,"" said Brown.\And that, said Myers, only proves his point about local decision-making. Schools were already modernizing their construction techniques before the state jumped in, because it was the smart thing to do.\""They're not waiting around for Olympia to tell them what to do,"" he said. ""In Olympia, their incentive is to look good politically.""\LINCOLN HEIGHTS' HIGH STANDARDS\Exceeding state standards adopted in 2005, Lincoln Heights Elementary School was certified ""gold"" by the U.S. Green Building Council.

The proposal, including a 9-cent gasoline tax, will be on the ballot in November.\ On Friday afternoon, the Capitol was a shadow of the bustling, frenzied place it's been since early January.\ ""This has been a grueling legislative session, one that has tried and tested our patience and our blood pressure,"" Gov. Gary Locke said shortly after midnight Friday.\ Senate Majority Leader Sid Snyder, already wrestling with prostate cancer and pneumonia, had a double root canal before returning to work on the Senate floor Thursday. He jokingly said he preferred the root canals.\ So it was no surprise that most of the state's part-time lawmakers wasted no time packing up. Inside the marble Rotunda, the clamor of lobbyists and weeks of tense negotiations was quickly replaced with the self-conscious murmurings of a few tourists and wide-eyed children.\ ""It'll feel real good to get home,"" said Rep. Alex Wood, D- Spokane. ""This is like a movie set or something. You get used to it, but it's so different from everything else.""\ Lawmakers are also taking home more than clothes and files. Some 11th-hour lobbying by Spokane-area lawmakers netted $1.5 million for a new Gonzaga sports arena, $207 million for the North Spokane Corridor, millions of dollars for local colleges, and millions more for smaller local programs and projects.\ The $22.5 billion budget rewrite, which all sides agreed is only a temporary fix, also avoided deep social service cuts and a broad tax increase.\ ""I think things turned out about as well as they could,"" said Rep. Jeff Gombosky, D-Spokane.\ Others were not as pleased.\ ""It's an unsustainable budget. We shall return,"" said Rep. Bob Sump, R-Republic, alluding to Republican predictions that lawmakers will be forced to return later this year to overhaul the Democrat- authored budget fix.\ The transportation tax proposal, which will loom large on politicians' radar through November, almost died at the last minute. Up until the final hour, the Senate didn't want to allow a public vote on the project. If it fails at the ballot, many lawmakers say, Puget Sound's traffic congestion, already second-worst in the nation, will choke off the engine of the state's economy.\ ""This is the economic vitality of the state, from the fields of Eastern Washington to the ports over here,"" said Wood.\ In the end, the Senate lost the showdown.\ ""Ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to stand up and do the right thing,"" Sen. Mary Margaret Haugen, D-Camano Island, told the Senate. ""Unfortunately, they didn't have the same courage across the Rotunda.""\ The bill then raced to the House, where lawmakers voted for it in the final seconds before the session ended.\ Decades ago, lawmakers had a special tactic to get around such deadlines: They would simply ignore the clock. Someone would drape a black cloth over it, and debate would resume, with legislative leaders maintaining until the early hours of the morning that it was still only 11:59 p.m. That option died with a 1983 rule change.\ During the 60 days, the Legislature also passed a number of other bills, including ones involving:\ School bullies. Schools are required to have policies prohibiting harassment and intimidation.\ Abandoned newborns. To avoid abandoned-baby deaths, mothers of unwanted newborns can anonymously abandon them at hospitals or open fire stations.\ Credit scoring. Insurers can't cancel a person's insurance policy solely because of their credit history.\ Family care. Employers must allow workers to use sick leave to care for a spouse, parents, or disabled child over age 18. (Existing law allows such leave to care for a child.) Unemployment insurance. An overhaul of the unemployment insurance tax rate. Labor and big business liked the changes, many small businesses opposed them.\ Collective bargaining. A major victory for state worker unions, who will be able to collectively bargain for wages and benefits for the first time. A similar bill covers collective bargaining for faculty at the state's colleges.\ On the other side of the ledger, lawmakers once again failed to do much to rein in prescription drug costs.\ ""If the public's been screaming for anything over the last four to five years, it's prescription drug help,"" said Wood. But resistance from drug and biotechnology companies torpedoed this year's attempts.\ Also dead was most of the state's anti-terrorism package, which would have made wiretapping easier and created a new death-penalty crime of first-degree terrorism. Objections from civil libertarians stopped the bills.\ Lawmakers said Friday that they won't know the fate of many small bills that faced amendments, deadlines and now a possible veto by the governor for a couple weeks more.\ In the meantime, they're happy to be going home. Many averaged only a few hours of sleep in the final days of the session.\ ""There's always a phone call to return, an e-mail message to read, a paper to look at,"" said Gombosky, D-Spokane. ""I'm looking forward to just going home and playing with my kids.""\ ""In a way, this is sometimes like having two lives,"" said Sump, surrounded in his office by empty packing boxes. ""When you get over here, there's a part of you that turns on. You start working in this environment and it seems like a natural place to be.\ ""But right now, `' he said, ""I'd like to go home and sleep for about two days."""

WASHINGTON -- The House likely would go along if the Senate votes to suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax, but a new way would have to be found to pay for highway construction, the House majority leader says.
\
At any rate, Rep. Dick Armey said, suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem of high gasoline prices. More helpful would be to augment the natural gas delivery system, deal more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on oil imports, he said on ""Fox News Sunday.""
\
""Let's look at building natural- gas lines so people in the Northeast can be heating with good, clean, reliable, inexpensive natural gas,"" said Armey, R-Texas. ""Let's have a foreign policy that allows us to get some respect out of the OPEC nations that we deserve and we fought for, by the way. And then let's reduce our domestic dependence on foreign oil.""
\
On the gasoline tax, most of which is supposed to go into a highway trust fund, Armey said a source of replacement money would be an important consideration before the tax could be suspended.
\
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., who controls the flow of legislation in the Senate as majority leader, has said he may have a vote on a suspension suggested by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
\
""I think the House is willing to do that, but we want to do it correctly,"" Armey said. ""And the first thing you have to answer is, 'How do you replenish the highway construction funds?'""
\
Like other Republicans in this presidential election year, Armey largely blamed the Clinton administration for high gasoline prices. Should Vice President Al Gore become president instead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, he said, gas prices would climb inexorably higher.
\
""That is his policy for the environment, to eliminate the internal combustion engine,"" Armey said.
\
In April's reissue of Gore's 1992 book ""Earth in the Balance,"" the vice president wrote a foreword in which he reaffirmed his idea that such engines should be eliminated within 25 years. He said he doesn't want to eliminate the car, just to develop a car that won't harm the environment.

Three Vancouver-area legislators and the civic and business establishment Friday urged support for increasing gasoline taxes to improve the state's overloaded transportation system.
\
Sen. Don Carlson, R-Hazel Dell, and Reps. Val Ogden and Bill Fromhold, both D-Vancouver, told a legislative preview audience that they'll vote in the upcoming session for a gas tax increase without putting it to a statewide vote.
\
This week, Gov. Gary Locke proposed raising the state's 23-cents- a-gallon gas tax by three cents a year for each of the next three years, plus boosting various fees. The additional money would be spent on highways, intersections, bus systems and other transportation needs.
\
Rep. Tom Mielke, R-Battle Ground, disagreed with Locke's plan and the Vancouver legislators, saying he thinks there's plenty of money to be saved by ferreting out and cutting off waste in state government. He said he might be persuaded to put a gas-tax measure on the state ballot for voters to decide.
\
No other Clark County legislators attended the breakfast, an annual event of the Chamber of Commerce, Columbia River Economic Development Council and Identity Clark County.
\
Emcee John McKibbin said Sen. Don Benton, R-Pleasant Valley, declined the invitation without explanation, while Reps. Marc Boldt, Jim Dunn and John Pennington and Sen. Joe Zarelli, all Republicans, pleaded conflicts and sent regrets.
\
Pennington is resigning from the Legislature to take a Bush administration post in the Northwest. The others have opposed gas tax increases, at least without statewide votes.
\
Standing with Carlson, Ogden and Fromhold for a gas-tax hike are the three groups that sponsored Friday's session.
\
""Our preference is to not submit transportation funding to the public for a vote,"" said attorney Scott Horenstein, who was speaking for all three groups.
\
Since the gas tax was last increased in 1991, inflation has cut its buying power from 23 cents per gallon to 18 cents by today's cost- of-living standards. In the meantime, population and transportation demands have skyrocketed.
\
Bipartisanship has 'eroded'
\
Ogden, about to enter her 12th year in the Legislature, said transportation has historically ""been a bipartisan effort. Unfortunately, in the last few years, that bipartisanship has eroded.""
\
She said she would like to see the gas tax rise automatically with inflation.
\
""I am willing to take this vote"" for a gas tax increase, she told the business audience. ""How about your employees? I challenge you to tell them"" about the need to improve transportation.
\
Fromhold did more than urge the business leaders to provide political cover for tough votes, suggesting that they should get tough with legislators who don't.
\
""If you don't hold us all accountable for how we vote on these issues,"" he said, ""shame on you.""
\
Given the $1.2 billion budget shortage facing the state for the period ending just 18 months from now, all four legislators agreed that this session will be unpleasant and tough.
\
Among their other observations:
\
Ogden: Costs of the state-federal Medicaid program increased 37 percent last year. That will force some changes that ""will affect low- income people. That concerns me very much.""
\
It will probably be necessary to impose a fee for day use of state parks, she said. Washington is the only Western state not to charge a day-use fee for its parks.
\
Fromhold: While he favors a gas tax hike to boost the transportation budget, ""this is not the environment for any general- fund tax increase.""
\
He predicted cuts in health and human services programs and in non- basic education areas of the public schools.
\
Carlson: ""Tuitions will be increased"" at state colleges, and there will be cuts in state services,"" he predicted.
\
""We have a crisis in health care for the most vulnerable people,"" seniors and children, Carlson added.
\
Mielke: He said transportation isn't as important in his more rural 18th Legislative District as it is to the Vancouver-area lawmakers.
\
His constituents are more concerned about onerous state land-use regulations, he said. People lack confidence in state government, and one way to improve that situation is to not ""force things down people's throats.""
\
The state also can do more private contracting and not always pay prevailing wages to workers on state projects, Mielke said.

OLYMPIA -- A third advocacy group has decided to oppose Referendum 51, the fall ballot measure that would raise gasoline and vehicle taxes in order to pump $7.7 billion into new highways and other transportation projects.
\
Board directors of Transportation Choices Coalition, Seattle- based supporters of alternative transportation, voted 7-3 this week to join anti-tax and environmental factions in opposing Referendum 51.
\
Since release of the Blue Ribbon Transportation Commission report in late 2000, the coalition has embraced its recommendation that one- third of all new spending go for nonhighway projects.
\
Referendum 51 would funnel about 85 percent of funding to highway projects. That would neglect mass transit, van pools, ride-sharing and other creative, less-polluting options, say its newest critics.
\
""It won't work. You can't build your way out of congestion,"" said Peter Hurley, executive director for the coalition. The projects that would be funded won't end congestion, would worsen pollution during construction and would only encourage more sprawl, he said.
\
""It's a 1956 solution to a 2002 problem,"" he said, pledging to mount a ""positive campaign on what you can do to move more people.""
\
The coalition thus joins an Olympia pro-environment group and staunch anti-tax Kirkland activists in blasting the plan, which was referred to voters by a harried Legislature in March after more than two years of intense haggling and stalemate failed to produce legislation.
\
Board members for 1000 Friends of Washington will meet June 27, and the land-use/environmental group will likely further swell opposition ranks.
\
""We don't like this initiative. This thing is full of projects that will contribute to sprawl,"" said John Healy, 1000 Friends' project director on Interstate 405 issues.
\
Plans to add traffic lanes to I-405 between Renton and Bellevue, at an estimated cost of $10 billion-plus ($1.8 million from Referendum 51 funds), have particularly peeved Puget Sound environmentalists.
\
""It's transportation business as usual, and transportation business as usual has gotten us into this mess. It's time for a new way of thinking,"" said Healy.
\
Clark County position?
\
What might be the message from Friends of Clark County, local affiliate of 1000 Friends of Washington?
\
So far, the local group has not taken a position, nor is it likely to, said recently named Director Steve Stuart.
\
In Clark County, ""there are some good things for transit and other alternatives. It's not a simple thing to say this is bad or good,"" said Stuart.
\
New park-and-ride lots, future HOV lanes and design for an I-5 bridge with light-rail capacity are among items linked to Referendum 51 funding. ""From a statewide perspective, I can see where they're coming from (furor over I-405, a new state Highway 520 floating bridge and other so-called mega-projects),"" he said.
\
Friends of Clark County does plan to sponsor and participate in public forums this autumn, getting a helping hand from Vancouver Democrat state Rep. Val Ogden, said Stuart. Given Ogden's strong support for Referendum 51, the objective is to debate pro and con sides, he said.
\
Healy of 1000 Friends believes there isn't much room for fence- sitting, however.
\
""I think you're going to find the environmental community is pretty uniform on this,"" he said. And that should play big in and around King County, heart of pro-transit and eco-friendly voters from whom a healthy ""yes"" margin is crucial if Referendum 51 is to pass, experts say.
\
All-out battle
\
Some observers had speculated any organized opposition would mean certain defeat for the fragile pro-Referendum 51 cause. But Hurley, Healy and others predict a costly, tight battle, recalling Paul Allen's effort to push his controversial Seattle Seahawks stadium referendum over the top in 1997.
\
With an expected $3 million to $4 million in campaign coffers, Referendum 51 backers must only wring out 50 percent plus one more vote, they note.
\
To do so, they'll have to win a fight they desperately didn't want. House Democrat leaders, including Speaker Frank Chopp, D- Seattle, have pleaded with transit and environmental groups not to mount attacks, to no avail.
\
""It's clear that the people who want to see this pass would prefer we just sat it out. It's our obligation not to do that,"" said Healy. He shrugs off potential backlash and environmental bashing, should Referendum 51 fail. ""If we roll over and let crummy policy carry the day, I'm not sure that helps our cause.""

146,"The state Senate on Wednesday proposed a $4.3 billion transportation budget that would include $38 million more for the North Spokane Corridor and $250,000 for work on a dangerous highway intersection in southwest Spokane.\Both fall far short of the ultimate price tags for those projects, but local lawmakers called it a victory to get any new money in a plan that also calls for saving money by delaying work on 31 other projects.\""This really was the only significant project that was added on,"" Sen. Chris Marr, D-Spokane, said of the north-south freeway money.\Marr also said that he's continuing to push for $14 million to build what state transportation officials say is the best fix for the intersection of U.S. 195 and Cheney-Spokane Road: a bridge over the highway.\The House is expected to release its own transportation plan soon; the two versions will be reconciled into a final budget.\The Senate is also calling for a study of how the state, which relies heavily on gas tax revenue to pay for roads, can keep paying those bills as motorists continue switching to high-mileage and electric vehicles.\""We have a long-term problem: Cars are getting more efficient, and people are driving less,"" said Senate Transportation Committee Chairwoman Mary Margaret Haugen, D-Camano Island. While that may be good for the environment, it also means that the state is collecting less gas tax than expected.\In fact, Haugen said, it now looks like recent gas tax increases that were expected to pay for 16 years' worth of transportation projects will be used up by 2015. So the budget also calls for a study of how else to get people to pay to use the roads.\""The fact is, gas tax is the most unreliable tax going forward,"" said Haugen. ""I don't know what the fuel of the future will be, but I doubt it will be petroleum.""\Several lawmakers said Wednesday that the state may eventually have a ""vehicle miles traveled"" tax based on how much people drive. Haugen also said that toll roads will become more common.\""We're looking at those sorts of things. They're years away,"" said Sen. Fred Jarrett, D-Mercer Island.\Marr said he's talked with electric-car advocates about whether they're willing to pay a tax in lieu of gas tax. They seemed open to the idea, he said.\""Let's face it, (electric cars) create wear and tear and congestion on the highway system,"" said Marr. It's not fair, he said, for the costs to be born just by gas and diesel users.\The Senate budget would pay for more than 400 projects, as well as four new small car ferries. It cut $120 million in rail projects, but Haugen and others said that some of that work is likely to be done with federal money instead. It also includes millions of dollars for transportation for disabled people, rural public transportation, and commuter van pools.\Marr and Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown in November proposed a slimmed-down version of the North Spokane Corridor. Fewer lanes and other changes cut the price tag for the freeway's next stretch from $720 million to $285 million. That would cover a three-mile stretch of new highway from Francis Avenue south to the Spokane River. The $38 million in the Senate budget would pay for changes in environmental plans and buying land.\Rep. Matt Shea, R-Mead, who tried unsuccessfully to pass a law steering more money into the $3 billion project, said he was ""relieved and heartened"" by the Senate plan. But he said that lawmakers must find a way to pay for the rest of the project.\The $250,000 for the U.S. 195 intersection was a late addition to the budget, prompted by the January death of 16-year-old Lorissa Green. Green, trying to cross the freeway at dusk, pulled out in front of an oncoming pickup and was killed. Family members and supporters packed a House hearing earlier this month to call for changes to improve visibility of oncoming vehicles. Reps. John Driscoll and Kevin Parker said they'll push to get the work in the House budget as well.\""We just need to push as a community for this improvement,"" said Spokane City Councilman Michael Allen, who was in Olympia on Wednesday.\Earlier this week, local attorney Steve Eugster told city officials that they could quickly improve safety at the intersection by lowering the highway speed limit.\The council has that power, so long as the state secretary of transportation agrees, he said.\""Any ordinary person knows the intersection is dangerous,"" Eugster wrote to the council. It's particularly dangerous to inexperienced or timid drivers, he said.\Allen said the council has asked city lawyers to look at the idea.\""It might be a short-term alternative,"" he said.\Staff writer Jonathan Brunt contributed to this report.

147,"
WASHINGTON -- Carefree American drivers and their sport-utility vehicles are guzzling cheap gas at the pumps, and that's having an extra payoff for the federal government: up to $1.5 billion in unanticipated fuel tax collections.
\
No matter how low the price of gas goes, drivers still pay their local, state and federal governments an average of 43 cents per gallon in taxes. The federal share is 18.4 cents, and the Clinton administration and the Republican-controlled Congress are already fighting over what to do with this revenue bonanza.
\
Under the nation's new $203 billion highway bill, gas tax revenues were split 80/20 between highway and mass transit programs. Any unanticipated money was supposed to be restricted to highway construction, traffic reduction and air quality improvements.
\
But with some $25 billion already in the pipeline for highway construction projects, the new Transportation Department budget outlines a different way to divvy up the $1.456 billion in extra gas tax revenues the administration now expects:
\
* $730 million for road construction, congestion reduction and air quality improvements.
\
* $291 million for mass transit.
\
* $250 million for surface transportation research.
\
* $125 million for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety programs.
\
* $35 million for rail programs, including grade-crossing eliminations.
\
* $25 million for a transportation preservation program.
\
That would mean roughly 50 percent being spent in ways other than those outlined in the highway bill.
\
""We are proposing to direct those resources to programs that we think are strategic and are in keeping with the overall needs identified by the administration, where we focus on investments in the environment, safety, technology and the like,"" Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said Monday during a briefing on the department's $45.5 billion budget.
"

FLORENCE, Ore. Gas prices in this small coastal town have hovered around the $2.50 per gallon mark for weeks now, with no drop in sight.
\
So even supporters of a plan to raise the city's gas tax by 3 cents per gallon have to admit that this isn't, perhaps, the best time to ask voters to pony up more at the pump.
\
""The timing is lousy,"" conceded Mayor Phil Brubaker, a self- described ""pro-business, fiscal conservative"" who has nevertheless been stumping for the gas tax at club meetings and homeowners' associations in anticipation of Tuesday's vote.
\
About a dozen Oregon cities, and others around the West, have similar taxes to pay for maintenance of city streets. But with gas prices in the region particularly in Oregon, Washington, California and Nevada among the highest in the nation, backlashes like the one in Florence could become more commonplace.
\
In Washington, Democratic Gov. Christine Gregoire just signed into law a new statewide gas tax that will mean a hike of 9.5 cents over four years. The money is intended to pay for massive transportation projects across the state, but Republicans already have begun a drive to collect enough signatures to put the issue to a statewide vote.
\
In Nevada, where the state gas tax is already 17.65 cents per gallon, lawmakers last month stopped a proposal to raise gas taxes by 2 cents a gallon each year for the next five years before it even really started.
\
""I will not move forward with any bill that raises gasoline taxes,"" said John Oceguera, the Democratic chairman of the Nevada Assembly Transportation and Homeland Security Committee.
\
In Arizona, legislators have gone a full 180 degrees from gas taxes, offering a proposal to let motorists who rack up the miles claim a 10-cent per gallon rebate, up to $200, for gasoline taxes paid between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
\
John Tapogna, an economist with Portland-based ECONorthwest, said that in the past, local gas taxes have been able to find favor with voters because the results were, quite literally, concrete.
\
""Voters could see in short order the benefits of the tax, in terms of improved roads or improved maintenance,"" he said.
\
But now, such taxes are likely to be a far harder sell, Tapogna said.
\
""Local willingness to increase taxes on gas is going to have to be viewed in the context of the current situation,"" he said. ""With prices having risen by 40 to 50 cents a gallon in the last few months, voters will take a second look.""
\
In tourist-oriented Florence, population 7,500, where retirees have settled in droves, the fracas over the gas tax started back in December, where city council members unanimously approved the tax to help pay for maintenance of the city's 36 miles of road.
\
There was no other choice, Brubaker said dollars from the logging trucks that used to rumble through town once paid for the wear-and-tear on streets, but that funding has dried up as the logging economy slowed.
\
Florence resident Suzanne Roberts said she was infuriated that the plan was passed without giving voters a say. She teamed up with former Florence Mayor Wilbur Ternyik to collect enough signatures to put the plan to a citywide vote.
\
It wasn't hard to collect the 450 signatures they needed, about 10 percent of those who voted in the last election. Gas prices in Oregon rank fifth in the nation, at an average of $2.48 as of May 3, according to the state's AAA affiliate. That's topped only by California, at $2.61, Nevada and Hawaii at $2.51 and Washington at $2.49.
\
""I don't think there is any question I think we will win,"" Roberts said of the vote-by-mail election that concludes Tuesday. ""There's already a heavy voter turnout here, and there's nothing else on our ballot of any interest.""
\
Brubaker, though, said he thinks the gas tax still has a shot. Voters understand, he said, that preventive maintenance now will stop the city's current roads from going to pot(holes) later. ""The city is built on sand,"" he said. ""Our environment is saltier, and since salt is a drying agent, the road surface is literally shrinking.""

When Rep. Deb Wallace saw an early list of projects to be included in a state transportation funding measure last March, she hit the roof.
\
For her 17th District in east Vancouver, where explosive growth has spawned daily traffic snarls at major intersections and freeway interchanges, the list included just $7 million in project dollars.
\
Wallace, the House Transportation Committee's Democratic vice chairman, told Chairman Ed Murray, D-Seattle, she would be voting against the package.
\
""I said that was unacceptable,"" she recalled. ""Clark County needed more.""
\
Adjustments were made. The final package, approved in April on a bipartisan vote in both the House and Senate, includes $244 million for 13 projects in Clark County. It's part of an $8.5 billion list of projects to be paid for over 16 years, mostly through a 9.5-cent gas tax increase to be phased in over four years.
\
Initiative 912 would repeal that tax increase and eliminate $5.475 billion in new revenue and net bond proceeds, cutting more than 80 percent of the money slated to fund 265 projects statewide. The measure would not repeal the increase in the diesel fuel tax or affect new weight fees on passenger vehicles.
\
I-912 was placed on the Nov. 8 ballot by anti-tax activists and endorsed by the Washington Republican Party.
\
Two Seattle KVI radio talk show hosts, former state legislator John Carlson and Kirby Wilbur, used the airwaves to galvanize opposition to the gas tax increase. Gas tax opponents gathered 420,000 signatures, more than twice as many as necessary, in just four weeks.
\
Their campaign accuses the Democrat-controlled Legislature and Gov. Christine Gregoire of embarking on a spending spree. It contends there is no guarantee the money raised will actually be used to reduce traffic congestion.
\
There's also residual bitterness among Republican leaders over the outcome of the contested 2004 governor's race.
\
State GOP Chairman Chris Vance recently told the Seattle Post- Intelligencer: ""What's driving this campaign is a lot broader than just transportation policy. It's an anger about the arrogant, out- of-control culture of the Democratic aristocracy that runs the state of Washington. .. The people elected Dino Rossi, and somehow Christine Gregoire ends up as governor.""
\
The pro-repeal campaign has raised about $400,000, most of it in donations of less than $100, according to campaign spokesman Brett Bader. A judge required Carlson and Wilbur to report the value of the air time they spent promoting the initiative as an ""in-kind"" donation.
\
Opponents of I-912, including many of the state's corporate heavyweights, have contributed more than $1 million, with major contributions from Microsoft, Weyerhaeuser Co., the Seattle Mariners and the state's asphalt paving association. Their campaign hopes to raise $2 million for fliers and television and radio ads.
\
Economic benefits touted
\
Though the Republican Party has endorsed I-912 and the Democratic Party opposes it, transportation funding is not strictly a partisan issue in Washington.
\
Eleven Republicans in the House and seven in the Senate voted for the transportation package. Local chambers of commerce, the statewide Association of Washington Business and the Washington Roundtable, an organization of chief executive officers of large companies, oppose repealing the tax.
\
They argue that Washington's unfunded transportation project backlog is hurting economic development.
\
In 2002, former Gov. Gary Locke's Competitiveness Council concluded: ""Washington's currently overwhelmed transportation system threatens jobs and economic vitality, wastes people's time and money, diminishes quality of life, and degrades our environment.""
\
That's even more true today, Vancouver transportation manager Thayer Rorabaugh told county commissioners last month.
\
""We are competing with the world in terms of the things we import and export,"" he said. ""This is a huge economic issue for the state of Washington.""
\
Vancouver consultant John D. White, who represents developers, governments and other clients, urged a no vote on I-912 in his latest newsletter.
\
""If we choose to eliminate the new gas tax, in the short term, traffic will get worse, safety deficiencies will get worse, and development moratoria will be the norm,"" White said. ""In the long term, our children and grandchildren will be forced to live, work and play elsewhere because we didn't choose now to build the foundation for healthy growth in the future.""
\
Transportation officials in Clark County hope the funding for long-sought projects survives the repeal. They're counting on the money to ease traffic at major choke points and address safety at hazardous intersections.
\
""We're all in this together,"" Rorabaugh said. ""The public largely doesn't know whether they are on a county road or a city street. All they want is for it to work.""
\
Local projects
\
At stake for motorists: $40 million to widen state Highway 14 through Camas, an unsafe stretch known locally as ""death alley""; $50 million to widen state Highway 502 west of Battle Ground; $58 million for a new Interstate 205-18th Street interchange to relieve pressure on the busy Mill Plain interchange; $26.3 million for a new state Highway 500-St. Johns Boulevard interchange; $10 million to update the Interstate 5-Ridgefield interchange; and several smaller projects.
\
Also at risk is $50 million for environmental studies that will help determine how the region addresses the need for a new I-5 crossing over the Columbia River.
\
Don Wagner, the state transportation department's regional administrator, says the Transportation Partnership Act responds to local needs.
\
""These projects did not get on the list because we said they were needed, but because local people asked for them,"" he told Clark County commissioners last month. ""There are some things, like love, that money can't buy. And there are others, like roads, that only money can buy.""
\
Money to widen state Highway 502 is critical to Battle Ground's future, says public works director Sam Adams especially because a new I-5 interchange at 219th Street, paid for with a 5-cent gas tax increase the Legislature adopted in 2003, already is on the drawing board. Without the widening, vehicles will spill off the new freeway exit ramp onto a two-lane road choked with traffic.
\
""Battle Ground serves 40,000 people in north county,"" Adams said. ""Without this, we're going to see growth stifled, and travel time will increase.""
\
Ridgefield, the county's fastest-growing city, needs an updated I- 5 interchange to accommodate a growing population and future industrial, commercial and office park development, said public works director Justin Clary. Between April 2003 and April 2004, the population of Ridgefield grew by 20 percent, to 2,630. Clary's office issued 221 building permits this year through Sept. 30.
\
The existing interchange, built in 1961 to serve a rural community, is at capacity, Clary said. It will be woefully inadequate to handle new traffic generated by development on 1,500 acres between the freeway and Northwest 45th Avenue. Clary said he gets almost daily inquiries from developers. ""Often, the limiting factor is the capacity of that interchange.""
\
Passage of I-912 could jeopardize $15 million of the $55 million needed for the I-5/Salmon Creek interchange, one of the county's gnarliest traffic messes, said Bill Wright, traffic manager for the Clark County Department of Public Works. The $15 million was included in the 2003 ""nickel"" gas tax, which is independent of the tax hike targeted by I-912, but things could change if the 2006 Legislature is forced to reassess its priorities.
\
Reducing accidents
\
State transportation officials say investments in safe roads made possible by the gas tax increase will reduce the number of injury accidents statewide by more than 3,000 per year. One of the most dangerous stretches is state Highway 14 through Camas and Washougal.
\
""We've got a section of a state route that is causing more casualties than any other state highway,"" said Washougal public works director Scott Sawyer. Between January 2002 and December 2004, the state tallied 112 accidents in that stretch.
\
New gas tax money will widen the highway between state Highway 500 in Camas and 6th Avenue in Washougal.
\
Routing city streets onto a fast-moving highway is a recipe for accidents, Sawyer said.
\
Highway 14 ""looks like a freeway, people drive it like a freeway, they drive it at 60 miles per hour,"" he said. ""Then the freeway ends when you come into Camas. You are asking thousands of people per day to pay attention and make a decision on whether to slow down.""
\
Even if the gas tax survives I-912's challenge, growth in Clark County will outstrip the region's system of freeways, highways, county roads and city streets, said state traffic engineer Bart Gernhart.
\
""We will never have less congestion on the roads than we have today,"" Gernhart said. ""The question is, how much worse will it get, and how much will we invest in the system?""
\
Campaign tightens
\
Despite the high stakes, the campaigns both for and against the gas tax repeal have been low profile in Clark County. With ballots scheduled to go in the mail next week, there's been virtually no broadcast media advertising here.
\
The pro-initiative campaign recently changed its name from Nonewgastax.com to Yes912.com to avoid voter confusion in an election where saying no to the tax means saying yes to the measure on the ballot.
\
For the same reason, the campaign opposing I-912 also has changed its name, from Keep Washington Rolling to No on 912.
\
Privately commissioned polls indicate that 55 percent supported repeal of the gas tax last summer. But a poll by Seattle independent pollster Stuart Elway released in early October showed support for repeal slipping to 41 percent, with 48 percent opposed.
\
The single biggest factor mentioned by voters who plan to support I-912 is rapidly escalating gas prices. In a September Elway poll, 44 percent of initiative supporters cited the price of gas at the pump as the reason they would vote to repeal the tax.
\
But though the cost of a gallon of gas in Washington has jumped $1 in a year, ""not one cent of that dollar has gone into Washington's infrastructure,"" Gregoire said in a September visit to a busy Vancouver intersection.
\
The 3-cent increase that went into effect July 1 boosted the state gas tax to 31 cents per gallon, tying Washington for the eighth-highest gas tax in the nation. But according to the Washington Research Council, the 37.5-cent tax motorists will pay after July 2008, when the full 9.5-cent increase takes effect, will still be less than motorists paid in 1969 in constant dollars adjusted for inflation.
\
Winners, losers
\
Clark County has historically contributed more in state gas tax revenue than it has received in project dollars. That won't change under the new gas tax distribution formula. Over the next 10 years, the county will get back 70 cents in federal and state transportation investments for each $1 in gas tax it contributes, or $1.14 billion for the $1.63 billion it spends.
\
In contrast, the Puget Sound region will receive $1.2 billion more in projects than it contributes in gas tax revenue.
\
But though Wallace herself lobbied for more money for Clark County, she says pitting one region against another ignores the many ways in which the state's regional economies are interrelated.
\
""People will say, 'Why should we pay for roads in Eastern Washington?'"" For Vancouver, the answer is simple, she said: ""Our port is the largest grain port on the West Coast. And Puget Sound is our economic engine. They pay a lot of taxes that fund services across the state.""
\
There's another reason Seattle projects should matter to all Washington residents, she added: The elevated Alaskan Way Viaduct, which serves the Port of Seattle and carries more than 103,000 vehicles a day, was damaged in the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, and engineers say it could collapse in a major quake. The transportation package provides $2.5 billion to replace the elevated highway.
\
""There are transportation people who won't park under the Alaskan Way Viaduct now,"" Wallace said. ""What we are really talking about is people's lives.""
\
If I-912 passes, there really is no Plan B, Gregoire said at a news conference in Olympia last month.
\
One possible scenario is that each part of the state might go its own way. For example, Seattle could try to raise money on its own to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct and the city's earthquake- vulnerable Highway 520 Floating Point Bridge.
\
""That's very risky,"" Wallace said. ""Puget Sound will get its projects, but the rest of the state could be left out of the game.""
\
A scenario that's unlikely, Wallace said, is a repeat of what lawmakers achieved last spring. ""It was so amazing we were able to get a bipartisan transportation funding package out of the Legislature,"" she said. ""I don't know that the stars line up to do that again.""

Did you know?
\
* The transportation funding measure targeted by I-912 shares state gas tax revenue with local governments.
\
* In 2008, when the 9.5-cent tax increase is fully phased in, 1 cent from each gallon of gas sold in Washington will be shared with counties and incorporated cities. That will mean an additional $1 million for Clark County and $700,000 for Vancouver money they can use to match federal grants.

150,"
OLYMPIA -- Environmentalists suggested ways to avoid cuts in the state's natural resources budget on Wednesday, including a list of possible permit and user fees, as they outlined their agenda for the upcoming legislative session.
\
The governor's proposed budget provides ""too little to protect our air, land and water,"" said Josh Baldi, policy director of the Washington Environmental Council.
\
Environmental groups also talked about how the Legislature should respond to the defeat of Referendum 51, which would have increased gas taxes to pay for transportation.
\
Peter Hurley, executive director of the Transportation Choices Coalition, said his group supports a three-cent gas tax increase to pay for basic maintenance and safety, plus a 1 percent car excise tax to pay for transportation ""choices"" such as buses, vanpools and trains.
\
Anything more than that, Hurley said, should go to the voters. ""Before increasing taxes, we need to fix the system that voters clearly don't have confidence in,"" he added.
\
The state agencies charged with protecting the environment amount to less than 2 percent of the budget. As the state faces a $2 billion budget hole, however, even small agencies are vulnerable to cuts.
\
Mindful of the pressure on budget writers, environmentalist leaders took care to propose funding solutions.
\
For example, the governor's budget proposes closing some state parks. Baldi said the Legislature could increase the 0.5 percent recreational boat excise tax, or charge a similar tax on recreational vehicles, and use the money to support parks.
\
Baldi also suggested creating a new fee on diesel machinery to fund clean air programs, or increasing the $10 water-rights permitting fee to pay for improvements in that program.
\
""There's a feeling among voters, if you're going to have a tax or a fee it should be connected to the services that are being provided,"" Baldi said.
\
The last time anyone proposed increasing water rights permit fees was in 1993, Ecology Department spokeswoman Sheryl Hutchison said, when the Legislature nixed the idea.
\
Baldi praised Gov. Gary Locke for including $700,000 in his budget to phase out toxic chemicals and $2 million for shoreline protection.
\
Environmentalists also outlined other priorities for the legislative session, including:
\
* Phasing out the sale of products that contain mercury, a neurotoxin that's especially harmful to pregnant women and young children, when cost-effective replacement products are available; also, requiring manufacturers of products containing mercury to pay for recycling and disposal programs.
\
* Creating a transportation package that allocates a third of the money for mass transit and other alternatives to highway driving. Hurley said the Transportation Department needs to regain consumer confidence.
\
* Resisting efforts at ""permit streamlining""; long sought by the business community and favored by many Republicans, environmentalists worry this idea would sacrifice important environmental protections.

151,"
A state climate change panel is considering a slate of bold proposals to reduce vehicle use in the interest of lowering greenhouse gas emissions:
\
More bike paths, sidewalks and HOV lanes.
\
More high-speed bus and passenger train alternatives.
\
Congestion pricing to induce people to drive at times other than rush hour.
\
Changes to the Growth Management Act that would reward high- density, transit-oriented development and make it harder to expand urban growth boundaries.
\
How these recommendations would play in Clark County if the Legislature eventually adopts them is an open question. The state's first attempt to get the county's motorists to leave their cars in the garage didn't exactly catch on.
\
In 2001, the Washington Department of Transportation painted a high-occupancy vehicle lane on Interstate 5 between Northeast 99th Street and Mill Plain Boulevard. The experiment was abandoned four years later, a victim of driver preference and a bottleneck on the Oregon side that limited its usefulness.
\
And when it comes to limiting suburban growth and promoting transit-oriented development, Clark County appears to be moving in the opposite direction.
\
Next month, county commissioners are expected to adopt a new land use plan that pushes out the urban growth boundary by 12,000 acres to accommodate another 184,000 residents over the next 20 years. About 1,900 acres west of Brush Prairie, released for residential development by the commission in April, is not served by C-Tran, so at least 1,500 new households there will have to depend on cars to get to work and run errands.
\
County Commissioner Steve Stuart called the county's efforts to reduce driving ""a mixed bag.""
\
The new county comprehensive plan does identify transit corridors for future bus rapid transit or light rail tied to a new Interstate 5 bridge over the Columbia River, he noted. Future bridge commuters will likely pay tolls, and those tolls could be priced to reduce congestion by rewarding drivers who avoid rush hour. The Chelatchie Railroad holds the potential for one day connecting Vancouver and Battle Ground by passenger rail.
\
But that's all in the future.
\
""You have to build the structure for those things to be successful,"" Stuart said. ""High-capacity transit has to have high densities to be successful, densities we don't see yet in Clark County.""
\
C-Tran spokesman Scott Patterson said the transit agency will overhaul its routes and schedules beginning Sept. 30, but the focus will be on increasing the frequency of bus service on existing routes and adding night runs, not expanding the area of its coverage.
\
""There aren't any plans currently to serve those areas"" recently opened to development, Patterson said. ""Were we to get more funding, our priority would be more service later in the evening and greater frequency"" to make existing routes more convenient.
\
Team meets Tuesday
\
A Climate Advisory Team appointed by Gov. Chris Gregoire last spring is approaching the halfway point in its assignment: crafting recommendations for the governor and the 2008 Legislature to reduce Washington's greenhouse gas contributions to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2050.
\
The team meets Tuesday in Seattle to begin receiving proposals from five working groups on strategies to limit greenhouse gas emissions and encourage energy efficiency and conservation in every part of the state's economy, from agriculture and forestry to energy generation to the residential, commercial and industrial sectors.
\
The transportation sector, which contributes 45 percent of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, would see some of the most sweeping changes.
\
Technology fixes are a part of the mix. For example, the transportation working group will propose that Washington consider adopting California's low-carbon fuels target.
\
Even so, K.C. Golden of the Seattle group Climate Solutions says those steps will take the state only so far without a significant reduction in miles driven by Washington residents.
\
""It is still possible to do better with a low-carbon fuel standard,"" he said. ""We have not pushed to the outer edges of what is possible. But if vehicle miles traveled continue to increase at the current clip, the results pretty much flatten our greenhouse gas emissions, and we need to reduce them.""
\
Significant reductions in the miles motorists drive will require both lifestyle changes and dramatic shifts in the way the state plans for growth and designs its transportation infrastructure.
\
State transportation planners could be required to consider the impact of new highway projects on the state's carbon dioxide emissions. They could be directed to plan for the safe movement of bicycles and pedestrians along and across most highways.
\
Some highway lanes could be set aside for vanpools, buses, trucks, and even ""green vehicles"" like gas-electric hybrids. That's already happening in Phoenix, under an experiment that allows drivers of the Toyota Prius, Honda Civic and Insight hybrids to use 73 miles of HOV lanes if they get special permits and plates.
\
Cities and counties could be required to invest in transit, bike trails and sidewalks as they expand their street systems.
\
""Our development regs already require complete streets in most situations for new streets,"" Stuart said. That's been true for at least 10 years. ""The challenge is retrofitting the streets we already have. For sidewalks alone, we have almost a $400 million deficit.""
\
The county has a master plan for bicycle commuting routes, but just seven of 26 miles of bike paths and dedicated bike lanes have been completed, Stuart said.
\
Retrofitting city streets and county roads with bike lanes and sidewalks will cost money. The transportation working group suggests increasing state funding for such projects and also giving local governments more flexibility to use their share of gas tax revenues to fund them.
\
Growth outstrips transit
\
Building alternative transportation systems that can catch up with runaway growth is a statewide challenge, said Mary McCumber of land use watchdog group Futurewise.
\
""Oregon made a decision on its growth management about two decades earlier than Washington,"" she said. ""When we passed the Growth Management Act in 1990, we already had large numbers of people living in unincorporated areas. We had to bring those people into our urban growth areas. ""
\
The question for the future, she said, is, ""How do we make our urban places work better, so people don't have to drive everywhere and get stuck in traffic?""
\
One way, she said, is to require cities and counties to identify their centers of housing and employment, and try to place those close enough to each other so that people can use mass transit, or bicycle, or walk, from home to work and back.
\
Stuart said the county's new comprehensive plan attempts to do just that in places like the La Center I-5 interchange.
\
""The La Center junction is being brought in for light industrial and office business park use,"" he said. ""It will provide jobs for a city that has very few jobs right now, and a chance to diversify their economic base. It will increase the vitality of the community.""
\
Another benefit: If it works, he said, it will reduce commute times for residents of La Center and the north county.
\
In the end, said Golden, ""Our growth management and transportation decisions are the decisions that have the biggest impact on how much we need our cars and what alternatives are available.""
\
The question of how or whether to rebuild Seattle's earthquake- damaged Alaskan Way Viaduct ""is a great example,"" he said. ""Do we make a huge new investment that will cause us to use more fossil fuels?""
\
Stuart agrees that Washington can't build its way out of its traffic problem. ""You can never build enough roadways to build yourself out of congestion. When you increase capacity, you induce traffic and you tap latent demand.""
\
At the same time, he hopes Washington learns a lesson from Oregon's experience with Measure 37, the property rights measure passed by voters who felt that state's land use laws were too restrictive.
\
""I believe Measure 37 was a result of overly draconian rules on the other side of the river,"" he said. ""You can only lead people as far as they can be led. Draconian measures won't work. If we get too restrictive, there will be pushback."" Some Clark County residents will never use mass transit, even if it's available, and that's fine, Stuart said.
\
""We need to provide options for people. Some will thrive in that high-density transit-oriented environment. However, there are people in this county who pay just as many taxes who want to live in a suburb or a rural area and they have no need or desire to be served by transit.""

152,"OLYMPIA - Lawmakers concerned about how environmental problems adversely affect lower-income communities have put forth what they call the HEAL Act, which stands for healthy environment for all.\The bill, which passed the Senate, would create a task force to advise certain state agencies on policy in an attempt to create environmental equity.\Environmental justice is a real issue, not the product of ""wild-eyed lefties,"" said Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Beacon Hill.\""There's a real concept that our environment and the way that our economy operates has disproportionate impacts on poor people, which are generally high concentrations of communities of color,"" he said.\Agencies would have to incorporate data compiled in an interactive map by the Department of Health, which compares demographics with environmental influences, such as water or air quality. The map shows parts of Spokane as having the most severe environmental health disparities in the state.\Sen. Andy Billig, D-Spokane, cited a Spokane Regional Health District report which showed certain neighborhoods in Spokane have drastically different life expectancies.\""From people that live two miles apart, from the Upper South Hill to West Central, there's a 20-year life span disparity. That's dramatic,"" said Billig, a cosponsor of the HEAL Act. ""Certainly, environmental factors are a contributor to that inequality.""\Along with the HEAL bill, lawmakers have focused this session on energy efficiency in an effort to reduce fossil-fuel consumption and ease the state's contribution to climate change.\One bill could phase out the use of natural gas and coal by electric utilities in Washington in an attempt to reach 100% ""clean"" energy - or not produced by fossil fuels - by 2045.\The bill, part of Gov. Jay Inslee's clean-energy package, could lower greenhouse gas emissions. It includes fines for utilities that fail to comply.\Avista announced last week the utility would comply with the proposed regulations and would try to provide a carbon-neutral electric supply by 2027.\It's notable that state utilities are attempting to comply even before the bill becomes law, Billig said.\""All of this significant environmental leadership and legislation that's happening around the state is really to the benefit of our citizens because it means cleaner air and cleaner water,"" he said.\The Senate, which previously passed the bill 28-19, must now consider whether to accept amendments made in the House which outline more stringent requirements for utilities.\Commercial buildings larger than 50,000 square feet would be subject to new energy standards to be determined by the Department of Commerce, under one bill that passed the Legislature last week. It would also require the State Building Code Council to develop rules regarding electric vehicle charge stations at all new buildings.\Household appliances that use water or electricity, such as toilets, computers, and water heaters, would have to meet new state efficiency standards under a different bill.\The new regulations would apply to products manufactured on or after Jan. 1, 2021.\Supporters say it could save customers money on energy, but opponents cited it as an example of overregulation.\""We would still like to keep government out of our bathrooms,"" said Rep. Matt Shea, R-Spokane Valley.\But the Legislature looks unlikely to pass a clean-fuel proposal.\One bill that emphasized alternatives to gasoline and diesel stalled in a Senate committee. A transportation package, which includes a carbon fee and gas tax increase to pay for various projects in the state, may not be considered this session.\Lawmakers also want to better manage waste in an effort to reduce pollution.\One bill, which passed the Senate but could face challenge in the House, would ban stores from providing single-use plastic bags and instead offer paper bags for an 8-cent fee. The ban would replace 27 local bag ordinances with one statewide rule.\The fee is meant to offset the cost to stores which pay more for paper bags than they do for plastic.\The ban would be an attempt to reduce litter caused by plastic bags, which are difficult to recycle in Spokane. Waste Management does not accept plastic bags because they clog the machinery. All bags they collect are sent to the city's incinerator. Private recycling companies in Spokane, like Earthworks Recycling and Action Recycling Inc., also won't accept plastic bags.\This issue could be addressed by plans for a Recycling Development Center that passed the Legislature last week. The center would analyze recycling policy and create a statewide outreach program to residents. Local governments would also be required to develop a recycling plan under the bill.\A ban on plastic straws passed the Senate, but not the House, and is likely dead for the 2019 session.\Protecting Washington's southern resident orca pod has been another priority in the Legislature.\That concern is behind a bill the Legislature passed to invest in oil-spill prevention and require tug escorts for certain oil tankers. Another bill under consideration would regulate products with harmful chemicals to keep them out of the environment.\A bill that would create a minimum distance boats must stay from orcas looks likely to pass, but another bill that would have imposed a three-year moratorium on whale-watching died in committee.\Lawmakers still don't agree on how to get more salmon to orcas.\With budget negotiators working on a compromise on the 2019-21 operating budget, the House operating budget contains money to study the effect of removing dams along the Snake River, but the Senate's budget does not.\It's just one of many differences in the two budget proposals that will have to be negotiated before lawmakers leave Olympia.\Earth Day\""We would still\like to keep government out of our bathrooms.""\Rep.

Remove light rail from proposal
\
If we are tired of tilting at windmills and really want to build the Columbia River bridge, all that is required is to remove the light rail. This would allow a taller bridge that would save the payment of $86 million to the upstream industries, reduce the rail portion cost by nearly $1 billion, and allow a $450 million buy-in by the Washington Legislature. The light rail is not cost-effective and is very slow compared with existing express buses, so why don't we act smart?

War on cannabis is over
\
The recent decision by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson that municipalities can prohibit the production, processing and retailing of cannabis is not a surprise. It was not an oversight in I-502 but a recognition that local jurisdictions have some control concerning activities in their area and rightly so.
\
Municipalities that prohibit cannabis firms may think they are keeping their communities wholesome and cannabis-free, but in reality they are merely handing over jobs, revenue and customers to smarter municipalities.
\
The war on cannabis is over. The U.S. Department of Justice has spoken on this. State-regulated cannabis activities will not be prosecuted if they are well-regulated. The issue has been put to rest.
\
Now that a quiet, non-polluting, revenue-producing activity can be prohibited, let's take on local control over truly dangerous, costly, economically destructive activities like coal trains and oil terminals.

Local moratoriums shortsighted
\
Local officials who extend moratoriums on legal marijuana processing and sales strengthen the black market and endanger law enforcement. Over 93,000 Clark County voters helped pass Initiative I-502 in 2012, and the state has approved various licenses for Clark County. Impeding those licenses not only invites lawsuits, but also forfeits tax revenue, much from out of state. Rather than encouraging new business revenues, they choose needless legal expense.
\
Washington history buffs may recall that Initiative 61 ended alcohol prohibition in 1932. This worked because of strong regulation, fair taxation and a crackdown on illegal producers. When Washington approved a state lottery in the early 1980s, Vancouver's Day-N-Nite market at Sixth and Washington was one of the highest-grossing outlets in the state. Why? Because of Portland. With their proximity to the border, Vancouver and Clark County are well-positioned to garner millions in new revenues. Rather than facilitate this, though, our ""leaders"" forgo that to strengthen the black market.
\
It is shortsighted to abandon marijuana taxes, frustrate the will of the people and invite lawsuits. May leaders at every level see this, to move firmly forward toward legal, responsible, regulated and profitable local marijuana production and sales.

Speak out about oil trains
\
The proposed oil terminal in Vancouver will bring at least five miles of North Dakota crude trains to Vancouver every day. Ask any Realtor; this project will kill the Vancouver waterfront project and downtown development. That means the oil terminal could kill at least two jobs for each job it creates.
\
Four oil trains have exploded within six months. Oil tankers rupture, catch fire and send flaming oil downhill. We should not be increasing fossil fuel infrastructure when most scientists say we need to reduce carbon pollution. The oil terminal and trains will degrade air quality, our health, our quality of life and our economy. How will elected officials know what you think, unless you tell them? Governor Inslee has the final say.

Don't boost minimum wage
\
Gov. Jay Inslee is attempting to raise the minimum wage in the state of Washington.
\
I'm not sure what they are teaching in economic classes in schools nowadays, but I learned that the best way to slow down the sale of a product is to raise the price on that product. So, doesn't it make sense that if you raise the price of an hourly wage that you'll get less employment?
\
Businesses are having a hard enough time with the economic environment without the government interfering and raising the cost of doing that business.

Gas tax would help Seattle
\
I've got an idea. Since Gov. Jay Inslee wants to raise the gas tax for the entire state so the mess in Seattle gets fixed (""Inslee's proposals face big hurdles,"" Jan. 20), ignoring the many problems in Southwest Washington, especially the Columbia River Crossing, Mill Plain/Fourth Plain travel, etc., why don't we in the Vancouver area just drive across the river and fill up there? Perhaps the loss of the gas tax will wake them up. And how about charging those who use electric cars some type of road tax? What is good for Seattle isn't necessarily good for the rest of the state. Why should we pay for their improvements?

GRANTS PASS - Driving his cruiser through the morning fog on Highway 199, Trooper Butch Lamkin knows he's the only state lawman on duty for an entire county. The trouble is, the drivers seem to know it too.
\
""With the lack of police presence, it's a real target-rich environment,"" Lamkin said, his way of saying there's more speeders out there than he can ever possibly catch.
\
As if on cue, the pitch on his radar went up like the whistle on a tea kettle, and he whipped around to pull over a driver speeding through the mist at 70 mph.
\
By the end of his 10-hour, solo shift, Lamkin had hit his flashing blue and red lights on 20 drivers, hardly enough to shake the percentages stacked in favor of the speeders, the drunken-drivers and the fugitives.
\
""Being the only one out, I'm not ever going to affect freeway traffic,"" he said. ""The freeway is going to get away with whatever they are doing.""
\
When the Legislature convenes later this month, one of the top issues will be finding a way to rebuild the Oregon State Police, which has lost more than 200 troopers to budget cuts over the last two decades.
\
""The essence of the problem is funding,"" said Steve Marks, Gov. John Kitzhaber's top policy adviser.
\
And ever since the 1979-80 biennium, when voters took state police off the gas tax and put them in the general fund, funding has withered. Property tax relief measures that gave the state more responsibility for school funding did a lot of the damage.
\
Twenty years ago, there were 539 troopers on patrol. Today, there are 331.
\
In Josephine County, the number has been trimmed from 20 to just six. They all work out of their homes, parking their cruisers in their driveways. The station along Interstate 5 is closed.
\
This year, Kitzhaber proposed hiring 100 extra troopers still 100 short of 1980 patrol levels but when a cooling economy produced a lower revenue forecast, he cut that back to just 25 new troopers for the last seven months of the biennium.
\
Squeezing the trooper funding is a measure passed by voters calling for more funding for state parks, and Kitzhaber's desire to protect his new juvenile crime-prevention program.
\
Republicans controlling the Legislature believe they can find money for 100 troopers, leveraged by federal funding that kicks in a quarter of the cost for three years. Kitzhaber has said he will cooperate, but the process will be difficult.
\
""The vast majority of legislators are in support, strong support, of additional Oregon State Police funding for officers going on the road,"" said state Rep. Ben Westlund, chairman of the Ways and Means Public Safety Subcommittee that will handle the state police budget. ""This is a zero-sum game. If somebody is getting, somebody else is losing.
\
Westlund will be looking at Oregon State Police Officers Association complaints about administration inefficiencies, as well as county sheriffs' claims they can do a more cost-effective job.
\
""Getting the money depends on how well we apply it to putting troopers on the road,"" he said.
\
For the past 20 years, state police have been steadily losing ground as the numbers of cars and trucks on Oregon roads has grown. The result has been declining enforcement.
\
The 539 troopers on patrol handed out 106,637 speeding tickets in the 1979-80 biennium, compared to just 65,716 written by the 332 patrol troopers in the 1995-96 biennium a 38 percent drop matching the 38 percent decline in trooper numbers.
\
Drunken-driving arrests fell 63 percent. Careless and reckless driving citations were down 37 percent, and all hazardous violation citations were down 58 percent.
\
In the days of plenty, state police were paid for out of the highway fund, which was pumped up with gas taxes, vehicle registrations and truck taxes. Each penny of the 24-cent gas tax generates $16.2 million, enough to put 98 troopers on the road, counting cruisers, uniforms and support for two years.
\
Since 1979, the number of licensed drivers has grown from 1.9 million to 2.5 million, a 33 percent increase. Vehicle registration is up 41 percent, from 2.4 million to 3.4 million. Truck registration has jumped 450 percent from 70,121 to 385,955. Miles traveled on Oregon highways has risen from 6.8 billion to 10.2 billion, a 38 percent increase.
\
Fatalities have not seen the same kinds of increases, bouncing around between a high of 676 in 1988 and a low of 472 in 1992. State police attribute the lack of an increase to better-engineered cars and better medical care.
\
Kitzhaber has said he would support a ballot measure to put state police back under the gas tax, without increasing the tax. That means squeezing highway construction and maintenance funds.
\
Westlund isn't sure how he feels about that. But he is interested in Washington state's system, where the number of troopers is mandated by law to keep pace with vehicle registrations.
\
Statewide, state police figure they are down a total of 415 people, which includes crime lab technicians and support staff.
\
, and have asked for a total of 220 patrol positions.
\
Even if 100 new troopers are funded, their impact will be spread thin over 36 work sites and 14 resident outposts. Grants Pass, for example, would get 1 trooper out of the first 50 new positions and four if there are 100. It would take 200 new patrol positions to boost them 13 spots to near their former staff level.
\
That would give Lamkin more time to patrol Interstate 5 and perhaps instill a bit more fear in speeding drivers.
\
""He's sitting right in front of the 55 on-ramp with a customer,"" a trucker informed his good buddies on the CB radio.
\
""I'm a law-abiding citizen,"" another trucker replied sarcastically. ""I'm not worried.""

155,"
OLYMPIA - He's no Newt Gingrich as a public speaker, but Gov. Gary Locke got a warm response to his first State of the State address.
\
Taking over the podium a few hours after the fiery House speaker departed Tuesday, the Democratic governor told the Republican-controlled Legislature, ""We cannot afford to coast into the 21st century.""
\
Fellow Democrats liked his appeals for action on education, the environment and for ""working families,"" and said he was a good counterpoint to the high-profile speaker. Even Republicans found little to fault in Locke's speech, particularly when he embraced their views on the changing role of government.
\
A big clunker with the GOP, though, was when Locke continued to press for a gasoline tax increase.
\
Locke's main theme was a call for government to join with citizens and the private sector to work on a variety of pressing needs, including education, restoring salmon runs and spreading economic prosperity statewide.
\
Washington's economy seldom has been so healthy, but ""this is no time to rest on our laurels or to assume that our economic good luck will last forever,"" the governor told a joint session of the Legislature.
\
Locke broke no new ground in his low-key, 30-minute address, but tried to summon bipartisan support for the legislative package he had previously sent up, including proposals for:
\
n A gas tax increase for highways. Republican leaders have said no tax increase will be considered this year, but on Tuesday were talking about a plan that involves greater use of car-licensing tax money and state bonds.
\
n An ambitious new corps of volunteers to help all elementary pupils learn to read. His education agenda also includes charter schools, greater use of technology, extra pay for teachers who have national certification, scholarships for college students in teacher-training programs and quicker certification of mid-career or retiring professionals who want to teach.
\
n A renewed effort to save the region's dwindling salmon runs.
\
n Tax credits and tax cuts. Locke wants a $35 cut in the tax paid on car license tabs and has suggested a variety of tax incentives for businesses.
\
Borrowing a page from a fellow ""New Democrat,"" President Clinton, Locke said the days of a new government program for every problem are over.
\
""That strategy didn't work,"" he said. ""When government promised more than it could ever deliver, the result was a disillusioned public, and problems that continued to get worse instead of better.
\
""Worse yet, relying on government alone to solve our problems diminished the importance of citizenship and the value of personal responsibility. That's the trend we must reverse before this century ends.""
\
In its place, Locke suggested ""partnerships between citizens, schools, business, labor and government at every level.""
\
He said his plan for a Washington Reading Corps is a prime example. He wants to train 25,000 volunteer tutors to work one-on-one with more than 80,000 school children.
\
He suggested making a unified effort to spread the prosperity of the Puget Sound region to the rest of the state. Tax incentives to lure companies to set up in distressed areas should help, he said.
\
""None of us was elected to preside over two Washingtons,"" Locke said.
\
He made an economic argument for his transportation plan.
\
""Gridlock on our freeways will cause gridlock in our economy if we don't act now,"" the governor said.
\
The state needs about $2.5 billion over the next five years for transportation, and it can't come at the expense of schools and other services.
\
""I don't see any way to do that without a gas tax increase,"" he said. ""I know it's politically unpopular, but it's the right thing to do.""
\
Most Republicans sat in silence; a smattering of Democrats applauded.
\
After the speech, Republican leaders were generally restrained in their analysis. They attacked the governor's repeated call for a gas tax and said they'll have a better plan.
\
Senate Majority Leader Dan McDonald, R-Bellevue, said the speech ""seemed long on style and short on substance.""
\
Both he and House Speaker Clyde Ballard, R-East Wenatchee, said they favored Locke's call for more help for the elderly who want to live at home, and for a new emphasis on reading in public schools.
\
Both men said they were interested in Locke's call for extra compensation for master teachers, but said they'd want to look at the particulars.

156,"
A federal judge has struck a blow for a hiking group in its long-running battle against off-road vehicles in the back country.
\
The decision echoed an earlier ruling in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.
\
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein ruled the Wenatchee National Forest failed to adequately study the cumulative effect of a proposed trails project in the Mad River area west of Lake Chelan.
\
The Forest Service said the project would increase motorized vehicle use by about 10 percent.
\
A group of seven Washington environmental organizations filed suit to block the project, saying the government violated the National Environmental Policy Act.
\
Rothstein issued a preliminary injunction on Aug. 31, requiring the government to go back and draw up a full environmental impact statement rather than the more cursory environmental assessment issued by Wenatchee Forest officials n 1997.
\
The analysis found the project would cause no significant problems for the environment, but Rothstein ruled that the agency failed to address the cumulative effect of trails on the environment and failed to consider the project's effects on wildlife outside the narrowly defined project area.
\
Three years ago, Rothstein made a similar ruling on a similar project in the Dark Divide roadless area on the Gifford Pinchot.
\
""Now, the Gifford Pinchot and the Cowlitz Valley Ranger District is looking at more of a bigger picture,"" said Craig Engelking, back country advocacy coordinator for the Washington Trails Association.
\
District Ranger Harry Cody is scheduled to be on hand this weekend for a campout sponsored by the trails association in the Dark Divide.
\
Engelking said the weekend activities will include guided hikes, trail maintenance and briefings from people working on different parts of the projects proposed for Western Washington's largest unroaded area that isn't currently designated as wilderness.
\
Three years ago, Rothstein agreed with plaintiffs who argued the Gifford Pinchot failed to consider the overall effects of a project to reconstruct trails in the Dark Divide.
\
The rugged and steep Langille and Juniper trails run along open ridge tops in the high alpine area 11 miles south of Randle.
\
But the trails association continues to criticize the Forest Service for a new proposal to add new, relocated or reconstructed motorized trails in the 57,000-acre area.
\
The organization pins some of the blame on a Washington program that funnels a small portion of gas tax revenues toward off-road activities and roads that don't directly benefit from state highway projects. The program, called NOVA, has about $5.4 million to dispense to various projects, most of which pay for off-road facilities, trails and enforcement.

I do. I know that it's not particularly popular, but each municipality acts on its own. The state law just enabled them to consider doing it.

I think the state can set those minimum standards, but should be challenging the districts to get up to those standards. ... That's really what I'd like to see, is the state funding it, setting minimum standards and then letting the individual districts go to work.\GRAPHIC: Map: 3rd Legislative District"

You can put the Superintendent of Public Instruction into a cabinet post rather than an elected office. That would cut the staffing in half and create another level of accountability. ... Personally I'd like to see staffing levels reduced at a lot of these agencies and then salaries frozen, salaries cut.\Would you support gay marriage? If it came up (for a vote), probably not. I think it should stay where it is right now. (The law) serves the purpose and it provides the legal rights that married couples have - if not in name, then in practice. ... As a private citizen I voted to uphold the Legislature's decision for the domestic partnerships.\Do you believe that there is enough evidence to indicate that human activity is a significant cause of global warming? I am not a big global warming person. I think that it's cover for an agenda that wouldn't have popular support, so it's guised in environmentalism so it will get more support. I think we should have a strong environmental policy. I think we should protect the environment, but I think it should be a reasonable, sane solution. It shouldn't be based on some numbers that we don't even know what they mean. ... The evidence (of human impact) now is less than credible.\Do you support the state law that allows cities to install red light cameras? Yes, I don't have a problem with that. I think it's a public safety issue and it's a revenue issue. If you have a camera at one of these lights, you can't have an officer parked out there 24 hours a day, giving tickets to everybody. It's one of these things that forces people to behave well.\Do you support Initiative 1098, which would create an income tax on people earning $200,000 or more a year while cutting the business and occupation tax and property taxes? No. I oppose the income tax. ... At the state level it's really the one thing that makes Washington competitive in the region. We have high taxes on businesses. ... This is just adding a tax that would hurt jobs. It would hurt businesses and it doesn't solve the fundamental issues that our state is facing. It's just another cash cow for the government so that they don't have to make hard decisions.\Should the state require students to pass a standardized test in order to graduate high school? Yes, in the broadest possible sense. The state has a mandate for education, and it can fulfill that mandate through funding. I think the funds can be tied to performance, that we're not going to spend all this money just so kids can play tiddlywinks all day. There should be minimum standards. ... I think the state can set those minimum standards, but should be challenging the districts to get up to those standards. ... That's really what I'd like to see, is the state funding it, setting minimum standards and then letting the individual districts go to work."

Pam Brokaw says that if letting local residents sell salvaged cars from Oregon was one of Tom Mielke's top two accomplishments in Olympia, he must not have been too effective.
\
Tom Mielke says that if Pam Brokaw cared about the poor, she'd come out against tolling as a way to pay for a new Interstate 5 bridge.
\
But both of them agree that the county could create more jobs by cutting the requirements for small construction projects, and both say they'd sign a new deal with the Cowlitz Tribe if the terms are right.
\
Brokaw, a Ridgefield Democrat, and Mielke, a Battle Ground Republican, have plenty of ideas for what to do if they're elected to the Board of Clark County Commissioners. But in election season, it's easy to get a politician to tell you why their ideas are good.
\
What's hard is to find out whose ideas are better.
\
With that in mind, The Columbian is sponsoring a Sunday morning print debate between the candidates. We asked 10 questions of each, then invited their opponent to respond to each answer.
\
The result shows some different philosophies and some shared goals. It also shows the very different personal styles of two very different politicians.
\
The other county commissioner race, between Marc Boldt and Jeanne Harris, will follow next week.
\
Our question-and-answer session with Tom Mielke and Pam Brokaw
\
Pam Brokaw
\
Born: June 5, 1953, in St. Helena, Calif.
\
Home: Ridgefield.
\
Party: Democrat.
\
Occupation: Executive director of Affordable Community Environments, a Vancouver affordable-housing nonprofit.
\
Education: Associate's degree from Clark College.
\
Family: Husband, Don Brokaw; and five children and stepchildren, Amanda, Megan, Jenny, Candice and Don.
\
Experience: District director for U.S. Rep. Brian Baird, 2005-06; manager and program coordinator for City of Vancouver, 1997-2004; Clark County communications specialist, 1990-97.

\
1) You often criticize sprawl, but rarely detail your solutions. Name a specific policy you'd change.
\
We must do a better job of implementing policy that requires infrastructure to be in place if development is to occur.
\
2) What two specific career accomplishments are you proudest of?
\
Developing a partnership to bring affordable housing and the Boys and Girls Club to the Fruit Valley neighborhood and managing the Water Resources Education Center.
\
3) You've held seven jobs in the last 25 years. Why so many?
\
For 25 years my focus has been community service. I spent seven years as a reporter at The Columbian and The Oregonian, seven years at Clark County in communications, and seven years with the City of Vancouver. I was Congressman Baird's district director and executive director of a housing nonprofit.
\
4) You support light rail to Clark College. Have you ever regularly commuted by mass transit?
\
In my youth (in San Francisco), with limited income and without a vehicle, I routinely used public transit as well as later in the 1990s. More people are choosing not to drive because of the high cost of fuel, concern about the environment, age, income or disability. We need transportation options.
\
5) Can the county afford to hire eight new sheriff's deputies every year?
\
Public safety is a priority. That said, I can't commit to a number until there is a broader discussion with the board of Commissioners and the elected officials which will factor into development of the 2009-2010 budget.
\
6) What's one thing the county can do to help farmers?
\
More folks want to buy food and products that are grown and raised locally. We have an opportunity to link farms and their goods to compatible business development in our rural centers and plans for sustainability efforts at the old WSU Extension property (on Northeast 78th Street).
\
7) Should big rural lots have more subdivision rights, such as cluster development?
\
I'm open to the conversation. We need to ask: How do we develop responsibly while maintaining the rural character and quality of life so many people were drawn to in the first place?
\
8) What would the Cowlitz Tribe have to offer for you to sign a new deal with them?
\
An agreement with the tribe needs to mitigate the casino's impact on our community in a range of issues including the environment, lost revenues, public safety, transportation, housing, social services and schools.
\
9) If you could pass, change or kill one county rule, what would it be?
\
It shouldn't be so tough and expensive to build a small-scale, low-impact project. How many projects don't move forward because administrative oversight is too costly in time and money? How much does our economy lose in jobs and local business?
\
10) What else isn't on the county's radar, but should be?
\
We need to address the needs of our older neighborhoods where the lack of safe roads and sidewalks are a real issue.
\
Responses by Tom Mielke:
\
This answer doesn't address the issue of ""sprawl."" My vision: smart growth policies where infrastructure changes, consistent with development needs for our rapidly expanding population, are tied together.
\
It is unfortunate that my opponent lacks relevant experience for this position. My business and legislative background has provided me with the best qualifications for this office.
\
Reciting a r sum doesn't answer the question. I owned my business for 18 years and served the people here for four terms in the Legislature. Job stability is an important indicator for elective office.
\
There is no state or federal money for this. My priorities: no light rail, a third bridge and no tolls. Tolling hurts the poor and one of us has to care about them. Let's give the people a vote!
\
Public safety is our first priority. We must commit to hire the deputies we need. We must find solutions for our problems, not talk them to death, and hiring personnel for our safety is one of them.
\
Government must focus on government responsibilities. Increase incentives to keep farmland in production, much as we need incentives for economic development to keep jobs on this side of the river.
\
Again, my opponent has not answered the question. Smart growth is the key. Our rapidly expanding population demands nontraditional thinking about our growth issues, and cluster development can be a useful tool in that effort.
\
My opponent fully supports the casino development as indicated by those funding her campaign. [Footnote 3] Additionally, the mitigation the tribe plans doesn't begin to address the real impacts to our community.
\
Again, my opponent fails to answer the question. This position calls for decisive and knowledgeable responses, not glittering generalities. Streamlined permitting processes MUST become our watchword for economic development.
\
I disagree, since that is mainly a city problem. Besides parkland maintenance and water retention ponds, affordable housing and a full-court press for economic development must become a top priority.
\

\
1) You've made overregulation of business your top issue, but struggled in the primary to win business support. Maybe a specific example of overregulation would help.
\
If Clark County is to ever really address job creation or encourage businesses to relocate here, we need to show a better permitting process, stop regulating their every move and either help them open their doors or get out of their way. In my own business, I had two big drawbacks: Government involvement and one tax after another. The other was employee mandates and more accountability than with my own children. As for the business support, what is left of them we have now.
\
2) What were your top two accomplishments in the state Legislature?
\
""Common sense"" road construction, such as the Interstate 5/Northeast 219th interchange vs. 179th Street interchange. Second, created a process for a Clark County resident to inspect and bring automobiles to Washington state.
\
3) You've been semi-retired since 1995. Are you ready to work the long hours this job takes?
\
Between 1978 and 1995 I worked between five to seven days a week and an average of 10 hours on duty and 14 hours a day on call. Worked 14 years before actually taking a full seven days off in a row. As a legislator during session, I worked from 7 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and was back to work by 9 p.m. another few hours every night. What was your question?
\
4) You oppose a new I-5 bridge and say the county needs to ""break off on its own."" With a third of us choosing work in Portland, is this realistic?
\
I oppose replacing a perfectly good bridge with six lanes with a new $4 billion bridge with six lanes [Footnote 2] and light rail that the people of Clark County don't want. If you are referring to the 67,000 people that go to Portland to have employment, I'm disappointed that with a county government department and two private organizations to bring jobs to Clark County, they haven't provided good-paying jobs here. I don't think the people choose to work there - it's where the jobs are.
\
5) Can the county afford to hire eight new sheriff's deputies every year?
\
If our growth is such, yes we can. A ratio of one deputy per 1,000 population is the ideal for law enforcement, and we have fallen short of that, for other social programs. Property taxes should by priority provide for safe neighborhoods.
\
6) What's one thing the county can do to help farmers?
\
Leave them alone! Stop taking their land through seasonal creek setbacks and regulating their products. Make products being shipped into Clark County have the same insecticide requirements required of our local farmers. We have seen nearly all the dairy farms regulated out of business.
\
7) Should big rural lots have more subdivision rights, such as cluster development?
\
I'm not sure how you might think large rural lots have more rights. Actually the small lots demonstrate more rights when you look at how Vancouver is being allowed to build right up to the edge of the Columbia River with no pervious land at all.
\
8) What would the Cowlitz Tribe have to offer for you to sign a new deal with them?
\
Pass the same requirements that any other business that size would see. Pay the same ongoing infrastructure taxes like any other business that size. Pay the same impact fees they would create. Have the same state protection for nontribal employees.
\
9) If you could pass, change or kill one county rule, what would it be?
\
Combine all three environmental departments. ESA, Clean Water and Commissioner (Steve) Stuart's new environmental department.
\
10) What else isn't on the county's radar, but should be?
\
What is the future plan for all the parkland we have, how are we to maintain it? We need a different design for the water retention ponds that the county mandated and now have no dollars to maintain over 700 of these mosquito-dwelling ponds.
\
Responses by Pam Brokaw:
\
Regulation needs to be reasonable, predictable and fair. We saw what happened on Wall Street with too little controls. I have the support of business leaders - most recently the Clark County Association of Realtors - because I know we must get our economy moving by taking action in a range of areas, not just regulatory relief.
\
While many stakeholders worked on the 219th interchange, the vote to fund it came after my opponent left office. [Footnote 1] While I respect his years of service, I question his effectiveness if the above are his top two legislative accomplishments.
\
(no response)
\
The bridge needs to be replaced to protect public safety and our economy. Built in 1917, the aging bridge represents an unacceptable risk when a major earthquake occurs. The federal government should bear the major cost. A sound bridge and effective transportation will keep people safe, keep our economy moving and help us recruit new companies to Clark County.
\
County revenues, so dependent on housing and development, are deeply depressed. This next biennial budget will reflect cuts but public safety must continue to be our priority. We'll need to take another step and address the core problems of our stagnant business climate by pulling together the leadership of our community to create a new business plan to get our economy moving.
\
Government regulation should be based on common sense and common good. I'm committed to working with our colleagues at the state and federal level to help farmers and encourage farming through reasonable safeguards and reduced red tape.
\
People who live in rural areas have chosen a different life with less density of development and levels of services. The challenge is providing for reasonable development, fairness and predictability for property owners while maintaining rural character.
\
Before we sign anything, let's not leave out environmental protection, lost revenues, public safety, transportation, housing, social services and schools.
\
The county is considering combining the Endangered Species Act Program, Clean Water Program and the Sustainability Program as well as other environmentally related programs and services. I'm for it if it saves money and increases efficiency.
\
The metro park district funds maintenance inside the urban growth boundary only. Parks outside the UGB are worth saving - stronger private partnerships and less general fund reliance may help. Ponds: The county has dealt with stormwater by using ponds, then larger expanses, and then ponds to protect water quality. I support a new design but am concerned about cost.
\
Footnotes:[Footnote 1] This depends on the meaning of ""fund"" - Battle Ground's new interchange was paid for by the nickel gas tax (which Mielke opposed, though he backed the interchange) but the project wasn't scheduled until after Mielke left office.
\
[Footnote 2] Unlike the current bridge, the proposed one would have two or three lanes for entering and exiting, as well as three through lanes, for a total of five or six lanes in each direction.
\
[Footnote 3] Brokaw hasn't said she supports or opposes a casino, and there's no evidence of direct or indirect donations to any local candidate by Cowlitz tribal government or its members. Mielke said he was referring to donations from construction unions, who support the casino and other projects, and from a lawyer who represents the Cowlitz Tribe among many clients who deal with the county.

Initiative offers choice
\
The Columbians July 13 coverage of Anatomy of a campaign: Washingtons Initiative 1000, was contrary to the initiatives principles. Eligible persons for treatment under I-1000 must be deemed terminal by two doctors and have less than six months to live. The example used was a lady living with inadequately treated pain after a broken hip repair, and not facing any disease process leading to death. Her wish for death from pain and depression is irrelevant to the initiative. She is not terminal.
\
Washington recognizes living wills, advance directives that a person at any time may write expressing their wish to be kept alive or not by artificial means. The AMA wants to keep its bonds of trust with patients where no healing, only death is possible. I want trust in my physician for a willingness to end my short terminal days, hopefully legally.

Scale back on design
\
How many people are aware of how light rail will be funded? Construction: federal and state. Operation: state and local. Maintenance: local. Taxes and fees: Among the possibilities are gas tax, sales tax, property tax, car tab, vehicle weight fee, tolls, vehicle value tax, and employee tax arent these taxes supposed to be for other things?
\
Also why do we have to have a beautiful bridge design when the money is scarce? I dont see a thing wrong with the Interstate 205 Bridge. I still think there should be a third bridge east around Camas or Washougal. It will be a hardship on a lot of people who work over in Oregon to pay the toll back and forth.
\
Also, what good would it do to have the light rail come to Clark College? Has anyone even thought of the parking situation there already? Clarks lots are full to bursting already.

Dont permit survey
\
In the Columbia gorge, many homeowners found unwelcome news in our mailboxes. Packets from the Blue Bridge gas pipeline project were sent to property owners who will be impacted by a right of way up to a 300 feet wide and 172 miles long.
\
The Blue Bridge mailing was to obtain permission to begin surveying the proposed route across our property. Some of us gave permission, but later rescinded it when we realized the damage that would be inflicted on the landscape of our lives and environment. Neighbors from the area met to discuss our worries and share ideas about how to confront this threat. We have many concerns environment, water, landowners, eminent domain, etc. Say no at the beginning of the process. Do not allow Blue Bridge permission to survey your land. You can revoke this if you have already given permission.

Adequately fund police
\
Our politicians have wasted much of the city budget on nonessential projects such as subsidizing hotels and waterfront development, Interstate 5 Bridge and light rail studies, etc. One of the top priorities of government is the safety and security of citizens through police departments. The recent announcement of cutbacks to these services is unconscionable.
\
When K-9 dog Dakota was killed, I gave the police department a check for the full amount of a new dog with the stipulation that Officer Roger Evans be the handler and others in the community funded all training and certification costs. Due to announced budget shortfall and subsequent cutbacks to the police department, I believe our mayor, city manager and council should reprioritize and provide adequate funding for the protection of the people first. To do otherwise is against common sense and a disregard for the oath they took.

Master insider language
\
Politicians have their own language. With the election of the century coming up, we should try to master as much of this insider language as we can. Essentially it is saying one thing but meaning something else, with words carefully chosen to silence alarm bells and lull into complacency. What they say and what they mean:
\
Investment: taxes. Revenue enhancement: taxes. User fees: taxes. Investment deficit: your money that the government plans to spend. I misspoke: I lied. I was misled: its not my fault. Middle ground: either way I win.
\
So much suspicion could be allayed if only elected and appointed officials would say what they mean in plain, clear, understandable, unambiguous English, instead of crafting words which give them an escape hatch and absolution from bad decisions.

PUDs are reliable
\
As executive director of Washington PUD Association, Im responding to Don Brunells July 8 column, Skagit would regret seizing live power lines. There are several reasons Skagit County residents urge their public utility district, which now provides drinking water, to also become an electric utility. Puget Sound Energy has some of the highest rates in the Northwest and is asking the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission for permission to raise rates even higher.
\
PSE also acknowledges that it needs to invest billions of dollars to upgrade its aging distribution system. Meanwhile, 23 PUDs in Washington including Clark Public Utilities already provide reliable electric service to nearly a third of the states residents. Every one of those community-owned PUDs has lower rates than PSE.
\
A study by D. Hittle & Associates found that Skagit ratepayers could save between $126 million and $186 million over the next 10 years if Skagit PUD took over operation of the PSE distribution system.

161,"2014 WASHINGTON LEGISLATURE\The 2014 session of the Washington Legislature may be one of short duration, small tweaks and low expectations.\Legislators will continue last year's struggles over roads and abortion. They may try to reconcile two very different sets of laws over recreational and medicinal marijuana. They will listen to ideas to trim tax loopholes, boost jobs, improve schools and bolster pensions.\But they don't actually have to do anything.\The state's budget picture is not particularly rosy, but for the first time in several years it is not bleak. A bit more revenue is projected to be in the pipeline. It's not enough for major new initiatives but enough for some ""tweaking"" of programs to accommodate increases in schoolchildren, college programs and mental health patients, if legislators can reach a consensus.\If not, the Legislature could quit after its constitutionally allotted 60 days without making any changes to last year's biennial operating budget, and any extra revenue would just go into reserve accounts. It would be the first time the Legislature finished on time, without needing a special session to cobble together a budget, since 2009.\""You could operate without a supplemental budget,"" Mark Schoesler, the Senate Republican leader from Ritzville, said last week at a legislative preview sponsored by the Associated Press. ""It doesn't hurt to have a little extra money in the bank.""\Changes to the budget will be limited, focusing on unfinished business from 2013, said House Democratic Leader Pat Sullivan, of Covington.""We think at this time we should have a supplemental budget.""\Gov. Jay Inslee's ""hold steady, get ready"" budget calls for modest changes, with most increases tied to higher demand for services: an extra 10,200 kids in public schools, more students qualifying for college aid, more felons sentenced to prison and more mental health patients needing services.\Here are some of the key topics that will occupy legislators for the next 60 days.\PUBLIC SCHOOLS\Facing a state Supreme Court order to live up to its constitutional requirement to make public education the state's ""paramount duty,"" the Legislature added about $1 billion to kindergarten through high school programs and expenses last year. Last Thursday, in a review of the steps taken toward reaching that duty, the court said the Legislature had made some progress but is not on track to implement key reforms by the 2017-18 school year. Total cost of all those reforms is estimated at $5 billion, but big changes are more likely next year, in a 105-day session when a two-year budget is written.\The Legislature was ordered to submit a plan by April 30 for fully implementing the reforms, with a schedule for phasing in the money the changes will require.\Expect many references to ""McCleary,"" the name of the landmark court decision ordering the Legislature to meet its obligation to schools, throughout the session.\TRANSPORTATION\Most legislators agree that ""something"" must be done about transportation, but they failed to reach a consensus last year even though Inslee said it was a priority during the regular session, the two succeeding special sessions and the interim leading up to the third special session.\There's still no agreement on a package of new highway and bridge projects, increased maintenance, public transit and reforms to the way the state plans and builds projects. It would require a bump of 10 cents or more to the gasoline tax. Democrats who control the House say they passed a package last year and it's up to Senate Republicans to pass a plan, too, so the differences can be negotiated. Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, said he doesn't yet have a package nailed down, and without that he can't predict how many votes it could get from the mainly Republican coalition that controls the Senate.\One Spokane-area Republican, Sen. Mike Baumgartner, said he'll only vote for a package that has full funding for the North Spokane Corridor. Sen. Mike Padden, R-Spokane Valley, said he can't promise to vote for it even then.\Complicating any effort to sell a gas tax to the public are cost overruns on a couple of megaprojects in Seattle:the tunnel being dug to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct and the state Route 520 floating bridge over Lake Washington.\MARIJUANA\The state has conflicting laws for medical marijuana, which voters approved in 1998, and recreational marijuana, which they approved in 2012. The Liquor Control Board, which controls the latter but not the former, has proposed clamping down on medical marijuana with a state registry of patients, closing of dispensaries and a requirement to buy the heavily taxed pot at recreational stores.\Legislative leaders and Inslee aren't backing all the board's recommendations, although the governor said last week, ""I do think it's important that we reconcile the two systems.""\Medical marijuana supporters - which include a mix of progressive Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans in and out of the Legislature, as well as patients and those who operate dispensaries - will fight all of the board's recommendations.\New recreational marijuana businesses are looking for help on banking so they don't have to conduct all their business, and pay their taxes, in cash.\ABORTION COVERAGE\Democratic leaders in both chambers list the Reproductive Parity Act as ""unfinished business"" from last year. The bill essentially would require any insurance plan that covers childbirth - and most do because of the Affordable Care Act - to also cover abortion. It passed the House but was held in a Senate committee, and some members of the Majority Coalition Caucus who said they support the bill rejected parliamentary efforts to bring it to the floor for a vote.\A House committee could have a hearing as early as this week on a new version of the bill, and the full chamber would likely pass it again quickly.\Senate Democratic Leader Sharon Nelson, of Maury Island, called a Senate vote on the Reproductive Parity Act an ""absolute must"" for the session. But at least one yes vote was replaced by a no vote when Republican Jan Angel ousted Democrat Nathan Schlicher in a special election last November.\DREAM ACT\One other ""must"" for Democrats is a vote on a proposal to extend state college aid to the children of undocumented immigrants who came to the United States with their parents, grew up and graduated from Washington high schools but are not citizens. Like the Reproductive Parity Act, the bill, often called the DREAM Act although it's different than the federal legislation of the same name, passed the House but was not allowed out of a Senate committee.\ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS\Inslee is expected to call for studies of low-carbon fuels in his State of the State speech Tuesday, with a thorough evaluation of their costs and benefit. He believes there is ""overwhelming support"" among the public to do something about climate change.\Republicans are leery of anything that could add to the cost of gasoline, especially if a transportation package is going to propose a jump in the gas tax. The state should focus on the good news about the environment rather than panicking over it, Senate GOP leader Schoesler said: ""We already have one of the cleanest states in the world.""\GUN CONTROL\The Legislature is likely to be presented with two conflicting initiatives on guns. Initiative 594 would extend background checks to most private sales while Initiative 591 would only allow an expansion in background checks if there was ""a unified national standard."" Both have almost 100,000 more signatures than required for certification.\The Legislature couldn't reach a consensus on gun proposals last year and probably doesn't have one now, Sullivan said. The initiatives willlikely get a committee hearing but no vote, which will send them to the November ballot.\Credit: Jim Camden jimc@spokesman.com, (509) 879-7461"

Democratic and Republican lawmakers don't agree on how to improve education or teacher pay, protect the environment, reduce health care costs or make government more efficient.
\
But they seem to agree their upcoming two-year budget-writing legislative session, which starts Monday, should not approach the brinkmanship of the last two-year budget cycle.
\
Caucus leaders and budget writers staked out their opening positions last week, claiming they're optimistic the upcoming session won't go into extra innings this year.
\
""I believe that we are going to get out of here in 105 days,"" said Rep. Bruce Chandler, R-Granger, at The Associated Press Legislative Preview in Olympia on Thursday. ""And I believe we will have a budget that makes everyone unhappy.""
\
The talking points about beginning the session in good-faith negotiations were similar in 2013, when the last two-year budget was drafted. But that session ended in June, well beyond the regular 105-day session, with government agencies scrambling for contingency plans in the event of a shutdown.
\
""If we are doing our duty for the citizens of the state, we won't go there again,"" Senate Minority Leader Sharon Nelson, D-Maury Island, said Thursday.
\
The sunny outlook comes in spite of historic pressures from court rulings to increase funding to education and pay for the proper care of mental health patients, while Democrats also say it's time to give teachers pay increases for voter-mandated cost-of-living adjustments that have been deferred for the last six years.
\
At the same time, Gov. Jay Inslee has put forth a capital gains tax proposal to meet those demands as well as a cap-and-trade program and carbon tax that would demand more from the state's biggest polluters.
\
Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, has already stated he ""can't support"" the cap-and-trade proposal. The most Republicans could support, he said, would be creating market incentives to reduce carbon output that don't put new costs on businesses.
\
Meanwhile Chandler, the Republicans' chief budget writer in the House, has said any tax increase would ultimately find its way to the ballot for voters to decide.
\
""If we simply pass a tax increase and don't put a referendum on it, there will be an initiative and the voters will put it on the ballot themselves,"" Chandler said in an interview Friday. ""The voters are going to be heard on this and I think they should be heard first rather than last.""
\
Remy Trupin, executive director of the liberal policy group Washington Budget & Policy Center, said state officials and voters will be educated on the hard realities facing the state's education and transportation systems, and he thinks they'll see the value in Inslee's tax proposals.
\
""If the public gets what the impact of these things are, I think it's all possible,"" Trupin said.
\
But before that would happen, both parties will also have to come to terms on whether new revenue is needed to solve any of the challenges facing government services in the coming biennium and beyond. Senate Republican budget writer Andy Hill of Redmond has stated emphatically that there is no budget deficit in terms of meeting the state's constitutionally mandated functions because revenue will grow in the biennium.
\
But that is something his Democratic counterparts don't see when they do the math.
\
""It's a myth that the budget deficit is a myth,"" said Senate Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Karen Fraser, D-Thurston County.
\
Projected revenue for the upcoming biennium is nearly $37 billion, according to the Office of Financial Management, almost $3 billion more than the previous biennium from 2013-15. Democratic leaders say as much as another $3 billion on top of that may be needed if the Legislature doesn't defer voter-approved Initiative 1531, which would require between $1.2 billion and $2 billion to reduce class sizes in K-12 education.
\
The Legislature would need a two-thirds majority vote to put off the implementation of that initiative. House Democratic budget writer Ross Hunter, D-Medina, whose caucus has the most members that support the initiative, indicated he doesn't see any room for it in the 2015-17 budget.
\
""When you look at things that can't be funded, they won't be,"" Hunter said Thursday.
\
Jason Mercier, of the conservative Washington Policy Center, said in an interview he expects the class-size initiative voters approved in 2014 to be the foremost hang-up in successfully drafting a budget. He said he doesn't think there are enough Democrats at the moment to help make up the two-thirds vote needed to defer the initiative.
\
""What passed at the ballot box will not be implemented this session,"" Mercier said. ""The question is in suspending that or putting it back on the ballot with a corresponding tax source.""
\
Lawmakers have until June 30, when the 2013-15 biennium officially ends, to approve a budget without forcing a government shutdown. The next biennium begins July 1.
\
The carbon tax discussion has all but derailed talk of a gas tax increase that was the center of transportation talk over the last year, Mercier said. Chandler said he's not sure what the governor's proposals mean for the prospect of a transportation package.
\
""I'm a little bit confused by the governor on whether it's a choice between the carbon tax and the gas tax or whether he's advocating both,"" Chandler said.
\
Inslee spokeswoman Jaime Smith said the governor has dropped the gas tax proposal in favor of his carbon tax plan, which charges businesses that emit 2,500 metric tons per year, with that threshold being lowered over time and a goal of reducing emissions overall. Businesses can purchase carbon emission allowances from others as part of the cap-and-trade program in order to avoid penalties.
\
Smith said the governor's proposal would raise $12 billion over 12 years, roughly the same estimate associated with last year's gas tax proposal.
\
But the gas tax remains an option for Senate Transportation Chairman Curtis King, R-Yakima, so long as a package of Republican reforms to cut costs to the state is included. King said a new revenue source is needed and he prefers the gas tax because that money is protected by the state constitution from being diverted to unrelated projects.
\
""There's no guarantee a carbon tax will go entirely to roads and bridges and highways,"" King said Friday.
\
While the budget and new revenue proposals will dominate the session, they won't be the only high profile or important pieces of legislation lawmakers will consider. What follows are some issues of importance to the Yakima Valley that are likely to come up.
\
Agriculture
\
Many growers in the fruit industry have concerns about Inslee's proposed efforts to limit carbon emissions, said Jon DeVaney, president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association based in Yakima.
\
""His direction to the Department of Ecology to draft a new state low-carbon fuel standard could substantially increase fuel and energy costs, which is a concern for the transportation-intensive agricultural sector,"" DeVaney said in an emailed statement.
\
While Democrats have sought to close tax breaks in order to generate revenue, most of the agricultural community hopes the Legislature keeps a variety of tax breaks for the industry, said Steve George, president of the Yakima County Farm Bureau.
\
""We have some tax preferences we'd certainly like to keep because that generates more business and stimulates the economy,"" he said.
\
As one example, businesses can qualify for a sales-and-use tax exemption on equipment and facilities used in livestock nutrient management. And certain replacement parts for farm machinery and equipment, and related services, enjoy exemption from sales taxes.
\
Mike Gempler of the Washington Growers League, a Yakima-based association that focuses on labor issues, said some growers seek more funding to train farm laborers to safely handle pesticides. Growers also want continued support of farm worker housing construction.
\
The Washington Growers League plans to ask for roughly $500,000 to double the scope of the state Department of Agriculture's farm worker education program, said Gempler, adding he's realistic about getting it.
\
""Asking for any kind of money is difficult,"" he said.
\
Agriculture is expected to oppose a bill proposed by the Agriculture Department that might apply specifically to Yakima County and two west side counties where dairy manure has been linked to water pollution problems.
\
The proposal would make farmers who buy manure from dairies and apply it as a fertilizer subject to similar regulations as dairy farmers. Currently, once manure leaves the dairy, there are no regulations to ensure that manure is applied at appropriate times and at rates that crops can use.
\
The goal is to protect surface and groundwater from manure run-off. It's already controversial. The plan has been criticized by the agricultural industry as unnecessary over-regulation and by some environmentalists as a way for the state to avoid enforcing existing water-quality laws.
\
Natural resources
\
The Department of Ecology has requested $30 million for capital projects that are part of the 30 year, $4 billion Yakima Basin Integrated Plan.
\
The request is comparable to federal funding for the plan - a joint proposal by Ecology and the federal Bureau of Reclamation - expected over the next two years, said Derek Sandison, Ecology's lead on the issue.
\
The request includes: $9.5 million for work at Kachess and Keechelus reservoirs; $9.5 million for fish passage at Cle Elum Dam and Tieton Dam; $5 million for agricultural and municipal water conservation; $5 million for habitat improvement work; and $500,000 each for water bank development and a groundwater storage pilot project.
\
But Inslee's capital budget proposal calls for $15 million for the Integrated Plan's projects.
\
Meanwhile, Sen. Jim Honeyford, R-Sunnyside, is sponsoring legislation that would create a funding mechanism for water infrastructure projects around the state, including water supply, flood control and storm water projects.
\
The details are still being worked out, but basically a new program would give local governments an opportunity to compete for grants and loans to fund needed water infrastructure projects.
\
Forest thinning across Eastern Washington and the funds to do it will be pushed by the Department of Natural Resources in order to reduce the risks of catastrophic wildfires.
\
The department is asking for $20 million for the next biennium - up from the current funding level of $4 million - to reduce the wildfire hazards in unhealthy forests.
\
Recent studies have shown that 3.5 million acres in Eastern Washington are in need of thinning work that has been proven to reduce wildfire severity - that's more than 5,000 square miles.
\
State Forester Aaron Everett told the Herald-Republic in December that the current pace of restoration work isn't keeping pace with the growing need, which leads to escalating wildfire danger.
\
According to the National Resources Department, $20 million could treat 45,000 acres, including state lands and private lands in partnership will small forest landowners.
\
The governor's budget also includes $2 million for the management of the 50,000-acre Teanaway Community Forest, created by the Legislature as part of approving the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan in 2013.
\
Social services
\
Meanwhile, local social service providers are keeping close watch that their budgets aren't tapped to help fund other needs.
\
""We're on high alert,"" Lori Brown, director of Yakima-based Aging and Long-Term Care of Southeast Washington, said in a recent interview with the Herald-Republic.
\
State-only funding for programs at Entrust Community Services in Yakima are also at risk, according to Mark James, community relations director at the Yakima program. Entrust provides a range of services, including employment support and training, for adults with disabilities.
\
Nursing homes, meanwhile, received $22 million in Medicaid dollars last year, but are still operating at rates well below cost. They are hoping for another adjustment.

Bring back the bridge
\
The word is out that the traffic projections used to justify the now defunct Columbia River Crossing were inflated. The state Transportation Revenue Forecast Council has revised highway travel sharply downward (www.ofm.wa.gov/budget/info/transportationrevenue.asp; see Alternative Scenario Forecast Volume IV revised Pages 24-28.)Two issues now demand attention.First, more efficient cars and fewer miles driven mean less gas-tax revenue, which does not completely pay for roads anyway. Tolls for all or part of Interstate 5 and/or vehicle licensing tied to miles driven may well be in the future.The second issue concerns $187.5 million, which Washington and Oregon will have to pay back to the federal government if a bridge does not happen. It is time to revisit a less expensive and less destructive to downtown Vancouver alternative crossing. The Common Sense Alternative II would replace the 100-year-old railroad spinner bridge, re-purpose the existing bridge to handle local traffic, pedestrians, bicycles and eventually mass transit. A much more modest eight-lane bascule bridge would be constructed roughly parallel to the existing bridge. This proposal saves downtown Vancouver, relieves both states from paying back federal dollars and costs much less.Check this out under Transportation Issues on the The Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocate website, www.aortarail.org.

Rebuild conduct for mutual good
\
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. This old proverb comes close to saying it all. It embodies compassion, humility and teamwork, the essence of a code designed by people who value freedom and respect their fellow human beings.Our religions are designed to meet this, as are our democratic tenets. A good philosophy for living but with one big rub, it depends on trust and commitment to responsible action. Its success is predicated on everyone following the same rules of conduct, working for the mutual good.The Constitution embodies these ideals, and our legal system is set to protect them. It is a repudiation of greed without succumbing to total socialism. A help when necessary attitude without becoming a permanent crutch. But the rub, in the form of personal greed, is still with us. All it takes is for a few to slightly change the proverb wording to give with remembering, so now favors can be exchanged, generating greater wealth and more ability to give with remembering.And so the cycle grows, with laws twisted or overlooked by our designated monitors, a suction force that pulls wealth to the top of an antiquated, old-world social pyramid. Instead of promoting general welfare, we are back to crowning tyrants. Why do we allow this? Ask yourself, Why do I allow this?

Safety in review of regulations
\
New technologies have allowed greater quantities of oil and other petroleum products to be extracted from both domestic and foreign sources. With the lack of adequate pipeline capacity, producers have relied on rail to transport their products to West Coast refineries. This has created additional rail traffic in general and, more specifically, additional risks for the environment and the citizenry.Recently, there have been several incidents, reports and studies indicating transportation and storage of large quantities of crude oil present a probability of adverse environment impact on the community. The Vancouver City Council has determined there is a need for a six-month moratorium on crude oil facilities, time to review the current regulations to make sure such results can be avoided, reduced or contained to the maximum practical extent.After a long and busy year, statistics have shown that it has been a year of many oil spills from trains. Officials have agreed to accept the challenge, and finally help decrease the amount of oil spilling from trains.It is far better to walk, ride a bike or take the city bus to avoid riding trains.

Premiums rise as benefits change
\
I bought health insurance three years ago because it would be mandated by Obamacare (Affordable Care Act). If I didnt buy insurance, I would be fined.The first year my premiums were $423 per month. For the second year, I was notified my premiums would go up to $725 per month. I contacted another insurance company and was quoted $623, so I signed up.A few days ago, I received notice that my premiums were rising to $650.50 per month beginning Jan. 1.Not only are my premiums going up, I now read that the ACA may allow coverage for taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery and addiction therapy. I am furious that I will pay higher premiums for benefits I do not believe are my responsibility.Not all of us work for high-paying corporations and can afford these high insurance premiums. Im tempted to drop health insurance coverage, take my chances with my health and just pay the fine.You can thank Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., for helping to create Obamacare. You can also thank Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., for voting for the ACA.

164," EDUCATION\ Gov. Chris Gregoire is backing a slate of changes: phasing in all- day kindergarten, expanding prekindergarten learning programs, adding thousands more college students, increasing teacher pay and shrinking class sizes.\ Where things stand: The Senate approved setting up a task force to re-examine how the state pays for public schools, although some districts - including Spokane public schools - say their budget woes can't wait.\ Among this year's dead bills: a Republican-backed measure to require state lawmakers to ""fund education first"" before allocating money to anything else and a bill to require lap-and-shoulder belts on all new school buses.\ HEALTH CARE\ Lawmakers are considering adding 38,000 children to state-paid health coverage, spending $26 million over the next two years to improve childhood vaccination, and an array of other reforms to make health care more affordable for more people.\ Where things stand: On Tuesday, Gregoire is slated to sign into law Sen. Chris Marr's bill to set up a state system to cover low- and some middle-income children.\ Despite Republican criticism that the system will encourage people to pull their kids off employer-offered health plans and sign them up for the government plan, the measure overwhelmingly passed the Senate and House.\ Dead bills include one to ban any below-the-neck body piercing of minors' ""certain sensitive parts.""\ THE ECONOMY\ From making health care cheaper to a ""holiday"" for some workers' compensation costs, lawmakers and the governor say they want to help the cooling economy, particularly small businesses.\ Where things stand: Look for an economic forecast Thursday, when the state Revenue Forecast Council dusts off its crystal ball to estimate how much the state can expect in taxes and other revenue over the next two years.\ Lawmakers approved continuation of a deal with some Indian tribes under which tribal gas stations collect the 34-cent state gas tax, with the money split between the tribes and the state.\ A similar agreement is in the works for the Spokane Tribe of Indians.\ SAME-SEX MARRIAGE\ Proponents want it, or at least domestic partnerships that would include many of the legal rights of married people.\ Critics are countering with a call to write the state law banning gay marriage into the state constitution - an unlikely move that would require approval from a legislative supermajority as well as voters statewide.\ Where things stand: The Senate has passed a bill to set up a state domestic partnership registry that would provide rights such as the right for partners to visit each other in the hospital, inheritance rights if there is no will, and the right to make medical decisions if a partner is incapacitated.\ Gay and lesbian couples, as well as heterosexual couples with at least one partner older than 62 would be eligible.\ ENVIRONMENT\ Gregoire has proposed spending $200 million toward the $9 billion problem of cleaning up Puget Sound, among other proposals.\ Where things stand: Among the lesser-known environmental proposals this year: House Bill 2143, requiring state regulators to come up with a list of ""environmentally preferred"" alternatives to lead tire weights.\ The lead weights, used to balance tires for decades, tend to eventually come loose and land beside roads and highways, where they can leach into soil and water.\ New lead weights would be banned for all vehicles registered in the state by 2010.\ Credit: Spokane"
165,"KNEZOVICH GETS JOB DONE\For over three years now, I have had the opportunity to work with Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich on criminal justice issues in Spokane County.

I have found him to be willing to sit down with citizens to discuss issues that would advance various options of that philosophy. I believe him to be tough but just; caring but realistic.\Knezovich is hardworking, dedicated and constantly works under the pressure of smaller budgets, fewer deputies and, always, more needed in order to stay ahead of those who create havoc for citizens and law enforcement alike.\Party politics aside, I'm talking about doing the job that must be done and showing thanks to those who are doing just that for all of us in Spokane County.\Judith Gilmore\Spokane\JOHNSON IS EXCEPTIONAL\We have known Mary Lou Johnson as a friend, a mother, a wife and an attorney for over 25 years.

She has the courage to run as an Independent to exemplify her commitment to facilitate win-win relationships and trust for the good and positive action of our entire community. She has the courage to refuse super-PAC funding for her campaign to remain independent of the influence of big money, leaving her squarely committed to the needs and well-being of the people and the environment of our county.\In her experience as a county commissioner, she has proven herself as a financially savvy leader, an advocate for local business expansion and a protector of the environment that supports us all. In my view, those are the perfect blend of attributes for this important position.\Stacy Cossey\Valleyford\SHEA DESERVES SUPPORT\The extremely misleading charges in a campaign piece from Josh Arritola, Rep.

The accusations listed are a prime example of turning the truth into a lie. Arritola needs to get his facts straight and go beyond the superficial.\First of all, Matt did not refuse to support completion of the North Spokane Corridor, but refused to support the massive tax increase. Working in the transportation committee, Matt found millions in wasted tax dollars. He worked diligently to correct this, promoting prioritized budgeting and money for the North Spokane Corridor.\The only solution the Democratic majority would consider was an 11.5 cent-per-gallon tax increase. Money ""promised"" for the North Spokane Corridor with prior tax increases was repeatedly redirected to West Side pet projects.\Do you want an 11.5 cent-per-gallon gas tax increase? During Shea's electronic town hall meetings, 98 percent of respondents did not want a tax increase. Matt had signed a no tax increase pledge and kept his promise. He deserves our continued support.\Terry Hatch\Spokane Valley\WHY SHEA WENT TO NEVADA\This is written for those who want to know the truth of ""Why did Rep. Matt Shea go to Nevada?"" It's a good question, but some would jump to false conclusions and demonize Matt for going.\Shea was asked to go there by Assemblywoman Michele Fiore to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. He met with several other state legislators in Nevada and formed the Coalition of Western States to seek a state solution to this federal overreach. If the feds had not acted illegally, the Bundy situation would never have happened.\A court case decided in U.S. v. Wayne Hage that a water right equals a forage right also applies to Bundy. The federal judge charged the Nevada arm of the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service with racketeering, extortion and mail fraud ... because of the ""conspiracy, literal conspiracy"" to deprive the Hage's of their property rights.\The Bureau of Land Management stated this over 20 years ago.

Larry Crouse, of the three candidates, Bob McCaslin was the only one who stood firm against a tax increase. Leonard Christian did not.\McCaslin, who was the precinct committee officers' first choice, stated he would not vote for a gas tax increase. McCaslin knows the transportation budget is bloated and wasteful. He also understands that prior tax hikes promising money to complete the North Spokane Corridor just disappeared into Western Washington's pet projects.\Based on prior track records of elusive promises, the North Spokane Corridor will not materialize with this massive tax hike, but only with prioritized, dedicated budgeting.\Vote for Bob McCaslin, who is willing to do the hard work of prioritized budgeting.

It was truly gratifying to hear how she is working across the aisle to fight for bills that will directly affect us, like her hydropower bill that passed through the House unanimously and was signed by the president.\As a young woman, I admire McMorris Rodgers' positive and pragmatic leadership. Her strong voice and willpower radiate throughout Congress and Eastern Washington as she continues to fight for and represent us.\McMorris Rodgers is not only a leader we can be proud of, but also a leader we deserve in a time when there is so much negativity and discouragement with our federal government. She is making a positive difference and is a great asset to the Northwest. There is no doubt that I'll be voting for McMorris Rodgers to keep her working for us, and so should you.\Shelby Pelon\Cheney\PAKOOTAS, FOR LEADERSHIP\So the Republican House of Representatives leadership now wants to sue President Obama over certain executive orders, even though he has issued fewer of them than most other presidents. But the real ethical, if not legal, offense is that the Republican leadership, including Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, won't allow a vote of the full House on the Senate-passed immigration bill - S.744 - even though it has enough House votes to pass and thus become law with Obama's promised signature.\Please join me and vote for Joe Pakootas, who will represent all of the people with an independent voice rather than simply echo the political leadership.\Norm Luther\Spokane"
166,"
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved a $214 billion bill Thursday to upgrade the nation's highways and mass transit systems and bring tens of thousands of jobs to communities across the country.
\
The giant bill also would crack down on drunken driving and preserve a program helping women and minorities win government construction contracts.
\
It took two weeks for the Senate to hammer out the final version of the 800-page bill, as lawmakers made sure their states got a fair share of the huge pot
\
.
\
""It really gives a major boost not only to jobs, not only to the environment, but really for quality life across the board,"" said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a chief architect of the legislation. ""This was a mountain to climb, and we're at the top.""
\
The bill passed 96-4, sending it to the House for consideration. Congress must get the completed bill to President Clinton before May 1, when the current short-term highway spending law expires.
\
In the gallery for the final vote was Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who praised the Senate for doing a ""great job.""
\
The legislation carves out $173 billion for highway construction and safety programs through 2003, up 38 percent from the six-year plan that ended last fall. Mass transit would get $41.3 billion, a 31 percent boost.
\
Supporters said the bill could have a major impact on the economy, citing figures that every $1 billion in transportation spending creates 42,000 jobs.
\
The new money in part will come from a decision that 4.3 cents of the federal gas tax previously reserved for reducing the budget deficit would go exclusively to transportation needs. Supporters insisted they could stay within budget caps by cutting other programs, although no one was specifying where those cuts would be made.
\
--
\
Beyond the money aspects of the bill, the Senate accepted amendments that push states to enact .08 percent blood-alcohol- content levels for drunken driving and ban driving with open containers of alcohol. States that don't go along -- currently 15 states have .08 percent laws -- face losing future highway money.
\
A third amendment encouraged states to impose tough minimum penalties on repeat drunken drivers.

Two candidates for state representative in the 49th Legislative District offer starkly different approaches for balancing the state's budget.
\
The Position 1 incumbent, Rep. Bill Fromhold, D-Vancouver, believes the Legislature must slash budgets again but that a projected $2 billion shortfall cannot be bridged without a temporary tax increase.
\
His challenger, Republican Mike Smith, said he will not raise taxes under any circumstances.
\
""I am going to stick to my commitments, so we will have to use the funds we have,"" Smith said.
\
Smith was less clear on where he would cut the budget. In fact, he didn't mention one specific area where he would trim state spending, except that he would ""look further into what's available to cut.""
\
""We need to find out where the waste is,"" he said. ""We need to have the legislators act more responsibly with the issues at hand.""
\
Fromhold believes legislators can act responsibly by confronting fiscal realities.
\
""It has to be a combination of budget cuts, efficiencies where we can provide them and some temporary taxation,"" the one-term incumbent said.
\
Fromhold presented his ideas for plugging the $2 billion budget hole with a few strokes of a ballpoint pen.
\
First knock off $400 million by tapping cash reserves. Then factor in $700 million in spending cuts, roughly equal to reductions the Legislature approved for this biennium.
\
Fold in another $200 million for higher taxes on liquor and gambling. That leaves a $700 million shortfall that can be covered by bumping up the sales tax three-tenths of 1 percent, with a ""sunset"" provision assuring the tax increase self-destructs after two years.
\
Fromhold knows the process will be far more cantankerous than jotting a few figures on a sheet of white paper, but the example says a lot about his legislative approach: confront realities, analyze options and make hard decisions, with as little hand- wringing and pontificating as possible.
\
Fromhold said the state will continue to search for efficiencies, particularly in health and social programs. Dennis Braddock, secretary of the Department of Social and Health Services, is ""doing the job he was hired to do,"" he said.
\
Fromhold is personally pushing one idea for making state government more efficient: consolidating all programs for early- childhood care and learning into a single department.
\
Fromhold said he met with Gov. Gary Locke three weeks ago to discuss his proposal, which is designed to better prepare children so they are ready to learn when they enter the public school system.
\
""The reaction is positive,"" he said. ""It's been talked to death, and I'm now going to get out and push this thing.""
\
Fromhold appears to be well on his way to winning a second term. Not only did he capture 60.6 percent of the vote in last month's ""beauty contest"" primary, but he holds a massive fund-raising advantage over his opponent.
\
As of Oct. 28, Fromhold had raised $87,900 for the election. Smith had raised $645, as of Oct. 8.
\
""I am no threat as far as advertising or TV,"" Smith said. ""I don't even have any road signs.
\
""I need to get people to vote,"" he added. ""I hope they hear my words. I hope they are inspired, to be able to be moved, to understand that there is a candidate who is honest, who is straightforward, who tells it how it is.""

\
QUESTIONS FOR THE CANDIDATES
\
Q. How do you think the state should address its $2 billion two- year budget deficit? Please be as specific as possible about both spending cuts or increased fees or taxes you would support.
\
Fromhold: The state will need to slash spending by $700 million, roughly equal to cuts for current biennium, and use $400 million in cash reserves. Another $200 million could be raised from higher liquor and gambling taxes. Remaining $700 million could be covered by bumping up sales tax three-tenths of 1 percent for two years.
\
Smith: Opposes any tax increases, period. Legislators need to ""find out where the waste is"" and ""act more responsibly,"" but would have to look further before identifying specific cuts. ""It's sad that we have to look into cutting anything because I'm really not a guy who likes to cut stuff.""
\
Q. What's your position on Referendum 51, which would increase gas taxes and other fees to finance improvements to the state's transportation system?
\
Fromhold: Will vote for it, but wishes it were a better package and Southwest Washington would get better return. ""It's the only game in town, but I'm pessimistic that it's going to pass.""
\
Smith: No. Opposed to any tax increases. R-51 would be ""steppingstone"" to bigger projects. Too much money would be set aside for studies and for nonhighway and off-road projects. ""Before a hammer falls, a shovel of dirt is moved, 31 percent of Referendum 51 is going to go into studies.""
\
Q. If Referendum 51 fails, what, if anything, should the state Legislature do to address the state's transportation needs? Be specific.
\
Fromhold: Would develop new package that has more even distribution for Western Washington. Reduce the proposed gas-tax increase to 6 or 7 cents a gallon. Believes the Legislature should take action without referral to voters. ""It's our job to do it; that's why we're elected. And it frustrates me to no end that these infrastructure issues didn't used to have this partisan bickering.""
\
Smith: No gas tax needed. ""The money is coming from all different sources. It needs to be accounted for. I think there is some waste and there might even be some corruption."" Proposes fee on sale of studded tires since ""most of our road damage that we suffer in this state is due to tire studs.""
\
Q. What, if anything, should the state do to retain existing businesses and foster economic development, particularly in Southwest Washington?
\
Fromhold: Give more tools to local economic development councils. Revise law on sales tax exemption on manufacturing equipment to prevent overly rigid interpretation by state Revenue Department. Push for consistent interpretation of regulations. ""It's the private sector who creates jobs. We need to work to maintain an environment that is conducive to that.""
\
Smith: Need to make community more attractive to businesses. ""We have everything we need here, major airport, major waterway."" Business taxes are ""unreasonable"" and should be reduced. Need to use ""entrepreneurial spirit"" and to ""think outside the box"" to attract more businesses.
\
Q.What's your response to educators' complaints that they lack sufficient funding sources to pay teachers what they deserve, maintain existing schools and build new schools?
\
Fromhold: He agrees that teachers need to be paid better. On right path for better pay but probably not moving fast enough. Framework for building schools, 50-50 split between state and local, is ""conceptually sound."" Believes 60 percent ""supermajority"" to pass school bond issues should be changed to 50 percent majority, along with increasing validation requirement from 40 percent to 50 percent.
\
Smith: Teachers make a ""fairly good wage,"" one that is ""really not that bad; it's a living wage."" Lottery was supposed to take care of schools. ""I think the school systems need to get a little more of the (lottery) pie.""
\
Q.If you could introduce one bill in the next session what would it be?
\
Fromhold: He would reintroduce legislation to provide balanced governance for all state pension systems. Bring representation from employers and employees, both retired and working, into system. Forty-six states have balanced systems.
\
Smith: He would support legislation directed toward business. ""When businesses have more freedom and power to exercise what they need to do, then everything else falls into place."" Not sure on specifics. ""I would actually look into that because writing a bill takes some thought, some foreknowledge.""

Two Vancouver lawmakers want to help the state recover $170 million in lost tax revenues by getting rid of the tax exemption buyers in Oregon and other states get when they buy motor vehicle fuel imported from and refined in Washington.
\
Its only fair, say 49th District Democrats Jim Moeller and Jim Jacks, because Clark County residents who work in Oregon pay more than their share in Oregon income tax, while Oregonians who shop in Washington are eligible for a sales tax exemption.
\
They note that more than 58,000 Oregon income tax returns were filed by Clark County residents in 2006. Clark County residents who worked in Oregon paid more than $138 million in Oregon income taxes that year, making Clark the eighth-highest contributor to Oregon tax coffers.
\
Under current law, states that buy gasoline from Washington suppliers pay their own gas tax rate on the purchase. In Oregon, the tax rate is 25 cents per gallon. In Washington, its 37.5 cents per gallon.
\
House Bill 2277 would require out-of-state purchasers to pay the Washington rate. The tax, collected by wholesalers or producers of fuel at the time the fuel is put on a truck, raises about $1.3 billion annually for Washington highway projects.
\
For sales to Oregon purchasers, the exemption on the motor vehicle fuel tax amounted to more than $169 million in lost revenue in 2007, Jacks said. I was quite surprised to hear how heavily Washington subsidizes the gas tax for Oregon. Were happy to be good partners and pay our fair share, but we are paying much, much more than our fair share.
\
Oregon has no petroleum refineries, and gets much of its fuel from Washington.
\
HB 2277, prime-sponsored by Moeller, was introduced Thursday and is awaiting a hearing in the House Transportation Committee, on which he sits.
\
Jacks and Moeller said they focused on the fuel tax because Washington incurs significant costs in the importing, refining and exporting of petroleum products. For example, the state bears the responsibility for protecting waterways and roads from fuel spills.
\
This provides an opportunity for Washington to ensure that the environment and the transportation system are protected, as well as provide funding for identified mega-transportation projects that will keep people and freight moving throughout the state, the two said in a statement.
\
At a time when a lot of our citizens are really hurting, here is something we can do to keep some of our money here in our state, Jacks said.
\
The fuel tax bill is the second even-the-score measure to be introduced by a Clark County legislator this session.
\
Rep. Deb Wallace is the prime sponsor of House Bill 1387, which would eliminate the sales tax exemption for retail purchases by out-of-state residents. The measure could allow the state to collect an additional $50 million over 10 years. The exemption was enacted in 1965 primarily to help Washington retailers in areas near the Oregon border compete.
\
A separate tax exemption would remain in effect for the purchase of cars, trucks and boats.
\
Moeller is a co-sponsor on Wallaces bill, which was heard Feb. 3 in the House Finance Committee. The bill has not moved out of committee.

YAKIMA HERALD-REPUBLIC
\
Yakima Valley Republican legislators acknowledge they face an uphill battle in the 2007 Legislature, which Democrats will dominate with historic majorities.
\
But the lawmakers reject the notion -- uttered by Republican consultant Chris Vance last week --that Democrats will marginalize them and their rural constituents.
\
""Certainly they have the majority of seats, but that doesn't mean that a lot of Washington citizens didn't vote for us,"" Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, said in a recent telephone interview. He is assistant Republican floor leader.
\
The reality is, though, that Democrats blew away Republicans on the suburban westside of the state, resulting in a firm 32-17 grip on the Senate, the strongest in more than 30 years. They control the House 61-37.
\
Water issues, for example, could take a back seat to Puget Sound traffic gridlock, some lawmakers predict. And labor unions will push a powerful agenda that is sure to include resurrection of last year's so-called Wal-Mart bill to require businesses with 5,000 or more employees to spend at least 9 percent of their payroll costs on employee health care, or pay the difference into the state's health care fund. Many large private companies in the state, including fruit warehouses in Yakima, have employees on the state-subsidized Basic Health Plan.
\
Observers say Gov. Chris Gregoire's ability to temper the Democrats' legislative zeal has enormous political implications for her likely bid for re-election in 2008.
\
She barely won in 2004 over former state Sen. Dino Rossi.
\
""This is not a matter of playing king of the hill,"" said Paul George, former Yakima mayor and longtime Democratic activist. ""She governs from the middle.""
\
Indeed, Gregoire has forged strategic alliances with some Eastern Washington Republicans. Last session, she won the controversial 9.5- cent gas-tax vote of conservative former Sen. Joyce Mulliken of Ephrata, who made the case for agriculture's transportation needs. Gregoire later appointed Mulliken to the Eastern Washington Growth Management Hearings Board.
\
Gregoire also happily shared credit for the state's new biofuels program with Rep. Jana Holmquist, R-Moses Lake, who recently won election to Mulliken's old seat in the Senate. The new laws mandate minimum levels of alternative fuels in the state's supply, which is expected to boost production of canola and other crops used to make biodiesel and ethanol.
\
Holmquist said she's realistic about the session but won't hesitate to call on her relationship with the governor.
\
""Ultimately, anything that gets done in Olympia is going to be the Democrats' decision, but I know I have access to Gov. Gregoire and that's available when and if I need it,"" she said.
\
Holmquist and other Eastern Washington Republicans strongly disagree with Vance, the former state Republican Party chairman, who told The Seattle Times last week that rural Republicans will be left out in the cold.
\
""Republicans have less leverage in Olympia than anytime in my living memory,"" Vance said. ""Now those Republicans from rural areas have no leverage at all. The Democrats don't have to talk to them, and probably won't.""
\
Mulliken said Vance, a Seattle-based consultant, is wrong.
\
""Chris doesn't understand Eastern Washington. It would be a big mistake on Democrats' part to exclude rural concerns. Don't forget there are Democrats in rural areas on the west side,"" she said.
\
Rep. Lynn Kessler, D-Hoquiam, for instance, represents a rural area and, as House majority leader, has a big say in the Democratic caucus.
\
Another rural Democrat in leadership is Bill Grant of Walla Walla. He's House caucus chairman. And House Speaker Frank Chopp likes to remind people that he was born in Cle Elum.
\
Still, Vance is a veteran and might have a point. So Miles Kohl, executive director of the Yakima Valley Growers-Shippers Association, has invited conservative Democrat Tim Sheldon of Potlatch to advise the group later this month. Sheldon, who owns a tree farm on the Olympic Peninsula, often left his party to vote with Republicans.
\
""I've asked him to talk about how pro- business groups like ours survive in this legislative environment,"" Kohl said.
\
Democrats, for their part, are pledging to legislate for the entire state, and maintain their agenda isn't anti-rural.
\
""With our increased majority comes an increased responsibility,"" Kessler said in a recent statement. ""We have an advantage, though, because the values we have worked so hard to represent are shared by people from all corners of the state.""
\
Rep. Bruce Chandler, R-Granger, will be watching Democrats' every move and won't hesitate to remind them that agriculture is still the largest employer in the state.
\
""Agriculture and rural Washington may not have the glamour of the Boeing Dreamliner,"" Chandler said, referring to the new 787 being built in Renton with the help of legislative tax breaks. ""But we still carry a large part of the economic load of this state. Both Frank (Chopp) and the governor say they are committed to one Washington. We'll see if that's more than a platitude.""

Another 20 years, apparently, wont bring enough technological advances to have us soaring around with jet packs or using our personal flying machines to go on some errands. Yet while the future envisioned by the forward-thinking animation of The Jetsons will need to wait, the state of Washington is engaging in some planning for future transportation needs.The state transportation commission is in the process of updating its 20-year plan, devising Washington Transportation Plan 2035 and attempting to discern future needs for roads, mass transportation and, perhaps most important, financing. Details of the early draft can be found at wtp2035.com, and the public is encouraged to submit comments through Sept. 25. The plan will be adopted in December and submitted to Gov. Jay Inslee and the Legislature in January.Were really talking about the transportation system for the generation coming up, Paul Parker, deputy director of the commission, told Columbian reporter Eric Florip. While that vision will help inform all kinds of future decisions, one of the biggest questions is how to pay for projects.Washington, as with most states, has watched its gas-tax revenue diminish in value over the years. While the states tax of 37.5 cents per gallon is among the highest in the nation, the amount does not automatically adjust for inflation, and more and more residents are using vehicles with improved fuel efficiency. Because of that, several states are considering charging users a mileage tax either a flat fee or a per-mile charge. As the draft plan says, The commission recommends that the state continue to evaluate and plan for a possible transition from the gas tax to a road usage charge.The problem is that no consensus exists for how to enhance or replace the gas tax. Congress recently faced a similar problem as the federal Highway Trust Fund, supported by the federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, neared insolvency. Lawmakers, as they are prone to doing, managed to solve the problem by providing no real solutions, instead providing $10.8 billion in infrastructure funding through pension smoothing, which the Washington Post referred to as an egregious budgetary gimmick. In short, it allows companies to temporarily delay payments to defined pension plans, raising tax revenues in the short term but decreasing them down the road.The Washington Transportation Plan 2035 does not create the same immediate needs as presented by the Highway Trust Fund, but it does raise similar questions. Fuel taxes are the largest source of state transportation funding, and meeting the needs of both the present and the future will require adjustments in how the state pays for projects. We hope planners and the Legislature will be more fiscally responsible than Congress in providing stable funding.The states 20-year plan, which is updated every five years, will provide a vision for how transportation will address issues for preservation, safety, mobility, environment, stewardship, and economic vitality. Each of those categories is crucial, and each of those is intertwined. Economic vitality, for example, is dependent upon preserving prior transportation investments and upon improved mobility as the population grows and density increases.Those are the kind of issues that are facing the transportation commission as it looks to the future. WTP 2035 wont be finalizing plans for a new bridge across the Columbia River, but who knows? it might be laying the groundwork for a Jetson-like future in transportation.
"
174,"
For a fifth straight year, the fate of a campaign to drop the 60 percent supermajority rule for Washington school operating levies rests with state senators.
\
School advocates are pushing hard in Olympia for a switch to a simple majority rule. The change requires a proposed constitutional amendment that would go to a public vote in November.
\
Four times, House members have approved a simple majority resolution. Four times, the Senate has declined. On Wednesday, the Senate rejected a simple majority measure by a 30-17 vote, three votes short of the two-thirds needed for passage. The measure failed even though it partly met opponents' concerns by requiring simple- majority elections to coincide with November general election dates.
\
But this debate is far from over. The measure is likely to return for Senate reconsideration on Friday.
\
School construction bonds won't be included, but simple-majority backers hope the Legislature approves a version of the bill without a November-only clause, ending a long, contentious battle.
\
It's no trifling issue. In 2006, about one in seven school levy proposals in Washington earned more than 50 percent support but less than the 60 percent needed, including two Battle Ground school district attempts. Those 33 levy failures raised the total to 169 supermajority ""defeats"" since 2000.
\
Running repeat school levy elections to gain 60 percent wastes valuable dollars and time, while eroding employee morale and community good will, simple majority backers say.
\
Now, proponents have fresh ammunition: A narrowing gap between voter turnout in non-November school levy votes and general elections, which weakens one argument long cited by foes.
\
Many simple majority opponents have said winter or springtime ballots catch voters by surprise, and thus should be held to the current 60 percent supermajority rule.
\
Opponents list other reasons, but educators chafe at hearing what they consider flimsy, outdated references to so-called ""stealth"" school votes. It especially rubs raw in Clark County, which has adopted all-mail voting along with 33 other Washington counties.
\
""I don't understand how we can hold a stealth election on an all- mail ballot,"" said Joan Skelton, longtime Evergreen school district board member who trekked to Olympia this week.
\
""There is no stealth argument,"" said Ted Thomas, Longview School District board member who has collected extensive Southwest Washington election data. ""It's rationalizations and justifications that do not represent the facts.""
\
They and others are lobbying for passage of House and Senate joint resolutions 4204 and 8207, which would forward the proposal to state voters.
\
But many opponents refuse to concede the simple majority without demanding levy votes come in November. While several counties may show large gains in special election turnout, it's not enough, they say.
\
""There's other cases we've looked at where it's been 30 percent. Those still aren't the numbers you get in the general election,"" said Steven Maggi, education reform director for the Evergreen Freedom Foundation, a conservative government watchdog group. He said special elections for levies also cost more public dollars, but high turnout is the main concern.
\
""We understand (dropping) the 60 percent. We don't have a problem with that (providing) as many people vote on it as possible,"" Maggi said.
\
Simple majority supporters wonder why Washington voters can approve construction of jails or new sports stadiums with a simple majority, but not school levies that provide for up to 24 percent of a district's annual budget. Levy dollars help pay for teacher assistants, student computers, rigorous Advanced Placement and other elective courses, and extracurricular programs.
\
Critics say the supermajority is a buffer intended to help protect property owners who directly pay the taxes levied. It also keeps school districts focused on performance to earn high public support, they say.
\
Debate invariably drifts back to anxiety over just when school levies are decided, however.
\
Changed environment
\
Mail voting and mass media have changed everything since the supermajority rule emerged in the 1930s, educators argue. Rural isolation, hundreds of tiny school districts and difficulty traveling to polling places are no longer barriers to voter turnout, they say.
\
Currently, 34 of 39 Washington counties conduct all elections by mail ballot. King County is phasing in mail balloting starting in 2008. Pierce, Kittitas, Klickitat and Island counties also retain polling-place voting, though absentee mail ballots far outnumber in- person votes.
\
Gone, too, are the days when only 19 to 20 percent of local voters braved winter weather to vote at the polls on Vancouver and Evergreen district levies, as occurred as recently as the 1980s.
\
As of now, nine Clark County school districts are expected to place operating levies on the February 2010 ballot; the Hockinson district could join them. Shared election costs and high publicity are incentives for districts to run their levies together, leaders say. A countywide school vote in February 2010 would seem hard to overlook.
\
""I don't understand how anybody could not know there was an election, unless they just totally turn themselves off from all the news media,"" Skelton said.
\
November-only stance
\
Sen. Joe Zarelli, R-Ridgefield, voted against the measure on Wednesday for strategic reasons, he said. He is among supermajority defenders open to lowering the bar only if schools agree to place levies on November ballots.
\
That's when voters expect elections, Zarelli said. If school measures are drawing higher turnout in February or March, ""Why are you afraid of the turnout in November?"" he asked rhetorically. Any district that can't pull 50 percent-plus support has troubles far more profound than election timing, he said.
\
""It just provides for a cleaner process. It's clear that all things are centered on November,"" Zarelli said.
\
School officials and advocates insist November levy elections are unworkable.
\
Districts, which now set annual budgets during summer, would lack assurance their levy would pass and needed dollars flow. Mid-school year cutbacks and layoffs could cause turmoil. Projecting future levy amounts and rates would be harder because county assessed tax values are not finalized by early autumn. The narrow window between levy approval and tax collection would necessitate a second constitutional reform, advocates say.
\
Educators also fear national politics, other tax measures and hot candidate races would sway outcomes of November school measures. School levies would get far less notice on a crowded ballot, they say.
\
Another approach
\
On one critical point, simple-majority backers and skeptical legislators such as Zarelli do agree.
\
If Washington bucks up to meet its state constitution mandate to fully fund ""basic education"" by changing its spending formula, local school levies would be far less critical.
\
Problem is, that price tag could be staggering. Last week, a Washington Education Association-commissioned study said the state would need to increase annual school spending by 45 percent, a $3.45 billion increase in 2004 dollars, to meet its obligation.
\
Several districts have filed a joint lawsuit against the state, pressing for such a change. Zarelli predicts, however, all that will come from the 2007 session is a new legislative study of the spending formula.
\
School measure vote turnout rising
\
More than 52 percent of registered voters weighed in this month when a Battle Ground Public Schools maintenance and operations levy narrowly won approval, following two failures in 2006.
\
Participation topped voter turnout for Battle Ground's previous attempt last May, when the measure fell short of passage by less than one percentage point.
\
It also came close to the 53.8 percent of Clark County registered voters who cast ballots in November 2002, near the average turnout in recent years for nonpresidential, even-year general elections. Headlining that ballot were a statewide gas tax hike and license tab fees, a congressional race and state legislators' contests.
\
School measures are drawing twice the share of registered voters in Clark County than they did two decades ago: A combined 45.4 percent turnout in February 2006 when levies for seven districts were on the ballot.
\
This year, Battle Ground levy supporters gave the election a lot of exposure. Lawn signs, banners, street rallies and community debate kept the proposed levy on the front burner after failure had triggered cuts in district staffing and classroom and extracurricular programs.
\
But higher school levy voter turnout also is evident elsewhere in Washington state:
\
53 percent last March when 15 Spokane County school districts, both large and small, ran operating levies;
\
50.5 percent in Kitsap County in February 2006, when voters backed all three school levies;
\
56 percent for the West Valley School District's first all-mail levy vote in Yakima County in February 2006, up from 48.9 percent in 2004.
\
Turnout remains less, in the 30 percent to 40 percent range, in King and Pierce counties where mail ballots are not yet used by all voters. That leaves foes of non-November elections unwilling to budge.
\
""We're just not there,"" said Steven Maggi, education reform director for the Evergreen Freedom Foundation.

\
The debate
\
Should Washington school district operating levies be restricted to November ballots if the supermajority rule is dropped?
\
On one side:
\
Yes. The highest number of voters should determine school levies, and most voters expect elections in November, not in February or March.
\
On another side:
\
No. School levies would get overshadowed on November ballots, and could be negatively affected by national, state or local factors. Tax assessment and school budget cycles make November levy elections problematic.
\
How to get involved:
\
State legislators are considering HJR 4204 and SJR 8207, which would put the 60 percent rule to a statewide vote this November. See www.leg.wa.gov and ""bill information"" for details.

"
175," He saw Washington state through an earthquake, a recession, two droughts, an energy crunch and the post-Sept. 11 confusion. But as Gary Locke prepares to leave office next month, the two-term governor - a popular Asian American leader once talked of as a potential Al Gore vice presidential pick - gets mixed reviews.\ Friends and supporters say he accomplished much for a Democrat hemmed in by events and by Republican lawmakers running one or both houses of the Legislature throughout his tenure.\ ""He's sort of a one-step-at-a-time guy, and these are one-step- at-a-time times,"" said longtime Locke friend and adviser Blair Butterworth. ""Gary fit the times, and he did it admirably and with honor.""\ But Locke's foes - and some former political allies - call him a do-nothing who was cautious to a fault. Despite tremendous promise and popularity, they say, Locke never showed much vision or used his political horsepower on the sort of sweeping changes that leave a real legacy.\ ""I don't think history will remember Gary Locke,"" said Republican Party Chairman Chris Vance. ""Leadership means leading, taking chances, spending your political capital, being bold. ... He tried to be everything to everyone, and he ended up accomplishing nothing.""\ Locke vowed to be ""the education governor"" - only to be snubbed by the state teachers union, bitter over Locke's refusal to back more taxes for teacher pay and schools.\ He delighted Republicans last year by sticking to a no-new-taxes budget. Now, only weeks before he leaves, he's proposed a half- billion dollars in new taxes.\ ""It's really hard to stand on top of the fence,"" said Sen.-elect Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville.\ 'AN IMMENSE PRIDE'\ Locke faced high expectations from the start. A young deputy prosecutor for King County, he was elected to the statehouse in 1982, moving quickly to lead the powerful Appropriations Committee. After a decade there, Locke in 1993 became King County executive. A year later, he married Mona Lee, a television reporter in Seattle.\ In 1996, Gary Locke ran for governor. He survived a tough Democratic primary, then trounced Christian conservative Ellen Craswell in a November landslide election. Four years later, he easily beat Republican radio talk-show host John Carlson. He became head of the Democratic Governors' Association and last year delivered the Democrats' response to President Bush's State of the Union speech.\ Locke's political career was buoyed by his life story. Born to a Chinese immigrant couple in 1950, he spent his first six years in a public housing project in Seattle. He grew up speaking Chinese. He learned English in kindergarten as his mother struggled to learn it from a worn Chinese-English dictionary.\ He worked in his father's grocery store and patched together jobs, financial aid and scholarships to attend Yale. He graduated in 1972 and three years later got his law degree from Boston University. When he became governor, Locke noted that his grandfather had been a household servant in an Olympia home about a mile from the governor's mansion. It took the Lockes 100 years, he'd joke, to travel that one mile.\ ""He was an immense pride to the Asian community,"" Butterworth said. ""He was speaking for a huge number of immigrants who had had their mile that they'd traveled.""\ University of Washington professor David Olson predicts that Locke's ties to China and its booming economy will be the governor's biggest legacy, one that may not be fully appreciated for 20 or 30 years.\ Shortly after taking office, Locke led a trade mission to China. On his last day, he and his family visited the Guangdong Province village where Locke's father was born. Thousands of Chinese schoolchildren lined the roads to greet them.\ FRIENDS AND FOES\ In office, Locke pushed reluctant lawmakers to approve a 5-cent gas tax increase to pay for billions of dollars in transportation work. After getting a black eye over Boeing's unexpected decision to move its corporate headquarters to Chicago, Locke got the Legislature to approve $3.2 billion in tax breaks and incentives for Boeing to assemble its next-generation airliner, the 7E7, in Washington state.\ ""I think he's going to be known as the governor who saved Boeing - and a lot of jobs,"" said Martha Choe, former head of the state office of Community, Trade and Economic Development.\ Over Democratic objections, last year he instituted a revolutionary ""priorities of government"" approach to the state budget, prioritizing government services and then allocating dollars on the basis of what's deemed most important. It sounds like common sense, but it was a dramatic change from a mindset of basing each budget on whatever each agency had gotten in the previous budget.\ In the midst of the recession, Locke infuriated the state teachers union - and drew accolades from Republicans - for refusing to press for a tax increase, even for something as popular as schools.\ Locke also created ""Promise Scholarships,"" aimed at students from middle-class families. He angered some Democrats again when he backed welfare reform, cutting the rolls 43 percent and forcing recipients to find jobs.\ Citing the wounded economy, Locke also went along with ""suspending"" two citizen initiatives that were supposed to steer hundreds of millions of dollars into teacher salaries and shrink the number of students in classrooms.\ ""Our members felt they had been betrayed,"" said Washington Education Association President Charles Hasse, particularly because Locke hadn't voiced similar worries about the gas tax increase.\ ""You never make progress on these things unless the bully pulpit is used, unless somebody is a strong advocate for what it will take to move forward on schools,"" Hasse said. ""These students won't have another chance, another two years in a noncrowded classroom to do over.""\ 'A STEADY HAND'\ Last week, Locke proposed reinstating those initiatives, with the cost paid by a new tax on beer, soda pop, wine and liquor. It's unclear, however, whether the incoming governor will support that idea.\ To spur the economy, Locke pushed for business-friendly reforms and promoted rural phone-and-data service - which expands access to the Internet and other networks - a move that advocates predict will be as beneficial to struggling areas as electrification once was.\ Many of Locke's accomplishments - his office will be happy to provide an 18-page list - are incremental things, policy tweaks designed to help rural economies, conserve energy, decrease pollution, help salmon, conserve water and streamline government.\ ""I think he will go down in history as someone who presided over some of the toughest times in state history and didn't do anything earth-shattering but was a steady hand,"" Choe said.\ It's no accident, friends say, that one of Locke's favorite hobbies is working around the house. He likes to work on cars, do plumbing, fix wiring. During key budget talks in 1991, he broke two vertebrae by falling off the roof of his Seattle home when a ladder shifted.\ ""Gary is a tinkerer,"" Vance said. ""He's very good at the minutiae of fixing bills and writing budgets. But he never had a big picture for the state. He's a detail guy, not a visionary.""\ That's not necessarily a bad thing, said David Nice, a political science professor at Washington State University.\ ""It would be fair to say he's not a super-charismatic leader, but most leaders aren't,"" Nice said. ""Frankly, it's not at all practical for a governor all the time to seize the bully pulpit and mold the minds of voters. It often doesn't work very well, and it often annoys people.""\ ""It should also be noted that Gary Locke ran a clean ship of state,"" said Olson, the UW professor. ""This has been a largely corruption-free eight years, and that's not always been the case in Washington state politics.""\ Locke's predecessor, Mike Lowry, left after one term, battered by two accusations of sexual misconduct, one of which he paid $97,500 to settle.\ GROWING FAMILY\ Locke brought something else to the office: a young family. Mona Lee Locke gave birth to a daughter, Emily, in 1997. A son, Dylan, was born two years later. Last month, a second daughter, Madeline, was born.\ It had been decades since young children scampered around the governor's mansion. Locke stuck his children's stick-figure artwork on the walls of his stately office, and tricycles and a jungle gym appeared on the mansion's front lawn. Locke would rush home from night meetings to cut up an apple - a Washington-grown Fuji, thank you very much - and read books to the children. And he was the first governor in a very long time to bristle at reporters during a press conference, then to explain that he'd been up all night with a colicky baby.\ Still, it's hard to have a normal childhood when your yard's guarded by state troopers, your home's open to public tours and the local newspaper treats your first day of kindergarten as front-page news.\ ""It's not a normal environment for raising a family,"" Locke said. ""It's not like you have kids next door that Emily and Dylan can see playing outside and just run out and join them. There are no kids within a quarter-mile.""\ Those sorts of concerns are a big part of why he chose not to run for a third term, he said.\ ""I just think it's time. We're ready for another chapter in our life,"" he said. He said he's proud of what he's done in office, ""but I also believe eight years is enough. Especially with the age of the kids, to grow up in a more normal setting.""\ In a Dec. 13 interview, Locke denied rumors that he'd lined up a job with a major Seattle law firm. Asked what he wants to do next, he said, ""I really don't know yet.""\ ""This may sound strange, but he's a really good man and has extraordinarily good values,"" Butterworth said. ""Given how willing we are to demonize our elected officials, that's a legacy of decency and honor that means something.""\ Richard Roesler can be reached at (360) 664-2598 or by e-mail at richr@spokanenews.net.\ Credit: Spokane"

Lost House seat in 2008 election. Website: voteahern.com.\Why do you feel you are the best candidate? Experience counts. I've had eight years experience in the Washington state Legislature. I've had two major bills that were beneficial to Eastern Washington and the entire state of Washington. One was the veterans' home for Eastern Washington. I got that in 2001. a[128][broken bar]The other major bill that I passed was the felony DUI bill.\Would you support asking voters for a gas tax to extend the north Spokane freeway south of Francis? Absolutely not. ... Here in Eastern Washington, particularly in Spokane, we get about 70 to 75 cents back on the dollar for gas taxes. ... Since we are a donor county it's only fair that we get our fair share back and whatever the cost is ... I think the state should allocate the funds for us, and I would fight for that.\Would you support tax increases to deal with the $3 billion shortfall over the next two years? Absolutely not. No way.\How would you cut the budget? I would scale back government tremendously. ... Three ways: privatize, privatize and privatize. We're going to have one, I think, that is going to be privatized and that's the liquor industry... The voters are pretty much going to take care of that. ... (There are) a couple (other) areas I'd like to privatize. One, would be the ferry system. ... We here in Spokane are supporting the ferry system and we seldom ever use it. ... The other area (is) the printing industry that they have in the Capitol. I would privatize that and let that out to bid. ... All you have to do is spend less money than what you're taking in. Families learn this, they do this all the time, but the state doesn't.\Should the state allow gay marriage? Absolutely not. ... (Domestic-partner benefits are) just costing the taxpayers more and more money. Secondly, marriage should be between a man and a woman. It goes against common sense, I think. It goes against most people's common sense. Domestic partner benefits, no, I would not be for it.\Do you believe that there is enough evidence to indicate that human activity is a significant cause of global warming? Not significant. Definitely not. ... I want clean water, clean air. Everybody does. We're in the right direction right now. ... I think you're going to see a lot less use of carbon fuels down the road. Right now we're looking at solar and wind. What about nuclear? We're totally ignoring nuclear here in the State of Washington and on a national basis.\Do you support Attorney General Rob McKenna's challenge of the federal health care law? Absolutely. For the simple reason the government right now on this health care is mandating that if you don't have insurance that you will have insurance. ... That is absolutely dead wrong.\Do you support the state law that allows cities to install red light cameras? That has been quite a controversy right there, and I'm not 100 percent supportive of it. I'd have to really take a look at it, and I'd like to check with other states that have had this for a long time (to investigate) what the pluses and minuses are.\Do you support Initiative 1098, which would create an income tax on people earning $200,000 or more a year while cutting the business and occupation tax and property taxes? No. Once you get the camel's nose under the tent on an income tax, that's all she wrote. I was on the Finance Committee a couple years ago and ... Bill Gates Sr. did a PowerPoint presentation on this very same thing. (Ahern said he told Gates about large increases in sales taxes he noticed during two visits to California 15 years apart). I said, 'In all due respect, Mr. Gates, this is what we call tax creep,' and I don't think the voters are going to go for it.\What is your stance on abortion? I believe that the only reason for an abortion is to save the mother's life. No other reason.\Should the state Legislature act to prevent continued large increases in college tuition? I really don't know how you can get a handle on it. ... There is a cost factor in the labor aspect of it, and that should be looked at very closely. Also, the administration, there probably is a lot of bureaucratic overhead that really has to be looked at.\JOHN F. DRISCOLL\Personal: 52.Incumbent Democrat. Born in Illinois.

I have lived and worked in Spokane my whole life and am extremely familiar with the dynamics of the district. With this federal health care reform bill now being implementedin the state of Washington, my longtime experience in health care administration will be important. ... That experience also will be helpful as we work to create many new high-paying jobs in the health care industry in Spokane.\Would you support asking voters for a gas tax to extend the north Spokane freeway south of Francis? We have two current gas taxes that are set to expire in the near future, and I think we need to renew those. So I would go to the voters asking for a renewal of our existing taxes with that proviso that it's contingent on us getting funding for the North-South Corridor.\Would you support tax increases to deal with the $3 billion shortfall over the next two years? No. In order to get our economic recovery happening, we cannot add tax burden.\How would you cut the budget? In my view within each of our large state departments we could have looked at further cuts in the administrative side, in the Washington Management Service level. ... I think there's definitely opportunity within that large body of midmanagement where we could consolidate, eliminate duplicative kinds of functions and positions ... We can also, I think, find savings ... . in the whole criminal justice system. ... We have huge backlogs in all of our levels of courts, and there's a high amount of overhead. Are there ways at the state level we could help with the criminal justice system, which is a huge expense overall?\Should the state allow gay marriage? I think the domestic partnership laws that we have passed over the last few years really have leveled the playing field as far as the issues. ... Adding another category of gay marriage I don't think is going to change what I believe our goal was, which was to level the playing field. ... If we were to go beyond and have gay marriage, I don't see what additional issues we would solve.\Do you believe that there is enough evidence to indicate that human activity is a significant cause of global warming? I have no question that human activity is contributing to global warming. All levels of government have a responsibility and the state of Washington, I think, is doing the right things as far as transportation policy and alternative fuel policies.\Do you support Attorney General Rob McKenna's challenge of the federal health care law? No. Absolutely not. I think the federal health reform bill is going to be good for Washingtonians.\Do you support the state law that allows cities to install red light cameras? There's conflicting data about the public safety side of it ... The cities really support this from a revenue standpoint, and I know how difficult cities' budgets are right now. ... If the red light cameras actually cause more accidents or don't solve that problem, then we shouldn't have them. ... I would vote to repeal it ... because I don't see the public safety return on investment.\Do you support Initiative 1098, which would create an income tax on people earning $200,000 or more a year while cutting the business and occupation tax and property taxes? If that vote was in front of me as a legislator, I definitely would vote against it. I think we're targeting a small subset of Washingtonians.\What is your stance on abortion? I believe in choice. Family planning decisions are between the mother and their health care provider.\Should the state Legislature act to prevent continued large increases in college tuition? The tuition-setting authority has been held by the Legislature at certain times and by the universities at other times over the last 20 years. ... The overall tuition increase has been less when it's under legislative control, and I think we do have a major responsibility within the Legislature to weigh in on that subject. ... We should control, at the legislative level, tuition increases.\SHELLY O'QUINN\Personal: 35. Republican. Born in Spokane. Married.

Campaign website: voteshellyoquinn.com.\Why do you feel you are the best candidate? I believe I have a very unique background. That includes experience both in nonprofit and the business community. My parents own a small business that I've been involved with for the last 10 years. (I am working) at GSI and working with the different industries that we have in Spokane. a[128][broken bar]I just feel like I have a really well-rounded background that gives me a perspective that understands that we need to be fiscally conservative and socially responsible.\Would you support asking voters for a gas tax to extend the north Spokane freeway south of Francis? Not at this time. I think we have the funding available. Statewide we prioritized our transportation projects and the north-south freeway was one of the top three. The other two are basically complete, and they're on the other side of the state. We need to advocate for the funding to complete the north-south freeway.\Would you support tax increases to deal with the $3 billion shortfall over the next two years? I would not. I don't believe that we have a revenue problem. While it's not growing as fast as projected, it continues to increase.\How would you cut the budget? We need to start by being efficient in government. If you look at the auditor's recommendations, he has about $3.6 billion in recommended cost savings. a[128][broken bar]You can't just look and say we're going to take a 10 percent across-the-board cut because that's a temporary solution. a[128][broken bar] You look at all the programs and say, 'Of these programs: What's working? What's not working? Should government be playing this role? Is this a core function of government? And, if it's not, is it something that can be done in the private sector that we can pass out?'\Should the state allow gay marriage? I do believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I believe that civil unions or domestic partnerships, which are also protected by Washington state law, cover the access issue.\Do you believe that there is enough evidence to indicate that human activity is a significant cause of global warming? I think human activity affects the environment, and I think the science has not given us the answer completely. ... We have a responsibility to take care of the environment. We all enjoy the quality of life we have here in Spokane, but there also has to be a balance.\Do you support Attorney General Rob McKenna's challenge of the federal health care law? I do. While I believe that we need to have affordable, accessible health care for all Washingtonians, I do not believe it needs to be a government-run system.\Do you support the state law that allows cities to install red light cameras? Since they're in, let's evaluate its effectiveness, and if it's getting the results that we need - reducing red light runners, reducing accidents - then it's a program we need to continue. If it's not, then we shouldn't be installing more.\Do you support Initiative 1098, which would create an income tax on people earning $200,000 or more a year while cutting the business and occupation tax and property taxes? I do not. ... In Spokane County it's three times more expensive to do business here than it isacross the border in Idaho, and the only competitive advantage that we have in recruiting companies to this region is the fact that we do not have an income tax.\What is your stance on abortion? I am pro-life. The one thing about this issue is that ...it's not black-and-white. So, in the case of rape and incest and the life of the mother, you have look at those.\Should the state Legislature act to prevent continued large increases in college tuition? Yes. They should. ... There will always be an increase because of inflation every year. We should not be seeing 7 or 14 percent increases. .... We need to look at cutting costs and being more efficient so that we're not preventing students from having access to education.\GRAPHIC: Map: 6th Legislative District"

In my view within each of our large state departments we could have looked at further cuts in the administrative side, in the Washington Management Service level. ... I think there's definitely opportunity within that large body of midmanagement where we could consolidate, eliminate duplicative kinds of functions and positions ... We can also, I think, find savings ... . in the whole criminal justice system. ... We have huge backlogs in all of our levels of courts, and there's a high amount of overhead. Are there ways at the state level we could help with the criminal justice system, which is a huge expense overall?\Should the state allow gay marriage? I think the domestic partnership laws that we have passed over the last few years really have leveled the playing field as far as the issues. ... Adding another category of gay marriage I don't think is going to change what I believe our goal was, which was to level the playing field. ... If we were to go beyond and have gay marriage, I don't see what additional issues we would solve.\Do you believe that there is enough evidence to indicate that human activity is a significant cause of global warming? I have no question that human activity is contributing to global warming. All levels of government have a responsibility and the state of Washington, I think, is doing the right things as far as transportation policy and alternative fuel policies.\Do you support Attorney General Rob McKenna's challenge of the federal health care law? No. Absolutely not. I think the federal health reform bill is going to be good for Washingtonians.\Do you support the state law that allows cities to install red light cameras? There's conflicting data about the public safety side of it ... The cities really support this from a revenue standpoint, and I know how difficult cities' budgets are right now. ... If the red light cameras actually cause more accidents or don't solve that problem, then we shouldn't have them. ... I would vote to repeal it ... because I don't see the public safety return on investment.\Do you support Initiative 1098, which would create an income tax on people earning $200,000 or more a year while cutting the business and occupation tax and property taxes? If that vote was in front of me as a legislator, I definitely would vote against it. I think we're targeting a small subset of Washingtonians.\What is your stance on abortion? I believe in choice. Family planning decisions are between the mother and their health care provider.\Should the state Legislature act to prevent continued large increases in college tuition? The tuition-setting authority has been held by the Legislature at certain times and by the universities at other times over the last 20 years. ... The overall tuition increase has been less when it's under legislative control, and I think we do have a major responsibility within the Legislature to weigh in on that subject. ... We should control, at the legislative level, tuition increases.\SHELLY O'QUINN\Personal: 35. Republican. Born in Spokane. Married. Has two young children.\Education: Graduated from Central Valley High School in 1993. Earned accounting, international business and business management bachelor's degrees from Whitworth College in 1997. Received master's in business administration from Monterey Institute of International Studies in California in 2001.\Career: Employed as Workforce Development Manager for Greater Spokane Inc. since Feb. 2008. Former positions include: small business development consultant for World Vision in Honduras; missions director for First United Methodist Church in Stuart, Fla.; family services director at Habitat for Humanity in Spokane; executive director of the George Nethercutt Foundation from Feb. 2008 to Sept. 2009.\Political: First run for office. Campaign website: voteshellyoquinn.com.\Why do you feel you are the best candidate? I believe I have a very unique background. That includes experience both in nonprofit and the business community. My parents own a small business that I've been involved with for the last 10 years. (I am working) at GSI and working with the different industries that we have in Spokane. ... I just feel like I have a really well-rounded background that gives me a perspective that understands that we need to be fiscally conservative and socially responsible.\Would you support asking voters for a gas tax to extend the north Spokane freeway south of Francis? Not at this time. I think we have the funding available. Statewide we prioritized our transportation projects and the north-south freeway was one of the top three. The other two are basically complete, and they're on the other side of the state. We need to advocate for the funding to complete the north-south freeway.\Would you support tax increases to deal with the $3 billion shortfall over the next two years? I would not. I don't believe that we have a revenue problem. While it's not growing as fast as projected, it continues to increase.\How would you cut the budget? We need to start by being efficient in government. If you look at the auditor's recommendations, he has about $3.6 billion in recommended cost savings. ...You can't just look and say we're going to take a 10 percent across-the-board cut because that's a temporary solution. ... You look at all the programs and say, 'Of these programs: What's working? What's not working? Should government be playing this role? Is this a core function of government? And, if it's not, is it something that can be done in the private sector that we can pass out?'\Should the state allow gay marriage? I do believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I believe that civil unions or domestic partnerships, which are also protected by Washington state law, cover the access issue.\Do you believe that there is enough evidence to indicate that human activity is a significant cause of global warming? I think human activity affects the environment, and I think the science has not given us the answer completely. ... We have a responsibility to take care of the environment. We all enjoy the quality of life we have here in Spokane, but there also has to be a balance.\Do you support Attorney General Rob McKenna's challenge of the federal health care law? I do. While I believe that we need to have affordable, accessible health care for all Washingtonians, I do not believe it needs to be a government-run system.\Do you support the state law that allows cities to install red light cameras? Since they're in, let's evaluate its effectiveness, and if it's getting the results that we need - reducing red light runners, reducing accidents - then it's a program we need to continue. If it's not, then we shouldn't be installing more.\Do you support Initiative 1098, which would create an income tax on people earning $200,000 or more a year while cutting the business and occupation tax and property taxes? I do not. ... In Spokane County it's three times more expensive to do business here than it isacross the border in Idaho, and the only competitive advantage that we have in recruiting companies to this region is the fact that we do not have an income tax.\What is your stance on abortion? I am pro-life. The one thing about this issue is that ...it's not black-and-white. So, in the case of rape and incest and the life of the mother, you have look at those.\Should the state Legislature act to prevent continued large increases in college tuition? Yes. They should. ... There will always be an increase because of inflation every year. We should not be seeing 7 or 14 percent increases. ... . We need to look at cutting costs and being more efficient so that we're not preventing students from having access to education.\GRAPHIC: Map: 6th Legislative District"

Transportation issues argued
\
The politics of our state transportation funding are leaving the taxpayers in the dark. We're not being told how much it will cost each of us or how far the plan will go to meet the need. That goes for both the Republicans' and the governor's proposals.
\
It's hard to get information. The local office of the state Department of Transportation doesn't have it, and what's available from the Olympia office is confusing.
\
Using what seems to be the governor's plan - but not intending to argue for or against it here - and the state Transportation Commission's estimate of needs for future infrastructure construction and maintenance, the following appears to be the situation.
\
To do the complete job requires $6 billion per year. Present funding is $3 billion. The governor's plan is for $3.6 billion. The $2.4 billion shortfall is equivalent to 80 cents per gallon of gasoline, roughly $400 per year per vehicle. The governor's plan calls for a gradual gas tax increase from 23 cents to 34 cents per gallon, or $55 more than the present $115 per year. This is based on 1 cent per gallon generating $30 million per year and a driver getting 20 miles per gallon on 10,000 miles per year, buying 500 gallons.
\
I am not aware of big differences in total funding between proposals competing in Olympia; the arguments seem to be about from where to take the money. There's no chance of getting the plan we need. Do we have the guts to tell our legislators that we'll support their doing the right thing?

\
After much thought and discussion with friends, I have developed a transportation vision for both the interstate corridors. Since this vision is similar for both corridors, I will describe only the Interstate 5 vision.
\
During the next 10 years commuters and truckers will help to raise the funds necessary to build a 10-lane, taller Interstate 5 Bridge complete with bike lanes, sidewalks and support for a future light rail. These funds will also be used to widen the current two-lane portion of freeway through Delta Park and create a double-decker express highway from downtown Vancouver to the Fremont Bridge.
\
Double-decker express lanes work very effectively in places such as Austin, Texas. They also improve safety because large interstate trucks can use them rather than competing with the local commuter traffic that is constantly entering and exiting the freeway.
\
Since money for these desperately needed traffic improvements will likely not come from either the state of Oregon or of Washington, it must be raised locally by those who will benefit from these improvements. An anticipated trial of an high-occupancy vehicle lane from Vancouver through to just north of downtown Portland for a year can be expanded to a 10-year period coupled with a fascinating high-tech method of collecting bridge usage fees.
\
Since HOV lanes typically don't operate at full capacity, this excess can be used by other motorists and truckers who are willing to pay an electronically collected toll. To participate in the HOV-plus lane, single occupant-vehicles registered in both Oregon and Washington must sign-up and have a wireless debit box installed. Each time they use the HOV-plus lane, their account is automatically billed. To help with compliance, a fancy sticker is also placed in the bottom of their back windshield for easy visual identification.
\
A toll of $2.50 to $5 should be sufficient over 10 years to raise the necessary funds. Regular folks who don't have the money to pay this toll can ease their commute either by riding mass transit, carpooling or driving during nonrush-hour periods. Wealthier or impatient individuals will be more than happy to avoid the traffic rush-hour mess and pay for the convenience.
\
For the tolls to be accepted, all funds that are raised must be dedicated to their respective corridors' improvements, including bridges, overpasses and interchanges that directly impinge on them. Local politicians who have mentioned spending tolls on a variety of unrelated traffic improvements on either side of the Columbia River must resist the urge, lest a 10-year toll stretch to a hundred.
\
Although a third Columbia River bridge and traffic corridor may not be in the cards, we can still succeed by making the most of the two corridors that we have available today. The fact that tolls will be charged only as part of an HOV-plus plan might also help to get this vision past the federal regulations that govern interstate highways.
\
With careful planning, this vision will enable all existing lanes of both corridors to be just as fully utilized as they are today, while helping to ensure a better future for residents of both sides of the river.

GOP's clichs worn out
\
The recent mailing about the 1998 legislative session by state Rep. Jim Dunn, R-Cascade Park, complete with Dunn's smiling face on the front, warrants a closer look at who Dunn truly represents.
\
Dunn, naturally, gives forth with the usual GOP mantra of ""less intrusive government,"" and ""more effective use of your hard-earned tax dollars."" What does Dunn really mean by these worn out clichs?
\
The past several years have seen a spate of legislation introduced by concerned Republicans aimed toward lessening government intrusion into our lives. One common target was the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The common goal of these bills was the emasculation of OSHA by making it less intrusive to big business while ripping away the rights of the working class, the very people that the law was enacted to protect. Most if not all of the legislation introduced would have made it much less complicated for the business world to maintain a safe and healthful working environment, and would have eased their burden of responsibility for the pain and agony of injured employees.
\
In addition, legislation has been introduced to back off on those inconvenient air and water pollution standards, which as we all know intrude upon the profit margin of corporate America. If businesses didn't have to abide by those standards, then they wouldn't be forced to move south of the border, where they don't have such environmental silliness. Thank goodness for NAFTA, right?
\
Next we have the old favorite: ""more effective use of your hard-earned tax dollars."" I like this one. Americans must be convinced that taxes, while paying for services we take for granted daily, are inherently evil. Republicans pride themselves in exposing the wasteful way our taxes are used - you know, welfare, Medicare and Medicaid, Head Start programs, programs to help the elderly, the poor and the handicapped. The list of shameful waste goes on.
\
Interesting, though, that Republicans voted last year to foil efforts to actually save taxpayers millions of dollars by ending funding of the notorious School of the Americas. This lovely little institution has for decades trained future Latin and South American dictators and death squad members in the fine art of spying, torture, assassination and gross abuse of civil and human rights for use back home.
\
Then, of course, we have that darling of the Republican Party, corporate welfare. Billions of tax dollars have been gleefully doled out to corporate fat cats in the form of incentives, tax breaks and aid.
\
And what are the results of these taxpayer investments? Well, corporate profits have skyrocketed and corporate CEO salaries and fringe benefit goodies have bloated to the point of being salacious. The guy out on the factory floor, whose sweat and muscle and tax dollars made it all possible, has not only watched his earnings decline or stagnate; he has also endured takeaways and loss of benefits that used to make life more enjoyable for him and his family.

Are we immune to scandal?
\
Many people don't seem to care what our president does and seem to care less about the president's sex scandal.
\
I wonder how many foreign leaders look upon the White House now as some kind of dirty joke. Our principles and morals seem to be sinking to an all-time low.
\
Evidently as long as some Americans have a job, money in their jeans and bread on the table, they just don't care about the White House or anything else. Here is a good example for our future kids. Little Johnny, who is 14 years old, gets arrested for exposing himself in school. When mom and dad show up, he says, ""What the hell, the president's done it.""
\
I still believe that if the majority of Americans turn to God and ask for help, we can still save America. I hope so.

\
The liberal, Clinton spin doctor's line that the American people don't care if the president had an affair in the White House and lied about it angers me greatly. We are one American family out of millions that do indeed care a great deal.
\
Clinton, a man who claims to be concerned about the future of the children, sets an abominable example for them to follow. Illicit sexual activities in the White House, lying about the affair and even the likelihood of leading others to cover-up will reap terrible consequences when our youth use these examples as models for their behavior.
\
Liberals put down Christian beliefs and moral values as old-fashioned and not applicable to the modern world. They are now relegating these citizens to being irrelevant or even nonexistent. What if these decent, honest, God-fearing people could not be trusted to pay their taxes to support the liberals' ever burgeoning giveaway programs? Would they then ignore us?
\
Our democratic system of government depends upon trust. If we can't trust our president, who can we trust? Behavioral standards have dropped to reprehensible levels. It's now OK to do whatever you want if you don't get caught or if you have enough power and money to buy lawyers to get you off the hook. Today, living a moral, law-abiding life in which your word is your bond does not apply to the rich and famous, a la O.J. and Clinton.
\
Our family will never accept this president's word on any matter.

179,"Washington lawmakers have little time remaining to invest in our state and prepare for a prosperous post-pandemic future. The end of the 105-day legislative session is Sunday, setting the stage for a busy week of defining the priorities of the state's residents.\Of course, a special session is possible; but whether the end arrives this week or during an overtime session, legislators should deliver a comprehensive transportation package. They should adopt a plan that would invest $17.8 billion over 16 years to boost mobility while also making progress in reducing carbon emissions.\Clark County residents know all too well the impact of infrastructure investment— and the lack of such investment. For years, we have needed a new Interstate 5 Bridge that is seismically sound and that keeps the local economy moving. The cost of an outdated bridge is evident with every minute sat idling in traffic; the price is paid by individuals as well as companies that rely on the transportation of goods and services.\As The Seattle Times writes editorially: “A diverse coalition of business, union, environment and government interests have urged lawmakers to get a transportation deal done, now: from Amazon, Microsoft and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan to Climate Solutions and the Washington State Labor Council. This package would make crucial infrastructure improvements while leveraging a cap-and-trade mechanism to cut the state's greenhouse gas pollution, an achievement that has long eluded Gov. Jay Inslee.”\Climate initiatives long have been a political football, even in our environmentally conscious state. But corporations are increasingly recognizing the need for quick and robust climate action, belying the well-worn trope that reducing carbon emissions will have a negative impact on the economy.\The need for investment is self-evident. According to the federal Bureau of Transportation, only 72 percent of Washington highways were in acceptable condition as of 2019; and according to the Washington State Department of Transportation, deferred repairs costing $14.8 billion over the next decade will be required to sustain “minimally acceptable condition” for the state's infrastructure.\While President Joe Biden's proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure investment over the next 10 years has received much attention, the plan before the Legislature is a reminder that all politics is local. Investment here will put people to work in our state on projects that will directly benefit Washington residents and businesses.\More than $5 billion for the construction plan would come from a carbon pricing bill that already has passed the Senate; it would reduce emissions while investing in cleaner transportation. Additional funding would come from a gas-tax increase of 9.8 cents per gallon, fee increases and new debt.\Any proposed increase to the state gas tax, which already is the fourth-highest in the nation, understandably will grab the attention of voters. Nobody likes paying higher taxes.\But the primary argument in favor of a gas-tax increase is that it is a user fee; unlike many other taxes, revenue directly benefits those who pay the tax — people using the roads. If we can agree that roads and bridges are a wise investment, it makes sense for the people and businesses who use them to pay for the bulk of that investment.\Regarding infrastructure and climate initiatives, Washington is at a crossroads. Lawmakers should invest in the future, focusing on the long-term"
180,"It's Republican vs. Republican in an Idaho political showdown: House GOP leaders say they'll adjourn for the session on Wednesday without passing GOP Gov. Butch Otter's transportation plan, likely forcing the GOP-dominated Senate to force the House back into session against its will.\""We can adjourn for three days, and then they would have to call us back,"" said House Majority Caucus Chairman Ken Roberts, R-Donnelly.\The governor's office had no immediate comment; press secretary Jon Hanian pointed to the veto letter Otter sent lawmakers last week in which he wrote, ""I am not going to let this session end until this legitimate and proper role of government is addressed in the manner it deserves.""\Senate Majority Leader Bart Davis, R-Idaho Falls, called Monday's developments ""bizarre.""\The Idaho Constitution states, ""Neither house shall, without the concurrence of the other, adjourn for more than three days."" Lawmakers on Monday were in the 106th day of this year's legislative session - the state's second-longest session ever.\Rep. Bill Killen, D-Boise, the House minority caucus chairman, said, ""We certainly want to get the job done. I'm not sure leaving on Wednesday is a good idea, since my sense is the Senate will call us back. I think there's some work we could do. ... I do think it's a little bit of a power struggle, that's my sense - some pretty big egos involved. I just hope the Senate hangs in there.""\Otter met with both House and Senate GOP leaders at day's end, and sent a clear message that he wants transportation funding increased - to the tune of $75 million to $80 million a year - before this year's legislative session ends. Monday morning, Otter sent a letter to every lawmaker highlighting other issues on which he and the Legislature have worked successfully this year, and thanking them. House Republican leaders interpreted the letter as a sign that Otter had given in on transportation funding, but the governor's office said it was nothing of the sort.\The House has voted six times this year against raising the gas tax, a key piece of Otter's plan to boost the state's lagging road maintenance.\Also on Monday, at a hastily convened Ways and Means Committee meeting, House GOP leaders pushed through, on a 4-3 party-line vote, a new version of legislation making several changes in public school funding, including retroactively ending an early teacher retirement program. Legislation to phase out that program passed the House, but the Senate amended it out of the bill, in what was hailed as a compromise with educators.\State Rep. Bob Nonini, R-Coeur d'Alene, sponsored the new bill, saying he wanted to keep public school money going to the classroom in tight budget times. But Davis, the Senate majority leader, said, ""I don't know what they're up to.""\This morning, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee is meeting to restore the funding for the early teacher retirement program, based on passage of the earlier bill.\Roberts said in his view, some progress was made Monday. ""I think we clearly defined our positions today, and that needed to happen,"" he said. House GOP leadership is opposing any gas tax hike this year, he said. ""We're in this economic environment where everybody's hurting.""\Roberts said House leaders told Otter they'd back removal of the ethanol exemption from the gas tax, and increasing some Department of Motor Vehicle fees, which together raise less than $30 million a year for roads. ""I asked him specifically if that was enough, and he said no,"" Roberts said.\House Assistant Majority Leader Scott Bedke, R-Oakley, said, ""We can be done - there's no business that should keep us here past Wednesday.""\The House GOP leaders said if the Senate won't send them key budget bills, they'll convene the House half of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee and introduce new versions, pass them and send them to the Senate.\""If the Senate or governor want to call us back, that will be something that they will have to answer to the citizens of Idaho for, as to why they want us to come back,"" Roberts declared.\Betsy Z.

181,"OLYMPIA - Lawmakers this weekend passed two major climate change bills that would put caps on carbon emissions from large polluters and push fuel companies to make cleaner products - two proposals long soughtby Gov. Jay Inslee and Democrats.\The cap-and-trade and low carbon fuel standard proposals passed in both chambers after big changes, including tying them to a 5-cent gas tax increase to help fund a transportation package.\""We're the home of 21st century climate action,"" cap-and-trade sponsor Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, said on the floor Saturday.\Both proposals were pushed through in the final days of the session. Supporters say they're long overdue to address climate change.\""We finally have meaningful climate legislation that reflects the values and priorities of Washingtonians, and that respects the science of climate change,"" Inslee said in prepared remarks.\A cap-and-trade program in Washington would set a cap on carbon pollution and greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2023. The largest polluters in the state would need to either clean up their work to meet the cap or purchase allowances from the state.\The state would then receive the revenue generated from those allowances, which it would use to improve the environment and invest in programs to help those disproportionately affected by climate change, including people of color, tribal communities and low-income earners.\Washington would be only the second state, behind California, to have such a plan.\In a statement, Fawn Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians and vice president of the Quinault Indian Nation, said the Legislature ""boldly confronted"" the existential threat of climate change.\""Our collective spirit soars for the ancestors whose example we have finally heeded, and for our youth and children who deserve to live in this beautiful and blessed land the way the Creator intended it,"" she said.\Opponents argued the plan would hurt businesses, which could mean higher costs for fuel, electricity or food. During the debate, Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, said the bill is ""deeply regressive"" with high gas tax increases.\Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, said the bill will drive businesses and families from the state who can't afford to stay.\""What are my grandchildren going to do? Because their best opportunity will be to get the heck out of Washington,"" he said.\A similar climate bill, the clean fuels standard, passed the Legislature on Sunday. It aims to use progressively cleaner transportation fuels in the state, including those used in cars, trucks, boats, trains and aircraft.\Beginning in 2023, polluters must start reducing their emissions a little bit each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20% below 2017 levels by 2038.\Fuel companies can either clean up their fuels by producing biofuels or mixed fuels. If they can't, they would be required to purchase ""credits"" to make up for emissions that go above the allowed amount.\During the floor debate, Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, said the bill lays the foundation for ""a safer climate for every single person in the state.""\""This bill is not the silver bullet,"" he said. ""No bill will be.""\For residents at the pump, that could mean more fuel options to choose from, said Leah Missik, Washington transportation policy manager at Climate Solutions, a Seattle-based nonprofit. Aside from regular and diesel, there may also be a more mixed, cleaner option.\Oregon, California and British Columbia all have similar clean fuels standard systems.\Opponents of the bill, however, say it will raise prices for people buying gas in Washington. And with cap-and-trade as well as the proposed 5-cent tax increase, it could mean too much for working families, Republicans said.\Rep. Mary Dye, R-Pomeroy, called the bill ""a trifecta of taxes"" that is bad for middle class families in the state.\Both climate proposals are now tied to at least a 5-cent gas tax increase, meaning they cannot go into effect as scheduled unless the Legislature passes a transportation revenue package that includes one. Lawmakers have said a new transportation revenue package is needed to pay for more roads, highways and infrastructure investments across the state.\Without one, the transportation budget that passed Saturday only ""keeps the lights on,"" as Sen. Steve Hobbs, D-Lake Stevens, has said.\Democrats want to tie new investments in transportation to climate policies, so the state is investing in new infrastructure while simultaneously cleaning the air.\A transportation package did not pass this session, but lawmakers have indicated they want to continue working throughout the interim. If a deal is reached before January, they may call themselves back into special session to pass one.\Missik said both the clean fuels standard and cap-and-trade proposals are complementary of each other in how they both look to reduce emissions, but they can also stand alone.\The bills now head to Inslee's desk where he will almost certainly sign.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"
182,"
OLYMPIA - The state Transportation Commission should launch a campaign to educate the public and win their trust following Referendum 51's dismal failure, Transportation Secretary Doug MacDonald says.
\
Most state leaders had pinned their hopes for improving transportation on R-51's 10-year, $7.7 billion plan, financed with a 9-cent-per-gallon gas-tax increase. But voters overwhelmingly shot it down.
\
On Thursday, MacDonald presented his plan for moving forward in what he called the ""after-the-referendum"" world.
\
It's a bleak world for the state Department of Transportation. About 600 DOT workers will be laid off by the end of 2005 because of R-51's failure, 50 of them before this Christmas.
\
And Transportation Commission Chairman Aubrey Davis noted that for every DOT job lost, 10 private-sector jobs will be eliminated because the state won't have new projects for contractors.
\
""It hasn't been a good week at the Department of Transportation,"" MacDonald said.
\
MacDonald's plan wasn't a strategy for replacing the money in R- 51, nor was it a plan for reprioritizing transportation spending. It was more like a plan for coming up with a new plan - a strategy for how the department should talk about transportation spending and listen to the public.
\
""It's time to put the whole deal on the table and show people what it's really all about,"" MacDonald said.
\
""The lack of public trust... is why the plan failed,"" he said of R-51.
\
MacDonald focused on two main points: accountability and showing people how all transportation funds get spent in this state.
\
He praised the department's current efforts at accountability, including road project ""report cards"" that people can see on the agency's web site, http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/.
\
Part of the problem with R-51, he said, is that it focused on the 9-cent gas- tax increase and what it would buy the state.
\
Voters wanted to see the whole picture of total transportation spending in the state, MacDonald says - and he wants to show it to them.
\
""We don't want to be in people's faces (saying), 'You didn't get it.' That is not the right response to how dramatically we were punched out.""
\
But the department needs to address the public's perception that there's plenty of transportation money to meet state needs if only the government would spend it better, says MacDonald.
\
That's simply not the case, he said - and he welcomes performance audits to prove it.
\
MacDonald's presentation, which is also available online, presented three very different funding options for transportation, ranging from a gas-tax increase of one penny to one of 12 cents.
\
He's dubbed them the blue-plate special, the family meal and the full course surf 'n turf.
\
One thing is sure, MacDonald said: ""There's no free dinner.""
\
Tolls and more projects such as the new Tacoma Narrows Bridge, a public-private partnership construction that will be financed in part with tolls, will be part of the state's transportation future, he said.
\
Transportation commissioners said they liked MacDonald's approach, but want to make sure the public knows they're going to do things differently.
\
Chris Marr, a commissioner from Spokane, made a pitch for dramatically scaling back expectations. He said some of MacDonald's taxation options wouldn't pass the ""smell test.""
\
""The world changed on November 5th,"" he said. ""We're in a fourth down situation.""
\
Connie Niva, commissioner from Snohomish County, said the Transportation Department needs to get tougher on spending.
\
""We have to take a hard look at the difference between what it necessary and what is nice,"" she said. Programs that advocate for bike trails, transit or freight mobility might be more nice than necessary in the current environment.
\
Elmira Forner, a commissioner from Chelan County, said she was struck by voters' willingness to support local taxes for local projects while rejecting statewide measures.
\
""There is a great distrust for people to send their money to the black hole of state government,"" she said. ""It tells me that somehow we have to reach the voters through the local level.""
\
MacDonald said the next step now is finding out what kind of transportation plan the public wants. He will be meeting with groups like the Association of Washington Business, Rotary and newspaper editorial boards, collecting public opinion to form a more substantial transportation menu to present to the Legislature.

My favorite is the person that has suspended my Social Security number. Now if we could just do something about spam.\Craig Brown\Vancouver\Jeers for Herrera Beutler\Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, who blindly votes party lines, failed to see the consequences of her vote not to condemn President Donald Trump's racist remarks toward Reps. Tlaib, Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Pressley. Although three of these congresswomen were born in America and all four are U.S. citizens, Trump told them to “go back home.” By condoning the president's racism as appropriate, it seems appropriate that Herrera Beutler, with her Hispanic background, would also need to “go back home.” By desperately trying to provide cover for a racist, Herrera Beutler basically voted to send herself back.\Don Howard\Camas\What happened to our city?\Today I traveled from my home in Hazel Dell down I-5 to the Fort Vancouver VA, to SR-14, to Chkalov and Mill Plain, and back home — and what a trip.\It all began at the corner of Highway 99 and 78th Street, where four vehicles decided that the red light meant nothing to them and went through it without even a pause. From I-5 to the Fourth Plain exit was trash, whole blocks covered with it. The shoulders of the road were covered with trash mile after mile, slacking off just a little at Ellsworth Road. After conducting my business in the area, I traveled west on Mill Plain where again were cars running red lights both at Chkalov and the light at the Mill Plain overpass over I-205. I headed north on I-205 and found more trash, especially on the east shoulder of the highway. From the Padden Parkway exit off I-205 I was assailed with the loud exhaust of a souped-up car (radio blasting as well), and a motorcycle with a rider that made sure he made as much noise as possible.\I just don't get it. What has happened to our city, and how do we stop it?\Leonard Mills\Vancouver\Trump rhetoric inflicts carnage\After three years of spewing divisive rhetoric, President Donald Trump finally issued a statement condemning the same hateful speech he has championed. Yet he takes no responsibility for his own contributions to our toxic political environment.\After all, wasn't it President Trump who called Mexican migrants criminals, drug dealers, and rapists? Wasn't it President Trump who said there were some “very fine people” carrying torches and chanting “the Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville, Va.? Wasn't it President Trump who questioned whether President Obama was an American citizen?\Of course it was. Can we believe he is now sincere, or is he simply attempting to distance himself from the carnage that his bigotry has helped inflict?\George Curtin\Camas\We are better than this\Really? Israel is barring duly elected members of Congress, American citizens, from visiting their country (“Israel bars two U.S. congresswomen with a nudge from Trump,” Aug. 16, Associated Press)? Maybe we should rethink the billions in aid we provide to them. Israel should be ashamed of bowing to Trump's political pressure.\God bless these United States, already great, and which will get greater once Trump is out of office and indicted for the corruption, dirty dealings, paying off hookers, and bad-mouthing women of color, American citizens, war vets (John McCain comes to mind) and others who don't agree with his racial rants.\We are better than this.\Lou Russo\Vancouver\Let the light shine through\Our country looks very dark after the recent tragedies of innocent lives being taken away. No matter how gloomy things may appear, a light will shine through in this darkness. This light will overpower this darkness. It will never be put out or be totally absorbed. The radiance of this light will shine through on Election Day in November 2020.\Dian Stack\Vancouver\Immigration reform is needed\I would like to apologize for my terrible grammar, coming from poverty since I was little, and still struggling now with my family makes it difficult to go back to school. My reason for writing is about this idea that Trump is considering reducing to zero the number of refugees that will enter the USA next year. I want this country to continue being the beacon of light, and give families the chance mine had. It hurts to see children being separated at the border with such coldness and no dignity. It hurts to say it, but this president with all my respect doesn't represent my family and state.\I want a better solution. I would love to see a immigration policy reform, residents that are not criminals given a chance, and families kept together.\Claudia Franson\Vancouver\Make visitors pay their share\Regarding the suggested mileage tax instead of the gas tax: how does the suggested mileage tax collect money from all of the out-of-state drivers and truckers who currently pay the gas tax each time they fill their gas/diesel fuel tanks? There are a lot of these drivers in the state on a daily basis. If the gas tax is abolished in favor of the mileage tax, there will be a lot of money no longer coming in for road maintenance from these drivers. The out-of-state drivers and truckers will be happy because they have less to pay for their fuel for each visit to a Washington gas station.\Arlene"

YAKIMA HERALD-REPUBLIC
\
The leading Republican and Democratic gubernatorial candidates made quiet campaign swings through Yakima on Wednesday, and in separate interviews seemed to agree on more issues that might normally separate opponents in the contest for the state's highest elected position.
\
Rob McKenna gave interviews at local radio stations while Jay Inslee spoke to supporters at Sarg Hubbard Park. Both were also scheduled to speak before a conference of fire chiefs.
\
In interviews with the Yakima Herald-Republic, the candidates did little to distinguish themselves from each other, save for McKenna's recent position that voters will likely have to consider a gas-tax package just to keep the state's roads and bridges functional, much less to create new projects.
\
Inslee, for his part, stayed uncommitted on the roads-tax question.
\
The former congressman also declined to amp up the race by commenting on an Associated Press report that McKenna's King County Council office inappropriately had kept files of hundreds of private, political-related documents alongside public documents. In one example, the AP found the county office had used official letterhead for a 2002 political invitation to the U.S. secretary of the interior.
\
McKenna was a King County councilman before voters elected him attorney general in 2003.
\
He told the Herald-Republic on Wednesday that the political-records issue was blown out of proportion. He said he believes someone on his staff got the political documents mixed while doing work from home and brought them into the office by accident.
\
""The (Associated Press) tends to dramatize,"" McKenna said.
\
Both candidates touched on water, agreeing on the need for conservation.
\
On the Department of Ecology's recent decision to require mitigation in Yakima County before processing decades-old water rights applications, McKenna said there should be more options. He said the state should support increased water storage and conservation in the Valley.
\
""The good news is Ecology wants to move forward,"" McKenna said.
\
Meanwhile, Inslee spoke of his work on water conservation as a former Selah resident and congressman from the 4th congressional District in the 1990s. He was greeted by a friendly crowd of about 45 people, including active local Democrats Tony Sandoval, George Fearing and Aaron Case.
\
Inslee helped pass the Yakima River Enhancement Act in 1994, which authorized the federal government to appropriate money for system upgrades to improve efficiency in area irrigation districts.
\
""We need leaders to understand how critical (water) is to the economy of this region and the environment of this region,"" Inslee said. ""Having lived for almost two decades here, I've got that deep understanding in my heart.""
\
But on the topic of improving the state's transportation infrastructure that, among other things, moves the Valley's enormous volume of agricultural products to market, Inslee wouldn't state a preferred method of finding the billions of dollars officials estimate are needed to improve roads.
\
""We realize we're going to have to make very substantial investments on some mega-projects,"" Inslee said. ""We have to consider our economic conditions as to when and how to invest in that.""
\
On the topic of immigration reform and agricultural labor, both candidates, again, generally agreed the federal government could do more to help farmers recruit abroad for foreign workers who come here legally.
\
""It's hurting not just the agricultural workers, but those in the larger community,"" Inslee said, using shopkeepers and grocery store owners as examples.
\
McKenna said the public also needs to learn more about the nuances of providing labor for one of the state's largest industries. ""People looking at the issue casually underestimate the skills required for field workers,"" McKenna said.
\
McKenna said his support of proving legal residency to obtain a driver's license is consistent with the positions of top Democrats such as Gov. Chris Gregoire and legislative leaders. Inslee has yet to commit on whether the requirements should be changed, telling the Associated Press he preferred finding a ""bipartisan consensus.""
\
Both candidates support allowing illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition at state universities.
\
The biggest distinction between the candidates is gay marriage. Inslee supports marriage for couples regardless of sexual orientation.
\
McKenna, who previously said his opposition to gay marriage was no different than President Barack Obama's, was asked if his stance on the issue had evolved.
\
""My (opposition) is consistent,"" McKenna said. ""Because it's based in faith, it could never change.""
\
He then clarified that he was only speaking about his own religious beliefs, and understands how others of religious faith can draw different conclusions on the issue.
\
""I'm not a theologian.""

Reject county charter
\
If you dont like the administrative actions of Clark County Commissioners David Madore and Tom Mielke, and would like to petulantly lash out at them, not caring about the repercussions such lashing out would have on the future of Clark County, not caring about the loss of representation we citizens enjoy under the current county governmental system, then the proposed county charter is the thing for you. The proposed charter is very obviously a childish retaliation against the commissioners and should be rejected.

Re-evaluate current governing
\
The anti-charter people are quick to ask whats wrong or to say the current county structure is working just fine. Well just for fun, lets flip the formula. If the current model was on the ballot as a proposed charter, would you vote for this?A board of three commissioners:1. Has both legislative and executive authority.2. Has the power to set their own salaries.3. Currently paid $106,000 per year plus benefits package worth thousands of dollars more per year.4. Only two votes required for any action.5. All three elected countywide in the general election so urban/Vancouver voters can sway the vote for all three positions.6. Citizens have no power of initiative or referendum.

Dingethal is the one to elect
\
I want a congressman like Bob Dingethal. He is not taking campaign money from the Koch brothers, Karl Rove or special interests. He has created hundreds of jobs in the telecommunications industry in Southwest Washington and led a nonprofit organization to restore our forests and parks. A vote for Dingethal is a vote for our environment. Dingethal will bring back town hall meetings and listen to the people. He wants to improve education and create more jobs. Dingethal has the values and experience to represent Clark County as our 3rd Congressional District representative.

Much ado about fireworks, et al
\
Again, there are complaints about fireworks on July 4. Where do these people live? We hear some fireworks on July 3 and July 5, after which there are no more shot off. The Fourth of July holiday has many fireworks going off. We keep our pets inside that evening, and they do fine.There are more complaints about coal and oil trains. I have seen both coal and oil trains pass through Vancouver every day. Find something else to gripe about, folks.Lastly, I have to admit, President Barack Obama is well-versed in keeping people confused and off-kilter. He has sounded off about climate change, illegal immigrants and immigration reform, and numerous other topics while making sure our enemies know what our strategy is in dealing with them. Mr. President, why not just fax a copy of your action plan to the Islamic State and save time?

Charge ahead with alternatives
\
National Public Radio reported that people dont act on global warming because the problem is too overwhelming. On Washingtons 2035 transportation plan, here are some thoughts:1. Recognize and plan for reduction in use of vehicles by todays youth.2. Improve walkability in urban areas to benefit young and old; promote electric-powered mass transit; reduce road widths in urban areas; promote mixed-use zoning in public transit locales.3. Revise road funding; reduce gas tax, but retain it as a negative incentive for use of hydrocarbon-powered vehicles; use annual mileage as the primary means for funding road maintenance and improvements.4. Significantly increase availability of rapid-charge electric vehicle power sources.5. Create incentives for use of EVs, such as reduced parking rates; exemption from metered parking fees; allow single-occupant EV use of HOV lanes.6. Promote high-speed rail between interstate principalities.7. Work to establish commonality of high-capacity charging outlets so that a uniform adapter will work for all EVs along the West Coast Electric Highway.

Are we ashamed to register guns?
\
Do churches have any influence with gun violence? Could churches have power if they worked together?Those whove died by gun violence children, dads, moms, clergy, cops, judges, teens as well as favorite pets are all lying on the sanctuary floors, in death, in front of the altars while we are sitting in the pews reciting our liturgies and praying for peace, or at least speaking words that sound like we pray.Thousands of these people, including the shooters, had attended worship communities. Theyd come forward to be dedicated to Gods love and then their bodies were brought back to be buried. Those people will never have a chance to experience their constitutional right to bear arms. What would be the best reason for a gun to be manufactured? When we have settled on a reason for a gun, then we should be honored and proud to register the arms that we have a right to bear just as we register our boats, motorcycles, and cars. Or are we ashamed to register our guns?Preachers, preach the Gospel. We church people claim we should live the Gospel life. We are expected to follow Jesus or the Holy One. Would that be only for a walk in the park?

\
COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE
\
BILLS: One called for election of Columbia River Gorge Commission members. One would have granted either a single building permit or compensation to pre-1987 owners of Gorge property. One asked Congress for a review of the workings of the National Scenic Act.
\
HOW THEY FARED: All died, but the state's 1997-1999 operating budget cuts contribution to the Gorge Commission from $600,000 to $275,000 plus $160,000 to Skamania and Clark Counties to help implement commission's plan for the area. Oregon Legislature expected to approve same amounts.
\
ALLIES AND ENEMIES: Commission staff, Gov. Locke and Friends of the Gorge opposed cuts, saying the commission oversight critical to protecting the area. Skamania County officials backed the change, saying the commission is heavy-handed and duplicates their own planners' efforts.
\
THE DELEGATION: Benton, Boldt were prime movers, joined by Zarelli, Dunn, Pennington and Mielke. Cuts opposed by Bauer, Ogden and Carlson.
\
VEHICLE EMISSIONS TESTING
\
BILL: HB1354 would have halted vehicle emissions testing in four ZIP code areas of north Clark County pending further study of air pollution problem. Also would have required unbiased technical review of plans to extend testing, among other things.
\
HOW IT FARED: Passed House, died in Senate Agriculture and Environment Committee.
\
ALLIES AND ENEMIES: Pennington introduced bill in response to complaints from citizens, with support from the Clark-Cowlitz Farm Bureau. Opponents included business groups and Southwest Washington Air Pollution Control Authority, both of which saw north county testing as key to earning federal ""clean air community"" status.
\
THE DELEGATION: Pennington, Mielke, Dunn, and Boldt favored. Absent: Carlson and Ogden.
\
SOCIAL ISSUES
\
BILLS: Included parental notification of abortions, partial birth abortion ban, same-sex marriage ban, abstinence education, domestic partner benefits, ban on use of state money for ""sexual minority initiatives,"" ban on school district presenting homosexuality as a positive lifestyle.
\
HOW THEY FARED: All died. Ban on same-sex marriage made it to Locke but he vetoed it. Veto-override efforts failed, as did efforts to by-pass governor by referring to state ballot. Parental notification bills passed House and Senate, then Senate failed to concur with one House amendment and it died.
\
THE DELEGATION: Only a few reached floor of House or Senate. On the same-sex marriage ban, Bauer and Ogden voted no. Carlson voted no once and yes once.
\
On parental notification, Bauer and Ogden voted no, Carlson yes. Other area legislators yes on both.
\
Boldt was prime sponsor of one parental notification bill, the ban on domestic partner benefits for public employees, and the use of state money for ""sexual minority initiatives.""
\
HIGHER EDUCATION
\
FAILED: A bill to make Clark County and Multnomah County, Ore., a free-trade area, in which college students could study across county lines without paying out-of-state tuition. It died because the Oregon Legislature declined to authorize the deal. Bill to put students on the universities' boards of regents also died.
\
WON: Plan to sell future tuition credits at the state's colleges and universities in $30 increments so parents can begin saving for children's college educations.
\
DECIDED: State colleges and universities may raise tuition 4 percent per year for next two years, with higher increases for UW law students and out-of-state students.
\
PRINCIPALS: House Higher Education Chair Carlson was prime sponsor of the bills and a negotiator in working out the tuition rates.
\
WSU at Vancouver
\
BILL: Continuing support of WSU Vancouver campus embodied in state's operating and capital budgets.
\
HOW IT FARED: WSU Vancouver budgeted for the addition of 120 more full-time equivalent students in next two years, bringing total to 971. New campus to get $13.5 million for new utility/maintenance shop, more infrastructure and design of two more classroom buildings.
\
ISSUES: Funding for new students is lower than originally proposed by governor and either House or Senate. WSU scaled back its request after legislators criticized colleges for taking state money this year for more students than they enrolled.
\
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
\
BILL: HB2170 provides for certain industrial investments to be deemed ""projects of statewide significance,"" thereby making them eligible for help from a state ombudsman and state agencies dealing with transportation, education and permitting.
\
HOW IT FARED: Passed both houses, delivered to governor for signature.
\
ALLIES AND ENEMIES: Main boosters were Columbia River Economic Development Council and Clark County business executives, who had projects such as WaferTech in mind. No opposition.
\
DELEGATION: All supported. Prime sponsors: Pennington, Bauer, Sen. Ray Schow, R-Federal Way.
\
TRANSPORTATION
\
BILL: A bill to raise gas tax as much as 9 cents per gallon died, even though it would have funded all the road projects on everyone's wish list. Final $3.2 billion no-new-taxes budget was termed ""bare bones.""
\
WHAT IT MEANS: Completion of projects already under way. $100 million for new construction starts statewide, including the likely start of construction next year on Southeast 192nd Avenue interchange with state Highway 14. No guarantees of more money for Mill Plain Extension or Northeast 134th Street-Interstate 5 interchange.
\
ALLIES AND ENEMIES: Contractors, construction trades unions, many business interests and local governments wanted the new gas-tax money. It just didn't play with those who had promised no new taxes and figured $3.2 billion was enough.
\
THE DELEGATION: Bauer, Ogden, and Carlson supported gas-tax increase, although no vote taken. Benton, Zarelli, Dunn, Boldt and Mielke, opposed it. Pennington remained neutral and never had to vote.
\
GROWTH MANAGEMENT
\
BILL: SB6094 incorporated at least seven bills on growth management, including easing restrictions on development in rural areas. Bill would make it harder for Growth Management hearings boards to rule county plans invalid, as happened to Clark County.
\
HOW IT FARED: Passed House 62-36 and Senate 30-18 on last night of the session.
\
ALLIES AND ENEMIES: Environmentalists resisted major changes in law, while builders and rural property owners generally supported them, with many between the two extremes.
\
THE DELEGATION: All nine Clark County legislators favored.
\
DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT
\
FAILED: One would have let all cities impose a 2 percent hotel/motel tax to help finance special events center, in addition to the 2 percent they now receive as credit against sales tax. It died in a Senate committee.
\
PASSED: A measure to let cities approve property tax exemptions for construction or renovation of multifamily housing in urban centers, as requested by some Vancouver business interests. The bill, by Ogden, became part of the growth management bill.

In 20 years, a larger economy and a larger population figure to put an even bigger strain on Washingtons highways, roads and rails.
\
An ongoing update to a statewide transportation plan aims to help answer the question: How will the states already-aging infrastructure keep up? The Washington Transportation Plan 2035, now the subject of public review, is the latest version of the states long-term vision.
\
This document that is going out for public comment is going to be the blueprint for how we look at transportation in the state of Washington for the next 20 years, said state transportation commission member Roy Jennings.
\
The Washington State Transportation Commission will host an open house on the 2035 plan Monday in Vancouver, part of a series of outreach events planned for this month. The agency is asking for public comments to be submitted by Sept. 25.
\
The statewide plan isnt designed to outline specific projects for any particular region. Rather, the document is created as a 30,000-foot vision with guiding policies and recommendations, said Paul Parker, deputy director of the transportation commission. Suggested actions fall under one of six categories: economic vitality, preservation, safety, mobility, environment and stewardship.
\
Parker admits that that kind of high-level, long-range policy doesnt resonate strongly with a lot of people. But the conversation now will affect everyone, including many Washington residents currently not old enough to drive, he said.
\
Were really talking about the transportation system for that generation coming up, Parker said.
\
For example: Public transportation may bear a greater load in the future as more people gravitate to urban centers, older drivers give up their keys and other demographic changes take shape, Parker said. The state will have to be ready, he said.
\
Another major question is funding. While overall gas tax revenues are expected to continue rising in the next two decades, transportation officials have said they wont keep up with the states needs. Fuel taxes are the largest single source of state transportation funding.
\
Washington and other states have recently explored the idea of a road usage charge, commonly referred to as a mileage tax essentially making people pay based on how far they drive, not how much gas they use.
\
The Washington Transportation Plan 2035 recommends continuing to look at a road usage charge and other possible funding sources. Washington could roll out a pilot program in the coming years, Jennings said.
\
If the fuel tax cant adequately support Washingtons transportation system in the future, Jennings said, youve got to come up with something else.
\
Also included in Mondays open house will be regional transportation plans currently being crafted by the Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council. Those efforts are more specific to Clark County, and include current and future project lists.
\
The statewide Washington Transportation Plan is required to be updated every four years. The 2035 version will be adopted by the transportation commission in December, then submitted to the governor and state Legislature in January 2015.

Federal money for projects to benefit ports and the shipping industry will get increased scrutiny from Congress in the post- Hurricane Katrina environment, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray warned at a gathering of port and waterway officials Thursday in Vancouver.
\
Murray, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, told the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association that funding for the Columbia River dredging project is included in both the House and Senate bills funding the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
\
But she added, ""The landscape in Washington, D.C., has changed dramatically because of two things: the budget and Hurricane Katrina.""
\
The federal budget deficit, which according to the Congressional Budget Office reached $317 billion for fiscal 2005, ""is really beginning to sink in in D.C.,"" Murray said. ""Every nondefense program is now competing for a slice of the pie that keeps shrinking.""
\
At the same time, she said, ""It is clear now that the Gulf Coast is going to need our help for many years to come.""
\
Because the corps will play a central role in the rebuilding of coastal Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region, its budget will get extra scrutiny, she said.
\
""Priorities are shifting to flood control and keeping new channels open,"" Murray said. ""Projects that don't meet the corps' core traditional mission,"" such as those aimed primarily at economic development, may face tough sledding, she said. ""You need to acknowledge that changed environment.""
\
Murray , who is serving her third Senate term, vowed to fight to retain money in the transportation spending bill for key Northwest projects.
\
She said she's especially concerned about protecting $17 million for repair of a rapidly eroding jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Wave action from an unusually large number of severe storms has accelerated erosion of the north and south jetties in recent years. Corps engineers have warned that if the jetties aren't repaired in the next two years, they could breach during a large storm. Millions of cubic yards of sand would be deposited directly into the navigational channel, shutting down shipping.
\
The corps began a two-year restoration project on the North Jetty last year, but the Bush administration did not include money for the second year in his 2006 budget. Murray added the $17 million to complete the repairs to a Senate energy and water spending bill, but no money for the project was included in the companion House measure.
\
""I see the federal government making some decisions that are not very bright,"" Murray said. ""Making the (Columbia River) channel deeper but ignoring the jetties makes no sense. Our investment in channel deepening will be lost if one of those jetties fails and the mouth of the Columbia River is closed.""
\
In response to a question, Murray said there's virtually no chance the Senate will take up a rewrite of the Endangered Species Act this year because it still faces the task of passing eight federal appropriations bills and considering a U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Miers.
\
The House passed a bill in late September that would require the government to compensate property owners who lose value if habitat for threatened species is protected on their land.
\
Without actually mentioning Initiative 912 , Murray also urged defeat of the gas tax repeal measure on Washington's Nov. 8 ballot.
\
""Will we invest in our infrastructure or will we fail?"" she asked. ""I hope that in Washington state we have the courage to make the right choice.""
"

OLYMPIA -- Lawmakers convene Monday in a special session, finding 105 days insufficient to finish the people's business.
\
The overtime session could last up to 30 days as legislators debate the 2003-05 budget and take up several other issues, such as unemployment insurance, workers' compensation and water rights.
\
Or, the session could take a matter of days if lawmakers quit Olympia after quickly agreeing on a budget. ""I can't imagine people hanging around long after that,"" said Rep. Jim Moeller, D- Vancouver.
\
Here are brief looks at what Clark County's 12 legislators did during the recently concluded regular session.
\
49th District
\
* Sen. Don Carlson, R-Hazel Dell, left his mark on the session as chairman of the Senate Higher Education Committee.
\
The legislature passed Carlson-sponsored bills that will allow colleges to set tuition for graduate and nonresident students and make permanent a tuition-reciprocity program between Washington and Oregon.
\
College officials opposed his proposal to tag ""career"" students with a tuition surcharge to prod them toward graduation. The House softened the bill to make a surcharge optional for schools.
\
He championed opening state colleges to illegal immigrants who grew up in the state and graduated from Washington high schools.
\
Departing from Senate Republican leaders, Carlson indicated support for a sales tax increase. He also pushed to make school levies passable by a simple majority, a move blocked by GOP leadership.
\
The only Clark County senator to support a gas tax increase, Carlson noted that favoring transportation improvements while opposing a funding plan would be inconsistent.
\
* Rep. Bill Fromhold, D-Vancouver, will help negotiate the operating budget as vice chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Before the session, he touted a temporary increase in the sales tax to fill half of the budget deficit. The idea appears dead as lawmakers embrace spending cuts.
\
Fromhold led a successful effort to give WaferTech and other semiconductor manufacturers tax breaks. The bill differs from previous corporate tax exemptions: Tax cuts for industry won't start until at least one company commits to a $1 billion investment, and companies must maintain employment levels or lose benefits.
\
Fromhold worked on a bill to curb the worst abuses of state's retire-rehire law.
\
He also introduced a bill to protect Clark Public Utilities' repair service from court challenge. The bill passed a House committee but taking the measure farther would have been useless because of inaction in the Senate.
\
* Rep. Jim Moeller, D-Vancouver, introduced bills to make gun owners responsible for keeping loaded firearms away from children, let county health districts ban smoking in restaurants and force initiative writers to budget for their proposals.
\
None of those measures went far. But six bills introduced by Moeller reached Gov. Gary Locke's desk.
\
One bill will require colleges to inform new students about meningococcal disease. Another bill will let retired judges substitute on the bench and decline compensation.
\
His bill to let Vancouver elect council members through instant runoff voting passed the House. It didn't have a chance in the Senate.
\
Moeller co-sponsored a prewar resolution against attacking Iraq. During the session, Moeller wore a ""No War!"" button, prompting a senator to ask in a committee hearing, ""Do you support our troops?""
\
""I certainly do,"" Moeller answered. ""And I would like to see them come home soon.""
\
17th District
\
* Sen. Don Benton, R-Vancouver, got under other lawmakers' skin over his opposition to car-pool lanes and Puget Sound light rail, his support for President Bush's tax cuts and his proposal to establish a ""Tax-Me-More Account"" for citizens feeling ""undertaxed.""
\
He defended Sen. Pam Roach, R-Sumner. A bipartisan panel of senators concluded that Roach created a ""hostile work environment"" by attempting to retaliate against an aide who complained about her. Benton told The Seattle Times that the Senate's reprimand of Roach created a ""Gestapo-type atmosphere.""
\
Insurance Commission Mike Kreidler called a news conference to blast and thwart a Benton bill that would have let insurance companies raise premiums by up to 10 percent without state review into whether the rates were excessive.
\
Benton dropped a bill late in the session to kill the downtown Vancouver hotel-conference center project. Another Republican senator considered the timing and asked whether the bill was an April Fools' Day joke. It didn't pass.
\
The former lead Republican on the Highways and Transportation Committee, Benton proposed a grab bag of transportation reforms. But he wasn't at the forefront of the issue. Republican Sens. Jim Horn, Dan Swecker and Bill Finkbeiner negotiated a plan with Democrats.
\
Benton sponsored a bill that will allow Hockinson families to appeal to the state Board of Education a local boundary decision that keeps them in the Battle Ground School District against their wishes.
\
He also introduced a bill that will allow state colleges to waive tuition for Korean War veterans.
\
Active in housing and financial fraud legislation, Benton became chairman of the Financial Services, Insurance and Housing Committee.
\
The Senate passed his proposal to let counties tax Oregonians who work in Washington. The bill didn't pass the House.
\
* Rep. Deb Wallace, D-Vancouver, brought to the Legislature experience as a Department of Transportation planner.
\
As a freshman, she established herself on the House Transportation Committee, sponsoring a bill to strengthen legislative oversight of transportation projects.
\
She opposed the 0.2 percent sales tax increase proposed by her party's leaders in the House. She was one of two Democrats who joined Republicans in voting against a scaled-back package of ""sin taxes"" that did pass the House.
\
Wallace sponsored a joint memorial calling on the Bonneville Power Administration to delay raising power rates to give the economy time to improve.
\
* Rep. Marc Boldt, R-Hockinson, introduced legislation to regulate bounty hunters, but it came too late in the session for serious consideration this year.
\
He also introduced bills to prohibit same-sex civil unions and overturn local ordinances barring discrimination based on sexual orientation. The bills didn't receive hearings.
\
Boldt served as the lead Republican on the House Children and Family Services Committee. He introduced a bill calling on the state to reach out to church charities. Different versions of the bill passed the House and Senate, and the chambers couldn't reconcile the differences.
\
One Boldt-introduced bill awaits the governor's signature. The measure requires the Department of Social and Health Services to assess the job skills of WorkFirst participants.
\
18th District
\
* Sen. Joe Zarelli, R-Ridgefield, rebounded from a tough run for Congress to introduce the first bill that Locke signed into law this year. Addressing a state Supreme Court decision, the measure reinstates the rule that lets prosecutors charge murder in cases in which attackers unintentionally kill.
\
Zarelli leads the Senate in writing the capital budget. Other Clark County legislators look to him to obtain support for local projects, such as a $10 million Washington State Patrol lab in Vancouver, an item in neither the governor nor House's proposals.
\
He championed tax cuts for WaferTech and other semiconductor manufacturers in the Senate.
\
Zarelli pushed for greater investment of state pension funds in Washington-based technology companies. The State Investment Board balked at the Legislature dictating investment strategy, and the measure didn't pass the House.
\
* Rep. Tom Mielke, R-Battle Ground, stood alone as the only lawmaker in either chamber to vote against continuing a state task force to help victims of human trafficking. Mielke said he feared the task force will create a separate ""welfare system"" rather get victims back to their home country.
\
He introduced a bill applying only to Clark County that would have made county commissioners elected by district rather than countywide.
\
He also sponsored a bill to make library trustees elected. Neither bill moved. But Locke signed a Mielke-sponsored bill that will allow suspended drivers to apply to have their licenses restored upon turning 21.
\
Another bill allowing unemployed truck drivers to wait until they have a job to take a mandatory physical examination to keep their truck drivers' license awaits the governor's signature.
\
* Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Carrolls, as a member of the House Finance Committee, had an early opportunity to label House Democrats' budrevnue plan fiscally irresponsible and a job killer.
\
His bill eliminating 15 reports to the Legislature from the Department of Social and Health Services passed and went to the governor.
\
He introduced a measure giving counties a share of lottery proceeds, but the bill didn't move.
\
As a member of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, Orcutt advocated for small forest landowners.
\
15th District
\
* Sen. Jim Honeyford, R-Sunnyside, chairs the Senate Commerce and Trade Committee and much of the Republican agenda passed through his panel, including severing the tie between inflation and the minimum wage, and repealing ergonomics rules. Both bills passed the Senate and died in the House.
\
The Senate approved Honeyford's bill requiring workers to file hearing-loss claims within two years of their last exposure to occupational noise. The House didn't approve the measure.
\
Honeyford sponsored a bill that will lift a century-old prohibition against selling alcohol at the University of Washington. The measure will allow an on-campus museum to have liquor at functions.
\
* Rep. Bruce Chandler, R-Granger, made a passionate plea for a bill that will give illegal immigrants who graduated from Washington state high schools access to higher education.
\
He prime-sponsored a resolution calling for a boycott of French wine and water to punish that country for ""unreasonable"" opposition to the U.S. attack on Iraq.
\
He voted in committee against a bill to protect Clark Public Utilities' repair service from court challenge.
\
Chandler leads the House Republicans on water issues.
\
* Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, followed in the footsteps of his father, the late Irv Newhouse, who served in the Legislature for 34 years.
\
A newcomer in the minority, Newhouse managed to sponsor several ""good little bills"" that reached the governor's desk.
\
The governor has signed Newhouse's bill to increase pensions for volunteer firefighters and reserve officers.
\
Other Newhouse bills passed by the Legislature will allow microbrewers to sell beer at farmers' markets and exempt financial- account numbers from public disclosure.

"
190,"
Oct. 19--Editor's note: The Kitsap Sun asked each candidate for the Legislature a series of questions based on issues expected to be at the forefront of the next session. Their answers to those questions are here.
\
James Olsen, R-Bainbridge Island
\
Age: 64
\
Background: Retired Coast Guard captain.
\
Money raised: $2,863.00
\
Drew Hansen, D-Poulsbo
\
Age: 41
\
Background: Attorney, legislator since 2011.
\
Money raised: $147,745.16
\
Q: Why does the philosophy ""fund education first"" work or not work?
\
Hansen: ""The state budget is well over $30 billion. Education, K-12 and higher education is about half. We can fund education first only if we want to make deep slashing cuts in mental health services, the very little we do for families with kids with developmental disabilities, our senior citizens and the other services the state provides. What we should do instead is provide adequate revenue so that we can fund education to our Constitutional obligation and also maintain the other services that rest of the citizens of the state rightfully demand.""
\
Olsen: ""The last session and for the past 30 years the Democratic controlled upper and lower houses have not funded education first. The Washington State Supreme Court has made it 100 percent clear they are in contempt of court because they have not funded education first ever. What the Republicans called for as a (plan) to fund education first, the Democrats didn't want to hear. They want to take care of their social programs first and if something's left over at the end they come around and do what they can for education.""
\
Q: Why is going after tax loopholes a good or bad idea?
\
H: ""There are a few hundred million dollars of tax loopholes in the tax code that do not generate significant jobs or economic returns to the state. For example: A general service industry business pays about 1.5 percent B&O tax on their gross receipt. Travel agents get a special rate much lower than that. This might have been done back in the day when travel agents were mom and pop stores with extremely thin margins just essentially passing on prices from the travel industry. Now, travel agencies tend to be large technology companies, some of them with names like Expedia. It's not totally clear why giving those companies a special tax break is a responsible use of state funds, when we really should be funding all-day kindergarten and paying teachers a decent wage and shrinking class sizes.""
\
O: ""The Democrats' first and foremost goal is to get an income tax. A backdoor way to get income tax, a Democratic talking point, is that they're going to go after the so-called tax loopholes. They are not tax loopholes, they are tax preferences, and as of 2008 there were 597 tax preferences and they were benefiting the taxpayer of the state of Washington to the tune of $100 billion a year. So closing the so-called tax loophole is a backdoor way to jam a new tax into the system. All tax preferences need to be looked at with a sunset law, they need to be analyzed as to what were their goals are. If they're not working they need to be scuttled, not just as a ploy to come up to balance the budget.""
\
Q: The Legislature is in contempt of court on education. The Supreme Court also told the state it can no longer board mental health patients in non-psychiatric hospital beds. The governor is asking the state's universities to do an exercise of cutting 15 percent from the budgets in case hard decisions need to be made. All of this shows the state either A) doesn't have the money to meet all its priorities, or B) doesn't have the courage to make needed cuts to the budget to pay for its top priorities. Do you think the answer is A or B, and why?
\
H: ""I voted for a budget that raised quite a significant amount of money by a combination of closing loopholes and maintaining temporary surcharges on the B&O rates that were imposed during the recession that were set to expire, including a surcharge on my own business that the law firm pays. I've voted for those revenue increases because they were a lot better than the alternative, which is cutting hundreds of millions of dollars out of some other services that the state provides.""
\
O: ""Washington needs to do a stem to stern analysis of their major programs and find out what are their core missions they are supposed to be doing and what is they are actually doing. Perform the core missions and the other stuff falls by the wayside, or the public-private partnerships, or the Sisters of Mercy, Saint Martin de Porres, or somebody else provides some of these services.""
\
Q: How should the state fund transportation improvements in the next Legislature?
\
H: ""I am looking for a transportation budget that maintains (ferry) operational service at current levels, limiting fare increases to about their regular rate, not these giant, double-digit spikes that you could see. Two is the system's most urgent capital need. The wood pilings underneath Colman Dock actually do need to be replaced as a safety need rather than modernization. And third is a stream of new boats so that we don't have to cancel routes when boats go out of service. All three of those priorities could be funded in a transportation budget that combines a gas tax increase with some increases in transportation-related fees across the budget.""
\
O: ""In the past more and more money would be dedicated to Washington state transportation and fewer miles of new roads were built having to do with alleviating that traffic flow. I would support a limited gas tax increase. It should be spent only those projects that help alleviate traffic flow. The Washington State Ferries organization is broken. The labor rates have gone up twice that of inflation. The various union members, and I'm not picking on the unions but the unions are the employees there, have not been showing up at work, trips have been scuttled. Certain elements of the ferry system can be, and probably should be, privatized to allow for competition. We have an aging fleet. Every three years we need to have a new vessel. When the Navy builds its fleet or my fine U.S. Coast Guard, they don't go to a sole bidder. They open it up to national competition. They are built to the standards that we specify at a savings of 30-40 percent.""
\
Q: Should the Legislature find a way to get the state in alignment with No Child Left Behind standards by including statewide test scores in teacher evaluations and why?
\
H: ""The federal government has conditioned our flexibility in using Title I money on a requirement that makes no sense at all. That requirement is to evaluate teachers based on tests that we have not even rolled out in the classroom yet, the Smarter Balanced assessment, based on curriculum, the Common Core, that we are only now starting to roll out statewide. It is fair and appropriate and makes perfect sense for educators to be evaluated on how much students have actually learned in their classes over the course of a semester. What's not appropriate, and is just not a way you treat a professional workforce, is to use these gestalt snapshot tests that we don't even have in the classroom yet.""
\
O: ""I have difficulty with anything being mandated from on high and not being locally controlled. I do, however, believe that teacher evaluations can be cranked into the calculus of how the students are doing and whether or not they get pay increases. Mr. Hansen has received handsome campaign donations from the Washington Education Association. Quite frequently, if not invariably, the Washington Education Association is opposed to significant reform in the bricks and mortar attitude toward education or the evaluation of teachers, teachers' tenure and paying teachers for high performance. The WEA has been opposed, I'm sure, to teacher evaluation and I don't particularly agree with that.""
\
Q: The Legislature has had special sessions in four of the past five years. What can you do to see that the Legislature's business is complete on time?
\
H: ""I think a pragmatic willingness to compromise and realize that every side is not going to get everything they want is important, as well as facing up to the reality that adequately funding our schools from the K-12 system through our community colleges and our research universities is going to require some new revenue.""
\
O: ""Forget the silly bills, the small bills, take care of the major problems, take care of the reform, take care of the budget, take care of education and take care of the most needy within the state. I know lots of gay people and this is not the issue about gays. But spending an entire session because a leader was gay, and he wanted to carry that (gay marriage) on as far as getting passage is a slap in the face of the Washington state citizens. They have to have a disincentive for producing small bills that go nowhere and solve nothing while sweeping the major problems in the Washington State Legislature under the rug.""
\
Q: What are your top three legislative priorities for the 2015 session?
\
H: ""Going forward I'm hoping to keep focusing on jobs. I've been working all summer with a Republican representative from Issaquah, a Microsoft contractor and a Navy veteran, on a statewide bipartisan strategic plan to train more people as computer science professionals. We plan to expand the teaching of computer science in the K-12 system and support educators who want to learn how to teach coding. We want to look at innovative, new ways to train computer science professionals whether through hybrid online/offline competency-based degrees or recognition for credit for prior learning or short-term conversion courses, where people can get the basics of coding.""
\
O: ""The top one is to fund education first. My second priority is take care of the most needy within the state of Washington by finding jobs for them. What we have to do is we have to create a business environment, a regulatory environment that will create an atmosphere for businesses to stay in business. My third priority is Washington state needs to do a long overdue reform, stem to stern, streamlining analysis of the various programs. As a bipartisan I will form a reform coalition of people who really want to get to the bottom of these problems.""

Many memories shared
\
To the editor -- Memories shared were enjoyed by classes of the 1930s and '40s by St. Joseph Academy and Marquette schools, held July 23 at the Convention Center.
\
For many of us it may be our last one, so this reunion was extremely special. It was beautifully planned and done by Chairperson Delores LaCoursiere. Name tags proved the clue to recognizing who was who.
\
Renewed friendships predominated and Auld Lang Syne was never more apparent. It was a fun night and whether we live long enough to enjoy another reunion makes little difference.
\
This one was a added bonus as memories are the legacy of love and friendship shared. Who could ask for anything more?

Gapsody rhapsody
\
To the editor -- Union Gap, you got it right. We attended the first Gapsody July 16-17 and were we surprised. My family came from Castle Rock for a small reunion, and we decided to go. We were so impressed with the talent that was brought in to perform. We had originally planned on just attending Sunday's gospel and country music, but decided to go to both days, after we heard Lenny LaLumiere sing at the Saturday Farmers Market in Union Gap. Now we are bluegrass fans and Jean's Cottage Inn Cheesesteak fans. Thank you, Union Gap, for giving us something very special. A very relaxing weekend of wonderful music and great company, also something very special to look forward to for next year. We will be back.
\
It is so wonderful to think that once again Union Gap will have something to be proud of, and a place to meet our friends, with good clean fun, and enjoy a wonderful celebration; it has been a long time coming.

Thanks, Gapsody crew
\
To the editor -- Union Gap did a very good thing July 16-17. We started something new and positive in our community: Gapsody. As the chairwoman for the Citizens for Union Gap's Future, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the committee members for their amazing hard work and dedication to not only this event but to the city of Union Gap. I would also like to thank the volunteers who helped us in every way possible.
\
We recognize that this community has a lot going for it and events such as this will make a huge impact on its future. At Gapsody, people were treated to, over a two-day period, bluegrass, Cajun, zydeco, Celtic, gospel and country music provided by both new talent and older talent, by big name bluegrass bands and some unbelievable local talent and some great food and great hospitality.
\
In the next year or so, Gapsody, at Fullbright Park, will be the place to be. All of the bands and musicians said that the venue was one of the best they had been to. In addition, they said that they had been to few events that were this well coordinated and organized, all because of our incredible volunteers and committee members' hard work.
\
We would especially like to thank the Lodging Tax Advisory Committee for their support, which allowed this event to happen. Watch for Gapsody next year; it will be the place to be.

Firefighting heroes
\
To the editor -- Our family has grown with the knowledge that firefighters are the last of the heroes. Time and again they answer the call to go out and fight the insurmountable odds to put a fire out. On July 18, they faced the insurmountable odds: To save a house, to keep a fire from spreading to neighbors on each side, dry grass and how to get tankers full of water in and out safely. They did it and did it well.
\
We heard glowing reports about a firefighter named Ross, who took a stand to save the house. Using a chainsaw, she separated the garage from the house. Then she took a stand, determined not to lose the house. She won! No blistered paint, smoke or water damage. Rabby, our bunny, wants to express gratitude because she was 5 feet from where the firefighter took her stand. Meanwhile, backup groups answered the call from the Naches Fire Department, Naches Heights, East Valley and Yakima.
\
We want each and everyone of them to know they have our heartfelt thanks and everlasting gratitude for putting your lives on the line. We thank your families for supporting your decision to fight fires. Our prayers will be with them every time the signal goes off. Our prayers for continued healing go to the firefighter who was overcome by the heat. Thank you from the Hellums family of Naches.

They must resign
\
To the editor -- It is undoubtedly folly to conceive of local government announcing that a budget had been met or some fiscal goal had been achieved through strong management and newfound efficiencies. Instead we are endlessly greeted with the unusable $27 million jail and now a bungled courthouse remodel, which is not only $350,000 or so over budget, but being done in violation of bid laws. Commissioners claim to be out of the loop -- i.e. no adequate communication. Hence the appropriateness of the adage: The inmates are in charge of the asylum.
\
These incidents could probably occur under any governmental arrangement, but why is the commission -- i.e., those elected to be in charge and responsible for decisions -- so isolated and aloof from this process?
\
The only change in recent years is that Yakima County created a job occupied by Doug Cochran. He is the manager's ""manager,"" sort of a front man for the commissioners. This is not a statutorily defined job -- one created without definitive standards of performance or accountability. The result is a squishiness -- an oozy sort of governing dictated by odd decisions and misdirected results, such as the jail and the fourth floor remodel.
\
This county needs a big change at the top -- and a good start would still be the resignation of Gamache, Palacios and Cochran as suggested by the Yakima Herald-Republic editorial of May 8, 2005.

'Miss Daisy' message
\
To the editor -- Re: Ivana Hernandez' letter of July 16. I hope that she (and others) know that the film ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is about a black chauffeur and his elderly white employer. Far from being a symbol of ""Jim Crow America,"" it's actually a powerful story about racial understanding and human friendship.
\
I didn't see the ""Driving Miss Daisy"" skit Ms. Hernandez found offensive, but I suspect it had a ""blackface"" actor because a main character in the original story was black. That's not comparable to the Mexican stamp with a black caricature. The caricature was unnecessary.
\
And in view of the Mexican government's refusal to apologize, it sadly shows that even minority groups can be racially insensitive.

Great Gapsody weekend

To the editor -- Thanks to Union Gap for a wonderful weekend of bluegrass music and good food at Gapsody.
\
The music was excellent and I was able to recapture some of my childhood memories of music in the parks, easy-going company coupled with first-class entertainers. I have some idea of the effort it takes to put these things together, so a big hand all those who were committed to bringing the communities together.

Guard American border
\
To the editor -- I agree with guarding our American border from illegal immigrants entering our country. America has a procedure that is a correct way to legally enter the U.S.A. We all in the world breathe the same air, so color doesn't matter. However, illegal people take money designed for legal Americans to help them get back on their feet. Let's help guard our borders and encourage the government to start over by returning the bad illegals back to where they came from. The good ones here can go through the proper procedure to become an American. All people should want to better their lives. Maybe we could all start by bettering ourselves where we are at.

Dentists serve community
\
To the editor -- Re: The recent litigation involving Dr. Young and the Park family. It appears that this case has gone beyond the facts that were presented during trial and has become more of a coup attempt by a lawyer that is determined to inculcate the litigious environment of King County to rural Eastern Washington. We at Creekside Dental are appalled to read Mr. Blankenship's words in the July 20 Yakima Herald-Republic when he states, ""People say there's no medical malpractice over the mountains We're going to prove them wrong.""
\
We are dental practitioners in the Yakima community. It would seem that what this barrister has failed to understand about our community is that justice is possible outside of the ""lawsuit- happy"" environment of the western part of the state. It is painfully obvious to us that his aim falls far outside the realm of justice and well within the parameters of enrichment of his own business.
\
In our practice, weekly, we see hundreds of children, most of whose only insurance is Medicaid. David Packard, D.M.D., Owen Packard, D.D.S., Bennett Packard, D.M.D., Jared V. Bloxham, D.D.S., and I and many other Yakima dentists are committed to serving the community. However, when it is obvious that the best intentions will likely paint a large target for litigators such as Mr. Blankenship, we question whether the cost of having our names dragged through the muck will be worth the good we are trying to do by seeing these patients.

If Taylor is an example of his or her generation, then I am looking forward to the future.

Dog not safe in yard
\
To the editor -- I think it's pathetic that my little dog is no longer safe to lie in our front yard in a patch of sunshine. But after reading the July 15 article about the dognappings, I am very uncomfortable leaving her out there unattended. I'm not too sure what a ""blood sport"" is, but she's too tiny for anything except perhaps getting ripped to shreds for someone's amusement. I'm sure there's a special place for people who do things like that!

Account for gas tax funds
\
To the editor -- Consider how many gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel are sold in the state every day. It must be millions, maybe even billions! That must add up to a lot of money. I, for one, would like an accounting of what the state has received in gas taxes, and what state officials have done with it!
\
Did you ever ask yourself what is being done, and has been done, with the 28 cents that the state has been collecting every day over the years!
\
It seems that all of a sudden all the work being done depends on the new tax.
\
Our governor says it's all about safety. No, it's all about money! Threatening to stop the work that has been started if this new tax doesn't go through is baloney!
\
You can bet that all of the 420,000 people who signed Inititative 912 to stop the new gas tax will vote the same way. I, for one, will be voting against it! No matter how many visits, or how much whining Christine Gregoire does!

Living by your faith
\
To the editor -- America was founded and based on the Christian faith. Yes, our leaders knew enough to know that it could not be ruled by the church as was Rome, yet they allowed their individual faiths to guide them in building this country. If you doubt this, read Washington's farewell letter. Separation does not mean total alienation from public view and guidance, except of course to the anti-Christians.
\
Now it is open season on that faith. The mere mention of Christianity draws scowls, scorn and outright hatred. This country's agnostics allow their disgust and hatred of this religion to rule them in the same manner that Christians allow their faith to rule them. I also have seen this hatred in the Christians for those outside their faith.
\
I have witnessed snarling remarks directed to Muslims because of the terrorists. What we all need to remember is that Muslims are not terrorists while terrorists may be Muslims. Just as abortion clinic bombers are not Christians but those calling themselves Christians may bomb clinics.
\
If we are going to limit religious icons, then limit them all or allow them all, not just one group based upon our dislikes and prejudices or political correctness. If you preach liberal and Christian tolerances then live those tolerances for all, not just selective groups or races or what is popular in the day.
\
We talk of living together in peace in the world, yet hate each other for our differences within our own country.

Firefighting heroes
\
To the editor -- Our family has grown with the knowledge that firefighters are the last of the heroes. Time and again they answer the call to go out and fight the insurmountable odds to put a fire out. On July 18, they faced the insurmountable odds: To save a house, to keep a fire from spreading to neighbors on each side, dry grass and how to get tankers full of water in and out safely. They did it and did it well.
\
We heard glowing reports about a firefighter named Ross, who took a stand to save the house. Using a chain saw, she separated the garage from the house. Then she took a stand, determined not to lose the house. She won! No blistered paint, smoke or water damage. Rabby, our bunny, wants to express gratitude because she was 5 feet from where the firefighter took her stand. Meanwhile, backup groups answered the call from the Naches Fire Department, Naches Heights, East Valley and Yakima.
\
We want each and everyone of them to know they have our heartfelt thanks and everlasting gratitude for putting your lives on the line. We thank your families for supporting your decision to fight fires. Our prayers will be with them every time the signal goes off. Our prayers for continued healing go to the firefighter who was overcome by the heat. Thank you from the Hellums family of Naches.

They must resign
\
To the editor -- It is undoubtedly folly to conceive of local government announcing that a budget had been met or some fiscal goal had been achieved through strong management and newfound efficiencies. Instead we are endlessly greeted with the unusable $27 million jail and now a bungled courthouse remodel, which is not only $350,000 or so over budget, but being done in violation of bid laws. Commissioners claim to be out of the loop -- i.e., no adequate communication. Hence the appropriateness of the adage: The inmates are in charge of the asylum.
\
These incidents could probably occur under any governmental arrangement, but why is the commission -- i.e., those elected to be in charge and responsible for decisions -- so isolated and aloof from this process?
\
The only change in recent years is that Yakima County created a job occupied by Doug Cochran. He is the manager's ""manager,"" sort of a front man for the commissioners. This is not a statutorily defined job -- one created without definitive standards of performance or accountability. The result is a squishiness -- an oozy sort of governing dictated by odd decisions and misdirected results, such as the jail and the fourth floor remodel.
\
This county needs a big change at the top -- and a good start would still be the resignation of Gamache, Palacios and Cochran as suggested by the Yakima Herald-Republic editorial of May 8, 2005.

'Miss Daisy' message
\
To the editor -- Re: Ivana Hernandez' letter of July 16. I hope that she (and others) know that the film ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is about a black chauffeur and his elderly white employer. Far from being a symbol of ""Jim Crow America,"" it's actually a powerful story about racial understanding and human friendship.
\
I didn't see the ""Driving Miss Daisy"" skit Ms. Hernandez found offensive, but I suspect it had a ""blackface"" actor because a main character in the original story was black. That's not comparable to the Mexican stamp with a black caricature. The caricature was unnecessary.
\
And in view of the Mexican government's refusal to apologize, it sadly shows that even minority groups can be racially insensitive.

Guard American border
\
To the editor -- I agree with guarding our American border from illegal immigrants entering our country. America has a procedure that is a correct way to legally enter the U.S.A. We all in the world breathe the same air, so color doesn't matter. However, illegal people take money designed for legal Americans to help them get back on their feet. Let's help guard our borders and encourage the government to start over by returning the bad illegals back to where they came from. The good ones here can go through the proper procedure to become an American. All people should want to better their lives. Maybe we could all start by bettering ourselves where we are at.

Dentists serve community
\
To the editor -- Re: The recent litigation involving Dr. Young and the Park family. It appears that this case has gone beyond the facts that were presented during trial and has become more of a coup attempt by a lawyer that is determined to inculcate the litigious environment of King County to rural Eastern Washington. We at Creekside Dental are appalled to read Mr. Blankenship's words in the July 20 Yakima Herald-Republic when he states, ""People say there's no medical malpractice over the mountains We're going to prove them wrong.""
\
We are dental practitioners in the Yakima community. It would seem that what this barrister has failed to understand about our community is that justice is possible outside of the ""lawsuit- happy"" environment of the western part of the state. It is painfully obvious to us that his aim falls far outside the realm of justice and well within the parameters of enrichment of his own business.
\
In our practice, weekly, we see hundreds of children, most of whose only insurance is Medicaid. David Packard, D.M.D., Owen Packard, D.D.S., Bennett Packard, D.M.D., Jared V. Bloxham, D.D.S., and I and many other Yakima dentists are committed to serving the community. However, when it is obvious that the best intentions will likely paint a large target for litigators such as Mr. Blankenship, we question whether the cost of having our names dragged through the muck will be worth the good we are trying to do by seeing these patients.

Account for gas tax funds
\
To the editor -- Consider how many gallons of gasoline and diesel are sold in the state every day. It must be millions, maybe even billions! That must add up to a lot of money. I, for one, would like an accounting of what the state has received in gas taxes, and what state officials have done with it!
\
Did you ever ask yourself what is being done, and has been done, with the 28 cents that the state has been collecting every day over the years!
\
It seems that all of a sudden all the work being done depends on the new tax.
\
Our governor says it's all about safety. No, it's all about money! Threatening to stop the work that has been started if this new tax doesn't go through is baloney!
\
You can bet that all of the 420,000 people who signed Initiative 912 to stop the new gas tax will vote the same way. I, for one, will be voting against it! No matter how many visits, or how much whining Gov. Christine Gregoire does!

Living by your faith
\
To the editor -- America was founded and based on the Christian faith. Yes, our leaders knew enough to know that it could not be ruled by the church as was Rome, yet they allowed their individual faiths to guide them in building this country. If you doubt this, read George Washington's farewell letter. Separation does not mean total alienation from public view and guidance, except of course to the anti-Christians.
\
Now it is open season on that faith. The mere mention of Christianity draws scowls, scorn and outright hatred. This country's agnostics allow their disgust and hatred of this religion to rule them in the same manner that Christians allow their faith to rule them. I also have seen this hatred in the Christians for those outside their faith.
\
I have witnessed snarling remarks directed to Muslims because of the terrorists. What we all need to remember is that Muslims are not terrorists, while terrorists may be Muslims. Just as abortion clinic bombers are not Christians, but those calling themselves Christians may bomb clinics.
\
If we are going to limit religious icons, then limit them all or allow them all, not just one group based upon our dislikes and prejudices or political correctness. If you preach liberal and Christian tolerances, then live those tolerances for all, not just selective groups or races or what is popular in the day.
\
We talk of living together in peace in the world, yet hate each other for our differences within our own country.

Consumers have a right to know
\
Remember back in 2003, when a standardized ""Nutrition Facts"" on the backside of every label became a requirement? Remember how we as consumers demanded it? Remember how the companies, major beverage and food manufacturers all cried that the masses would cease to purchase their products, killing their business?
\
Well, we all know that didn't happen.
\
To the contrary, those companies are thriving, putting new products on the shelves all the time, with advertising often targeting children.
\
Genetically engineered foods should be labeled because all citizens have a right to know where their food comes from and how it was produced. You can buy it or not, just like we do now after reviewing the list of ingredients and nutrition facts.

Coal export problems are numerous
\
I'm opposed to the development of the Gateway Pacific export terminal in Whatcom County and any other coal export terminal. The Pacific Northwest is worth so much more than becoming a coal chute for the Wyoming-Montana coal mines (or any other coal mines).
\
Due to the horrendous effects of coal on our environment, I support a Comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement for the entire proposed project: from the mine, along the railroad tracks, to the coal terminal to the trip across the ocean to export site, and then on the effects of the wind returning chemicals to us. In addition, dust from returning coal trains, ships, barges, etc., should be studied.
\
Endangered fish, plants, animals and people will be sickened and/or killed by coal chemicals. Bees will not be able to pollinate if they are covered in coal dust. The agricultural damage is far more costly than any few jobs can justify.
\
Pass-through communities will see the damage: delays caused by lengthy trains, diseases caused by coal dust, the destruction of our communities. We will not see jobs except for the increased need for health care professionals.
\
Wind, solar, wave energy are all clean. Coal is only clean when left in the ground.

Cleaner coal means good jobs
\
Concerned citizens throughout the Northwest have heard mixed messages about coal exports since the proposals were first announced. Some fringe groups have used scare tactics and misinformation in an attempt to derail the projects. As an officer of the Columbia Pacific Building Trades Council, I encourage you to evaluate each of these projects and decide for yourself based on the facts. Let's take a look at what we know is true.
\
First, Asia will not stop burning coal anytime soon. If Powder River Basin (from Wyoming and Montana) coal is not shipped to Asia from the Northwest, it will be shipped from Louisiana and Texas.
\
Second, new technologies in the transportation of coal have virtually eliminated coal dust from trains and barges.
\
Third, tax contributions would help fund our schools and other public services.
\
Lastly, our region is facing very high unemployment. These projects would create thousands of much-needed family-wage jobs in our communities.
\
Don't be fooled by scare tactics. The facts paint a clear picture of what coal export projects will mean for the Northwest: Good jobs and strong communities.

Put military in charge of drones
\
The Central Intelligence Agency may have its beloved aerial drone warfare franchise taken away from it by Congress. Our senators and representatives suspect rather strongly that the CIA's drone cowboys are managing to inflict far too many civilian casualties. Distrust of this country's premier intelligence outfit runs so deep that testimony by its various spokespersons almost automatically becomes the object of derision on Capitol Hill. It is in deep disrepute.
\
Putting the uniformed military in charge of the drone campaign is certainly no guarantee that this particular aerial warfare initiative will be run ""cleanly"" from now on. The military certainly is not infallible. Yet it is far more accountable to congressional oversight than the CIA. It is reasonable to hope that the Pentagon will strive to avoid the worst sorts of excesses. They can hardly do any worse.

Why pick on drones?

I don't understand why some people are against using drones. The drones search for the people who want to do harm, the terrorists and the masterminds who want to destroy us. For those who complain about the drones, would they rather see our soldiers put their lives in more danger instead?
\
Maybe if we use enough of the drones, we wouldn't lose any more lives at all. I'm for using the drones 100 percent in order to save our soldiers' lives.

Technology can become a crutch
\
Vancouver Public Schools has begun implementing its weLearn 1:1 program, which should be district-wide by 2017. This program gives students their own personal iPads or laptops to use at school and at home. The devices will be issued to students with pre-installed apps and Web filters, and are only to be used for educational purposes. According to the VPS website, the program aims to create ""21st century flexible learning environments"" by making technology ""seamlessly embedded in education.""
\
VPS may be preparing students for the modern workforce, but it's also inhibiting critical thinking. When a student learns how to do something on paper, they gain essential problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. But if they learn how to solve a problem with technology, they become accustomed to doing things the easy way. Therefore, teachers should make sure they cover material in class before it is introduced on the students' devices.
\
For example, a 1:1 teacher preparing a lesson on long division should allot a certain amount of instructional time for the traditional paper-and-pencil method, and then allow students to practice what they've learned by playing a game. This way, the students understand the material before it becomes more fun than work.

Wield capitalism with constraint
\
The modern Republican conservative movement has kidnapped the legacy of America's Founding Fathers. They would have us believe that our Founding Fathers were conservative and that unrestrained capitalism and decentralized small government constitute the core principles of America. This is all a myth.
\
Our Founding Fathers tried small government with the Articles of Confederation, but chaos reigned among the states. So we could function together as one nation, our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution and formed a strong central government. Today's conservatives would call this growing government.
\
In 1776, conservatives were Tories and loyal to the British crown. Our Founders were Whigs and promoted the philosophy of 18th century liberalism, and our U.S. Constitution is probably the most liberal document ever devised to build a nation upon.
\
The current concerns over economic inequality and unrestrained capitalism were also shared by American's Founding Fathers. John Adams believed, according to Newsweek, that ""a business aristocracy born of inequality would manipulate voters, create a system of subordination and, unless constrained, the rich would wield economic and political power that will destroy all equality and liberty.""
\
While a vast majority of Americans favor raising the minimum wage, the current conservative Republican Party is loyal to a business aristocracy that, like the British crown, feels entitled.

Campaign reconsidered
\
I take exception to the Nov. 9 editorial, ""Locke may see friendly faces in House, Senate,"" which suggested that local Democrats did not recruit quality candidates to run for the Legislature.
\
On the contrary, Bob Watrous, who ran against Rep. Marc Boldt, R-Sifton, in the 17th District, is an exceptional person.
\
I found Watrous' positions on the economy, growth, education and the environment to be very mainstream. Furthermore, since he is a 1969 graduate of Camas High School and a lifelong resident of the area, I appreciate that Watrous has a sense of history about Clark County and he can use this knowledge to blend old ideas with the new.
\
What I like most about Watrous is his personality. Watrous listens, weighs and values varied perspectives, then develops an informed opinion on issues.
\
Now that it appears the Democrats may be the majority party in the Legislature, it is too bad the 17th District does not have someone like Watrous to represent their interests. Let's hope he will run again in 2000.

The scurrilous campaign conducted by the National Republican Congressional Committee, at a reported $700,000 cost, in support of state Sen. Don Benton, R-Pleasant Valley, for Congress must stand as a new low in unethical advertising.
\
It's a disgrace to every decent Republican and a violation of the very purpose of our postal laws and regulations.
\
This mail campaign against Brian Baird, newly elected representative from Washington's 3rd Congressional District, carried unfounded and misleading misinformation against Baird. It constitutes, at the very least, grounds for legal recourse as defamation of character and unwarranted conjecture intended to injure him personally.
\
After the election, Benton appeared on television to disclaim any responsibility for the slanderous attack.
\
Bob McCann
\
Battle Ground
\
Now that the election is over, I mean to correct Brian Baird's distortions of my voting record in the state Senate.
\
His television ads claimed that I missed one in five days of work. This is completely untrue. If you do the simple math on this outrageous claim, you would come up 33 days missed.
\
The official record shows that I removed myself from the session payroll during one four-day absence to honor contractual commitments I made prior to my election to the Senate. This excused absence was carefully planned with the leadership in the Senate. It never created a situation in which an important piece of legislation passed or failed as a result of my not being there.
\
Another outlandish claim made by my opponent was that I missed 201 votes on important bills. This is another calculated distortion. Many of the votes missed were not even on bills. They were on gubernatorial appointments and resolutions that have no effect of law whatsoever. Many of the votes on actual bills passed by near-unanimous consent. Baird conveniently neglected to mention that I had voted on most of these bills in one form or another several times previously.
\
Many legislators, myself included, make a conscious decision to miss insignificant or noncontroversial votes to do more important things like negotiating an agreement on a critical bill with a committee chairman, attending a meeting on the World War II Memorial at the Department of Veterans Affairs, spending some quality time with the hundreds of children and parents from schools that come to visit the Capitol every year from your home district, and, yes, even being with my wife when she gave birth to our third child.
\
As we now all know, twisting the truth and omitting important facts is a disturbing pattern for Baird. He never mentioned that state Rep. Val Ogden, D-Vancouver, missed more than 400 votes in one session or that the Democrat minority leader of the Senate, Sid Snyder, D-Long Beach, missed more than 160 votes. These were decision they made in what they believed were the best interest of their constituents and their families. I believe the same standard should apply to all of our elected officials regardless of political party.
\
My vote and my voice made a significant difference in stopping the gas tax, reducing property taxes, increasing education funding, rolling back business and occupation taxes, increasing penalties for drug dealers and violent juvenile offenders, passing the Defense of Marriage Act and many other important pieces of legislation.
\
As I continue to represent the citizens of Washington in the state Senate, they can be assured that I will use my voice and my vote where, in my best judgement, it will serve them the best.

Arts vital to sound society
\
This fiscal conservative believes that the arts are vital to the republic form of government.
\
In recognition of our current political atmosphere, let us consider bringing in some tools of mediation, arbitration and critical thinking to deal with the numerous issues of the day. We are famously short on these, while rich in charged propaganda.
\
To fulfill our preamble providing liberty and justice for all men created equally, we as citizens have formed institutions of government to ensure order via law and its enforcement. Being that representatives to these institutions are continually rechosen in democratic elections, citizens must be continually motivated to vote and must apply critical thinking to the nature of the candidate and the ideas of the day.
\
Institutions that investigate the nature of the world religion, business, medicine, and education must also continually bring intelligent arguments to the marketplace of ideas. The citizen's burden to evaluate numerous ideas and faces is enormous.
\
In addition to reflecting on history, the citizen must be willing to evaluate the impact of law on others in different circumstances. The media cannot solely be expected to bring and explain the realm of ideas and motivate action. The arts are vital in their power and obligation to society to explore and discuss the marketplace of ideas, and they have the unique ability to simultaneously speak to different ages, cultures and circumstances.
\
""Oliver"" is important because it is the voice of God to remember the plight of the orphan and the poor. ""Les Miserables"" is important because it proclaims the virtue of grace, giving freely of oneself, purely to uplift others. In a capitalistic society that must provide work, reward and hope for a society of free men, ""Other People's Money"" is important because it exposes the effects of greed as opposed to just profits from production. Handel's ""Messiah"" is important because it reminds us of the presence of God and his gift to humanity an example to follow. ""Oedipus"" is enormously important in its depiction of the consequences of immorality.
\
Far too often, cinema and television productions trivialize drama into sensationalism, cynicism and titillating spectacle. While enormously entertaining to the American public, these productions are rarely edifying to the marketplace of ideas. The vast majority of these profit-driven productions rarely challenge us to think beyond our current condition and ourselves. They do not remind us of our duty to others via government, charity and personal ethic and behavior.
\
Theatre has an excellent record of accomplishment for discussing ideas and exposing the personal situations of others. In addition, theatre and the other fine arts rarely resort to the purpose of mere stimulation or seduction; no place has this been truer than in Vancouver's stages and galleries.
\
Voltaire proclaimed, ""Whoever condemns the theatre is an enemy to the state."" His superlative statement has an element of truth; theatre and the arts are an important vehicle of ideas to free men. While today we live in a free society, the continuance of our freedom is contingent on our willingness to represent high ideals and truth while shunning the tyranny of bad ideas and self-centered political figures.
\
In addition to the media, let's not forget to reap from the arts; let's not forget to attend ""Oliver"" in January with our children.

Seniors drive well

Many seniors take advantage of the ""55 and over"" driver retraining classes offered by the American Association of Retired Persons, AAA and other organizations.
\
Most insurance companies offer discounts on auto policies by enrolling in these eight-hour classes, and they are required every two to three years to continue the discount. It is an excellent brush-up on rules of the road, changes in laws and safety tips. How often do the younger drivers take retraining?
\
Statistics show that younger drivers, particularly teens to 30-year-olds, account for most accidents and road rage. Maybe everyone should be required to go through a reminder course every five years.

196,"
BOISE, Idaho -- Democrats in nine Western states are forming a new coalition aimed at rebuilding their party in a region where Republicans have dominated for nearly two decades.
\
Organizers said the group will take policy positions on issues specific to the Rocky Mountain West, hoping to increase Democratic representation in government.
\
High-profile leaders on the committee include former Interior Secretary and Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, former Montana Rep. Pat Williams, former New Mexico Sen. Dennis DeConcini and former Interior Secretary and Arizona Rep. Stewart Udall.
\
The nine states represented in the effort are Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Seven of those states are currently controlled by Republican state legislatures.
\
Andrus said Western Democrats are tired of being painted by Republicans with the same brush as Eastern and urban environmentalists. He said Democrats for the West will take positions that run counter to some other Democratic organizations.
\
""I had a balanced approach. I had credibility on the environment and we still had an adequate timber harvest,"" Andrus said. ""I'm not going to let them drive the train anymore. They have no right to stereotype us.""
\
While coastal states such as California, Oregon and Washington have remained politically balanced over the past 20 or so years, Democrats in interior Western states have lost tremendous ground to Republicans, especially on natural resource issues.
\
""Democrats have not been good at doing anything because they are on the defensive on the environment. It didn't always used to be that way,"" said Williams, who represented Montana in Congress from 1979 to 1997.
\
""Republicans present the environment only as a 'we' and 'them' issue,"" Williams said. ""That's not how Westerners perceive the issue. Our rivers and the land and the air ought to bring us together.""
\
The GOP does not have a specific Rocky Mountain organization, Republican National Committee Western region spokesman Yier Schi said. But he said that despite the attempts of past Democratic officeholders to pay homage to regional issues, the party is still represented by its leaders. And this year, that leader is Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry.
\
""The Democratic Party has nominated a candidate that is wrong for Western issues and has wrong ideas for the West,"" Schi said from his Washington, D.C., office.
\
""John Kerry voted for gas tax hike. He is not right for the West on healthy forests or private property rights. They have to live by who elected to represent their party,"" Schi said.
\
Democrats for the West will not focus only on traditional Western issues, Andrus said. For example, Rocky Mountain Democrats will argue that President Bush's federal budget deficit runs counter to their conservative fiscal beliefs.
\
""They're the most liberal spenders that this nation has ever seen,"" Andrus said.
\
The new organization will take positions on issues such as the environment, urban growth, and access to public lands, Idaho Democratic Party Chairwoman Carolyn Boyce said. Also, Democratic candidates can use the policy as an information base for their own campaigns, she said.
\
Natural resource issues are not the only topics to be tackled by the fledgling Democratic group. Also on their agenda will be federal mandates, such as President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act, and the social concerns of Indians, Hispanics and other minorities.
\
""We're going to be discussing how we are going to be more relevant in the West,"" Boyce said. ""What we don't want to do is get together and chat a couple of times a year. We're going to work to elect more Democrats who have real solutions to Western problems.""

To all of our many fine sponsors whose support is so vital, we thank you and are most grateful. To local law enforcement, thank you for your professionalism and for working with us so well. To the city of Moxee and its residents, thank you for sharing your city for this fantastic community event. And to all the entertainers and vendors we say, ""Job well done.""
\
Revenue generated from the Hop Festival is put into the coffers of the East Valley Community Enhancement Association, the nonprofit sponsor of the Hop Festival. An allocations committee comprised of local business people, along with the Board of Directors, steers the philanthropic endeavors of the EVCEA.
\
Funds go back into the community in many ways. The EVCEA provides money for scholarships, the Moxee Library League, Terrace Heights Flag Project, expansion of Moxee Park, booster for EVHS sports, playground equipment, books for classrooms, and of course, funds the annual Hop Festival.
\
The Moxee Hop Festival and the East Valley Community Enhancement Association are doing great things in a growing area. Thanks to everyone for making a difference in the greater East Valley area.

There's plenty of space already
\
To the editor -- The proposal to have a new and separate meeting room outside Yakima City Hall and the County Courthouse is totally unnecessary because there is sufficient room in the basement of the courthouse where the commissioners currently meet that could be expanded, in my estimation, for about the same cost the city is willing to pay for a study.
\
There is also a large meeting room on the second floor of the justice center. There is a room next to the City Council chambers that could be utilized as well.
\
I see absolutely no need for the city and county to rent new meeting space, furnish it and have even more debt added to their respective budgets when sufficient space already exists within the present structures.

Things looking up downtown
\
To the editor -- I keep hearing someone saying, ""What's it all about, Alfie?"" Downtown Yakima is receiving more attention than a newborn baby! The first week of August, the City Council gave the green light to the $4.8 million downtown ""VIVID"" design option, beginning the much-anticipated revitalization plan to coincide with the completion of ""our"" lovely new downtown hotel.
\
I'm sure that many, many others join me in the feelings of gratitude, joy, pride, extreme elation and anticipation that finally -- after so many years of neglect -- our downtown will have a chance to return to its original vitality and splendor that some of us can remember so vividly.
\
The exuberance that I experience, contemplating all the ""gifts,"" or possibilities that may be reality soon, make minor mundane considerations -- such as a few pennies' gas tax -- fade from any concern.
\
Placing Mother Nature's beautiful creations among harmonious man- made artistry promises aesthetic beauty along our downtown streets. I see, also, the enjoyment and appreciation presented by bustling sidewalk cafes and the clanging of the trolley-car bells, reminiscent of San Francisco and Union Street.
\
If, in future months, our new entrepreneurs should be visited by uneasiness for one reason or another, let me offer one minor suggestion: Somewhere along the route of commerce, perhaps one more Wal-Mart should be on standby; you know, just in case!

Littering fines not doing the job
\
To the editor -- I have recently observed the amount of litter on our state's highways. It seems to me that the fines that the state has in place for littering are not deterring people from throwing their coffee cups, soda and beer cans and other garbage out the window of their cars. Even though the littering fines are pretty stiff (you can pay around $100 for tossing something the size of a food or beverage container out the window and over $1,000 for what can be classified as potentially dangerous litter, like a lit cigarette), people still seem to not care about what they are doing to the environment. Keeping the highways clean is everybody's responsibility. Education on littering will help the litter problem. One method of education would be an advertising campaign funded by the state using state alcohol and cigarette tax money. Please help keep our highways clean.

BEST SELF is successful again
\
To the editor -- Thank you to Yakima County, local school districts, Sunrise Charities, Zonta Club, Yakima Federal Savings, Clark Jennings, Catholic Family and many others for another great summer of BEST SELF. This program is an exemplar of community collaboration and investment in the future of our communities.
\
BEST SELF builds protective factors into the lives of many children who otherwise experience disproportionate risks. Research tells us that even in the face of poverty and other risk factors, we can build protection in children and communities to balance out that risk and create positive futures for them.
\
Connection with their communities is one very strong protective factor, and we know that children who feel a connection and investment in their community are much less likely to exhibit delinquent behavior. BEST SELF makes this connection in strong ways for many children each year.
\
This summer my 6-year-old son participated in painting over graffiti at a local grocery store with his BEST SELF peers and teachers. Participating in this unique service activity enabled the children of our community to learn about the importance of caring for their neighbors and community in an experiential way that they won't ever forget.
\
Please join me in telling our county commissioners what a great investment this program is in the future of our communities.

Where is Union Gap's benefit?
\
To the editor -- Union Gap got the short end of the deal again. The new expanded Yakima Transit route to Union Gap does not benefit Union Gap residents. Yakima residents can now take public transit to shop at the Valley Mall or renew licenses at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Union Gappers can not.
\
Why would I walk 20 blocks to catch a bus to the Valley Mall when my destination is only a few more steps ahead?
\
If I take a transit bus to visit my medical practitioner after walking 20 blocks in this weather, I'm in serious need of medical attention by the time I get to my destination.
\
Yakima Transit goes through Selah, but only to the edge of Union Gap. How did that happen?
\
From personal experience, I observe many students using Yakima Transit to and from school. Union Gap students cannot.
\
A good, expanded route would go down Third Avenue to Ahtanum Road then to Union Gap city center. Then residents in West Union Gap and city proper would have some service.
\
Lack of mass transit has hindered the development of our city as many institutions can not move here for that reason. The slow development of Ahtanum business park is a good example.
\
So thanks for bring mass transition to Union Gap, but no thanks: We still cannot use it.

Bombs had a purpose
\
To the editor -- If any American has it in his or her mind to blame their country for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or is questioning where to place blame for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that American neither belongs here nor deserves America.
\
They should take the following advice at face value:
\
Don't question the decision to drop the bomb. Be thankful for it. Feel free to question politically correct thinking, and be fearful of it.

198,"Tracy Ellig can be reached at (509) 459-5489 or by e-mail at tracye@spokesman.com. See individual profiles under name of candidate. These 3 sidebars appeared with the story: 1. WHERE THEY STAND... The issues: Here are the positions on selected issues of the two candidates for Washington's 3rd Legislative District, House seat No. 1. CHERYL STEELE, Republican BIGGEST ISSUE: If economy declines, the major issue will be holding line on tax increases. If Referendum 49 fails, transportation funding will be major issue. REGIONAL ADVOCATE: Mariner and Seahawks stadiums are two examples of West Side getting more than fair share. Supports funding for North-South Freeway, Spokane Convention Center, expansion of the Cheney Cowles museum, SIRTI. GAMBLING: Unsure. Concerned about long-term social effects of gambling. BUDGET: Spend less on regulation of businesses. Federal requirements should suffice. Spend more on transportation and criminal justice. TRANSPORTATION: Referendum 49 is a start. Our local government doesn't fully utilize local gas tax authority, so state is not inclined to give more to Spokane. EDUCATION: Ensure adequate school construction funds. Concerned about charter schools because school funding is based on enrollment. Reducing funding to some schools would be unfair to children and teachers left there. FIELD-BURNING: Supports ban. Recognizes farmers will suffer due to current ban. Would encourage spending on joint environmentalist-farmer coalition to solve problem. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT: Giving kids a good education will help reduce crime. More police needed in Spokane County as well as more crime prevention. 2. ALEX WOOD, Democrat BIGGEST ISSUE: The budget. REGIONAL ADVOCATE: Supports funding for convention center expansion, North-South Freeway, Health Sciences building at Riverpoint Higher Education Park. GAMBLING: Supports local control over gambling issues. BUDGET: Make taxes less burdensome on small businesses and citizens. Spend more on social services, day care, food banks, mental health centers and basic health plan. TRANSPORTATION: Opposes Referendum 49. Tough to ask state for more money when Spokane voters reject local-option gas tax for roads. EDUCATION: Supports ongoing reforms. Raise pay for teachers, especially in community colleges. FIELD-BURNING: Supports ban, but too soon to tell if it's fair to farmers. Wants ban to stay in effect for few years to see results. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT: Tougher laws and longer sentences don't reduce crime. Giving children good start does more to reduce crime. 3. 3RD DISTRICT The 3rd District includes most of downtown Spokane and the city's core housing areas, including the West Central and East Central neighborhoods. State representatives serve two-year terms and are paid $28,300 annually.\ It's a Republican's ground-floor community activism vs. a Democrat's legislative experience in Position 1 of the 3rd Legislative District.\ Incumbent Democrat Alex Wood is seeking re-election with the motto that ""one good term deserves another.""\ Challenger Cheryl Steele argues the 3rd District needs a Republican at the table to shed its standing as the poorest district in the state.\ The district includes most of downtown Spokane and the city's core housing areas, including the West Central and East Central neighborhoods.\ ""For 65 years the 3rd District has been controlled by Democrats and it's always been the lowest social-economic district in the state,"" Steele said.\ That's astounding, Steele said, since the 3rd District is the economic hub of Eastern Washington.\ ""If you send a Democratic voice, you are not sending a voice to the majority table. And (having) a voice will be critical in the coming session, especially in transportation,"" she said.\ Wood counters that it is premature to say Democrats won't be at the table. He contends Democrats could take majority control of the Senate, and Democrats have Gov. Gary Locke's ear in a way Republicans never will.\ ""Cheryl is a moderate Republican. The leadership of her party is very conservative,"" Wood said. ""Even with her good intentions I don't think she'll be able to do the things she wants to do.""\ He also argues that his first-term experience was invaluable.\ ""I had a good first term, made a lot of friends and know a lot more about the process,"" Wood said. ""Incumbency really does have its advantages, even though I'm in the minority party.""\ While Wood has incumbency, Steele argues she knows more about the needs of the 3rd District from her years of involvement as a community policing advocate.\ But Wood says six years as a radio talk show host interviewing community leaders has kept him in touch with the district.\ Steele's main campaign issues are crime and education, which she sees as linked.\ ""Healthy kids in healthy environments will ultimately reduce crime,"" she said.\ If young people have good educations and can find decent jobs, that will go a long way toward reducing crime, Steele said.\ She also believes citizens need to take more personal responsibility for themselves, their children and their communities.\ ""We see people continually asking the system to fix their problems,"" Steele said. ""We've lost the sense of belonging and of personal responsibility.""\ Steele wants the Legislature to stop passing crime laws that can't be enforced, but which soothe public outcry over an issue.\ Wood plans to focus his efforts on getting a minimum wage increase, ensuring affordable health care for citizens and supporting education and economic development for the 3rd District.\ ""My No. 1 issue is a minimum wage increase,"" Wood said. ""We tried to get that passed and it should have been passed, but the Republicans wouldn't even give us a hearing on it.""\ He's a supporter of charter schools, which would allow the development of public schools with academic specialties.\ ""Each year that bill gets better,"" Wood said."
199,"Gov. Jay Inslee didn't send out cards for Earth Day, but he did send a message to the Legislature that he wants more than just an operating budget that satisfies the Supreme Court orders on public education and a major transportation package when they go into a special session.\He also wants them to do something about carbon pollution, oil train safety and toxic chemicals.\Wednesday was Earth Day, so Inslee held an outdoor news conference to say the state is suffering on a day set aside to mark the environment. Last summer's wildfires could be repeated this year, the state has a snowpack drought and oyster beds are suffering from ocean acidification, he said.\The Legislature will need a special session to complete work on an operating budget and may come to an agreement on major road and bridge construction funded by a gas-tax increase. But they shouldn't stop there, he said.\He wants them to come to some agreement on a carbon reduction plan. His carbon initiative has stalled in both chambers.\He wants them to pass legislation to regulate oil shipments across the state. The House and Senate have competing plans on that topic, and he prefers the level of inspections and advance notice in the House version.\Republican leaders said Tuesday that they oppose Inslee's carbon reduction plans, which could raise the price of gasoline at the same time the state may be raising gasoline taxes for the transportation package. Faced with a double hit at the pump, they say voters may take to the ballot to reject the gas-tax hike, killing the projects it would cover.\GOP leaders were more optimistic that oil train safety legislation would pass. The two bills are being negotiated and there are ""growing similarities"" between the two proposals, Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said.\Credit: Jim Camden jimc@spokesman.com, (509) 879-7461"

Washington voters, newly empowered under Initiative 695, probably will have one or more tax-increase proposals on the ballot in November 2000, a top-ranking Democratic state House member said in Vancouver on Wednesday night.
\
""We probably will go to the voters with one or two things,"" Rep. Lynn Kessler, D-Hoquiam, said. Then, ""It'll be up to the citizens"" to decide whether they want to pay to get more from state government.
\
At least for now, the day is gone when the Legislature may raise taxes on its own. Likewise for local boards, councils and commissions. I-695, approved overwhelmingly in the Nov. 2 election, requires a public vote for all tax and fee increases by state and local agencies. Only college tuition and criminal and civil fines are exempt.
\
The town hall-style meeting at the Vancouver Housing Authority headquarters included Kessler, who is co-House leader; Reps. Val Ogden, D-Vancouver; Hans Dunshee, D-Snohomish; and Mark Doumit, D- Cathlamet. About 40 local residents attended.
\
Kessler said she expects the Legislature will give voters a chance to decide at least one tax increase ""for a particular purpose, such as transportation.""
\
'Give voters a chance'
\
Jerry King, retired Vancouver city attorney, urged the legislators not to be shy about putting proposed tax increases on the ballot.
\
""Give the people a chance to vote on a gas tax,"" he said, adding that it was last raised in 1990.
\
Lawmakers should also give voters a chance to decide on an increase in liquor taxes, he said, adding that they haven't gone up since 1989.
\
""Tell the people we need some help,"" King implored the lawmakers, reminding them that's what I-695 calls for. ""See if they'll go for it.""
\
I-695, health insurance and health maintenance organizations, government voice-mail systems, the homeless and the state's environment were among other topics targeted by the audience.
\
One speaker, John Gear, said the state's economy is good because of the good environment and it would be false economy to try saving money for government or industry by relaxing environmental laws. Mississippi, he said, has a horrible economy because it has a bad environment.
\
Inaccessible government agencies, especially those with elaborate phone trees or voice-mail systems at which no live person readily comes on the line, were the subject of considerable derision by the legislators and audience members.
\
Exempting cars
\
Kessler said the Legislature's first order of business when it meets in January will be to fix Initiative 695 by exempting automobiles from the state's personal property tax. Gov. Gary Locke has already urged the same thing.
\
Action can't come fast enough for Clark County Assessor Ben Gassaway. He agreed with legislators who said they don't think voters understood that in addition to repealing the motor vehicle excise tax, I-695 also put cars under the state's personal property tax.
\
The personal property tax now now applies primarily to business equipment and machinery.
\
Gassaway said that, without quick legislative action, county assessors will have to begin the expensive and cumbersome process of expanding the personal property tax to vehicles.
\
Making that ""fix"" in I-695 will require two-thirds approval by both the state House and Senate, as is required to change an initiative in the first two years after it has passed.
\
Public health concerns
\
There was plenty of concern voiced about I-695's effects on public transit, health and other programs. Legislators said they hope some of the state's money in the national tobacco settlement will go to health districts, which were hard hit by loss of the car tax money.
\
""We are not going to jeopardize public health,"" Kessler said. But, she warned, the whole process of adjusting to I-695 ""is not going to be painless.""
\
Some in the audience chose to argue the merits of I-695 itself rather than discuss how best to deal with the reality of its passage. Those monologues prompted groans, rolling of the eyes and early departures from some in the audience.
\
Jim Eccles of Vancouver said ""government"" and ""tax"" have ""become dirty words"" in political dialogue. ""That's really too bad,"" he said. ""Somewhere, government services are going to cost money. Conservatives tell us there is no free lunch, then go around trying to make everything else free.""
\
He won applause for his final line: ""We need to become as good at figuring out what we do want (government) to do as what we are at figuring out what we don't want (it) to do.""

OLYMPIA - House Democrats have stopped negotiations on a transportation revenue package until a state operating budget deal is reached, the chamber's key transportation negotiator said Wednesday.
\
House Transportation Chairwoman Judy Clibborn, a Democrat from Mercer Island, said she was asked Tuesday by caucus leadership to temporarily halt talks with Senate Republicans, which have been ongoing for weeks.
\
Clibborn said both sides had been close to coming to agreement on a transportation funding package that would include a gas tax increase to pay for projects across the state. Clibborn says she's frustrated by the development, but says that both sides are close enough to a transportation agreement that they could move quickly once a final state budget deal has been struck.
\
""I'm feeling comfortable about where we are,"" she said. ""I don't think we'll slide backwards if we wait or else I'd be more upset.""
\
The Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate have been locked in budget negotiations for several weeks. They are currently in a second overtime legislative session after adjourning both a regular 105-day legislative session and a 30-day special session without reaching a budget deal.
\
Officials from the governor's budget office have already released a contingency plan on what state offices may have to close completely if a budget isn't signed into law before midnight June 30, when the current two-year budget ends. The current special session ends on June 27, which means that lawmakers could call a third special session if their work isn't done by then.
\
The transportation negotiating team has been meeting two to three times a week to negotiate differences between their packages that were introduced earlier this year, Clibborn said.
\
Both the House and Senate are looking at $15 billion plans that include an incremental gas tax increase.
\
Clibborn said she canceled a previously scheduled meeting Wednesday with Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, the chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee.
\
Clibborn said based on the current environment surrounding the operating budget negotiations, the timing isn't right for her caucus to consider a transportation deal.
\
""I'm not thrilled, but I understand if I came forward with decision and everyone else in my caucus is upset, it doesn't bode well for their support for transportation,"" she said.
\
King said he was disappointed with the decision. ""All of us were working very well together,"" he said.
\
""We were getting close to having an agreement. Now they want to take what has been a very good process and politicize it and hold it hostage.""
\
If lawmakers pass an operating budget before the end of the current special session, Clibborn said she hopes there will be time to move transportation shortly thereafter.
\
But there's also a possibility of coming back in a third special session, either because lawmakers have to move into extra overtime for the operating budget, or solely to deal with transportation, Clibborn said.

202,"EDITORIAL\If it was not clear before the Legislature got down to business Monday, it's clear now: Neither of the major changes in the Washington tax code proposed by Gov. Jay Inslee will pass in the Senate.\With the two-thirds procedural rule quickly adopted by the Republican majority, just 17 members - one more than one-third - can block bills that would implement a new tax. There are certainly more than 17 senators prepared to stop the governor's cap-and-trade air pollution control plan and his proposed tax on capital gains.\Inslee did not acknowledge this in his State of the State address Tuesday. Instead, he cited an obvious fact the majority of Washington residents have shown they are willing to ignore: the inequity of a tax system that imposes a disproportionate share of the burden on the state's middle- and lower-income residents.\A state income tax might be fairer, but voters in 2010 rejected Initiative 1098, which would have created one. A capital gains tax is much the same thing, with much the same future.\Inslee celebrated Washington's history of innovation, but that has not been true regarding taxation.\In her response to Inslee on behalf of Republicans, Rep. Norma Smith of Clinton started, as Inslee should have, by noting the state expects to collect an additional $3 billion in revenues during the next budget biennium, a better than 8 percent increase that should go a long way - if not all the way - toward meeting court-ordered mandates to increase education funding and support for mental health services.\As revenue projections have advanced with each quarterly report, the possibility the state will be able to pad its reserves and backfill pension accounts has increased.\Smith's comments on Inslee's environmental initiatives were less helpful.\The governor and the Department of Ecology are fighting the good fight against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on water quality regulations. Also, the department last month released a nearly 500-page study, with recommendations, of the potential impacts of more oil train traffic through Washington and how the state can respond.\Knocking cap-and-trade as a substitute for higher gas taxes is easy. Finding money to get the North Spokane Corridor and other projects completed will be hard. Reforms - and they are needed - are not going to get these jobs done.\Senate Republicans last spring blocked a plan that included gas tax hikes. Gasoline was about $1 more per gallon then. If legislators are going to spurn ideas like cap-and-trade, or the expansion of tolling, this is an opportunity to minimize the pain of a tax increase and relieve the congestion that pours tons of pollutants into Washington's skies.\Although the gas tax works less well with every advance in automotive technology, the new Senate rules do not require a two-thirds majority to adjust existing taxes.\The state of this state's roads is detrimental to business, health and the environment. Let's get on with a fix.\To respond to this editorial online, go to www.spokesman.com and click on Opinion under the Topics menu."
203,"
OLYMPIA Washington state's environmental community has learned an important lesson about dealing with the Legislature: Don't expect everything all at once and make sure whatever you push for doesn't pit the environment against the economy.
\
That formula ensured the greenies got almost everything they wanted last legislative session including strict car emissions and it already has them working closely with Gov. Christine Gregoire on priorities they are set to tackle in the 2006 session.
\
""The environmental community is being more diligent in bringing win-win issues to the Legislature that not only help protect our air, land and water but also help our business friendly-manner,"" said Clifford Traisman, a lobbyist for Washington Conservation Voters and the Washington Environmental Council. ""That combination has afforded us the opportunity to be taken more seriously.""
\
Environmentalists had their best session in years when lawmakers this year adopted a version of California's auto emission standards and imposed energy-efficient ""green"" construction standards on public buildings such as schools and college buildings.
\
The Legislature also passed bills earmarking money for local clean-water projects, including a grant and loan program to help homeowners fix failing septic systems that are blamed for many of the state's water pollution problems, especially in Hood Canal.
\
In turn, the environmentalists teamed up with business and labor in fighting an initiative that would have overturned an increase in the gas tax to pay for road and bridge projects, including Seattle's quake-damaged Alaskan Way Viaduct.
\
The transportation package also had projects that environmentalists didn't want to lose expanded HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) lanes and the potential for HOT lanes, which allow buses, car pools and van pools in for free, while charging solo drivers a toll. They also lauded the inclusion of wildlife crossings along a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 90 over Snoqualmie Pass that will allow wildlife to safely get to the other side of the freeway.
\
But in 2006, the hot-button issue for them and for Democrats and Republicans alike is energy independence.
\
Demand for biodiesel and ethanol has grown with the rising cost of gasoline and other petroleum fuels. Biodiesel is a vegetable oil- based fuel that can be burned in place of regular diesel or mixed in varying blends; ethanol can be distilled from corn and grain and mixed with gasoline.
\
Gregoire has already has proposed greater investments by the state in the biofuel industry, including $17.5 million in low- interest loans for a crusher to turn canola to oil and refineries to convert that oil to biodiesel.
\
Money for Puget Sound
\
In addition, Gregoire has proposed requiring that diesel fuels sold in Washington contain a minimum amount of biodiesel a step that would create a market for the products produced by the state's own farmers and refineries.
\
""It will be the biggest issue that the Legislature will be focusing on,"" Traisman said.
\
And Gregoire recently earmarked $42 million in her supplemental budget to restore and protect Puget Sound, another issue deemed vital by environmentalists. She named a panel of environmental, tribal and political leaders to research cleanup efforts across the country and make recommendations.
\
Gregoire wants to clean up toxic sites, prevent oil spills and continuing toxic contamination, and restore nearshore, estuary and salmon habitats.
\
""It's a huge increase in commitment over what has been done in past supplemental budgets,"" said Naki Stevens, director of programs for People for Puget Sound.
\
Stevens said the health of the sound is an economic issue as well. ""The sound drives the economy and generates thousands and thousands of jobs in all kinds of industries from shellfishing to tourism,"" she said. ""Some of the business folks and Republicans are understanding that it's a lot more cost-effective to try and get a handle on this problem now before it truly is out of our reach.""
\
Did you know?
\
Environmentalists in Washington are seeing several changes lately that they consider positive. These include:
\
Stricter car emissions.
\
""Green"" construction standards on public buildings.
\
Funding for clean water and sewer projects.
\
Rejection of last year's effort to repeal the recent increase in the gas tax.
\
Plans to build wildlife crossings along Interstate 90.
\
Future projects include:
\
Funding for biodiesel projects.
\
Restoration and protection for Puget Sound.
\
Recycling programs for electronic waste.

204,"
OLYMPIA Gov. Christine Gregoire, urging Washington to ""get out of the mud"" and aspire to greatness, on Tuesday signed a tax package and a $26 billion two-year state budget that invests heavily in education and health care.
\
The tax package includes a $6-a-carton increase in cigarette taxes and higher taxes on hard liquor, but an unapologetic Gregoire said the taxes won't hurt the average citizen much and will produce a better state.
\
The budget and tax package has been roundly criticized by fiscal conservatives and Gregoire's signing came just days before a Chelan County court hears arguments in a case that could toss out her election.
\
But the rookie Democratic governor defended both the budget, which increases spending by 12 percent over current levels, and the revenue package, the first major tax hikes in 12 years.
\
The budget plan, which leaves a reserve of about $170 million, requires a new revenue package of about $480 million, including the ""sin tax"" increases on cigarettes and liquor.
\
Smokes will go up by 60 cents a pack in July and the liquor tax will rise by $1.33 a liter. The estate tax, called the death tax by foes, will be imposed on about 250 large estates each year. Extended warranty contracts on consumer goods like computers and TVs will be taxed.
\
Gregoire told reporters the revenue package meets her test of not including general taxes such as the sales, property and business taxes. Without the extra revenue, the state couldn't provide 8,000 additional higher-education enrollment slots, restart two expensive voter-approved education initiatives or expand access to health care, she said.
\
In a slap at her Republican gubernatorial rival, former Senate budget Chairman Dino Rossi, she said she inherited an unsustainable budget, one that didn't properly fund the initiatives, salaries for public employees or the pension system. The new version, crafted by Democrats in both houses from a template she suggested, does much better, she insisted.
\
As for criticism from Rossi and others that the state needed a no- new-tax budget, she said heatedly, ""We can stay stuck in the mud; we can be a second-rate state. But you know what? I love my state. That's not good enough for us.
\
""We've got to get up. We've got to get going. We've got to leave a legacy to our children. We've got to be at the forefront. We should be second to no one when it comes to education.
\
""I say it's time to invest in education, to invest in transportation and our economic vitality.""
\
A day earlier, Gregoire approved a $3.3 billion construction budget. It relies heavily on borrowed money but doesn't boost taxes.
\
The governor signed a transportation package last week. The 16- year plan includes $8.5 billion in new revenue, including a 9.5- cent-a-gallon gas tax hike phased in over the next four years. An initiative has been filed to overturn the gas tax increase.
\
The two-year operating budget cleared the Legislature by party- line votes over the objections of Republicans who argued new taxes weren't necessary.
\
BOTTOM LINE: Gov. Christine Gregoire signed the Democratic Legislature's budget plan, providing $25.96 billion for the two fiscal years beginning July 1. That compares with the current $23.4 billion, or roughly a 12 percent increase.
\
NEW REVENUE: Gregoire approved a separate tax package, including ""sin tax"" increases on liquor and cigarettes, a new estate tax on large estates and revenue-related legislation. The price tag is roughly $480 million, or less than a third of the spending gap the majority Democrats faced.
\
Highlights of $480 Million Package
\
WINNERS: K-12 education, including voter-approved initiatives; higher education; human services; public employee compensation; environment; and health care.
\
LOSERS: Cigarette and liquor consumers, heirs of large estates, college students, and others who pay more; 1,000 middle managers who'll lose their jobs or have to take line jobs; pension funding.
\
Details of tax increases:
\
CIGARETTE TAX: $175 million is raised by boosting the current $1.425-a-pack tax by 60 cents a pack in July.
\
LIQUOR TAX: $50 million is generated by boosting the liquor tax by $1.33 per liter.
\
ESTATE TAX: $139 million from a new state tax on estates worth $1.5 million or more for 2005 and on estates worth $2 million or more thereafter. The state's old estate tax was struck down by the state Supreme Court.
\
WARRANTY TAX: $37 million is raised by levying the sales tax on extended warranties on consumer products like big screen TVs.
\
MISCELLANEOUS: Other revenue is raised through a variety of means the average citizen won't notice, such as a new cigarette tax agreement with the Puyallup Tribe and changing the filing date for real estate taxes.
\
The state hopes to earn an extra $5 million by opening some liquor stores on Sunday.

Marshall shows initiative
\
To the editor -- Last weekend I was pleasantly surprised to find that Rockey Marshall, candidate for Yakima City Council Position No. 1, was doorbelling in my neighborhood. I think this says a lot about his character and this is why I am going to support him in the upcoming election.
\
If he is willing to spend his Saturday afternoon visiting with voters and answering their questions, he must care about our opinions. In talking to him, I found him knowledgeable and I respected the fact that he had done his homework on issues important to our community. Also, I thought it was great that he took the initiative to put himself out there. He is working so hard on getting to know the voters now, that I can't imagine him doing things in the City Council that voters wouldn't support.

Help attract specialists
\
To the editor -- It is time to awaken to the reality that there is a structural problem in liability insurance including medical liability. Our practice, ENT Associates, P.S., has been attempting to recruit a new ear, nose and throat physician for the last three years. It is very difficult because of medical liability insurance's availability.
\
The price of the products for Ob-Gyn and neurosurgery will drive away practitioners from our region. The availability of insurance has almost eliminated radiologists from this region. We do not work in isolation. We require the expertise and skills of our colleagues in order to practice our area of specialty.
\
When critical areas of medical services are at risk, young physicians and their families are not prepared to make roots in an unstable environment. Initiative 330 is a start, not an end in the restructuring of our systems. What is at issue is availability of physicians. If there are none in Yakima, then there is no local access to care. It might not be available across the mountains, perhaps in another state? Vote yes on I-330, no on I-336, so that young specialty physicians can see Yakima as their home.

Vote for health care
\
To the editor -- It's human nature to take things for granted. Our family, our friends, our careers and all the goods and services that our industrious society has provided for us are frequently forgotten in our daily lives. When we witness natural disasters, wars and pandemics, we are reminded that the gift of life that God has given us should not be wasted in the pursuit of anarchy or unnecessary conflict.
\
As we age, we eventually come to realize that we are not indestructible and must live with our frailties. We learn from our experiences to build the relationships that create value in our lives.
\
In 1997, I moved here from San Diego to join the Yakima Heart Center. The quality of cardiac care that was provided by the two local hospitals exceeded even the Scripps Hospitals, where I had come from. The death rate from a heart attack was 20 percent in the early 1990s. This rate has dropped to 2 percent to 5 percent, near the best in the country. The physicians, nurses and hospital support staff create these results. It is my belief that, even in Yakima, high quality health care is possible, but not guaranteed.
\
All politics are local, and the political issue today is whether we will support our own health. Or will we hope to suffer some injury, so that we can possibly split a monetary award with a personal injury attorney.
\
Please vote yes on Initiative 330 (and no on I-336) and play the Lottery for your chance at millions.

Grant County needs 'yes'
\
To the editor -- The Grant County Deputy Sheriff's Association strongly supports local Proposition 1, which would add one-tenth of 1 percent to the sales tax to support construction, operation and maintenance of the communications system serving public safety agencies in Grant County. The sales tax proposition spreads the cost of the communications system to all persons served, not just the property owners. This proposition assures that recreational visitors to our county will also help pay for the system that serves everyone.
\
Fire, law and ambulance services must be represented in an extensive review of our current radio system. Lack of coverage, deterioration of the existing system and inadequate structures for radio sites are immediate problems. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission has established deadlines in 2011 and 2013 that are requiring agencies to replace existing radios with ones that use only half the bandwidth per channel. County growth and the associated increased demand for service require planning for additional capacity at the dispatch facility.
\
One-tenth of 1 percent addition to our sales tax rate would take Grant County from 7.8 cents per dollar to 7.9 cents per dollar. This would be an increase of one penny on a $10 purchase or 10 cents on a $100 purchase.
\
Members of the Grant County Deputy Sheriff's Association ask for your support of Proposition 1 as a fair funding solution to a significant problem facing Grant County residents.

Stop specialist shortage
\
To the editor -- Initiative 330 discussion has generated more heat than light for one obvious reason; when the dust settles and the smoke blows away it's all about ""the money.""
\
Who gets the lion's share of the health-care dollar -- health- care providers or trial attorneys. Rest assured malpractice litigation is not going to disappear; courts have already determined you cannot be deprived of your constitutional right to sue. However 27 states have already enacted liability tort reform placing reasonable limits on noneconomic damages that allow insurers to actuarialize risk. In every one of these states, malpractice premiums for physicians have plummeted, allowing newly trained specialists to start new practices. Shortage of qualified specialists in obstetrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics and plastic/ reconstructive surgery in Yakima can be dated to the advent of malpractice premiums spiraling out of control.
\
There were once five neurosurgeons practicing in Yakima instead of one. A yes vote for I-330 will help get the trial attorney ""lottery-fee-genie"" back in the bottle.

Solve insurance crisis
\
To the editor -- I have never been sued for malpractice, yet the cost of my malpractice insurance has risen by 350 percent in five years. I endure certain comments about my driving; my wife hopes there is no correlation with how I perform surgery. I admit to a few fender-benders over the years -- yet our car insurance premiums have risen very little. Something is amiss.
\
Our Legislature seems unable to solve our malpractice insurance crisis. The Yakima Herald-Republic has called for a yes vote on both Initiatives 330 and the trial attorneys' reactionary proposal, I- 336, kicking it back to the Legislature for resolution. That, I believe, is wishful thinking, for our Legislature has established a track record of not addressing this insurance crisis that has now escalated to a doctor shortage crisis. The solution is to vote yes only on I-330, for if I-336 passes, we will have yet another state bureaucracy managing malpractice insurance -- at who knows what additional cost.
\
Unfortunately, if I-336 passes, doctors could be held hostage by malpractice attorneys using the threat of ""three strikes and you're out"" to obtain out-of-court settlements when no actual malpractice has occurred. Would anyone vote yes on the state yanking his or her driver's license after three fender-benders within a 10-year period? I doubt it.
\
I-330 was carefully formulated after studying tort reform measures in 27 other states. It should help stabilize health insurance premiums for everyone and will reduce physician malpractice premiums -- helping us to once again attract doctors to our state.

Don't vote away rights
\
To the editor -- Proponents of Initiative 330 state that ""jackpot"" justice and outrageous jury verdicts are the main culprit behind high malpractice premiums. They would like us to believe that ""frivolous"" lawsuits have driven doctors' insurance premiums so high that doctors are leaving the state in droves.
\
They have, however, provided no actual evidence of any of this. To date, I have not heard of one specific jury verdict in the last 10 years where someone hit the ""jackpot"" on a ""frivolous"" medical malpractice case. I am sure that if such cases existed, the insurance industry would be telling the public all about them in its lawyer bashing ads.
\
Beware voters, the insurance industry wants to take away your right to a jury and place a cap on damages in the event you are the victim of medical malpractice. However, the insurance industry has not stated it would lower malpractice premiums if I-330 becomes law. Sounds like a raw deal to me.
\
Don't give away your rights for nothing in return. Vote no on I- 330.

Medical-care access
\
To the editor -- I have practiced medicine for 31 years in Yakima initially in emergency medicine and now in occupational medicine. This is my first letter to the editor about any topic.
\
I have watched several good physicians leave Yakima in the last few years and have tried to recruit physicians to join a medical practice in Yakima. There is a common theme in discussions with both groups. Expenses to practice keep rising but lag behind income. A major factor in medical practice expense is malpractice insurance. Without placing some limits on pain and suffering awards, the malpractice insurers cannot reliably predict potential settlement amounts. This continues to drive up premium costs.
\
Initiative 330 helps make this more predictable and will help restore balance in this difficult and confusing situation. I-330 does not limit reimbursements for medical costs or loss of income. Pain and suffering can not be accurately defined in dollar amounts. I-330 proposes $350,000 as a ceiling on most pain and suffering awards. That is more than other states have offered in their tort reform packages.
\
Despite the confusing statistics quoted by those with vested interests in seeing I-330 defeated, the states where caps on pain and suffering awards have been passed have an easier time retaining and recruiting physicians. These states also seem to stabilize the increases in malpractice insurance premiums. If you think it is good to improve access to medical care in our community and in our state, vote yes on I-330 and no on I-336.

Settle issue in Olympia
\
To the editor -- Does anyone see the real problem with Initiative 330 and Initiative 336? Yes, they are difficult to read and understand; both claim to be looking out for the rights of the patients and the public. Each initiative promises to save us loads of money, like the insurance industry and the trial lawyers don't really want our money. Sure, I believe that.
\
The thing that has bothered me the most about this is why is this issue being settled as an initiative? Why was it not handled by our elected officials? This is a issue that requires more information than is given in the voter pamphlet statements, information that our state representatives have ready access to and should have used to settle the issue as a change in law.
\
I may be simple in my outlook on these things, but the initiative process should be a last resort used when our elected officials do something we disagree with or something too stupid to be allowed. They should have dealt with it with all the information, not us with only part of the information. Good luck with this vote.

Kobes serves Selah well
\
To the editor -- I would like to recognize the outstanding job Councilman Jerry Kobes is doing for Selah citizens. I'm a lifelong community resident and appreciate his long-term commitment to Selah's controlled growth.
\
Jerry Kobes is on different council subcommittees from finances to public safety. On the public safety committee he is in constant contact with our police and fire departments. Our fire department is a city and a fire district that includes some 65 square miles and 20,000-plus citizens. Jerry Kobes attends a majority of the Yakima County Fire Protection District No. 2 monthly meetings to make sure the City Council, mayor and the district fire commissioners are working together for a common goal, the protection of life and property.
\
A few years ago, Jerry Kobes was a key player, when the Joint Agreement was rewritten for fire protection for both identities. This is interoperability at its best and a savings for taxpayers. He is committed to the public's well-being and fosters public safety and disaster planning.
\
Jerry Kobes has been on the Selah Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, helping to better our community. A longtime member of the Selah Community Days Committee, he has put in countless hours of planning and work for the weeklong festival, as well as assisting on our award-winning parade float.
\
We don't need a new face, when we already have strong leadership, commitment, experience and a love of the Selah Community.
\
Please help re-elect Jerry Kobes to the Selah City Council.

Elect Cawley to Council
\
To the editor -- I am writing this letter to let you know about a young man that I met several years ago. He is industrious, energetic and forward thinking. This person is Micah Cawley and he is running for Yakima City Council.
\
He has the desire to learn and the passion for improving the city and the quality of life for Yakima residents. He is such a positive person, always looking for answers and never giving up. He is committed to being a voice for all the citizens of Yakima. Although Micah is young, and may have limited ""big"" business experience, he is far more focused and hard-working than many people twice his age. He has fresh new ideas that will help solve the issues that we face.
\
I like the idea of a councilperson who will bring new ideas as well as someone who is willing to make things happen. Micah Cawley is that person and I would highly recommend him for the Yakima City Council.

Cut bureaucratic waste
\
To the editor -- Recently I met a Puget Sound area county deputy who commutes daily across the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. I asked, how's that second bridge construction? He said the towers are up and stringing the cables, but I heard a tone of discontent. He elaborated that the total capacity of the two bridges would not exceed the current capacity of the single Tacoma Narrows Bridge, because the state Department of Transportation redesigned traffic lane widths and High Occupancy Vehicle lanes.
\
Also proposing tollbooths charging $4 per crossing. For a daily commuter that is $40 a week, $160 a month, $2,000 per year! Plus tax increases every which way conceived and deceived. What do you get for your additional tax dollar investments? Nothing more than what is currently offered. He'll be voting for Initiative 912, repealing the gas tax and every opportunity to vote against any new taxes/tax increases.
\
Olympia does not get it. Washington voters must send another message, as they did with Referendum 51.
\
We hear the political scare tactics of all the projects that we will be denied should we vote against these taxes. Transportation is a two-way street. Vote against the irresponsible and ludicrous spending of our tax dollars. Vote against taxes and demand the reduction, termination and elimination of all the bureaucratic levels that won't be needed for the projects we have been threatened of losing!
\
If Washington had performance audits, transportation taxation would not be an issue. Brain flash! Strong reason to also vote for Initiative 900.

Torres-Senz right for job
\
To the editor -- Dr. Jorge Torres-Senz is the right person for the Yakima School District Board of Directors.
\
Jorge's motivation to serve on the board is to collectively and collaboratively enhance quality education for all students in the Yakima School District.
\
My wife, Maggie, and I opt to vote for Dr. Torres-Senz for Position No. 2 for the Yakima school board in the November election.
\
We are conclusively optimistic that Dr. Torres-Senz is the precise person for the position. He is a strong supporter and advocate for quality education for all children. Jorge exemplifies a vital role in the quality of education and the subject of access to education as an important concern to him.
\
Jorge and his wife, Aurora, are community members and advocates and supporters of quality education for all children in the Yakima School District. Jorge's involvement in school affairs and education is evidence that he is the right person for the position.
\
Jorge possesses exceptional listening skills, communication and interpersonal skills that can be seen in his professional and community work, along with the programs he facilitates in Yakima schools for parents and children.
\
Jorge is dedicated, committed, meticulously organized and well prepared to assist the Yakima School District board with the many challenges that face our district.
\
Jorge has our vote!

Vote for economic growth
\
To the editor -- I have been involved in the city of Yakima community issues for over 15 years. It has only been the last two years where I have been able to influence the community in a bigger fashion.
\
We are at a critical phase in new projects being put forward in our community and we need visionary and experience people.
\
A group of community leaders traveled to Everett on Oct. l3 and met with Everett city officials and others who were part of that revitalization effort. Every person came back with added valuable knowledge to bring back to our community.
\
I was impressed with the chemistry between Rockey Marshall, Bernie Sims and Paul George at the Everett trip.
\
Rockey's opponent has only been in the city of Yakima a couple of years. Rockey will be tough on crime unlike his opponent who has spent years in Toppenish where crime has risen.
\
Bernard Sims' opponent may have potential in the future, but I have yet to see him be on one committee with any responsibility. He has one-liner answers, but I'm afraid that will not help in major decisions.
\
Paul's opponent talks about waste in City Hall, but I have yet to hear any solution to cover expenses or problems facing the city.
\
Vote for the future economic growth and I'm asking you to support Rockey Marshall, Position 1, Bernie J. Sims, Position 2, and Mayor Paul George, Position 3

Mayor should listen
\
To the editor -- Re: The Oct. 13 editorial: I really object to some of the comments that have been printed. Did you forget why the supposed ""gang of four"" was elected? The mayor and his supporters on the former Union Gap City Council tried to take land from landowners on McNair Avenue and other streets in the northeast area of Union Gap. After that people in the northeast and west Union Gap wanted council members in office who would listen to their concerns. They wanted to have a voice in the city government, not the dictatorship it had become. If you watch Y-Pac or been to City Council meetings you know what I'm talking about.
\
To say that the four council members are the cause of the problems is very wrong. The council members did pass the budget last fall and it was the mayor who refused to sign it.
\
Wasn't it the city manager, who works directly for the mayor, who would not furnish requested information to the council? I haven't heard the city employees, firemen and policemen, complaining about the supposed ""gang of four."" If anything, they have tried to resolve the problems and always are met with resistance from the mayor.
\
Instead of complaining that four duly elected council members need to learn to work with the present mayor, maybe the mayor needs to listen to his council. Just maybe they have some worthwhile input!

206,"
State legislators who represent Clark County told an audience of business and civic leaders Friday they will work in the 2007 session to address the county's urgent transportation, school construction and affordable housing needs.
\
The annual legislative preview breakfast at the Hilton Vancouver Washington is sponsored by the Greater Vancouver Chamber of Commerce, Identity Clark County and the Columbia River Economic Development Council.
\
This year's event drew seven members of the Clark County delegation, four Democrats -- Sen. Craig Pridemore and Reps. Bill Fromhold, Jim Moeller and Deb Wallace -- and three Republicans -- Reps. Richard Curtis, Ed Orcutt and Bruce Chandler.
\
They tossed out ideas on issues ranging from Medicaid reimbursement to global warming.
\
But the underlying theme of the event was taxes -- how to collect them and where to spend them to benefit Clark County in a year when the state is flush with $1.9 billion in carryover funds.
\
Curtis, R-La Center, a member of the House Education Committee, said he will introduce a bill to do away with the impact fees governments charge developers to pay for new school construction. Passed on to purchasers, those fees add thousands of dollars to the price of new houses in fast-growing districts like Battle Ground.
\
Instead, Curtis wants the state to dedicate $50 million annually to school construction costs from its 1.28 percent excise tax levied on real estate sales. Extra help would go to the state's fastest- growing districts.
\
The sponsoring business groups have their own agenda. They want lawmakers to give cities and counties more funding options, including the authority to impose a local gas tax and a local vehicle tax without a vote of the people.
\
They also want a more comprehensive tax-increment financing law, expanded tax credits for funding downtown revitalization projects, and protection for state gas tax funds earmarked for regional transportation improvements.
\
The Vancouver City Council voted recently not to revive a business-and-occupation tax to pay for city road projects, which it could have imposed without a public vote. Instead, it levied a per- employee business surcharge to raise a portion of what it needs and is asking the Legislature for permission to add $20 to vehicle registration fees without a public vote.
\
That could be a tough sell in Olympia, said Mark Brown, a lobbyist for the city. Local governments in Washington already have several options for raising revenue without going to voters, and some jurisdictions, including the city of Seattle, have recently done the hard work of winning voter approval for transportation funding measures.
\
No income tax
\
A question from the audience about whether the next Legislature is likely to consider a state income tax brought this quip from Fromhold, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee: ""Does the term 'cold day in hell' mean anything to you?""
\
Fromhold noted that House Finance Committee Chairman Jim McIntire, a Seattle Democrat, lost his chairmanship for 2007 because he supported a state income tax. An income tax might actually benefit Washington residents, Fromhold said. ""But I don't think it will happen in my lifetime.""
\
Orcutt, ranking Republican on the House Finance Committee, said he opposes an income tax because it ""would take revenue out of the economy faster than the sales tax. ""
\
Moeller took the opportunity to promote his proposal for a once- a-year sales tax holiday, a weekend in August when the state would waive the sales tax on clothing, shoes, school supplies, textbooks and computers to encourage families in border counties to shop in Washington.
\
""We can't always compete with Oregon, but a sales tax holiday would benefit businesses,"" Moeller said. ""They could market it to increase their sales.""
\
On another tax matter, Wallace was asked whether she supports doing away with the 60 percent supermajority requirement for passage of property tax levies and bond measures for schools, libraries and other taxing districts. Wallace noted that she supported a successful House bill this year that would have done away with the supermajority requirement for operations levies. A companion Senate bill failed.
\
""I think this will be the year it passes in the Senate,"" Wallace said.
\
Ecology debate
\
A question about the Department of Ecology's controversial new stormwater management rules sparked a spirited debate.
\
Orcutt said the governor should be required to sign such rules so voters could hold her accountable if the rules end up hurting businesses. ""Or let them come through the Legislature, because they have the effect of laws,"" he said.
\
Chandler said the problem isn't so much the rules, which serve an important purpose, but the way Ecology implements them.
\
""It's important to keep in mind the enormous investment the state has made in salmon habitat,"" he said. ""We aren't just complying with the Endangered Species Act, we are trying to restore salmon populations.""
\
The problem, he said, is that state regulators ""never tell you what the goal is, and that's why the Department of Ecology is so universally popular... No one feels they are treated fairly, and every county pays a different price. ""
\
That drew applause from the business crowd. But Pridemore defended the state's environmental rule-making, saying that one- size-fits-all rules don't always make sense in a diverse state like Washington.
\
Scott Walstra, government affairs director for the chamber and the panel's moderator, threw out the last question. He asked each legislator to discuss how the state should address global warming.
\
""With prudence and caution,"" Curtis said. ""Global warming is cyclical. There are things we can do to slow it down. I do not think it is cause for panic."" The state's investment in alternative fuels is a start, he said.
\
""We need to make sure we don't drive manufacturing jobs from an area where we have protections for air and water to areas that have none,"" said Orcutt.
\
But Pridemore said Washington's economic vitality proves it's possible to protect the environment and create jobs. The threat posed by global warming is urgent, he said, and not something the state can ignore. ""Thirty years from now, there will no longer be year-round ice in the Arctic.""
\
""We only have one planet, and we abuse it at our peril,"" Moeller agreed. ""We need to be a leader. We need to join the rest of the world. ""
"
207,"
Among the six candidates running for seats in the 49th Legislative District, Republican Craig Schmidt is a rarity.
\
Some candidates work part time. Others are full-time office seekers.
\
Not Schmidt. He spends his days driving a garbage truck, his nights and weekends running for office.
\
""It's not easy,"" he said about juggling work and politics. ""It's like working two plus jobs. It's like getting only four hours of sleep a day.""
\
It doesn't help that Schmidt is challenging state Rep. Val Ogden, D-Vancouver, one of the area's most experienced legislators. With state Sen. Al Bauer's retirement, Ogden will become the dean of Clark County's delegation should she win a sixth two-year term next month.
\
Ogden won a resounding 62.8 percent of the vote in the Sept. 19 primary election, leaving Schmidt a huge gap to try to make up in seven short weeks.
\
Ogden believes she can win an more lopsided victory in the Nov. 7 election by getting more people out to vote.
\
""I have tried to be very open about who I am and how I've voted,"" she said. ""My record is there. I have tried to be very responsive to the constituents.""
\
Schmidt also is looking for a heavy turnout, but he believes these voters will support a new face.
\
'Pass the baton'
\
""They're looking for a change,"" he said. ""I think it's time she passed the baton on to us.""
\
The contest has been fairly free of acrimony, except for Schmidt's radio commercials criticizing Ogden on taxes.
\
""My opponent has voted for every increase there has been,"" Schmidt said. ""She wants to continue to take more money away from us while I want to try to give it back to the people.""
\
Ogden said she supported a tax increase in 1993 when the state had a huge budget deficit, but Schmidt neglects to mention she voted to remove it two years later.
\
""I've voted for the budget to provide services, and that does include taxes, of course,"" she said. ""But I really don't think he knows what he is talking about.""
\
Ogden said she would like to know what tax increase her opponent is referring to, a question Schmidt did not directly answer.
\
""When you look at the record, you will see she has voted for tax increases,"" he said. ""I don't think that's negative. It's just stating a fact.""
\
Schmidt said he wants to reduce taxes and loosen restrictions on small businesses so they can grow and create more jobs, thereby reducing the number of Clark County residents working in Oregon and paying that state's high income tax.
\
Schmidt is a strong supporter of building a third bridge across the Columbia River somewhere near Ridgefield that would connect with Highway 30 in Oregon.
\
New bridge
\
A new bridge would divert some of the truck traffic that now travels down Interstate 5 to the Port of Portland, ""which is going to relieve a lot of stress and congestion we have right now,"" he said.
\
To free up more money for transportation, Schmidt supports phasing out ineffective state programs, but he didn't offer any examples.
\
""That's why I would want to sit down with the other legislators, other groups of people,"" he said.
\
Ogden said she wants to see what recommendations come from Gov. Gary Locke's ""blue ribbon"" transportation commission.
\
In the past, Ogden has been open to a gas tax increase. With near- record prices at the pump, a gas tax increase is no longer a viable alternative, she said.
\
""If we get desperate enough and decide to try it, I think it will probably be a referendum,"" she said.
\
On education
\
On education, Ogden supports allocating more state dollars to school construction. The Legislature took a step in this direction by passing the ""kicker bill"" that tinkered with Initiative 601 and allowed some of the budget surplus to be used for school construction, she said.
\
Ogden supports Initiative 732, which calls for teachers and other school employees to receive cost-of-living salary adjustments every year, but she worries that a 2 percent annual increase isn't enough.
\
""If we can't attract new teachers and our beginning salary is very low, we're going to have a problem because many of our experienced teachers are retiring,"" she said.
\
Schmidt said he supports competition in education through charter schools and possibly vouchers for parents who send their children to private schools.
\
""It's time we get things back to local control,"" he said. ""I'm kind of tired, and I know a lot of people are, of big governing dictating and demanding.""
\
Schmidt also believes the state could phase out the Growth Management Act.
\
""It's confining people in a box and causing problems,"" he said. ""People are starting to get a little irritated.""
\
Ogden said she will continue seeking new laws to protect consumers from shoddy or incomplete work by home builders and contractors.
\
She says that, If she can't get it done next year, she'll push the Legislature to set up a commission that would include home builders, legislators and others to return with a specific proposal by December 2001.
\
""I'm going to put the ball in their court because they've admitted there are some problems,"" Ogden said.

208,"Pat Sciuchetti can be reached at (509) 927-2164 or by e-mail at pats@spokesman.com. See candidate profile by name. This sidebar appeared with the story: WHERE THEY STAND... THE ISSUES Here are the positions on selected issues of the two candidates for Washington's Fourth Legislative District House seat 1. LARRY CROUSE, REPUBLICAN BIGGEST ISSUE: If Referendum 49 fails, transportation funding. If it passes, education. Supports proposals to improve school safety and ensure public schoolteachers are qualified. REGIONAL ADVOCATE: Funding appears disproportionate because West Side has received big-ticket items recently. Believes East Side's turn is coming. Will push for funding Spokane Convention Center expansion, Mirabeau Point and North-South Freeway. GAMBLING: Opposes gambling due to social costs; willing to consider additional restrictions or limits. Disappointed that gaming has expanded. BUDGET: Spend more on transportation. Supports additional personal and business tax cuts. Would consider cuts to some Department of Social and Health Services programs. TRANSPORTATION: Supports Referendum 49, but admits it doesn't provide long-term planning and funding. It would give Legislature time to create a long-term plan. EDUCATION: Supports vouchers. Public schools would do better job if they face true competition and threat of student loss. Schools should focus on core academic subjects. FIELD-BURNING: Supports existing ban on bluegrass field burning because people are suffering from poor air quality. Undecided on additional limits. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT: Legislature has passed numerous crime laws. Now is time to enforce them and review effectiveness. Criminals should serve full sentences. Would support additional prison construction if needed so prisoners serve out sentences. RICHARD REED, DEMOCRAT BIGGEST ISSUE: Transportation. There will be scramble for money by affected general fund programs if Referendum 49 passes. If it fails, Legislature must find alternative funding. REGIONAL ADVOCATE: West Side receives more than fair share of funding. Wants to promote more East Side tourism, so potential visitors are aware of forests, parks, other attractions. GAMBLING: State shouldn't promote gambling. State should not allow tribes to set up gambling operations on purchased land. BUDGET: Spend more on Basic Health Plan, class size reduction and community college class offerings. Spend less on growth and economic development programs. TRANSPORTATION: Opposes Referendum 49 because it will hurt other state programs. Longer-term funding plan needed. Supports light rail and other projects to protect environment and save money in long run. EDUCATION: Give teachers more freedom to try new things within the public school classroom. Don't take money away from the public school system for private-school vouchers. FIELD BURNING: Supports existing ban on bluegrass field burning. Says it's bad agricultural practice to waste nutrients in straw by burning. People and health should come before money. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT: Criminals aren't deterred by tougher sentences. Supports preventative crime programs instead, especially for children. Opposes costly practice of locking up non-violent criminals. Supports expansion of alternatives such as house arrest.\  Larry Crouse isn't shy about his confidence.\ The 4th District legislator is so certain Valley voters will return him to office on Nov. 3, he's spent his campaign largely ignoring his Democratic challenger, Richard ""Rico"" Reed.\ Crouse, 53, admits he's done very little fund raising and advertising. Early on, he decided not to bother with a campaign manager.\ ""(Reed) didn't seem to pose any threat,"" the two-term Republican representative said. ""He (just) forced me to put up a few signs.""\ For his part, Reed admits he was a reluctant candidate. A stay-at- home father with two junior high school-age children, he didn't like the idea of taking time away from his family.\ In the end, he said he decided to run ""for my kids.""\ A Democratic party activist, he also wanted to give Valley voters a choice.\ The choice will be a clear one. Crouse and Reed are polar opposites on many major issues, including transportation funding, education funding and crime and punishment.\ Reed, 53, supports increased funding for education, health care and some other areas of government.\ With the exception of transportation, Crouse opposes new spending. One of Crouse's biggest disappointments during his two terms has been his party's inability to get into state agencies and ferret out inefficiencies. He still believes there's much bureaucratic fat to be cut.\ Another disappointment has been his party's inability to ban partial-birth abortions.\ Crouse is strongly anti-abortion. Reed is strongly for abortion rights. Reed opposes Referendum 49, the Republicans' transportation funding plan, believing it will lead to cuts in general fund programs. He prefers ""paying as you go,"" with funding from gas tax increases.\ Crouse supports the referendum, but admits it's a short-term solution. If passed, he said, it will give legislators time to do some long-term transportation planning.\ Reed opposes taking funding away from public schools through vouchers. He'd like to increase funding for community colleges. He'd also like to see schools offer summer programs for students who have fallen behind.\ Reed wishes schools would work harder to teach cooperation and problem-solving, instead of rewarding competition and selfishness. He believes too many teachers are hired simply because they're coaches.\ Crouse supports competition - at least for enrollment. He believes vouchers would force public schools to improve.\ Crouse also believes schools need to become safer. Teachers, he said, must be tested for competency and children need to be ""required to learn.""\ Reed wants fewer nonviolent criminals in prison. Crouse wants to see all criminals forced to serve their full sentences.\ Crouse believes a large part of his job as legislator is stopping bad ideas. It's a philosophy espoused by Sen. Bob McCaslin, whose seat Crouse hopes to someday fill.\ ""It's not so much what I've passed, it's what I haven't passed,"" said Crouse, who believes he helped the state by killing a major energy deregulation bill last session.\ Crouse, who serves as chairman of the House Energy and Utilities Committee, believes his seniority alone makes him a better choice for voters.\ Reed believes voters would benefit from his new ideas.\ One of those is the creation of a universal no-fault liability insurance pool for motorists.\ Drivers would pay for it ""at the pump,"" through a gas tax increase. That, he said, would force all drivers to be covered."

Cutting your personal carbon footprint?
\
Thats so 2007.
\
Ask any green-minded local government leader: The big new decisions about the future of the planet arent being made in car lots, corporate boardrooms or even Congress. Theyre being made by your city council.
\
The battle lines run straight through our daily lives: grocery bags, yard sizes, parking meters.
\
You know, the sorts of things that are too important for presidential candidates to talk about.
\
Heres the question: What can communities do for the environment that individuals cant do alone?
\
In the next two weeks, Vancouver plans to release a mountain of data on this question: the first estimate of the whole citys carbon footprint, said Mike Piper, the citys sustainability coordinator.
\
Until last year, Pipers job didnt exist. This spring, his counterpart Pete DuBois was the first in the same position at Clark County.
\
Now, with human-caused global warming atop the green movements hit list, the search is on to find simple, small policies that encourage individuals to save energy and to kick out the legal barriers that have made it hard for individuals to do so.
\
Solutions like that may sound good, at least to environmentalists. But they dont come without a downside.
\
How much will each cost? And how much good would each do?
\
By this time next year, well all be talking about carbon, Piper said.
\
Our whole language will change.
\
Read up. Theres an exam on the way.
\
Cottage zoning
\
Why do it?
\
A 1,000-square-foot house uses less than half the energy of a 3,000-square-foot home, but local development codes treat the two identically so small houses rarely pay off for builders. A few Washington cities already have laws giving developers permission to build several small houses on a lot instead of one big one.
\
Why we dont.
\
Itd be a headache: New codes would take months to write, said county traffic planner Steve Schulte. And more homes mean more traffic, no matter the size.
\
HOV lanes
\
Why do it?
\
Cars and trucks account for 20 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted in the United States; 77 percent of Americans get to work by driving alone. The biggest unused capacity in the transportation system, DuBois said, is the seat next to you.
\
Why we dont.
\
Washingtons DOT cant offer evidence that HOV lanes actually create new carpools, and an academic study has found that they make no difference. They may attract bus riders, but theres no proof of that, either. A brief HOV lane experiment in Vancouver shaved three to six minutes for bus commuters, but motorists mostly hated it.
\
Local carbon tax
\
Why do it?
\
If all these trade-offs make your head spin, youre not alone. But theres one sure way to guarantee less energy gets consumed: raise its price. A local gas tax would mean less driving.
\
Why we dont.
\
Set aside the complaints from citizens, especially poorer ones. Gas stations would scream enough for everybody. Last winter, Eugene hiked its gas tax 2 cents per gallon. Stations were so convinced itd send drivers outside city limits that they said theyd prefer a 14-cent hike in the statewide tax.
\
Expensive parking meters
\
Why do it?
\
Any commercial developer will tell you: free parking spaces arent. They occupy valuable space. Yet we subsidize drivers by making parking cheap. UCLA professor Donald Shoup figured that each free parking space at his school lured drivers onto the road an extra 727 miles each month.
\
Why we dont.
\
If meters dont appear everywhere, drivers cruise to find free spots and if everybody drives an extra half-mile, a third of the benefit disappears. We are still very much of a sprawl community, said the countys Pete DuBois. Youll always be able to find free parking somehow.
\
Car sharing
\
Why do it?
\
The typical auto is parked 23 hours a day. Counting wear, tear and insurance, its owner pays $26 for that one hour of driving. If you could sell your car and use a $9.50 Zipcar for errands, youd save lots and probably drive less. Cities might sweeten the deal by subsidizing car-share sites or putting special car-share/carpool parking spaces right next to handicapped parking.
\
Why we dont.
\
Car-sharing doesnt pay unless people can ditch their personal cars. Thats unlikely. This year, even King County is letting a Zipcar subsidy program expire.
\
Long east-west blocks
\
Why do it?
\
The U.S. Green Building Council extolls a simple concept: blocks that run mostly east-west instead of north-south will have more south-facing roofs and windows. The roofs are great for solar panels, and south-facing windows can cut winter heating bills by 30 percent.
\
Why we dont.
\
Developers hate restrictions on how to arrange lots, and with reason: more rules can mean fewer lots, and fewer lots mean less money. So they must make up the difference by charging more for each house, and buyers are price sensitive.
\
Bike lanes
\
Why do it?
\
Since 1990, Portland has tripled its bike lane and bike path network to 266 miles. In that time, its number of bicycle commuters grew 263 percent, compared with 11 percent nationwide. Today, Portland is the top bicycling city in the country. Interest could be high here.
\
Why we dont.
\
Bike lanes cost money (about $232,000 per mile just for paving) and occupy space (in Clark County, bike lanes consume 14 percent of each new major road). But even in Portland, only 3.5 percent of commutes are pedal-powered. In Clark County today, the bicycling rate is 0.6 percent, half what Portlands was in 1990.
\
Ban grocery bags
\
Why do it?
\
Paper? Plastic? It all took energy to make. If every household bought a few durable, nonwoven plastic grocery bags and reused them for a couple years, the energy savings would be about 180,000 British thermal units, about the same as running a TV for six months straight, an Australian study found.
\
Why we dont.
\
A ban, like San Francisco recently enacted, is harsh: What happens when you forget your bag? Other cities are adding taxes of 10 to 20 cents per disposable bag. The catch: Should it apply to Target? Battle Ground Pharmacy? Muchas Gracias?
\
Public loans for self-powered houses
\
Why do it?
\
In June, Berkeley, Calif., launched a program that could jump-start small-scale solar or wind production. The city uses its access to low interest rates to borrow money for residents to invest in solar panels. The government recoups the money by hiking the property taxes which are income tax-deductible. The combination makes solar panels dirt cheap.
\
Why we dont.
\
Vancouver aint Berkeley and not just because Hummers probably outnumber hippies. We get between 14 and 38 percent less sunlight. If a Clark County program couldnt attract buyers, it would flop.
\
Solar access
\
Why do it?
\
Even Clark Countys dim sunlight can power photovoltaic panels. A 100-square-foot roof panel here can put out 1,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power annually, according to Seattles Northwest Solar Center. But today, no law guarantees that their neighbors wont build (or grow) something that blocks the light.
\
Why we dont.
\
For the average family a rooftop panel would only cut the electric bill by 10 percent. But a solar access ordinance might make it harder to build tall, dense neighborhoods which can cut transportation costs by 30 percent, dwarfing any solar power benefit.

Still more school debate
\
I am voting ""no"" on the Evergreen School District levies and bonds. The reason is the uncontrolled growth in the county.
\
The developers approached the Evergreen School Board and asked if the schools could handle additional students. Board members graciously said ""yes,"" so they are going to have to dig deep to come up with the money. I will continue to vote ""no"" on all school levies as a protest of uncontrolled growth.
\
We already have gridlock in our area. It is next to impossible to cross Northeast 164th Avenue without putting your life on the line. There are days when there are 10 cars waiting for a break in the traffic so that they can cross.We are going to have to live with the discomfort for three years -- the time frame that the county graciously gave the developers to widen our roads and put in stop lights.
\
I moved here 25 years ago so I could enjoy the country and raise a family and livestock. Our land has been rezoned, and I see our family as being taxed off our land because of sewer and water rates.
\
Developments are being cleared and regulations sidestepped at a fast rate, disregarding local dissent. One wonders if hearings examiners are in collusion with the developers or if kickbacks or payoffs are occurring.
\
People who are unhappy with this uncontrolled growth should join me in protest.
\
M. K. Redlinger
\
Vancouver
\
Why incur another $106 million on top of $69 million in bonds that Evergreen School District taxpayers still owe from 1977-78? That indebtedness is not adding one teacher or improving education.
\
The state Basic Education Act provides sufficient funding for our local schools -- $9,000 per student per year, which includes one teacher for every 27 students. The large increase in local property taxes that Evergreen proposes is not justified.
\
How can we accept and pour more dollars into a system that is producing students whose standardized test scores are below national norms and state averages? There seems to be no correlation between education tax dollars spent and quality education.
\
Frances Rutherford
\
Vancouver
\
A number of recent letters have decried the low average test scores in Washougal schools. This has been cited as a reason not to support passage of Tuesday's bond measure.
\
One must keep in mind that those scores represent averages -- not the full spectrum achieved. And Washougal chooses to test all of its students, even the special-needs children whose scores are frequently lower; not all districts do that.
\
All three of our daughters have scored in the 95th to 99th percentile in one or more areas on the standardized tests every year. They are not the only students like that in Washougal schools. Washougal High School's SAT scores have been ranked first and second in the county the last two years. It is very possible for students to obtain a good education in Washougal schools -- but effort is required on the part of the student.
\
The need for facility enlargement and improvement is real. Our obligation to provide for our own community's needs is real. I urge voters to disregard the naysayers and vote ""yes"" for Washougal schools.

Programs needed
\
The April 24 editorial, ""Our kids count, but only if we help them,"" and the April 25 editorial, ""Community offers help to kids on the street,"" call our attention to efforts to meet the critical needs of homeless or neglected children and youth. They are a wake-up call to all of us concerning the grave danger in which so many children are living right here in Clark County.
\
While politicians and lobbyists harangue government and voters for tougher sentencing and more prisons, we are overlooking the most critical need:Unless we provide a safe environment, protection from neglect and abuse, equal and adequate education and opportunity for all children, an alarming proportion of them will ensure the need for more welfare and prisons.
\
This must include greater compassion and support for families at risk. These two editorials and many other stories of the love and care expended in both private and professional groups demonstrate what is being achieved. The hope to bond all of these efforts can become a reality. The leadership is here.
\
Let all of us who say we love and care about children provide our support, volunteer help, be willing to pay the cost in taxes or approval for use of feasible sites, so that no youth will leave the teen years without adequate intellectual and spiritual preparation to assume his or her place in adult life with joy and confidence.

Immigrants speak well
\
In response to Joshua J. Dodson's May 1 letter, ""Speak English or get out,"" Mexicans or any other ethnic group in the United States do not expect us to learn their language when they come to this country or even if we go to their country.
\
The majority of immigrants who live here know English well enough to communicate effectively. Many of the people whom Dodson said should leave speak more than two languages. How many does Dodson speak? Who was Dodson referring to when he said ""our language?"" Where are these people supposed to ""get out"" to? Back to their ""own"" country?
\
If Dodson is speaking of ethnicity, then he should go back to his own country -- unless he is full-blooded Native American.

Priorities skewed
\
Clark County's recent publication titled ""Technology, what has it done for us lately?"" talks about the county's increase in technology and improved office efficiency, its better computer service to the community and to those that do business with the county. But at what cost?
\
While county employees enjoy new computers, databases that allow them to print impressive pictures and the ability to find data in five seconds rather than 10, they are preparing to lay off sheriff's deputies. Is county government here to serve the citizens or the county employees?
\
With the tremendous increase in county population, traffic and crime, it is appalling that the county actually reduced the sheriff's budget. Where once a deputy would call, now you will receive a form. (Remember the news article a while back that reported a person was threatened and 9-1-1 said it would send a form?)
\
County officials serve themselves rather than those who pay taxes. When was the last time you saw a sheriff's patrol car? Why are services to taxpayer cut while those who run the county assure themselves of new cars and computers? We deserve an explanation.

Wage raises discussed
\
Increasing the minimum wage would have the short-term effect of increasing the minimum-wage earner's buying power, but it would have a long-term effect of decreasing that same wage earner's buying power.
\
When such a law takes affect, wages go up and people are happy. But businesses must make a profit, so prices also go up to compensate for increased salary expenses.
\
In addition, the increase causes a ripple effect through businesses as workers who used to earn substantially more than minimum wage find themselves at or close to minimum wage. They become unhappy and demand a similar pay increase, and soon everyone has an increase in wages. These same people will pay for it with an increase in product and service prices, and therefore will not be able to buy more nor save more.
\
In the long term, people will have less buying power -- and more taxes. They will earn more and pay more income tax. They will spend more for the same merchandise and pay more sales tax. The winners in the increase in minimum wage are not workers but politicians who have, once again, increased their coffers at our expense.
\
Ron Bremer
\
Vancouver
\
Tightwad Republicans refuse to raise the minimum wage by 95 cents an hour. The same idiots want to rescind the huge Clinton gas tax increase of 4.3 cents a gallon. This would save workers denied a wage increase a staggering 86 cents on a 20-gallon fill-up.
\
Goofy NewtGingrich is spearheading the effort to repeal the gas tax. He is closely followed by blinky Bob Dole.
\
It's no wonder these clowns quadrupled the national debt from less than $1 trillion in 1980 to more than $4 trillion in 1992 after their decade of greed. They are always piling on the national debt while talking about a balanced-budget amendment.

TCI ignored testimony
\
On May 1 I learned for the first time what it feels like to feel utterly helpless.
\
I went to Vancouver City Hall and listened to TCItell the cable commission, the audience and the many people listening on the radio that it is raising cable rates -- like it or lump it.
\
Three suits sat there like neighborhood bullies, talking to each other, while people in the audience explained how hard it was going to be for the many who live on fixed incomes to be able to continue to enjoy having cable.
\
TCI couldn't care less what anyone thinks, but it assured the audience that it would continue to give a discount to those older than 65 or those who are physically handicapped. How much is 5 percent less than too much?

211,"FOCUS ON CENTRAL AMERICA\I am troubled by the lack of enforcement of our southern borders and in particular of the stream of children coming from the violent Central American countries through Mexico.\We supply millions of dollars of munitions and arms to the bloody combatants in the Middle East who have savaged each other for centuries, and will continue their slaughter that their religions seem to accept. Why not spend this money in Central America to end the violence there, which I understand is the main reason for this giant exodus? This would be a humanitarian thing to do that would have long-term advantages for them as well as for us.\And to encourage Mexico to help stop traffic through their country, how about stopping our corporations from relocating to Mexico?\Ray Betts\Spokane\NEED LIBERALS TO STEP UP\It is a point of pride that conservatives like me turned on their president (Richard Nixon) when it became clear that he had violated his oath of office during the Watergate cover-up. The means do not justify the ends, and no president is above the law. Liberals trumpeted these lessons for decades as a warning against an imperial presidency.\Will liberals, progressives and Democrats do now what Republicans did in 1973-1974? Will people of good will on the left agree that people of any ideology should oppose any administration that uses the Internal Revenue Service to punish political opponents and then covers it up (Lois Lerner)? Also, will they condemn those who assigned the National Security Agency to monitor literally everyone's electronic communications? Will they agree that today's children's crusade was created by all levels of our government refusing to enforce immigration laws?\Enlightened self-interest wedded to common sense should be universal virtues. Compassion for those in need is not a suicide pact. While wanting to see one's own ideas vindicated is nice, living in a pluralistic society that transcends your own vision and includes genuine diversity is far better. Conservatives and moderates alone cannot save us.\Liberals, America needs you.\Ralph Ginorio\Coeur d'Alene\SAY NO TO NAYSAYER\In a fundraising letter, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers criticized the Affordable Care Act. No surprise. She led in 54 repeal votes, as well as advancing the 18-day government shutdown. Wasted votes, calculated lost opportunities, and actual dollars are shameful. Her leadership on the ACA repeal votes cost us more than $72million, by one estimate. And the government closure added as much as $24 billion. The totals are staggering.\The Republican Congress, including McMorris Rodgers, is known as the ""party of no,"" but our representative, who constantly touts her power and leadership role, deserves more blame. What does she stand for? She seems obsessed with saying ""no"" to issues, even those she once strongly supported. Her votes demonstrate her wealthy donors, not her constituents, are her benefactors. Continuous no votes and scare tactics satisfy the demands of her wealthy contributors but fail constituents.\Wasting tax dollars to stop the ACA rather than working to improve a law that has provided access to life-saving health care is unacceptable. It is time to review her voting history and hold her accountable. We need someone who makes a difference to constituents over wealthy political donors.\Gayle Cain\Cusick, Wash.\ACCOUNTABILITY NEEDED\Regardless of the political party you support, our politicians are hurting our country.\Why are they allowing other countries to send their people across our border, then busing and flying them to different parts of the United States? The states are having financial problems without any additional burdens.\Why are government employees receiving bonuses for the job they are hired to do? If they don't do a good job, they should be fired.\Why did we send back the five worst terrorists from Guantanamo Bay? We let them dictate what they wanted. Why did we lose four American lives in the Benghazi consulate? Someone should be held responsible for not giving them support.\Why does our Internal Revenue Service have missing emails? This couldn't be by accident. Why do we keep printing money? Our money used to be the basis of currency in the world. Stop spending wastefully.\We need accountability to save our country.\Joe Schauble\Spokane\HATING THE FOURTH\Why I hate July Fourth: It's legal in my town.\1. Why do we celebrate the use of fireworks?\2. When was the Declaration of Independence actually signed?\3. People around the world constantly live the noise and explosions - in war.\4. People who fight for our freedom, suffer post-traumatic stress syndrome, and relive their horrors over and over.\5. Wildlife, animals, children, elderly suffer the sounds, smell and explosions, crying, screaming, fleeing, running and hopefully are not killed.\6. The environment is filled with toxic pollutants and haze.\7. Did you know that the American consumers alone spent about $662million on fireworks in 2013?\8. The U.S. Census Bureau's foreign trade statistics indicate $213.8 million worth of fireworks were imported, with a large majority coming from China - again supporting China and not America.\9. If you spent $66.20 on fireworks, you could feed or prevent the abuse of a homeless person, a hungry child, an animal for over a month.\10. What could you do with the money going up literally in smoke for the Fourth of July?\Barb Bauman\Medical Lake\CHANGE ROAD FUNDING\Is anyone surprised that the Highway Trust Fund is running out of money? As the CAFE (corporate average fuel efficiency) has increased, the money from gas taxes (both state and federal) has decreased.\Now that the feds are considering increasing the gas tax, (don't forget that Gov. Jay Inslee policies could increase the state tax, too) the tax revenue death spiral will begin. More electric cars, higher mileage cars and fewer miles driven will decrease gas tax revenue even further. How do you tax the electric cars?\Perhaps it is time to start imposing a ton-mile-tax on cars and trucks and tax the studded tire out of the market (thus reducing the abnormal pavement wear) that cause the ruts that need to be repaired. Balancing the highway tax income to the structural repair costs and highway patrol expense may prevent death-spiral funding problems.\Ernie Preedy\Spangle\FORGETTING U.S. HISTORY\When my grandmother Elizabeth Cooney arrived from Ireland 100 years ago, she was greeted in New York harbor by a statuesque lady proclaiming, 'Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me: I lift my lamp beside the golden door.""\How the times have changed. This week, the news carries stories of busloads of frightened children from war-torn, impoverished Central and South American countries being met at our southern border and showered with hateful insults by flag-waving descendants of yesterday's European immigrants telling them to go home.\What will it take for the 535 members of the Congress of the United States to summon the moral and political courage to reflect upon their own immigrant histories and pass comprehensive immigration reform? Our nation of immigrants is becoming a nation of belligerents.\Tom Keefe\Spokane\EMBARRASSING PROTESTERS\The recent news video clips of the near-rabid anti-immigration protesters in the South can't help but remind me of the same fervor demonstrated by segregationists during the late 1950s and early '60s.\How embarrassing!\George Rickert\Sandpoint\THANKS FOR ISRAEL LETTER\Thank you to Myrta Ladich (July 1), for explaining and taking a stand against Israel's attacks on both Muslim and Christian residents of Palestinian areas.\Elouise Engle\Spokane\THE NEW OLD WEST\There are a number of candidates for sheriff of Stevens County who promote and believe that the county sheriff is the highest legitimate law enforcement official in the land and, in order to protect the community from the evil and tyrannical federal, state, and local governments, the sheriff needs to draw a line around the county, and make it abundantly clear to other law enforcement agencies that he will only enforce those laws that his posse agrees with.\This seems to be very popular with constitutionalists, armed militias and pseudo-libertarians, who fortunately only make up about 15 percent to 20 percent of our county population.\The idea reminds me of an old Western. No doubt Rowdy Yates would get a little nervous about a lynch mob that just went to the dry goods store and there was a rope sale. People really seem to enjoy watching movies with violent lawlessness and vigilantism.\Please research the candidates and check out their spurs. We don't need to make a movie or a miniseries in Stevens County.\James Perkins\Colville\THANKS FROM CALIFORNIA\On June 29, our three-generation family of seven was traveling toward Spokane on the last days of a vacation that covered Salt Lake City, Mount Rushmore, Yellowstone National Park, Oregon and points in between.\At the seven-mile marker in Idaho, outside Washington, we were hit from behind by a weaving driver in what could have been a horrific accident. Our white minivan was sideswiped, spun around, hit again, and finally stopped on the grassy median.\We want to thank Trooper Andy Hodl of the Idaho State Police who arrived on the scene quickly. His professional manner was a calming influence on the situation, as he competently attended to what needed to be done.\Also, we wish to thank the witnesses who took time from their Sunday to stop and give their account of what happened. They could easily have chosen not to be inconvenienced or involved and gone on their way to continue enjoying their pleasant day.\Fortunately, none of us suffered major injuries, although we all were seen in the emergency room the following morning.\Again, thank you to those who made a frightening experience bearable.\Susan MacKenzie\Chico, Calif."
212,"OLYMPIA - After campaigning on carbon restrictions and pushing for a capital gains tax for two terms, Gov. Jay Inslee scored big wins in the Legislature this year.\Aside from addressing COVID-19 recovery and response, the Democratic-led Legislature passed many long-awaited, consequential proposals. Pushed by Inslee, Democrats made last-minute deals on climate change, capital gains, police accountability and drug possession.\Inslee told reporters Monday he had ""never seen a legislative session that was so productive.""\""Their efforts were so broad in the number of things that they worked on in such difficult circumstances in the middle of the pandemic,"" he said.\Since taking office eight years ago, Inslee has pushed for passage of proposals that would lower the state's carbon emissions and help fight a changing climate. His unsuccessful presidential campaign was dedicated to raising awareness on climate change, but until this year, no major policy changes on the issue had passed the Legislature.\In 2012, Inslee campaigned for a low carbon fuel standard, which he said would encourage the use of fuels that have less effect on the climate. In 2014, Inslee laid out plans to cut carbon emissions by implementing a ""cap-and-trade"" proposal that would collect a carbon tax on industries that pollute.\The proposals have been complicated and controversial, with opponents saying they would increase fuel prices and the general cost of living for residents. Some also worried that businesses targeted by pollution caps would leave the state.\But something changed this year. In the final days before the voting deadline, lawmakers reached deals on both climate bills.\Washington joins California, Oregon and British Columbia in adopting a clean-fuels standard, similar to what Inslee has introduced.\Beginning in 2023, fuel companies in Washington must start reducing emissions a little bit each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20% below 2017 levels by 2038. Fuel companies can either clean up their fuels by producing biofuels or mixed fuels. If they can't, they would be required to purchase ""credits"" to make up for emissions that go above the allowed amount.\The cap-and-trade program that passed this year would set a cap on emissions that large polluters in the state would have to meet by 2023. If they can't meet the cap, they could either clean up their work or purchase allowances from the state. The state would receive the revenue generated from those allowances, which it would use to invest in programs that help the environment and communities disproportionately affected by climate change, such as people of color and low-income earners.\Both the clean-fuels standard and the cap-and-trade program that passed over the weekend come with a tie to a 5-cent gas tax increase, meaning neither would go into effect until lawmakers pass a new transportation revenue package.\Inslee said Monday he did not agree with the provisions tying the climate policies to the gas tax increase, but he would not say whether he would be vetoing those lines.\He said he is committed to getting a new transportation package moving, although he did not say for certain whether he would call legislators back into special session.\In a Sunday news conference, Democrats attributed their success this session on so many issues to a variety of reasons. House Speaker Laurie Jinkins said House members were told early in session to limit the number of bills they introduced.\Members really wanted to prioritize consequential bills and move through the session with ""real urgency,"" she said. ""The pandemic pressed us to do bigger things.""\Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane, said lawmakers worked more during the interim this year than in previous years. The pandemic exposed many institutional problems, which built public and legislative momentum to push a lot of bills through.\Sen. Joe Nguyen, D-Seattle, attributed the success to the Legislature being the most diverse it's ever been with more members of color, women and LGBTQ members than before.\The party breakdown in the chambers did not change this year, but some long-term moderate Democrats were replaced with more progressive ones after last November's election.\Another example of where lawmakers were able to reach a deal after years of trying: the capital gains tax.\Democrats have pushed for the policy for years as a way to fix what they say is a regressive tax code in which low-income earners pay proportionately more in taxes than those whose income is higher. In 2014, Inslee introduced a capital gains tax into his budget.\As in other years, Inslee had proposed a capital gains tax in his budget plans in December. His version though looked a little different than the one that eventually passed. It would have implemented a 9% tax on annual investment earnings of $50,000 for a married couple.\The final proposal approved by the Legislature implements a 7% tax on capital gains, including from the sale of stocks, bonds, businesses and other assets, if the profits exceed $250,000.\Lawmakers could never get enough support through both chambers to get Inslee's initial proposal through, as they faced stiff opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats who called it an unconstitutional income tax.\The measure that passed will be signed by Inslee, but will likely face a court challenge.\Inslee's initial plan would have brought in more money for the state than the plan that passed Sunday, which brings in about $415 million in tax revenue.\Inslee acknowledged Monday the capital gains tax rate in the final measure will be lower than those in other states, but said he did not have plans to push for expansion of the bill passed on Sunday. Instead, he said he wanted to first ""celebrate the success"" of a proposal he's worked on for years.\""This will bring a good portion of fairness to our tax system,"" he said.\Along with Inslee's requests, legislators tackled other consequential issues, passing significant reforms in many categories. Here are some other notable policy changes made this session:\POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY\Lawmakers passed almost a dozen police accountability measures, a package that came together almost a year ago after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\Bills include creating a statewide database of use-of-force incidents, requiring officers to intervene when they see another officer use excessive force and easing requirements to decertify officers.\Two others, which received some of the most debate, address police tactics and the standard needed to use force. The police tactics bill prohibits the use of choke holds and neck restraints and limits the use of tear gas, police dogs and vehicle pursuits. It also bans law enforcement agencies from acquiring military equipment.\Lawmakers then changed the policy for when force is allowed. A previous statute allowed for ""any means necessary"" during an arrest. A bill that passed last week requires officers to prioritize de-escalation before employing force.\DRUG POSSESSION\Drug possession will now be treated as a misdemeanor in Washington, punishable by up to 90 days in jail, a $1,000 fine or both.\Prior to February, possession was a felony. But a state Supreme Court decision ruled Washington's drug possession law unconstitutional. Lawmakers began scrambling for a fix. Some wanted to see decriminalization of drug possession and a focus on treatment while others wanted to see at least some criminal penalty.\The compromise: making possession of a controlled substance a misdemeanor, at least for the next two years. In 2023, the criminal penalty will expire, meaning no more arrests for drug possession, unless legislators pass any further laws.\The final bill also focuses heavily on treatment for substance abuse disorder. Those possessing drugs will be diverted to treatment on their first two offenses. Their third offense would be a misdemeanor. It also increases funding for behavioral health services to increase community treatment and outreach programs for addiction.\OPEN CARRY AT DEMONSTRATIONS\Openly carrying firearms at the Capitol campus and at public demonstrations would be illegal, if Inslee gives his final signature.\The proposal came after a year of large armed protests at the Capitol. In January, protesters breached the governor's mansion gate. Last summer, two protests ended with shots fired.\The bill would ban open carry within 250 feet of publicly permitted demonstrations and on the state Capitol campus. People openly carrying a firearm on their private property are exempt, if a protest is occurring outside their home or business. Law enforcement officers are also exempt.\FOREST HEALTH\After years of fighting for more stable funding for wildfire fighting and forest health, Commissioner for Public Lands Hilary Franz garnered support this session for a bill to give substantial funding every two years toward the wildfire effort.\The bill passed unanimously and would set aside $125 million every two years for wildfire response, forest restoration and community resilience.\For wildfire response, it would allow the state to hire 100 more firefighters and expand the air fleet. The bill would also help fund the Department of Natural Resource's 20-year Forest Health Strategic Plan, which treats the state's forests to make them more wildfire resistant. Lastly, it would help communities across the state make investments at a local level to reduce wildfire risk, such as building fuel breaks or doing prescribed burns.\COVID-19 ECONOMIC RECOVERY\With the infusion of billions of federal stimulus dollars, state lawmakers turned their focus to helping the state recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\At the start of the session, lawmakers allocated $2.2 billion for rental assistance, school assistance, public health, food assistance and child care grants.\When Congress passed an additional $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package, lawmakers used about $10 billion of the state's share of funds in their budget for one-time costs related to the pandemic. The final budget allocated funds for vaccine distribution, school reopening and rental assistance.\A portion of the federal funds will assist child care providers across the state. As part of a broad package to address child care shortages statewide, lawmakers expanded eligibility and decreased co-pays for subsidy grants and increased the subsidy rate, supports and grants for providers. In the short-term, federal funds will pay for those expansions. In the long-term, funds would come from revenue generated by the capital gains tax.\Lawmakers also funded the Working Families Tax Credit, which provides between a rebate of $300 to $1,200 for low-income families, depending on how many children they have.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com.\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"
213,"istock.com \iStock.com \The Columbian \Motorists cross the Interstate Bridge from Portland into Vancouver on Friday afternoon, June 5, 2020. \iStock.com \Associated Press files \Carolyn Long, Democratic candidate for the 3rd Congressional District, speaks during the Goldendale Grange Hall candidate forum on Wednesday night, Oct. 17, 2018. (Nathan Howard/The Columbian) \The Columbian files; iStock.com and National Institutes of Health photo \Carolyn Long, left, and Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground.\Two days before Election Day, five-term Republican U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Democratic challenger Carolyn Long are on the offensive. More than $1 million in outside spending poured into the race in October, manifesting as attack ads and mailers.\Long, a political science professor at Washington State University Vancouver, ran against Herrera Beutler in 2018; she lost by 5 percentage points.\In the interest of divesting from race-horse election coverage, The Columbian presents summaries of where each candidate stands on major issues. Each summary includes recent, on-the-record comments from the candidate outlining her stance and additional context or fact-checking when relevant.\Environment and climate change\Herrera Beutler: President Donald Trump made the right decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord in 2017, she said, adding that the agreement imposed a disproportionate burden on America compared with China.\“I'm not going to support agreements either at home or internationally that are going to be paid for on the backs of working-class citizens,” she said in an Oct. 23 interview with KGW-TV. She said she backs the USE IT Act, which aids in the development of carbon-capture technology. “I won't support a carbon tax on the American workers,” she said.\Long: “I think it was a mistake for us to yield our position of leadership when we withdrew from the Paris climate accord, and I think it's something that we should rejoin,” Long said during an Oct. 8 debate. She was also critical of rollbacks to environmental protection laws under Trump's administration. “I'll be a steward for our climate by focusing on bipartisan legislation that will actually address the climate crisis,” Long said. “I won't pit our environment protections against jobs.” She said she did not support Washington's 2018 carbon tax proposal, and that “we shouldn't move toward taxes and fees” as a way of stemming climate change. She said she wants to develop more jobs in the clean-energy sector.\The record: Herrera Beutler occasionally crosses party lines to maintain environmental regulations (notably last year, when she voted to ban oil drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico). In 2017, she voted to postpone implementing pieces of the Clean Air Act, and voted to repeal a rule requiring oil and gas companies to reduce emissions. Rankings from the League of Conservation Voters, which tracks how often lawmakers cast votes that benefit the environment, gives the congresswoman a 10 percent lifetime rating, and a 24 percent rating last year (the House average is 56 percent). The league endorsed Long in February.\Interstate 5 Bridge replacement\Long: Is critical of Herrera Beutler for failing to get the I-5 Bridge replacement project funded. She points to rising construction costs that make the project much more expensive now than it would have been had the Columbia River Crossing project not disintegrated in 2014. “The more important question is, why hasn't this been fixed in 10 years?” she told KGW-TV in an Oct. 23 interview. She added that she doesn't support tolling to pay for the bridge. “I've never supported tolling on the I-5 Bridge. My record is very clear on that.” If elected, she said she'd work to attract federal infrastructure dollars.\Herrera Beutler: The Columbia River Crossing was a bad plan, Herrera Beutler said in an interview with KOIN-TV. “They were going to build it too low, and they were also going to put light rail on it, which is something Clark County didn't want,” she said. In August, Herrera Beutler wrote a public letter to the project's new administrator and pledged to work toward appropriating federal gas tax funding for a new I-5 bridge. “The project, like the CRC, will fail if one state dictates to the other, or if transportation officials only pay lip service to stakeholders' concerns while making decisions behind closed doors,” she wrote in the letter.\Also, she strongly opposes a proposal that would collect tolls from motorists using Portland-area freeways, including Clark County commuters, to fund Oregon transportation projects.\Fact check: Was the proposed bridge replacement too low? Initially, yes, but the Coast Guard in 2013 issued a bridge permit after the bridge was redesigned to be 21 feet taller.\Health care and insurance\Herrera Beutler: Since 2011 she has joined House Republicans dozens of times and voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. She says she wants to maintain health insurance coverage for people with preexisting medical conditions. “A passion of mine is health care,” she said during a meeting with The Columbian's Editorial Board in August. “My oldest child has a kidney transplant. She will forever be a part of the health care system. She has a preexisting condition. I get my health insurance off the ACA. I would never vote to strip her or any person in my district's access to health care.” She pointed to a bill she co-sponsored in 2019 that would protect preexisting condition coverage if the ACA is overturned (the bill never advanced to a vote). She denounces Long's position, claiming the Democrat had previously championed a “Medicare for All” plan.\Long: The top priority of Long's platform in both 2018 and 2020 has been shoring up the protections offered under the Affordable Care Act and creating a public health insurance option. She told The Columbian's Editorial Board: “The framework that I use to address health care is, try to get health care coverage for as many people as possible as quickly as possible while maintaining the element of choice, and with an eye toward affordability. That has always been my position,” Long said. “If somebody chooses to do so, they can buy government-provided health insurance … if you don't want to do it, you don't have to do it.” She's critical of Republicans' sustained efforts to repeal the ACA. “It protects tens of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions,” Long said. “They've brought that issue to the courts in the middle of a global pandemic.”\The record: Herrera Beutler voted to repeal or amend the ACA more than 80 times over the last decade. She's focused on piecemeal maternal and prenatal health legislation, as with her MOMS Act, which encouraged states to extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers up to one year postpartum. In December, she was one of two Republicans to split from her party and vote for a prescription drug pricing bill championed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\Fact check: Ads from Herrera Beutler's campaign claim that Long supported “Medicare for All” during her first run for Congress. The ads cite a June 2018 interview with The (Longview) Daily News, when Long said she'd vote for a “Medicare for All” bill if Democrats won control of Congress.\“I think the way to address the health care crisis as quickly as possible given the climate that we're in is to repair the ACA and the damage that's been done by the Trump administration as a starting point,” Long told The Daily News. “You should look at my (position) within the context of who's in control of the White House, and the Democrats' relative control in Congress. It's viable because it has bipartisan support in Congress.”\Long has since said that the Herrera Beutler campaign took her 2018 quote out of context. She's reiterated her position on a universal single-payer plan — she doesn't support it — in multiple public forums over the course of her current campaign.\National politics and Trump\Long: Voted for Joe Biden. The Democratic nominee also endorsed her bid for Congress. Long doesn't discuss Trump frequently, though she'll criticize the president on certain points, like when she issued a statement denouncing a controversial statement from Trump in the first presidential debate. “The president called on white supremacist groups to ‘Stand back, and stand by' rather than take an opportunity handed to him to denounce hatred in these difficult times. This has to stop now,” Long said.\In December, Long also issued a statement on Trump's impeachment: “The voters expect us to have a basic sense of right and wrong and to always put the interests of our country ahead of petty politics. After taking the time to review the facts, evidence, and articles of impeachment, I can say that if I were in Congress today — having taken an oath to uphold the Constitution — I would vote for the articles of impeachment,” Long said.\Herrera Beutler: Voted for Trump this year. That's a departure from what she said 2016, when she said “I refuse to accept this is the best we can do” and wrote in then-House Speaker Paul Ryan for president. In June, Herrera Beutler said in a PBS interview that she measures Trump's comments on a “cringe meter.” “Do I think the way the president presents his ideas or his opinions is appropriate? Not always,” Herrera Beutler said. But she said that the president's tax policy and hard-line stance against China make him a better leader for the country.\In December 2019, she voted against the two articles of impeachment accusing the president of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, citing lack of evidence. “They had to prove it. They didn't even come close,” Herrera Beutler said. “To me, it felt like it turned into a political weapon for one party to take out a president they didn't like.”\Tax policy\Long: Says she'd seek to replace the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In an Oct. 15 interview with KOIN-TV, she said the bill disproportionately benefited corporations and the wealthy, and added $2 trillion to the national deficit “Our tax reform should instead prioritize tax cuts for small businesses and working families.” She was echoing what she told The Columbian's Editorial Board in August: “Trickle-down economics has never worked historically,” Long said. “What we saw big corporations do, and the biggest beneficiaries of the tax bill, was buy back stocks and give dividends to their shareholders.”\Herrera Beutler: Is a strong proponent of the 2017 tax bill. She sparred with The Columbian's Editorial Board over the topic, and claimed that the cuts were already starting to pay for themselves before the coronavirus pandemic sank the economy.\“The reality is we were seeing that come back into the economy,” Herrera Beutler said. “We were bringing in more in tax receipts, hundreds of millions of dollars — it had started.” She points to data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury indicating that the cuts increased average annual household income by an estimated $4,000.\Fact check: According to a report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bill is expected to increase the projected national deficit by $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028. The same (pre-pandemic) report also estimated that the tax cuts would add 1.1 million jobs over the decade.\COVID-19\Herrera Beutler: Is focusing her efforts on restoring the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers emergency loans to businesses that can be forgiven if the business maintains its payroll. The PPP expired in August, and she has been trying to force a standalone House vote to extend it. (Congress is currently adjourned.) She called the program “a bridge for almost 9,500 small businesses in Southwest Washington alone,” adding “if we fail to extend it immediately, it will have been a bridge to nowhere because small businesses remain on the brink of survival.” Herrera Beutler also joined her House colleagues in a unanimous March voice vote to pass the CARES Act, which sent direct relief checks of $1,200 to every adult citizen.\Long: Released an overarching pandemic recovery plan in September. The 17-page document focuses on health care (highlighting her aforementioned Affordable Care Act plus public option proposal), infrastructure and emergency unemployment aid. It also takes a broader view on rebuilding the economy, and proposes a graduated $15 federal minimum wage, expansion of the Child Care Development Block Grant program and guaranteed paid sick leave.\“We have people still talking about a CARES Act that was passed five months ago. Congress hasn't done its job,” Long told The Columbian at the time.\Calley Hair: 360-735-4558; calley.hair@columbian.com; twitter.com/calleynhair\By the numbers\Election cycle-to-date fundraising totals:\(as of Oct. 14)\Herrera Beutler: $4.11 million\Long: $3.74 million\Cash on-hand totals:\(as of Oct. 14)\Herrera Beutler: $590,850\Long: $105.605\Election cycle-to-date spending totals:\(as of Oct. 14)\Herrera Beutler: $3.18 million\Long: $3.66 million\August primary results\Districtwide\Herrera Beutler: 135,726 56.24%\Long: 95,875	39.73%\Clark County\Herrera Beutler: 74,969 51.15%\Long: 66,165	45.14%\2018 General election\Districtwide\Herrera Beutler: 161,819 52.67%\Long: 145,407	47.33%\Voting\Clark County residents can register to vote up to and including until 8 p.m. Nov. 3. \CREDIT: Calley Hair The Columbian"

Marshall knows water
\
To the editor -- I'm tired, every summer, of hearing how there's not enough water and never knowing if I'll have enough water for the plants in my yard. I'm tired of more family farms, every year having to close up business because they can't get enough water for their crops. And I'm tired of everyone complaining about the water crisis, and not knowing what to do about it.
\
Rockey Marshall is a board member of the Yakima Basin Storage Alliance, the nonprofit Black Rock Reservoir group. He is trying to find a solution to our water problems. He, for one, isn't content to sit back and wait for others to figure out the answers. Rockey knows that tough problems require hard work and cooperation to solve, so he's out there trying to figure out the solutions, while most of us are still sitting around complaining. Black Rock Dam would help with the water crisis, would bring several years of construction jobs and federal money to our area, not even counting the permanent jobs it would create.
\
I support someone who's willing to stick his neck out and try to find solutions to the tough problems. I support Rockey Marshall for City Council.

Don't dump incumbents
\
To the editor -- The philosophy of dumping all incumbents removes seated officials without regard to aptitude or integrity, the manner or level of service provided, or voting record. This simplistic concept excuses voters from thorough evaluation of candidates.
\
I will be voting against Paul George, not because he is an incumbent, but because of his selective enforcement of the three- minute speaking rule. As I watched what looked to me like a rude and intimidating reaction to the young man presenting the petition on Miller Pool, I was appalled. Being fair and courteous doesn't cost anything.
\
Bill Lover, who fought for our freedoms in Vietnam, is a better candidate and will receive my vote. He understands the city's budget, organizational structure, processes and product. He is a strong family man involved in a variety of civic groups. Bill worked hard on our irrigation petition. He is an independent thinker who enjoys speaking with anyone, no matter his or her position on an issue. Retired from Boeing, Bill has the time to serve.
\
I have not always agreed with Bernie Sims; however, he supported rebuilding our irrigation system. He understands the time City Council requires, and has demonstrated the commitment to serve in this position. Bernie's education and experience with finance, knowledge of city's facilities and committees, and water are qualifications unmatched by his youthful opponent.
\
In November 2003, the chant for change replaced veteran council members with four novice council members. I hope the voters will more carefully consider the consequences of their ballot in this election.

I-300 is all about profits
\
To the editor -- Rod Nelson is absolutely correct in his Oct. 24 letter suggesting Initiative 330 is all about profits. Nurses, well- known patient advocates, are standing united against this initiative and Initiative 336. Washington State Nurses Association and numerous other nursing organizations have spoken out against it. WSNA's Web site (www.wsna.org) has more information on the nursing viewpoint regarding this.

Re-elect Judge Martin
\
To the editor -- For Yakima Municipal Court judge, I strongly urge re-election of Judge Jonathan Martin. Without question, Martin is eminently qualified for the position. I have known Judge Martin for over 35 years. He was a principal in the law firm of Martin and Marquis for over 10 years and practiced law for a total of 17 years in District, Municipal and Federal courts. Regarding specialized judicial experience, he has served as pro tem judge in Yakima County District Court, Selah Municipal Court and Kittitas County District Court.
\
In 1993 he was selected as the first judge for the city of Union Gap. He authored the court rules and procedures for Union Gap and established its Probation Department. In 1997 he was selected by our City Council from a field of applicants to the newly established position of Yakima Municipal Court judge. He authored the court rules and procedures for the court, participated in hiring the staff and established the Probation Department.
\
He has been active in the District and Municipal Court Judges Association for the state of Washington since 1994, serving on the Judicial Assistance, Pattern Forms and Salaries committees.
\
Among Judge Martin's numerous accomplishments, he is well known for initiating Day Detention for misdemeanants, i.e., detention as an alternative to imprisonment. This procedure has since been adopted by other courts within and outside the state of Washington.
\
I highly recommend that my fellow voters join me in supporting Judge Martin, the best qualified candidate for Yakima Municipal Court judge.

Riel as dad's successor
\
To the editor -- Please join me in supporting Kevin Riel for Fire District No. 5 Commissioner Position 1. This position has been held by my father for the past 20 years, who has decided to retire at the end of this term. I give Kevin my full support in his candidacy to fill this position.
\
I have known Kevin since our first day of school at Harrah Elementary and have had a lasting friendship ever since. Kevin's strong business experience with budgeting, finance and management makes him the best candidate for this position. I have observed his management style and know that he believes in hiring good people, and then letting them perform their job without micro-managing their day-to-day duties. His successful large-scale farming operation proves he is a good leader.
\
Kevin also has an everyday working knowledge of Fire District No. 5, having been a volunteer firefighter since 1987, and is currently trained as an EMT. I have observed him in action at a New Year's Eve accident where alcohol was involved. Even though I could see his frustration with the situation, he showed great patience and kindness for those who were injured. He is dedicated to this Valley and to the volunteer firefighter system.
\
Kevin has been a good friend, a great business leader, and is raising a beautiful family here in our Valley.
\
Please vote for Kevin Riel for Fire District No. 5 Commissioner Position 1.

I-901 helps employees
\
To the editor -- Most of the letters discussing Initiative 901, which would ban smoking in buildings and vehicles open to the public, focus on the rights and welfare of the patrons. Those favoring I-901 point out that people who wish to enjoy a meal or a drink should not be exposed to smoke, which is hazardous to their health. Opponents of the initiative argue that such people can go elsewhere if they find the environment not to their liking.
\
Although the rights and welfare of patrons are important, a more compelling argument for voting for Initiative 901 has to do with the rights and welfare of the employees. Most employees need their job and do not have the option of going elsewhere. Those who do have such an option would soon be replaced by other people. No worker should have to work in a hazardous environment, especially when the hazards can be eliminated.
\
The dangers to workers who have to spend many hours in a smoke- filled workplace are much greater than the dangers to patrons, who may only be spending an hour or two in that place.

Teacher for Torres-Saenz
\
To the editor -- I am writing to encourage Yakima citizens to vote for Jorge Torres-Saenz. He is running for a vacant seat on the Yakima school board and will be an excellent choice.
\
Jorge has many years experience working with and for children as a child and family psychologist. He understands the needs of those children who come to our schools needing extra help and attention. He will be an advocate for both children and educators in this demanding environment.
\
Jorge strongly promotes parental involvement and responsibility in the educational process, a key ingredient that is often downplayed and ignored when considering student learning success. This will bring a fresh, new, all-inclusive and much-needed perspective to the school board. As a concerned teacher in the Yakima School District I am voting for Jorge Torres-Saenz on Nov. 8.

Marshall for change
\
To the editor -- Yakima needs change: It seems as if we are stuck in a rut with little attempt to work our way out of the long worn habits. We need to elect officials who are willing to set aside their personal agendas for the good of the whole. Rockey Marshall wants to see Yakima succeed, and he has the enthusiasm and experience to get the job done.
\
Rockey understands that no single person nor solitary group can accomplish all that is needed to turn Yakima around and has committed to bringing all the different groups together to make Yakima a better place to live. He is a proven leader with more energy than twin toddlers and will channel that energy toward improving the quality of life for the citizens of Yakima.
\
Rockey has been active on numerous boards and committees in the area and is to be commended for his dedication in finding solutions for the problems his hometown faces. He wants to help and he has a plan, so let's give this man a chance.
\
I encourage everyone to vote Rockey Marshall for Position 1 on the Yakima City Council.

Riel has the right skills
\
To the editor -- Kevin Riel is a well qualified person whom I would like to recommend in the race for commissioner of Yakima County Fire District No. 5, Position No. 1.
\
Kevin is a dedicated, hardworking individual who has the knowledge and expertise to be a great addition to the Yakima County District No. 5 board of commissioners. He has been a firefighter/ EMT for 19 years and past captain of Station No. 3, with perfect attendance to drills and classes during that time. He has served as chairman in a variety of leadership positions in this Valley and this has helped give him additional skills and abilities to listen to all sides of the issues and challenges the fire district will face in the years to come. In addition, Kevin has taken leadership training through Washington Agriculture and Forest Education classes besides gradating from Central Washington University, summa cum laude, with a bachelor of sciences degree. Kevin has the management and business skills that are needed to help run Fire District No. 5 smoothly. He is a devoted family man and neighbor who runs a successful farm, but has always found time to give of himself unselfishly to his community. These are valuable assets and show dedication in whatever Kevin takes on in life.
\
I highly recommend Kevin Riel as the best candidate in the race for commissioner of Yakima County Fire District No. 5, Position No. 1. Please cast your vote for Kevin Riel.

Farming is Valley's heart
\
To the editor -- On my way through the Lower Valley, I couldn't believe my nose. It stinks!
\
This was hard to comprehend, especially after all the media about how the local politicians had eliminated the smell from what they have painted with their own brush as ""Smellyside."" In fact Mike Farmer and Bruce Ricks are using this ""Grand Odor Eliminating"" event as the platform for their re-election bid.
\
I think these boys need to breathe in through the nose instead of out through the mouth.
\
So what did they eliminate if not the odor?
\
As a Monson Ranches employee, I know they did eliminate over 30 full-time jobs paying out over $1,000,000 annually in base pay and benefits. They did eliminate in excess of $1.1 million in sales to Yakima Valley area merchants. They did eliminate the purchase of over 140,000 tons hay, potato by-products, and grains. This is good for Sunnyside? That's right, it is pronounced Sunnyside.
\
We live in an agricultural area. Agricultural is what has made our Lower Valley strong and vibrant. When I talk of our Lower Valley to anyone across the nation I brag about how we can grow any and everything from apples to zucchini. I brag about how many days of sunshine we have in the Valley.
\
And yes, I brag about how strong the beef and dairy industry has made our economy.
\
These are things to be proud of, not scorned and ridiculed in the media.
\
It is your vote, Sunnyside. Tell Ricks and Farmer how they did.

Reed said Idaho needs to address school construction, roads and parks across the state.\Roads are the only one of the three that the governor targeted for increased funding.\Reaction to the governor's talk from the rest of the North Idaho legislative delegation was mixed.\Said Rep. Jim Stoicheff, D-Sandpoint, ""I think the governor's sincere in everything he said .... I happen to like the guy.""\Rep. Don Pischner, R-Coeur d'Alene, said he was glad the governor touched on issues of concern to North Idaho. ""He didn't miss the Silver Valley, he didn't miss the wood industry, he didn't miss the highway situation,"" Pischner said. ""He was fairly thorough.""\Sen. Tim Tucker, D-Porthill, called the governor inconsistent for saying he wants to avoid burdening mining companies, but later saying he wants to protect the environment. ""Pick one, please,"" Tucker said.\Rep. June Judd, D-St. Maries, disagreed, saying she supported Batt's comments. ""Who will you save the environment for, if all the people die out?""\Sen. Gordon Crow, R-Hayden, said he'd like to hear from citizens before deciding how to vote on a gas tax increase to repair roads.\He also said he supports using state funds for school construction. North Idaho school districts have seen dramatic increases in the number of school kids, but often have failed to win the required two-thirds voter support to pass school construction bonds.\""I want it to have a full hearing,"" Crow said.\Rep. Jeff Alltus, R-Coeur d'Alene, said he, too, favors a state contribution toward local school construction, but, ""There's no money. There's not going to be much left this time.""\Rep. Marvin Vandenberg, D-Coeur d'Alene, said he was disappointed the governor didn't propose more property tax relief, but liked the welfare reform plans.\Rep. Wayne Meyer, R-Rathdrum, said he was worried the governor's reference to abandoning old ""roles and missions"" that guided Idaho's universities might lead to costly duplication.

Freedom of religion
\
To the editor -- Re: James Cluff's Oct. 11 letter, ""Pledge belongs to all,"" is right except for ""under God"" wasn't put in it just so it would be just for Christians only. ""Under God"" was added in 1954 to make a statement of what this country was founded on: Freedoms and freedom of religion, in particular, not to worship the flag.
\
In fact, being Christian means being a part of one of the most inclusive clubs in the world. Absolutely anyone is free to accept Jesus as Lord and Savior.
\
Maybe this county hasn't forgotten God, but I think He is not very high on some people's priorities, if at all, and some of the ideas people have are downright scary.
\
I would like the courts to leave it in and give each person their choice to say it or not, just like accepting Jesus or not. I don't believe it would hurt to have a little reminder.

Change your batteries
\
To the editor -- As the time change approaches on Sunday, Oct. 30, the Selah Fire Department wants to remind residents to make another change that could save their lives -- changing the batteries in their smoke alarms.
\
Communities nationwide witness tragic home fire deaths each year. An average of three children per day die in home fires and 80 percent of those occur in homes without working smoke alarms.
\
Nonworking smoke alarms rob residents of the protective benefits home fire safety devices were designed to provide. The most commonly cited cause of nonworking smoke alarms: worn or missing batteries.
\
Changing smoke alarm batteries at least once a year is one of the simplest, most effective ways to reduce these tragic deaths and injuries.
\
In fact, working smoke alarms nearly cut in half the risk of dying in a home fire. Additionally, the International Association of Fire Chiefs recommends replacing your smoke alarms every 10 years.
\
The peak time for home fire fatalities is between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. when most families are sleeping. Children and senior citizens are most at risk, and a working smoke alarm can give them the extra seconds they need to get out safely.
\
In addition, Selah Fire Department recommends residents use the ""extra"" hour they save from the time change to test smoke alarms by pushing the test button, planning ""two ways out"" and practicing escape routes with the entire family. Families should also prepare a fire safety kit that includes working flashlights and new batteries.

Council isn't a gang
\
To the editor -- I am writing in regard to the Yakima Herald- Republic coined phrase, ""Gang of four"" in Union Gap (See the Oct. 13 editorial, Candidates offer promise of moving Union Gap forward""). Any other city newspaper in the United States would use the phrase ""majority of the City Council."" We are not a ""gang"" and take offense at the negative connotation. We, the majority, have not seen eye to eye on all issues, and have worked hard to bring Union Gap into the 21st century. From what I read in the letters to the editor, the residents of the city of Yakima wish they had a ""gang"" like ours.

Evolution makes no sense
\
To the editor -- It seems the only ""truth"" acceptable in the public square is the opinion of the liberal media and liberals in the court system. Only a religious belief in naturalistic materialism (evolution) is ""mainstream,"" even when it is opposed by irrefutable logic, scientific evidence, and the opinion of most Americans.
\
Dr. Scott Todd wrote in Nature, ""Even if all the data point to an intelligent designer, such an hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic."" Richard Lewontin admits the ""scientific community"" promotes evolution ""in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs,"" its ""tolerance of unsubstantiated 'Just-So stories,'"" and its ""a priori adherence to material causes"" ""because we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.""
\
Eugenie Scott, the high priestess of evolutionism, said, ""Using creation and evolution as topics for critical-thinking exercises in primary and secondary schools is virtually guaranteed to confuse students about evolution and may lead them to reject one of the major themes in science.""
\
Critical thinking, logic, and full exposure to the data do not support a self-created universe that improves by self-destruction, random chance, and purposeless, unintelligent means. I hope that someday kids in school, and readers of the Herald-Republic, can be exposed to the evidence concerning origins and not just be forced to accept the court-established religion of evolutionary naturalism.

Marshall knows water
\
To the editor -- I'm tired, every summer, of hearing how there's not enough water and never knowing if I'll have enough water for the plants in my yard. I'm tired of more family farms, every year having to close up business because they can't get enough water for their crops. And I'm tired of everyone complaining about the water crisis, and not knowing what to do about it.
\
Rockey Marshall is a board member of the Yakima Basin Storage Alliance, the nonprofit Black Rock Reservoir group. He is trying to find a solution to our water problems. He, for one, isn't content to sit back and wait for others to figure out the answers. Rockey knows that tough problems require hard work and cooperation to solve, so he's out there trying to figure out the solutions, while most of us are still sitting around complaining. Black Rock Dam would help with the water crisis, would bring several years of construction jobs and federal money to our area, not even counting the permanent jobs it would create.
\
I support someone who's willing to stick his neck out and try to find solutions to the tough problems. I support Rockey Marshall for City Council.

Don't dump incumbents
\
To the editor -- The philosophy of dumping all incumbents removes seated officials without regard to aptitude or integrity, the manner or level of service provided, or voting record. This simplistic concept excuses voters from thorough evaluation of candidates.
\
I will be voting against Paul George, not because he is an incumbent, but because of his selective enforcement of the three- minute speaking rule. As I watched what looked to me like a rude and intimidating reaction to the young man presenting the petition on Miller Pool, I was appalled. Being fair and courteous doesn't cost anything.
\
Bill Lover, who fought for our freedoms in Vietnam, is a better candidate and will receive my vote. He understands the city's budget, organizational structure, processes and product. He is a strong family man involved in a variety of civic groups. Bill worked hard on our irrigation petition. He is an independent thinker who enjoys speaking with anyone, no matter his or her position on an issue. Retired from Boeing, Bill has the time to serve.
\
I have not always agreed with Bernie Sims; however, he supported rebuilding our irrigation system. He understands the time City Council requires, and has demonstrated the commitment to serve in this position. Bernie's education and experience with finance, knowledge of city's facilities and committees, and water are qualifications unmatched by his youthful opponent.
\
In November 2003, the chant for change replaced veteran council members with four novice council members. I hope the voters will more carefully consider the consequences of their ballot in this election.

Re-elect Judge Martin
\
To the editor -- For Yakima Municipal Court judge, I strongly urge re-election of Judge Jonathan Martin. Without question, Martin is eminently qualified for the position. I have known Judge Martin for over 35 years. He was a principal in the law firm of Martin and Marquis for over 10 years and practiced law for a total of 17 years in District, Municipal and Federal courts. Regarding specialized judicial experience, he has served as pro tem judge in Yakima County District Court, Selah Municipal Court and Kittitas County District Court.
\
In 1993 he was selected as the first judge for the city of Union Gap. He authored the court rules and procedures for Union Gap and established its Probation Department. In 1997 he was selected by our City Council from a field of applicants to the newly established position of Yakima Municipal Court judge. He authored the court rules and procedures for the court, participated in hiring the staff and established the Probation Department.
\
He has been active in the District and Municipal Court Judges Association for the state of Washington since 1994, serving on the Judicial Assistance, Pattern Forms and Salaries committees.
\
Among Judge Martin's numerous accomplishments, he is well known for initiating Day Detention for misdemeanants, i.e., detention as an alternative to imprisonment. This procedure has since been adopted by other courts within and outside the state of Washington.
\
I highly recommend that my fellow voters join me in supporting Judge Martin, the best qualified candidate for Yakima Municipal Court judge.

\
I have known Kevin since our first day of school at Harrah Elementary and have had a lasting friendship ever since. Kevin's strong business experience with budgeting, finance and management makes him the best candidate for this position. I have observed his management style and know that he believes in hiring good people, and then letting them perform their job without micromanaging their day-to-day duties. His successful large-scale farming operation proves he is a good leader.
\
Kevin also has an everyday working knowledge of Fire District No. 5, having been a volunteer firefighter since 1987, and is currently trained as an EMT. I have observed him in action at a New Year's Eve accident where alcohol was involved. Even though I could see his frustration with the situation, he showed great patience and kindness for those who were injured. He is dedicated to this Valley and to the volunteer firefighter system.
\
Kevin has been a good friend, a great business leader, and is raising a beautiful family here in our Valley.
\
Please vote for Kevin Riel for Fire District No. 5 Commissioner Position 1.

I-901 helps employees
\
To the editor -- Most of the letters discussing Initiative 901, which would ban smoking in buildings and vehicles open to the public, focus on the rights and welfare of the patrons. Those favoring I-901 point out that people who wish to enjoy a meal or a drink should not be exposed to smoke, which is hazardous to their health. Opponents of the initiative argue that such people can go elsewhere if they find the environment not to their liking.
\
Although the rights and welfare of patrons are important, a more compelling argument for voting for Initiative 901 has to do with the rights and welfare of the employees. Most employees need their job and do not have the option of going elsewhere. Those who do have such an option would soon be replaced by other people. No worker should have to work in a hazardous environment, especially when the hazards can be eliminated.
\
The dangers to workers who have to spend many hours in a smoke- filled workplace are much greater than the dangers to patrons, who may only be spending an hour or two in that place.

Teacher for Torres-Senz
\
To the editor -- I am writing to encourage Yakima citizens to vote for Jorge Torres-Senz. He is running for a vacant seat on the Yakima school board and will be an excellent choice.
\
Jorge has many years experience working with and for children as a child and family psychologist. He understands the needs of those children who come to our schools needing extra help and attention. He will be an advocate for both children and educators in this demanding environment.
\
Jorge strongly promotes parental involvement and responsibility in the educational process, a key ingredient that is often downplayed and ignored when considering student learning success. This will bring a fresh, new, all-inclusive and much-needed perspective to the school board. As a concerned teacher in the Yakima School District I am voting for Jorge Torres-Senz Nov. 8.

To the editor -- Yakima needs change: It seems as if we are stuck in a rut with little attempt to work our way out of the long worn habits. We need to elect officials who are willing to set aside their personal agendas for the good of the whole. Rockey Marshall wants to see Yakima succeed, and he has the enthusiasm and experience to get the job done.
\
Rockey understands that no single person nor solitary group can accomplish all that is needed to turn Yakima around and has committed to bringing all the different groups together to make Yakima a better place to live. He is a proven leader with more energy than twin toddlers and will channel that energy toward improving the quality of life for the citizens of Yakima.
\
Rockey has been active on numerous boards and committees in the area and is to be commended for his dedication in finding solutions for the problems his hometown faces. He wants to help and he has a plan, so let's give this man a chance.
\
I encourage everyone to vote Rockey Marshall for Position 1 on the Yakima City Council.

217,"
OLYMPIA -- As airplanes, apples and other Washington products faced increasingly fierce global competition and homestate businesses wobbled, Gov. Gary Locke and other state leaders pushed ""competitiveness"" as the elixir to revive the economy.
\
Boeing's recent decision to build its next jetliner in Everett is a major sign of a turnaround in the state's business climate, Locke crows.
\
Business leaders concur, but say it's still not known whether the state's commitment will endure when the economy is rosy again or whether the pressure on pols and the bureaucracy to regulate, tax and spend will hogtie businesses anew.
\
Spearheaded by the governor's Washington Competitiveness Council, captains of industry have joined leaders of organized labor, academia, the Legislature and others to brainstorm ways to help companies survive and thrive here.
\
Well over half of the council's ambitious agenda has been adopted over the past two years. Much of it was straightforward. But some elements were pricey a multibillion-dollar transportation package boosted the gasoline tax by a nickel. Others were controversial rolling back unemployment benefits for laid-off workers.
\
Labor complains the effort is too tilted toward business on some issues, and environmentalists and liberals say they've been frozen out.
\
Broad swaths of the council's agenda remain undone such as the latest push to ramp up spending for higher education and work force training.
\
And some of the vexing issues defy solutions that will please everyone, says Dick Thompson, the highly regarded former state budget chief and college official who serves as the council's director.
\
Examples:
\
* The business impulse to rein in state regulators will collide with the simultaneous desire to safeguard the environment, worker safety and so forth.
\
* The desire for smaller, cheaper government clashes with business' demand for significantly higher spending for colleges, public schools and roads.
\
* The business push for a Christmas tree of tax breaks $74 million proposed for the next legislative session alone will mean fewer dollars for schools and the rest.
\
Locke created the council in 2001, clearly shaken by Boeing's decision to move its headquarters to Chicago.
\
Boeing's move, coupled with the mighty struggles of thousands of small businesses, were the ""canary in the coal mine"" that finally convinced policy-makers that ""Olympia, we have a problem,"" said Carolyn Logue, head of the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business.
\
Locke tapped 35 people for the council, leaders from business, labor, academia, ports, tribes, and government. No one specifically represents the environment.
\
Co-chaired by Seattle attorney Judith Runstad, Boeing executive Alan Mulally and Washington Mutual chairman Kerry Killinger, the council also includes heads of Alaska Airlines, REI, Immunex, Port Townsend Paper, Avista, Tree Top, WaferTech and Costco.
\
""It was hard to focus. It was like opening a garage that hadn't been cleaned out in 50 years,"" Runstad said.
\
The panel divided its work into five areas: Taxes and fees, regulation and permitting, physical infrastructure, human capital and innovation, and benchmarks to measure improvement.
\
The committee eventually reached broad consensus on dozens of recommendations, all aimed at improving the state's attractiveness to business. So far, more than half of the 100-plus recommendations have been implemented by the Locke administration or enacted by the Legislature.
\
Examples:
\
* Lawmakers approved the council's No. 1 priority, a transportation fix. Despite overwhelming voter rejection of a 9- cent gas tax hike in 2002, lawmakers approved a nickel increase this year to help raise $4.2 billion over 10 years for highways, ferries, public transportation and rail.
\
* The Legislature overhauled the unemployment insurance programs to reduce costs part of a package of bills aimed at landing the new Boeing jetliner.
\
* Locke and the Legislature fixed a $2.6 billion state budget problem without raising business taxes.

218,"Let's say you go green.\I don't mean superhero green or sick-to-your-stomach green, but green as in the environment.\You start thinking, really thinking, that the future of travel is electric or hybrid vehicles. There's plenty of sound reasoning behind this decision. Besides, the handwriting's on the wall and all over the blasted gas pumps.\You take the plunge, an expensive one I might add, live with the inconvenience of finding plug-in stations, monitor your distance, and tweak your life. But you know it's good because it's as obvious as the defunct gas station on the corner: this is the mode of transportation to come. You're feeling pretty darn good, no longer grimacing at the gas pump like so many others and helping the environment to boot.\Then Washington state and its wise-taxers sense a change in the gas winds. More and more residents are taking a serious look at electric vehicles and beginning to buy them - when they become available, that is - and politicians, as is typical, start thinking about money, specifically tax money. Sen. Mary Margaret Haugen, D-Camano Island, did just that.\Currently, Washingtonians who drive 12,000 miles a year contribute approximately $200 to road maintenance through gas taxes. Apparently this got Haugen thinking: What would happen if gas taxes cease to roll in because more and more people are going green? And since the gas tax is proof positive politicians can squeeze blood from 6,753,369 Washington turnips, she proposed a $100 annual fee on electric car owners.\Now the oil companies, who have regulated, demanded, sequestered and basically run our lives since the birth of the combustible engine, are also getting nervous. Fossil fuel, as they know it, is doomed to extinction like the dinosaurs that left behind the Texas tea, and to earn even more money over the bazillions they've already made before their oil empires topple, they start pushing up the price for the bubblin' crude.\Then the gas station owners, who are feeling the tottering of this gaseous empire, start making noises and before you know it, that electric car is costing double just to charge the dang thing up. On top of that, the state is charging a gas fee even though you're not using gas.\First they want us to go green; then they want us to turn green. What up with that?\The proposed $100 annual fee, also known as Senate Bill 5251, passed on March 29. Proponents contend those who have gone green but still use the roadways must make up the loss of road maintenance revenue that's generated from taxes paid at the gas pump. Electric-vehicle owners must pay their fair share, they cry.\Opponents acknowledge that although electric vehicles use the roadways, their carbon tread mark is much lower. Since several current vehicle models top out at 35 mph, they're unsuitable for highway travel. In reality, the annual fee they pay will go to roads they don't use.\Suggestions have been made to base the fee on miles traveled, vehicle weight, battery pack size or a combination. There's also concern that the $100 fee will be a disincentive to those considering making the switch.\While the politicians in Olympia wrangle about how and whether to appropriate the $100 fee fairly among the state's current 1,316 electric-vehicle owners (with nothing being said about hybrid cars that use both electric and gas), the drive to rid the American public of gas-guzzlers and dependency on foreign oil comes to another fork in the road. Which direction we take depends on how much Big Oil rules the roost and how much Washington state foresees the future of clean and efficient travel.\One thing's certain - the tax people cometh and they sure don't leaveth you alone.\Reach Spokane Valley resident Sandra Babcock at sandi30@comcast.net."

Yakima Republican Curtis King will take sole chairmanship of the Senate Transportation Committee in the 2015 Legislature, where he will preside over controversial proposals on funding transportation projects that have eluded compromise in recent years.
\
Whether he'll be able to use his new muscle to push Yakima Valley projects, such as the expansion of Interstate 82 into six lanes or a new interchange to enhance development of the old Boise Cascade mill site, remains to be seen.
\
But King said Friday he's generally ""optimistic"" about being in a position to benefit his district. Both projects have been on a wish list for several years.
\
King will lead without co-chairwoman Tracey Eide, D-Federal Way, who did not run for re-election.
\
Funding high-priority transportation projects promises to be just one flashpoint in what is expected to be a long and contentious session between the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-majority House.
\
King was named by Senate majority lawmakers who met earlier this week. They also renamed Sen. Jim Honeyford, R-Sunnyside, vice chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which keeps him in charge of developing the Senate's capital budget proposal. Honeyford has been instrumental in securing funding for the Yakima Basin Integrated Water Resources Plan.
\
Republicans now hold a 25-seat majority in the Senate but still operate under the flag of the Majority Coalition Caucus as one conservative Democrat, Tim Sheldon, continues to caucus with them.
\
""I think the caucus felt in some respects having two chairs worked very well, and in other respects it didn't,"" King said in an interview Friday. ""This year we decided to just do what's normal and have our members be the chairs.""
\
In addition to writing the state transportation budget for the next two years, the committee will have to address elements of a proposed carbon fuel reduction plan from Gov. Jay Inslee. The specifics of Inslee's plan are yet to be unveiled, but could include a carbon tax on fuel or caps on carbon emissions.
\
King said he believes such a proposal will put undo stress on consumers by raising the price of fuel. He said he believes the Legislature can approve other policies that both protect the environment and pay for transportation costs, but he didn't offer specifics.
\
He also could play a prominent role in the unresolved debate over a transportation revenue package first proposed by Inslee in 2013. State officials estimate another $10 billion is needed just to support the state's current transportation systems and fund maintenance to roads and bridges, and an increase in the gas tax remains one of the most prominent and controversial elements of that plan.
\
King has opposed a tax increase without first implementing reforms on the oversight of construction costs and the allocation of tolling funds. Some apply specifically to transportation in the state, including stormwater mitigation from runoff on highways and the contracting process for purchasing new ferries.
\
Others would affect permitting, hiring and spending practices of numerous agencies.
\
Meanwhile, the Legislature is under pressure from the state Supreme Court to dedicate billions more to funding public education, which some observers have said could derail discussions of a transportation revenue package altogether.
\
Honeyford, who will oversee the construction budget that lawmakers like to tap for local projects, said he will keep a close eye on public dollars.
\
""I feel strongly that taxpayers expect us to make sure that the monies we use for these projects are well spent and spent in the manner they were intended,"" Honeyford said in a statement.
\
Honeyford will also serve on Senate committees for Agriculture, Water and Rural Economic Development; Energy, Environment and Telecommunications; and Rules. King also serves on the Commerce and Labor Committee.
\
The 2015 legislative session begins Jan. 12 and is scheduled to last 105 days. However, it can be extended if the governor calls a special session, which has been common in recent years.

GUEST COMMENTARY
\
It's time to take action to fix the transportation crisis in Washington. But action just for the sake of action is not the answer, and there's no simple fix.
\
We must make well-informed decisions and fair investments in all types of transportation - smart actions that will make a real difference. ""Business as usual"" isn't fixing our problems, so we need to fundamentally re-create the way we plan, finance and deliver transportation.
\
Move! Maintain! Make our money work! That's what people want - to get out of traffic jams, take care of roads, bridges and buses, and get better value for their tax dollars.
\
The Blue Ribbon Commission on Transportation has heard the public's cry for action and results, and our work reflects these demands. We've developed 64 decisive options that would dramatically change and improve transportation across the state by focusing on mobility, maintenance and efficiency.
\
Now we need the public to take a look and let us know how we've done.
\
Move!
\
Traffic and delay are rampant throughout the state, and our citizens, businesses and environment are suffering as a result. If we don't respond to this crisis now, our future will be bleak. To move people and freight better, we need action and improvements for roads, transit, ferries, rail, bikeways and so forth.
\
Potential solutions include: building new roads, HOV lanes, park- and-ride lots and transit-only lanes, and expanding bus and rail services on major traffic routes throughout the state; empowering regions to fix their own problems by giving them the authority to plan, fund and construct projects; and linking new housing and business developments with adequate transit and pedestrian options.
\
Maintain!
\
Simply fixing and maintaining our roads, buses and ferries is a tremendous challenge. Yet, what could be more important than taking better care of what we have? The commission believes maintenance and safety should be top priorities for all levels of government, and we've developed solutions to protect our billions of dollars worth of transportation assets.
\
Ways to keep everything in working order include: creating common standards for upkeep and safety; providing adequate funding for maintenance and safety of roads, transit and rail; using new durable materials in construction; phasing in a studded tire ban; and forcing utilities and businesses to adequately repave roads when they dig them up.
\
Make Our Money Work!
\
Who's in charge? Who's responsible? What are we getting for our tax dollars? These are questions we hear time and again. And along with confusion over authority comes incredible frustration over projects that take years to build and run over budget. We need to get rid of red tape and make sure we get the biggest bang for our buck.
\
Reforms to make sure our tax dollars are working include: establishing specific targets to monitor government efficiency; cutting and capping administrative and construction costs of transportation agencies; streamlining the permitting process while still protecting the environment; building projects using private- sector funds and expertise; and encouraging cities and counties to share resources.
\
Efficiencies AloneWon't Get Us There
\
We're working hard to identify ways to squeeze savings out of our existing transportation system, but efficiencies alone will not solve our crisis - the needs are simply too great. We'll have to consider new revenue sources if we ever want to get an upper hand on congestion and maintenance.
\
To help solve unique local problems, we should give regions various revenue tools to help pay for improvements. Potential choices could include: charges for miles driven; vehicle license fees; and local option sales and gas taxes.
\
At the same time, statewide funding sources must be predictable and keep pace with inflation. And we should consider dedicating some revenues solely to statewide transportation improvements. Alternatives include: increasing the state sales tax; authorizing a sales tax on the underlying price of gas; devoting taxes generated by transportation-related sales to transportation improvements; and periodically increasing the state gas tax.
\
Tell Us
\
These are just a few of our ideas for strong, positive actions to untangle our transportation mess. But are they the right ideas? Some are controversial because they challenge the status quo, but we think that's exactly what is needed. Have we gone too far or not far enough? We need the public to tell us by Oct. 1.
\
Take a look at our ideas and help us shape what the future will look like.
\
Help us make choices that are right for us and right for our children. All 64 options are available for review on the Internet at www.brct.wa.gov or at any state government publication depository library.
\
The commission will hold a public hearing on Sept. 14 in room 420 of the Yakima County Courthouse from 4-7 p.m. We encourage the public to join us and share their opinions.
\
One thing is certain - for the good of Washington, we must act now. And that's something we can all agree on.
\
Doug Beighle is chairman of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Transportation and a retired senior vice president of Boeing Co. Bettie Ingham is a member of the commission's Investment Strategies Committee and represents the 2nd District on the Yakima County Board of Commissioners.

221,"Hopefuls talk schools, I-5 Bridge, policing\The three candidates running for a seat in Washington's 49th Legislative District agree on a few key points.\They all think that the state's lawmakers should have convened in Olympia for a special session by now, to deal with the economic fallout of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.\They believe that law enforcement agencies need supplemental resources — either in the form of more mental health professionals and social workers, or increased training for officers themselves — to better serve their communities. And they believe that replacing the Interstate 5 Bridge should be a top priority for whomever is elected to the seat.\But in a video meeting with The Columbian's Editorial Board Tuesday morning, the candidates seeking Position 2 in the House of Representatives expressed wide-ranging opinions on other issues that will directly impact voters of the district, which represents west Vancouver.\One such urgent issue is whether students, teachers and school support staff should be expected to return to their classrooms in September.\Currently, new coronavirus cases are rising in Clark County. Public health officials reported 47 new cases Tuesday, a new daily record. Some local teachers are starting to eye a potential back-to-school date with trepidation.\The incumbent, Democratic Rep. Monica Stonier, argued that school systems need to be prepared for the possibility that they'll have to “pivot quickly back to an online environment, and we have to be able to do that better than we did in March.”\With some districts showing higher coronavirus spikes than others, Stonier, who works in public education, also advocated that local school boards ought to be granted some authority over reopening decisions, so long as they follow public health guidelines.\But it's possible that reopening schools could put the health of everyone at risk, not just young students, she added.\“Many kids right now are raised by grandparents and other family members,” Stonier said. “(Kids) may be taking a virus home to very vulnerable family members, and that has a huge impact on our ability to recover.”\Park Llafet, a Republican challenging Stonier for her seat, said that reopening schools in the fall is crucial for the state's economy. That holds true for the employees within the school system, he added, as well as for parents who need to get back to their own jobs.\As to whether reopening schools in the fall is wise, Llafet said, “I think you better ask all of those moms that question.”\He said that the state's superintendent of public instruction, Chris Reykdal, needs to be proactive in coming up with a plan to keep students and staff in the classroom from contracting the virus.\“I believe we can reopen the state safely,” Llafet said. “Not only for the students, but for the employees.”\The third candidate seeking the House seat, independent and fellow first-time candidate Troy Potter, said he's staunchly against reopening schools until at least 2021. He said he watched his wife, a preschool teacher, conduct successful online learning sessions when schools closed four months ago.\It's too soon to gamble with coronavirus, he said.\“Let's reevaluate in January. If everything looks good, let's go for it,” Potter said. “I'm just looking at the safety of not only our kids, but what they can bring home.”\Transportation\Stonier, Llafet and Potter agree that replacing the Interstate 5 Bridge is a top priority.\Potter expressed frustration about how a previous project, the Columbia River Crossing, ultimately fell through after an eight-year planning effort that cost nearly $200 million.\“Everything was done completely wrong on the first round,” Potter said.\Potter also came out strongly against a potential bridge toll to pay for a replacement, claiming that Washington residents wouldn't see the benefits of those funds. He suggested a 1 cent gas tax increase in both Washington and Oregon to help cover the cost of the project.\Llafet said he'd like to see a federal infrastructure package work hand-in-hand with COVID-19 economic recovery, in a similar fashion to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration.\The I-5 replacement bridge could potentially benefit from such a program, Llafet said. He also said he's against paying for the project with tolls.\“I am not opposed to looking at an alternative for a third bridge,” he added.\Stonier countered that discussions surrounding a third bridge at this point are a distraction, and one that has been used to unnecessarily politicize the push to rebuild the I-5 crossing. A divided government, she pointed out, was ultimately behind the failure of the last rebuilding effort in 2013.\“Replacing the I-5 crossing is the most important and prioritized focus,” Stonier said. “The idea of a third bridge is a long-term project. We're going to need to know a lot more about transportation patterns.”\Stonier also said that there are takeaways from the Columbia River Crossing's planning phase that can potentially be carried forward into a new bridge project —it's not a total loss.\“I think we need to first see what leftover data and study info would be helpful from the past process. As time moves on it becomes less relevant, but it can be useful,” Stonier said.\Quick hits\The candidates also touched on their views surrounding climate change, police reform, and the state's budget deficit.\Though all three agree that the planet is changing, they disagree on the cause.\“It follows natural law. Things are decaying,” Llafet said. “At what level are they decaying, that is perhaps what is subjective.”\Potter said that humans are actually helping to improve the planet, with their heightened awareness of the environment. Stonier took a different stance.\“To not accept and take full responsibility for the impact that we as humans … have on the climate, would be a failure on my part as an elected official,” she said.\On policing, they were largely in agreement: law enforcement needs more de-escalation options. That could come in the form of social workers or mental health professionals who could accompany officers on calls, or officers could receive more training on those topics directly.\Funding could potentially be funneled into those services from traditional police budgets, Stonier suggested. The other candidates said they'd be reluctant to consider any kind of reduction in funding for local police departments.\The full conversation with The Columbian's editorial board is available at youtube.com/user/columbiannewspaper. The three candidates will appear on the primary ballot on Aug. 4, and the top two will advance to the general election on Nov. 3.\Calley Hair: 360-735-4558; calley.hair@columbian.com; twitter.com/calleynhair The following fields overf\CREDIT: Calley Hair Columbian staff writer"
222,"OLYMPIA - The Washington State Senate passed Thursday two controversial climate proposals that aim to reduce carbon emissions in the state: a ""cap-and-trade"" bill and a clean fuel standard.\Both bills have been proposed by Democrats and Gov. Jay Inslee for years, but neither has made its way through the Legislature. They're both pieces of what Senate Democrats call a ""grand bargain,"" which ties proposals that reduce carbon emissions to a transportation revenue package that funds new highways, roads and green energy initiatives.\The cap-and-trade bill, which passed 25-24 after a six-hour debate on more than 40 amendments, would put a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and force companies who cannot meet that cap to purchase carbon allowances from the state.\Four Democrats voted against the bill.\Bill sponsor Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, said the proposal is ""good economics and good environmental policy."" It looks at effects of carbon on the environment, as well as the effects on people most harmed by climate change, he said.\""It is a profoundly serious endeavor that this legislation embarks on,"" Carlyle said on the floor.\It would put a cap on emissions from large polluters by 2023. Companies who cannot meet the cap can purchase carbon allowances from the state. The revenue from those allowances would fund projects resulting in ""long-term environmental benefit and increased resiliency to the impacts of climate change,"" according to the bill.\Supporters say it will provide cleaner air across the state by reducing carbon emissions from the largest polluters in the state while generating some revenue for the state to spend on projects that could improve the environment.\Supporters also say it would invest in programs that would help those disproportionately affected by climate change, including people of color and low-income earners.\Opponents say the bill could result in working families paying more for fuel, electricity or food. Large corporations, they say, could find ways to avoid paying large fees.\""There is not a single person today in the state of Washington who will not be affected,"" said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.\An amendment proposed by Braun would have implemented a carbon pollution tax instead of the cap-and-trade program. It would have started with a $15 tax per metric ton of greenhouse gas emissions on the sale or use of fossil fuels in the state.\Republicans said this amendment would have broader support from business and corporations, but Democrats said the tax would not be enough.\Tax reform should be on the table, Carlyle said, but a carbon tax alone would not effectively reduce carbon.\""This is a climate bill, not a tax bill,"" Senate Majority Leader Marko Liias said.\Opponents also argued it has negative effects on manufacturing and farms, which could see loss of jobs or increasing costs. Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, said the proposal could have harmful effects on farms in Eastern Washington because it could drive up costs for many small farmers who use a lot of fuel.\Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, criticized the passage of the bill in a statement, saying farmers in the state use large amounts of fuel to produce crops and move them to market or ports.\""Farmers and growers are price takers, not price setters, which means they'll be hurt by higher fuel prices,"" he said. ""This bill will be very bad for ag, no question about it.""\The clean fuels standard bill passed 27-20 after a late-night debate. It aims to use progressively cleaner transportation fuels in the state, including those used in cars, trucks, boats, trains and aircraft.\If enacted, it would reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuel by 20% by 2035, according to the bill. To do so, the bill would incentivize the creation of alternative fuels in the state and penalize producers of transportation fuels that don't meet the standards.\Similar to the cap-and-trade bill, opponents say it would result in an increase in gas prices. Supporters say that in California and Oregon, which also enacted these standards, those price hikes didn't happen.\Inslee has tried to introduce both proposals for years, but they have never received enough support in the Legislature. He told reporters Thursday both the cap-and-trade and the clean fuel standard proposals would bring Washington in line with the rest of the West Coast.\""We need climate action this year,"" he said. ""We can't run or hide from it. We have to defeat it.""\Senate Democrats are trying to keep both the clean fuels standard and the cap-and-trade proposals tied to a new transportation package.\Last week, the Senate Ways and Means Committee attached an amendment to the clean fuels standard bill that requires at least $500 million more every two years for transportation before the new standard could go into effect.\That new funding could come from a new transportation package, written by Sen. Steve Hobbs, D-Lake Stevens. His plan looks to spend $17.8 billion over the next 16 years on new investments in highways, roads and green energy initiatives. To do so, it uses some money from the cap-and-trade bill, as well as a 9.8 cent gas-tax increase and other taxes and fees.\For Spokane, that package could mean finally funding the long-awaited Division Street Bus Rapid Transit system. The proposal currently has $50 million set aside for the project for the next 16 years.\But that package only passes if both the cap-and-trade and low carbon fuels standard proposals do. While they've now passed the Senate, they might not be as lucky in the House, where leaders have already indicated it could be too late in the game for such a large package to pass.\The last day of the session is April 25, just over two weeks away.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com.\SIDEBAR:\BILL INFORMATION\Senate Bill 5126 passed the state Senate 25-24.

223,"Candidates for mayor were given a 30-question survey from The Spokesman-Review about their positions on numerous topics, including taxes, the Waste-to-Energy Plant, the urban forest and Fire Department response times. Four of the five candidates responded, and below is a portion of the questions and answers. To view all of them, visit The Spokesman-Review's online Election Center, www.spokesman.com/elections.\Candidates were given 100 words to answer the following:\Q. Why do you feel that you are the best candidate?\David Condon:\I will provide the strong leadership necessary to solve the city's most challenging issues. It's time for a wake-up call at City Hall. City government can no longer afford to spend more than it earns. My background in finance, the military, small business and government service has prepared me to set priorities for city government and to get results. The city is trying to do too many things and spending too much money.\Mary Verner:\I'm the only candidate who has experience running a city with a complex $600 million budget and over 2,000 employees. I've successfully served as City Council member and mayor, elected citywide, and have demonstrated my ability to implement citizens' priorities. My proven track records in business, government, law and management have made me well-suited to serve again as CEO of the city. Service to the community has always been at the forefront of my career choices, and I am honored to again seek to serve the citizens of this great city.\Barbara Lampert:\Lived in Spokane on and off since 1954. Know this town and love it. Running a low-budget, ""mini-reporting"" campaign to show I know how to save money and use it wisely.\Michael Noder:\I believe I am best candidate because I am dedicated to reducing the size, cost and scope of government. I plan to reverse the rapidly growing costs and impositions of government on the lives and incomes of individual citizens.\Q. Given the expected $7 million shortfall between the revenue the city expects in 2012 and the amount needed to maintain current services, should the city maintain a youth department? Should the city maintain an arts department? Should the city maintain a weights and measures department? Are there other city services that you would consider eliminating?\David Condon:\The city should focus taxpayer resources on core services. Citizens have identified public safety and streets as their top priorities. The city should consider partnering with other community organizations to deliver services outside the scope of the city's charter. It is possible that these services could be delivered by other organizations more efficiently or at a lower cost. If city government spent less time arguing with the county and other local municipalities, we could save money with regional solutions.\Mary Verner:\The Youth, Arts, and Weights & Measures departments are important for quality of life, opportunity for young people, the culture and character of our city and consumer protection. However, my focus for the general fund is on protecting our citizens' safety and maintaining basic infrastructure. Management, supervisory and workforce ranks have been reduced and program budgets have been deeply cut. We must retain essential core services to support local businesses and grow private-sector jobs. So I am exploring options with City Council and community members to retain these important small departments through alternative arrangements and partnerships.\Barbara Lampert:\Yes, we need a Youth Department for quality of life. Yes, we need an Arts Department to maintain and enhance culture. Yes, we need the Weights and Measures Department to protect consumers. All city services are important. They should be reduced and not eliminated. Reduce them by making their organization less top-heavy.\Michael Noder:\Answer No. 1: The city should not maintain a youth department. Schools, parks, neighborhood councils, charity organizations and private sector initiatives are better suited to oversee such activities. I will consider city involvement with youth services in conjunction with the library system. Otherwise, I want youth services out of city government. Answer No. 2: Arts should go with parks and be administered there when possible. I prefer private sector funding as opposed to taxpayer funding of the arts. Answer No. 3: Yes, the city should absolutely maintain a weights & measures department.\Q. Do you support the use of red light cameras? If so, do you support diverting ticket revenue from a fund for traffic safety projects to help balance the budget?\David Condon:\Yes. Red light or speed cameras are appropriate where they can demonstrate a positive impact on traffic safety, but the funds should not be diverted from traffic safety projects.\Mary Verner:\I support camera enforcement for intersection safety. Red-light running is extremely dangerous. Over 23,000 tickets have been issued at only seven intersections since the first cameras were installed in October of 2008, so it is obvious that driver behavior needs to change. It is impractical to use scarce police resources for this purpose, and the camera systems preserve privacy and provide an appeal process. I support using the revenue only for traffic safety, and believe funding traffic patrols (such as speed limit emphasis patrols) would be consistent with the use of the funds for traffic safety.\Barbara Lampert:\Yes. Yes, the balanced budget is the priority.\Michael Noder:\Answer No. 1: Not under the current configuration. Answer No. 2: I support sound traffic control management uninfluenced by revenue enhancement schemes, particularly those that primarily benefit private sector interests.\Q. Spokane's library system offers significantly fewer hours than many of the 20 largest cities in Washington. Would you be willing to ask voters for a tax to boost this service as was requested earlier this year by the city library board?\David Condon:\A regional approach to library service delivery should be evaluated as a possible alternative to shrinking services. I am concerned about going to the voters without having carefully evaluated our options and trimmed overhead costs.\Mary Verner:\Increased revenues will be necessary if library hours are to be increased. Cuts to all general fund budgets have constrained library funding to freezes alongside other frozen departmental budgets. I asked the library board to be patient regarding new taxes as we prioritize many different requests to voters. Citizens' tolerance for new taxes is very limited, while funding needs are extensive (fire and emergency medical response, police investigation of property crimes, animal control, and many more). I believe taxes for these essential services must be balanced to provide adequate library services, as well.\Barbara Lampert:\No, we don't need another tax. Libraries should be open 24-7. There should be a donation jar at each checkout counter. People would give plenty if it was possible to do so. Currently, only the rich are invited to give at fancy fundraisers.\Michael Noder:\Not likely. City library services need to evolve. The delivery of information services have been migrating rapidly to new platforms. I encourage the library board to recognize this changing knowledge field and to re-task existing assets to maximize informational value for the Spokane community.\Q. Most city officials say that the street department has not been adequately funded to properly maintain city streets once they are reconstructed. This year, the City Council approved a $20 vehicle tab tax to boost street funding. Do you support this decision? If not, would you support a change in state law to allow the city to create a street utility fee that would be charged on city trash and water bills?\David Condon:\No, we should have gone to the voters for approval. Long-range, voter-approved funding for streets is a key priority.\This is another example of Mary Verner's lack of leadership on a key issue, by ignoring the larger issue in favor of taking the easy route with a small, short-term fix. The city should have worked with regional partners for a more comprehensive regional solution to street investment. Citizens have been supportive of street financing in the past and are likely to be again if the investment is guaranteed to produce results as they did in the last street bond.\Mary Verner:\I am in close contact with many other mayors who are all dealing with the same challenge of loss of federal funding and gas tax dollars for streets. I followed the council's decision closely and understood the rationale for having users of our streets pay to maintain them. The state currently does not allow cities to have an additional street utility fee, and I do believe the Legislature should give cities the freedom to pursue it, if they choose to. For Spokane, a street utility program would have to go to the voters to decide by majority. I would not support it without voter approval.\Barbara Lampert:\Yes, vehicles are a luxury. Those who drive a vehicle should help pay for the streets. Everyone needs trash and water service, even those who can't afford the luxury of a vehicle.\Michael Noder:\Answer #1: No. Answer #2: No.\Candidates were given 150 words to answer the following:\Q. City officials increased sewer charges by 17 percent last year and predict more increases the next few years in large part to pay for nearly $650 million for projects required by the state to improve sewage treatment and prevent untreated sewage from spilling into the river. Do you support sewage fee increases that could top 10 percent in each of the next couple of years? If not, what would be your preferred alternative?\David Condon:\The city's utility rate increases are excessive. While the city has significant interest in improving water quality, the citizens of Spokane should not bear all of the cost of state- and federally mandated water quality measures.\The current mayor has taxed funds each year intended for sewage treatment in order to pay for general government overhead. That was irresponsible and has led to the higher sewer charges. The tax on the Rate Stabilization Fund should be rescinded to lessen the increase.\Mary Verner:\No, I do not want increases to be so steep. In fact, I proposed a lower increase last year, but City Council increased the rate by 17 percent. I prefer more moderate annual increases, using previously saved reserves, grants, low-interest loans and revenue bonds. In 2008, I commissioned the city's first-ever comprehensive utility rate review so we could set rates based on long-term stability for the utilities and citizens' ability to pay. I believe this approach should continue to guide rate-setting as we make investments necessary to clean up the Spokane River. Unfortunately, hard decisions were deferred in the past, and rates will exceed 10 percent increases until the largest capital investments are completed. Innovative projects that collect stormwater in attractive roadside planters (West Broadway, South Lincoln) help reduce sewage treatment costs. I'll continue to work with regulators to pace costs of compliance to keep rates as low as possible.\Barbara Lampert:\Yes, untreated sewage is not an option. City life is expensive. Get another job, double up in your living space, or find a cheaper place to live.\Michael Noder:\I would prefer to sue the State of Washington, for dumping unfunded mandates on us, but the mismanagement of city interests also appears to be a huge problem. I am disgusted with government-engineered waste of taxpayer money. The improvements are providing marginal environmental gains. We clearly needed more capacity and steadily increasing environmental standards goes with upgrades, but we did not need $650 million worth of improvements. It is doubtful the final cost will stay this low. I do not have an immediate answer to this economic black hole, but expect long-term utility bonds will be part of the solution/penalty. I will have to see clear and understandable financial statements before commenting much further on this unpleasant subject.\Q. Do you support the sustainability plan promoted by Mayor Mary Verner, which was adopted by the Spokane City Council in 2010? Do you support the decision of former Mayor Dennis Hession to sign the U.S. Conference of Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement?\David Condon:\There are elements in the sustainability plan that warrant further evaluation. In addition to energy and the environment, sustainability must include a sustainable budget. I would not have signed the Climate Protection Agreement, on the grounds that the mayor of Spokane should be focused on local governance, not partisan, national issues.\Mary Verner:\Major insurance companies and the U.S. Defense Department are increasing their efforts to address risks of dependence on foreign oil and high-priced energy. With a small grant, my administration and 150 citizens compiled the city's Sustainability Plan to guide city actions to reduce waste and exhibit leadership for the community. I've taken tangible actions to address the city's impact on the environment and the global economy's impact on Spokane.\Spokane's Sustainability Plan received planning association awards. Greenhouse gas reduction targets in the plan build on former Mayor Hession's 2007 pledge to the Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement. Other goals and action steps include: alternative transportation options; community gardens; using recycled glass in street projects; and, disseminating educational materials. I developed an energy savings plan, with the help of a loaned Avista executive, to take more steps to reduce the city's annual purchase of $8 million in electricity and natural gas.\Barbara Lampert:\Yes. Yes.\Michael Noder:\Answer #1: No. Answer #2: No. Spokane's reputation for green-cleaning and eco-fraud appears well deserved. The city should conserve and steadily seek improved efficiencies in all of its operations; however, I have little confidence in the economic or scientific case for binding subsequent administrations to poorly defined sustainability objectives that lack clearly understood economic impacts.\Q. Do you support collective bargaining rights of government employees?\David Condon:\I respect the right of workers to collectively bargain. But the current mayor has been giving away the store. City workers have generous salary, benefit and pension packages while the city is drowning in red ink. I intend to be a fair, but tough, negotiator.\Mary Verner:\Yes. Successful labor negotiations kept our city from experiencing problems like those that occurred this spring in Wisconsin. I respect the staff's professionalism as well as the bargaining process. Through the collaborative decision-making process of collective bargaining, I was able to achieve significant compromises in staff ratios and benefit cost reductions which were made thoughtfully and rationally for the last three years. Sharing our budget information educated the unions about harsh economic realities. With mutual understanding by management and labor, I was able to lead negotiations to significant reductions, and met the challenge of balancing not one, not two, but three years of city budgets with cumulative $34 million deficit reduction while avoiding layoffs.\Barbara Lampert:\Yes, government employees deserve citizenship rights of collective bargaining.\Michael Noder:\No, collective bargaining is not a right, it is a power. I am personally against subverting the individual interests of union members to a collective; however, I view this as a decision of city employees. As mayor I represent the citizens, not the unions specifically, and will seek the best value proposition that I can for all citizens and ratepayers. I am concerned with the tendency of collective bargaining to make government services uncompetitive relative to private sector comparisons. I am even more concerned with the tendency of collective bargaining agreements to punish individual performance while rewarding the poor performance of others.\Q. State leaders have said that local funding may be needed to pay to finish the North Spokane freeway. Do you support the completion of the North Spokane freeway south of Francis Avenue to Interstate 90? If so, would you be willing to support local taxes, fees or tolls for the freeway?\David Condon:\Yes, the North Spokane freeway will be an economic driver as well as an environmental enhancement. Improving freight mobility and relieving surface street congestion is a win/win for Spokane. What portion of the state and federal infrastructures should be funded by local investment is something that needs to be negotiated with the state and our regional neighbors.\Mary Verner:\I do support the completion of the North-South freeway, but not at the expense of repairing our local streets. We need to finish what we started and open the freeway to push heavy freight traffic off our local streets. I would prefer using tolls, fees and state and federal partnerships, rather than local taxes, to complete the corridor. I remain supportive of a regional Transportation Benefit District to contribute funds to this project of regional significance.\Barbara Lampert:\Yes, the North Spokane freeway should be completed. No, we should pursue federal, state or private grants to finish the freeway.\Michael Noder:\Answer #1: I have no problem paying for our share of infrastructure improvements that benefit our community directly. Answer #2: I reserve comment on funding solutions until I have reviewed the projected costs and have consulted engineering reports. I suspect we can get it done, but I make no offer of support at this specific time."

Don Wagner in his office in Vancouver. The longtime state transportation administrator retired Friday.
\
A sign in Don Wagners office foretells his move to Hawaii after his retirement.
\
When Don Wagner began his transportation career in 1973, he worked as a rear chainman with the Oregon Department of Transportation.
\
He described the job this way:
\
I replaced a lock on the dumb end of a tape measure, Wagner said this week. Somebody said, Here, hold the dumb end of this tape here, and Im going to go out there and measure something important.?
\
He added: The expectation was fairly low.
\
Wagner chuckles now about the assignment, which turned out to be the humble start of a long career. Wagner spent 24 years with ODOT before joining the Washington State Department of Transportation as Southwest regional administrator in 1997.
\
He also spent a brief stint as co-director of the ill-fated Columbia River Crossing, stepping into a political hornets nest during the projects later stages.
\
Wagner, 63, is now retiring after a transportation career spanning 42 years and two states. Hes moving with his wife to Hawaii where theres not a single interstate bridge. (Though there are, oddly, interstate freeways.)
\
His last day in the office was Friday.
\
When youve had a long career, youre kind of used to whats normal getting up every morning, thinking about whats happening, planning the day out, Wagner said. Its going to take a little bit of time to get used to (not doing) that.
\
Building boom
\
During his time with WSDOT, Wagner oversaw something of a building boom in Southwest Washington. A pair of gas-tax packages in 2003 and 2005 steered $850 million in projects to the region, he said. Most of that investment occurred in Clark County.
\
The project list includes some major efforts. Among them are the Salmon Creek Interchange Project, an expansion of state Highway 14 in Camas and Washougal, a new interchange at state Highway 500 and St. Johns Boulevard, and upgrades along the Interstate 205 corridor. Wagner also shepherded the completion of the Southeast 192nd Avenue connection at Highway 14 and other projects crucial to the areas development, said Vancouver City Councilor Jack Burkman.
\
If you look at what he has delivered here the amount of progress that hes helped foster here is staggering, said Burkman, who worked as a regional planning manager for WSDOT in 2007 and 2008.
\
Wagners ability to work with a wide range of perspectives in politically difficult environments is a big reason for his success, Burkman said. Wagner also balanced technical expertise with a skill in building partnerships, said Matt Ransom, executive director of the Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council.
\
Hes just a consummate professional, Ransom said. When he speaks, people listen.
\
CRC co-director
\
With all of the achievements of his career, Wagner can also point to a few disappointments. He considers one of those to be the Columbia River Crossing, the canceled megaproject that would have replaced the Interstate 5 Bridge and brought light rail to Vancouver.
\
Wagner took over as co-director of the CRC in early 2010. By that time, much of the technical work had been done, and the effort had moved more into the political realm.
\
The $3 billion CRC earned the support of every jurisdiction that had a formal stake in the project. Thats no small accomplishment given the often disparate political interests on both sides of the Columbia River, Wagner said. But by then it also had a host of citizen detractors.
\
It was a huge success, he said. The problem was we didnt bring the public along to have that same understanding of the project.
\
The CRC lost significant momentum in early 2011 when leaders scrapped the design of the bridge, following the recommendation of an expert review panel that called it unnecessarily costly and complex.
\
Wagner stepped away from his role in the CRC project office in the spring of 2011, returning to his regular WSDOT duties. The project began to unravel in 2012 and 2013 amid other missteps, heightened scrutiny and new elected leaders who were hostile toward it.
\
The CRC was shut down for good last year.
\
I believe what was the ultimate demise of the project was the length of time it took, Wagner said.
\
As he prepares for retirement, Wagner said he plans to relax and take on some charity work. A send-off event for Wagner was planned before he heads to Hawaii.
\
Wagners four-decade career has seen dramatic changes in both vehicle and infrastructure technology. New projects have altered the regional landscape. But he cites at least one constant during that time.
\
What hasnt changed, in my opinion, is the quality of the people that work for the DOTs, he said. Whether youre in Oregon or Washington, theyre very dedicated people.
\
Wagners career gradually took him north as he took on regional leadership positions in Roseburg, Salem and Portland in Oregon, then Vancouver.
\
Now Im going to go west, he said.

State stimulus questions
\
To the editor -- A Jan. 26 article describes the $1 billion stimulus plan sponsored by Democrat Hans Dunshee. I only have three questions for Mr. Dunshee and the rest of our legislators (those elected officials who are supposed to manage this state for the citizens).
\
First: Have you witnessed the state of the U.S. economy since Obama's nearly $1 trillion stimulus package? The economy has barely budged, proof that their definition of ""shovel ready"" was very far from accurate; and proof that short-term stimulus rarely provides sufficient returns, especially over a longer term.
\
Second: Where will you get the money when we have been fighting to close the deficit gap, more borrowing? How is that working for the United States as we approach a federal deficit that is more than the gross domestic product of the U.S. economy?
\
Finally: Where have you been (collectively) during the time these projects have needed to be done over the past several years? How come they are suddenly an emergency when you were able to ignore them in recent years due to budget problems? Is this another boon to the unions as the federal programs were?

Flat-lined thinking
\
To the editor -- Global warming (see Jan. 27 letter, ""Global warming claims"") is not the only hoax being perpetrated on us by the government. Regarding those ""Round World"" theorists: Many claims are made, but when were we last provided actual proof of these irresponsible liberal beliefs?
\
For the truth, see www.theflatearth society.org: ""the earth is flat and ... Round Earth doctrine is little more than an elaborate hoax."" Learned experts including Dr. Samuel Birley Rowbotham have submitted easily reproducible evidence demonstrating that the surface of the earth does not curve.
\
Why would good American citizens choose to instead believe someone from Greece (Pythagoras), France (Maupertuis) or Portugal (Magellan)? Ask yourself, why are big government agencies (NASA, U.S. Geological Survey) using our tax dollars to perpetrate on us their false belief that the world is round? ""Round World"" is only a theory some scientists promote, not a fact.
\
We need to fight craziness. Educate yourself. Don't just accept claims made without proof.

Dairy practice problems
\
To the editor -- The dairy industry donated $30,000 for Yakima Regional Clean Air Authority's Dairy Policy Research Project. This project allowed the industry to set its own guidelines and perimeters for the project. There was/is no off-site, scientific data gathering of surrounding properties and homes, even though the Washington State University scientists suggested doing so.
\
The dairy industry gave the donation to WSU with the intention of selecting dairy friendly scientists of its choice. Project end results are to use their eyes to determine odors from manure and urine. Local citizens and environmental groups were not included in decisions that affect the dairy owners' neighbors, their health and the value of their homes and property.
\
Scientists from Johns Hopkins did an extensive off-site, scientific data gathering research in 40 selected homes near dairies or feedlots. Their peer-reviewed study reveals there is dairy pollution inside the homes. Recently, a federal court judge ruled that Best Management Practices contribute to pollution. BMPs have been in effect for many years -- apparently they don't work.

Allow all equal rights
\
To the editor -- Thank you to the letter writers and others who stand up for gay rights. Every person on earth has the right to a happy life, and the right to totally share that happiness with one chosen mate. As a parent, all I ever want and pray for my children is a life of happiness and treated equally in every aspect of their life.
\
The day that one of your children ""outs"" to you, is not something you expect or planned for in those dreams you had for them. It is not an easy path for them to go down, and we always want an easy life for our loved ones. No parent is exempt from possibly hearing those words from their son or daughter. But, that doesn't stop us from loving them as much as before, and still wanting that ""happy forever after"" for them with the one they love.
\
Please, Washington state, allow all of our children that ""forever happy with the one they love"" right that they deserve.

Approve Yakima levy
\
To the editor -- Please vote yes for our Yakima school levy!
\
While public resources are limited, education is a wise investment for our future. Public schools serve all our children and provide their basic learning opportunities, including complex programs to meet special needs.
\
We all benefit if the district is able to continue the quality programs and services currently available to students.
\
Without a doubt, it's a tough time to ask our community for financial support. The school board voted to keep the levy at a level that would just maintain the ongoing programs.
\
That was a good, responsible decision.
\
Levy dollars strengthen the district's operating budget. Levy dollars are not used for constructing new buildings. If we lose local levy dollars -- and any possible state levy equalization money -- then programs and opportunities for all kids would be significantly weakened or reduced.
\
We cannot afford that.
\
Yakima schools provide strong academic, special education, vocational, honors, music/arts and athletic programs, and leadership and community service opportunities in secure environments -- most made possible through levy dollars.
\
Our future rests in the strong hearts and educated minds of Yakima's youth.
\
Their future options and achievements depend on the decisions we make today.

Selah bonds needed
\
To the editor -- Selah residents have the opportunity to pass school facilities bonds in February and improve the community of Selah without raising taxes. The bond measure would replace Selah Junior High, expand Selah High School, and make efficient use of our current facilities without raising the current tax rate of $1.23 per thousand.
\
If passed, John Campbell Elementary School would become the future home of all preschool through second-grade students within the Selah School District. This configuration would give the youngest students one place to go to school with the older students attending Selah Intermediate School. John Campbell was designed as an elementary school and the facilities, structure, etc., were created to serve small children. The current facilities and campus at Robert Lince were designed as a high school and although remodeled to accommodate elementary-age students, the campus and facilities still provide challenges for students.
\
Passing the upcoming facilities bonds would allow all primary teaching staff the opportunity to collaborate as a group rather than being split up among the two current elementary buildings. This new John Campbell campus would provide students the ideal school configuration to begin their education. Join in me voting yes for Selah students.

Can't afford West Valley levy
\
To the editor -- Something is wrong! Asking for 22 percent more is wrong! Please, West Valley homeowners, we need to send a strong message that we cannot add another $1.5 million to our property taxes. For years we have been told that it's just another $100-plus. How many more times can adding another $100-plus to everyone's taxes be justified?
\
We need to be courageous and vote no! We need to tell West Valley School District administrators and our school board that we do not have bottomless pockets. Home-owners are concerned about the security of their jobs and need to be cautious.
\
The WVSD can have another election and ask for the same amount it is receiving now. While the vast majority of homeowners have not received any increase in their salaries, we hear proposals to increase sales tax, the gas tax and we constantly face higher food costs and power bills. We cannot afford another $1.5 million!
\
My school taxes are $1,061.18. My other property taxes are $906.97. Does this sound like someone who is selfish? All I am saying is that $1,968.15 is enough! Let's all join hands and defeat this 22 percent increase of $1.5 million. It's wrong! Vote no!

A planned freeway interchange will open a new gateway to Battle Ground and north Clark County.
\
The interchange at 219th Street will be the first added to Interstate 5 in this county since the 99th Street project in 1996.
\
The state Department of Transportation will kick off the $34.7 million project Tuesday with an open house detailing the necessary environmental studies and outlining possible routes.
\
The new nickel gas tax adopted by the Legislature earlier this year will cover the entire cost of the interchange at 219th Street, also known as state Highway 502.
\
The state expects to start construction in 2007 and complete the project in 2009. But first the transportation department must review potential effects on the environment, take public comment about possible routes, decide on the final alignment, complete designs and obtain rights of way.
\
""This new interchange is an important step toward improving mobility along the I-5 corridor,"" said Don Wagner, administrator for the transportation department's Southwest region, in a statement announcing Tuesday's meeting.
\
The interchange will take pressure off the exit at 179th Street, now the most direct route off I-5 to state Highway 502 and Battle Ground.
\
State officials say the interchange will improve safety by reducing the need for cars to change lanes between the I-5 and I- 205 junction and the 179th Street exit.
\
The state completed a study of new I-5 on- and off-ramps in 1998, and then had to secure permission from the federal government.
\
Battle Ground boosters have been pushing for the interchange for years. They hope the more direct route to Battle Ground will help the city attract new businesses.
\
""This really will be a boon for Battle Ground,"" said Mayor John Idsinga. ""Transportation is the key to economic development. It will definitely open up our industrial areas.""
\
He added, ""It will make it easier for the citizens of Battle Ground to get out to the freeway.""
\
The state also plans a $15 million widening of a five-mile stretch of state Highway 502-219th from Interstate 5 to the western Battle Ground city limits.
\
Battle Ground and the state are finishing up widening of that road within the city limits, known there as West Main Street.
\
The city will celebrate completion of the project with a ribbon cutting at 10:30 a.m. Oct. 30.
\
Open house: An open house from 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday at the Battle Ground Chamber of Commerce, 912 E. Main St., will detail the $34.7 million project to build a new Interstate 5 interchange at 219th Street.

227,"Gov. Jay Inslee's plan to charge some of the state's largest businesses for carbon pollution their operations generate drew praise and criticism Thursday in its debut before a legislative committee.\It will cost jobs in energy, manufacturing and farming and raise energy bills, critics told the House Appropriations Committee. It will provide new opportunities in alternative energy while improving the environment, supporters said.\But state officials who have studied the plan said they believe it won't have a huge negative or positive impact on Washington's economy. It will have a modest impact on prices, personal income and employment, said Marc Baldwin, assistant director of forecasting for the Office of Financial Management.\The plan places a charge - some call it a tax - on high amounts of carbon emissions, eight different greenhouse gases thought to contribute to climate change, for about 100 large businesses, which include electric and natural gas utilities, oil refineries and factories. Over the next 35 years, the amount of emissions the state will allow would be reduced, and businesses would have to find ways to reduce pollution or buy ""allowances"" at an auction.\Because those businesses are expected to pass at least some of those costs on to customers, some of that charge would eventually be paid by the general public when they drive cars or heat and light their homes.\The money from the fees and the allowances would be used for a combination of transportation projects, education and other state programs.\The system is marginally regressive, meaning a slightly higher percentage of a poor family's income would be used for those higher costs than a rich family's, Baldwin said.\But higher energy prices are a concern, said Rep. Kevin Parker, R-Spokane, because they are a key factor in consumer confidence. ""That's not something I think we should be playing with,"" he said.\Vehicle exhausts are a major source of carbon emissions, and the proposed system focuses on big businesses without directly tackling them, said Rep. Chad Magendanz, R-Issaquah. ""Why not use an existing tax we already have, the gas tax ...without introducing a whole new system of taxation?""\But the carbon pollution system does address vehicle exhausts through the required reduction of carbon pollution at the refineries, and provides more certainty of reducing total emissions, members of the governor's staff said. The fees would add an estimated 12 cents to a gallon of gasoline, about the same as Senate Republicans have proposed for a major transportation package, but that's probably not enough to persuade people to drive less. The price of gasoline would rise about 3.5 percent, a fluctuation that has happened, up or down, 14 times in the last year.\Inslee said Thursday he's open to other plans but believes this is the best to accomplish the twin goals the public has to decrease pollution and increase money for education.\""I feel really good about the prospect of the people's will to be followed,"" he said when asked to judge the prospect for his carbon reduction system.\The Appropriations Committee is considering the carbon charge system for possible inclusion in the state's 2015-17 budget. They are expected to vote on it in the coming weeks.\Credit: Jim Camden jimc@spokesman.com, (509) 879-7461"

They haven't settled on a name yet, but an alliance of local government and business leaders do have a plan.
\
The group has agreed to jointly promote three transportation projects in the greater Yakima area, hoping that singing from the same hymnal will mean more state and federal money in the collection plate to build needed roads.
\
Arrayed in no particular order of priority, the three projects include upgrading freeway interchanges in Union Gap, finishing and extending the Interstate 82-State Route 24 project to Moxee, and sprucing up freeway interchanges between the Yakima Training Center exit, north of Selah, and Union Gap.
\
The Valley Mall and South Union Gap interchanges are linked as one project because Union Gap is proceeding with a $12 million extension of Valley Mall Boulevard west to South Third Avenue. A further extension to the west is planned.
\
Todd Trepanier, an assistant regional Transportation Department administrator, said the two interchanges are included to relieve potential congestion caused by expansion in Union Gap.
\
Representatives of cities, the county, state transportation officials and business settled on the three projects on Wednesday, Trepanier said. All three projects are proposed as ways to boost the area's economic vitality.
\
""We are continuing to work together as a group to come up with a solution for these needs so that everyone gets the benefit,"" Trepanier said. ""In today's environment, to believe that one group can do these things isn't as efficient as everyone working together.""
\
Yakima Mayor Mary Place said state lawmakers and the state's congressional delegation have advised local officials unanimous support is needed to obtain funding for road projects.
\
""For our economic vitality, we need to work together and not worry about boundaries,"" she said. ""We are one community trying to solve our problems as a community.""
\
Regional Transportation Department Administrator Don Whitehouse initially called the group together in April out of concern the Upper Valley is being shut out of funding for projects by not working together.
\
In addition to the county, the group includes the cities of Selah, Yakima, and Union Gap, and businessmen, including auto dealer Bob Hall and Trent Marquis, a principal in the proposed Central Washington Sports Center, a 223-acre business and sports complex in Union Gap.
\
Don Skone, director of the Yakima Valley Conference of Governments, said the three road projects will be added to the annual unified transportation plan his office prepares for the metropolitan Yakima area.
\
""This will ensure to our state legislators that everyone is singing the same tune so our request for state or federal funding is consistent,"" Skone said on Friday.
\
Funding for improvements to the Interstate 82 interchange at Nob Hill Boulevard and State Route 24 is included in Referendum 51, the gas tax increase proposal on this fall's ballot.

229,"SPOKANE MAYOR\They agree on a lot, but that hasn't made this high-profile campaign friendly. Incumbent Mayor Dennis Hession and challenger Mary Verner, a councilwoman, are in a tough battle with charges of dirty politics being leveled on both sides. The job pays $138,768 annually. The city has about 2,000 employees and an annual budget of about $533 million.\Supporters of Hession argue that he came into office at a fragile time and has brought stability and fiscal conservatism to the state's second-largest city and promises to keep city spending under control. His campaign has sought to label Verner as wishy-washy.\Verner's camp argues that Hession has too often ignored the public and that he's a poor communicator with his employees and the citizens. They say her experience in government and educational background give her the background necessary for the city's top office.\Hession has raised more than double the amount of campaign contributions as Verner, with strong donations from Avista, residential contractors and others in the development community. Verner has received her biggest contributions from public employees unions and has financial backing from the tribes she represents in her non-council job.\*Hession, 57, attorney; former parks board member; elected to City Council in 2001; elected council president in 2003; appointed mayor in 2005.\*Verner, 51, attorney; executive director of Upper Columbia United Tribes; appointed to City Council in 2004, elected in 2005.\SPOKANE CITY COUNCIL\Finding long-term solutions to the city's perennial budget woes, resolving worsening angst over issues as seemingly innocuous as garbage collection, and balancing neighborhood expectations against the demands and desires of rapid development have kept City Council races active. Council members are paid $18,000 annually; the council president earns $40,000 annually.\Council president: Incumbent Joe Shogan faces perennial candidate Barbara Lampert in the race for the City Council's top seat. Lampert says she'll be better at running meetings and wants to hire an additional 100 police officers but has been unable to say how she would pay for them. Shogan says he's been a fair and steady hand at running council business. He calls Lampert's public safety plan unrealistic and has instead suggested adding 2 1/2 positions for Spokane public high schools on top of the 24 suggested earlier this year by police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick.\*Shogan, 59, attorney; elected to northwest City Council seat, 2003; appointed City Council president in 2006.\*Lampert, 61, retired insurance claims representative and former nurse's assistant; Lampert has run for office each year for more than a decade.\District 1: Covers the third of the city east of Division and south of Interstate 90, plus a portion of downtown east of Monroe Street.\Incumbent Bob Apple faces a challenge from Logan Neighborhood activist and former EWU instructor Donna McKereghan. They argue over who's the best ""watchdog"" for City Hall, with Apple saying he's done that job for four years and McKereghan saying he's lost his energy. He wants the city to do more to fight drugs, particularly methamphetamine, with a special ""meth jail.""

His opponent, Richard Rush, argues city officials have too long ignored the city's comprehensive plan - long-term growth guide - to the detriment of citizens. Rush says he'll be a fresh voice who will put the plan front and center.\Stark labels Rush as a one-issue candidate, while Rush questions the influence of contributions from development interests made to Stark's campaign.

Lewis Griffin is touting his experience as a former city manager in Colfax and Liberty Lake as a plus. Both are supporting some type of impact fees to help pay for road improvements in rapidly growing areas. Corker is a long-time proponent of the city's strong-mayor system; Griffin thinks Spokane would do better with its old council-city manager system but doesn't advocate switching back.

Two seats on the council are being contested. The positions pay $750 per month.\Position 2: Councilman Steve Taylor was running unopposed until late September when he began to face criticism from neighborhood leaders for his employment with Spokane Home Builders Association and his support for greater housing density.

This year, however, the challenge has been getting candidates for the ballot.\Position 5: Ron Welker filed for office then tried to withdraw; he said he might move at the end of the school year because of concerns over sex offenders moving into the area.

He argues that his measure simply holds state lawmakers accountable for tax decisions. Eyman's opponents - including AARP, unions and environmental groups - say it's a foolish scheme that will mire Olympia in bureaucracy, mislead voters and possibly trigger dozens of non-binding statewide votes each November.\The complex measure would:\*re-affirm an existing - but often bypassed - law requiring a two-thirds legislative vote to increase taxes,\*trigger extensive public notices on all tax-hike legislation,\*and require lawmakers to approve state-agency fee increases, large or small.\Also, the proposal tries to discourage lawmakers from declaring tax increases a state emergency - which makes them immune to a voter referendum - by triggering automatic statewide ""advisory votes"" in such cases.\The measure would apply to statewide taxes, like most of the sales tax and gas tax. But it would have little or no impact on taxes that are primarily local, like most property taxes, utility taxes and gambling taxes.\R-67: This spring, the Legislature approved a controversial new law that allows triple damages when an insurer wrongly denies a policyholder's claim. Predicting a flurry of lawsuits, dozens of insurance companies and other groups have spent millions of dollars asking voters - via a statewide referendum - to veto the new law. Fighting to save the new law are dozens of attorneys and law firms.\The law covers many common types of insurance - homeowners' policies, life insurance, auto coverage and business policies. It does not, however, cover health insurance. It also covers only those policyholders suing their own insurer.\The trial lawyers say the law is a critical counterbalance to the increasingly common strategy of insurers denying or delaying legitimate claims. Insurers say complaints are minimal and that if the law stands they'll be forced to settle questionable claims, which will raise everyone's insurance rates.\HJR 4204: If approved by voters the required 60 percent majority for school levies would be abolished, using the simple majority standard instead. It also would eliminate a separate hurdle that total voter turnout must be at least 40 percent.\Supporters say schools need the money and that it's unfair to place the supermajority burden on education while entire sports stadiums can be approved with a simple majority. Opponents, including most Republican legislative leaders, contend making it easier to raise taxes sends the wrong message and is the wrong course to be setting.\SJR 8206: This would amend the state constitution to require that the state create and maintain an official ""rainy day fund."" Spearheaded by Gov. Chris Gregoire, who championed an idea Republicans had pushed unsuccessfully in the Democrat-controlled Legislature in past years, the budget stabilization account would be filled by automatically diverting 1 percent of general state tax revenues into the account each year, an amount estimated at about $150 million annually.\It could be tapped only if 60 percent of lawmakers agree, if the economy is slumping and job growth is at a near standstill, or if the governor declares a state of emergency.\Supporters say it helps prepare the state for future economic downturns. Opponents argue the same goal could be accomplished without a ballot measure if lawmakers would show greater fiscal restraint.\SJR 8212: If approved, the state constitution would be amended to allow companies to resume manufacturing operations inside state prisons to take advantage of voluntary but cheap inmate labor. The state Supreme Court halted the private use of inmate labor in 2004, citing a constitutional provision dating back to chain-gang times.\Supporters say it helps inmates learn valuable job skills that they can use after serving time, and that the measure prohibits companies from using the cheap labor to compete unfairly against other companies. Opponents argue the measure fails to provide enough protections against unfair competition and that it exploits prisoners.\HJR 4215: If approved, it would give the state greater flexibility in where it invests money dedicated to schools from the sales and leases of timber, mining, grazing and so forth on public lands. Currently, profits from those activities on large swaths of land given to Washington state by the federal government in 1889 are prohibited from being invested in private stocks or bonds.\Supporters say it would give the state the ability to earn greater returns on its investments, which would aid education. Opponents argue it's best to leave the money in stable investments ""instead of gambling them in the stock market.""\SPOKANE COUNTY BALLOT MEASURES\Proposition 1, Conservation Futures: Twice in 10 years Spokane County voters have told county commissioners they want to buy land for conservation. Now commissioners wonder whether they should stop asking. The Conservation Futures tax - 6 cents per $1,000 of assessed property value - likely will become permanent if voters consent in an advisory question on the Nov. 6 general election ballot. For the owner of a $150,000 home, the tax would cost $9 a year.\The tax will expire on Dec. 31 unless commissioners renew it. Supplemented with $4.2 million worth of grants, the tax has been used to purchase 4,296 acres of undeveloped land as natural buffers to urban areas and passive recreation areas.\Proposition 2, Emergency communications: Spokane County authorities say they need a 0.1 percent increase in the sales tax rate to upgrade emergency communication equipment, restore the popular Crime Check program and build a new digital radio network required of all emergency agencies by 2012. The tax hike would raise an estimated $7.5 million to $8 million a year.\Opponents say it would be giving politicians and bureaucrats a big ""blank check"" but supporters describe it as a ""sustainable revenue source"" for pressing public safety needs.\CITY OF SPOKANE\Pools and parks bond: The city of Spokane wants $42.9 million to fix pools, create a new sports complex and add other park features. If approved by at least 60 percent of city voters, the property tax rate would increase by $2.36 per $1,000 of assessed value. A home assessed at $140,000 would increase by about $36 a year.\The money would pay to replace or rebuild the city's five outdoor swimming pools and add a new outdoor pool - likely near Joe Albi Stadium. The funds also would build 10 spray pads, allow the city to build a sports complex promised almost a decade ago north of Albi, and improve or build baseball fields across the city.\AIRWAY HEIGHTS\Municipal facilities bond: The city is proposing a $3.7 million bond issue, which would add an estimated 75 cents per $1,000 of assessed valuation to property taxes in Airway Heights to build a new city hall and turn the current structure, which city administration shares with the Fire Department, into an expanded fire station.\Supporters say it's a needed addition for the rapidly growing city. Opponents say it's a nice idea, but hardly a necessity to place the additional taxes on residents with fixed incomes.\TOWN OF SPANGLE\Streets levy: Voters here are being asked to approve a one-year property tax assessment to pay for $20,000 of work on the town's streets and lights. The cost to voters is estimated at $1.67 per $1,000 of assessed valuation, or $167 on a $100,000 home. The money would be collected in 2008, and needs a 60 percent supermajority to pass.\FIRE LEVIES\Spokane Valley Fire levy: The Valley's largest fire department wants a 6-year increase in its levy to pay for upgrades and new stations. If approved, the district's levy rate on property would climb to $1.50 per $1,000 of assessed valuation, up from the current $1.23 per $1,000. That would increase property taxes $54 a year on a home assessed at $200,000 and raise nearly $3.5 million in extra revenue in 2008, according to county assessor estimates.\District 3: Voters in this West Plains district are being asked to restore the original levy rate of $1.50 per $1,000 of assessed property value, which has been reduced to $1.37 per $1,000 by the 1 percent cap on annual increases in the fire district's overall budget. If approved, it would generate an estimated $503,613 in additional revenue for the district next year, and would allow 6 percent annual increases over the next five years. The district serves the southwest corner of Spokane County.\District 5: Voters in another West Plains district also will decide whether to approve an EMS levy that will cost 50 cents per $1,000 of assessed property value. It would raise $43,903 next year that supporters say will help the 90-square-mile fire district serve its growing population.\Making your vote count\* Ballots must be postmarked no later than Nov. 6.\* Designated drop-off boxes are located at public libraries in Spokane County.\* Ballots can be dropped off at the county Elections Office until 8 p.m. Nov. 6.\On the Web\* Find in-depth election coverage at spokesmanreview.com /elections\* Stay atop the Inland Northwest's political buzz at www.pendulumblog.com.\Ballot questions?\Call the elections office in your county:\*Adams County: (509) 659-3249\*Ferry County: (509) 775-5200\*Lincoln County: (509) 725-4971\*Pend Oreille County: (509) 447-3185\*Spokane County: (509) 477-2320\*Stevens County: (509) 684-7514\*Whitman County: (509) 397-6353"

Kids' future in our hands
\
As Michael Zuzel pointed out in two places on Jan. 20, in the editorial ""Levy approval important for Vancouver kids,"" and in his column, ""One word on school levies: disgusting,"" school levies are coming up, and it's time to complain about those who vote against them.
\
And it's time again for those who vote ""no"" to question how school money is spent. We go through this every time, and there's never any answer. It's obvious that schools are not profit-making organizations, but it would help if they ran themselves that way, beginning with the actual building of the schools.
\
When a company such as Kmart builds another store, it doesn't hire an architect each time and pay him 15 percent of the cost of the building. Kmart, as do many companies, has a fixed set of plans for an inexpensive building and uses these plans over and over again. This saves money.
\
Why can't our schools do the same? The state could purchase six to eight sets of plans - different sizes and environments - and use them over and over again. They could save taxpayers millions of our dollars, yet the subject is never broached.
\
It appears our school system is just another political organization that wants to tax and spend without economy or discussion.

\
After reading and agreeing with Michael Zuzel's column, I started thinking about his frustrations over the things that he mentioned concerning our schools and the problems they have paying their bills.
\
There are a lot of inequities in the way we collect that money. One that I can never figure out is why the schools need a 60 percent ""yes"" vote when Paul Allen got his ballpark with a 50 percent ""yes"" vote.
\
Zuzel got me wondering why we don't have enough money to give our children the education they need. Aside from our weird way of voting, I don't think that we are collecting all the money due our schools.
\
If there are 1,000 duplexes in Clark County and the average selling price is $160,000, then the landlord is paying taxes on that amount, yet there are two families living in this one tax base. That means there are 500 families not represented on the tax rolls. If half of them have children in school, then 250 students are not paying their way.
\
What about the thousands of apartments in the county? Not only are the school districts shorted on money, but these same people are voting. Or as Zuzel points out, they don't have to vote to veto a school levy.
\
If voting and taxing rules aren't changed, we will see a group of people who are not smart enough to earn the price of a ticket to go to their new ballpark.

\
Michael Zuzel deserves an award for his honest, thought-provoking commentary on the ""disgusting"" status of our local school levies.
\
The conservative-led Legislature must despise school-age children and middle-income families who have children in public schools. The conservative legislators have been playing a shell game with the taxpayers' dollars for the last four years. They boast about cutting taxes and tightening spending, but look how they've done it.
\
Less than a decade ago the Legislature funded local schools for 85 percent of their operating costs. Levies made up the difference by asking voters to contribute the remaining 15 percent from local property tax. During the last legislative session, each of our conservative local legislators voted in favor of decreasing mandatory state funding to an all-time low of 76 percent and placed the burden on local school districts to raise the remaining 24 percent on property tax.
\
They can brag how they cut spending at the state level and have accumulated more than $600 million in tax reserves, but they have only been able to do this on the backs of local property owners.
\
As a result of this inept legislation, every school district in Clark County except Washougal is asking for more than a 20 percent increase in their maintenance and operations levies. Washougal is asking for a mere 8 percent increase.
\
How can our conservative-led Legislature claim to cut taxes at the state level and then ask local home owners to increase their property tax to support local schools? I resent this when I know that some of my tax dollars are sitting in a huge reserve fund and that our conservative-led Legislature is planning to give more tax cuts to business and industry, which are currently enjoying record earnings.
\
I will be going to the polls next Tuesday to vote in favor of my local schools. But next fall, I think it is time that we turned a few bums out. Someone once said, ""Bad politicians get elected when good people don't vote.""

When my parents came from Europe at the beginning of this century, one of the motivating factors for choosing to come to America was the public school system.
\
At that time in Europe, the wealthy attended private schools or had tutors. Religious education was limited also, usually to that of only being able to read the Bible.
\
Some people in our midst also think that their own preference, whether educational or religious, should be superimposed on all. They overlook the fact that we are a mixture of ethnic and racial groups with a multitude of opinions and beliefs. Despite all the clamor pointing to shortcomings, our public schools are doing a great job of preparing our youngsters for the future.
\
Public schools have made our nation progress to the pinnacle of being the envy of the world. Because of our public schools, most people have learned to live in harmony while enjoying or even confronting our basic differences. The local levy request merely allows for the support of current educational programs and services.

What's next?
\
What will be the next ""rip-off"" of the innocent citizens of Washington?
\
For a few years Clark County overassessed property owners. Mistake? Who knows.
\
In 1997 Paul Allen paid for an election to sell the idea of a new stadium for the Mariners. What or maybe who else did he buy and pay for?
\
Then there was the other event, perhaps even a ""cash event,"" in which Vancouver's City Hall sold out to the downtown development gang.
\
Now I note that corporate welfare took over the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. As a result, we ordinary citizens will be adding another $2 a month to the already overpayment of US West for questionable services. Oregon said ""no,"" but even the Washington commission's staff as well as the commission itself gives US West more bucks to waste advertising the weather, which so far has not been too great.
\
Meanwhile the state Department of Transportation is trying to add 5 cents a gallon to the gas tax. All this with an $800 million state surplus.
\
Then there was the Jan. 1 editorial, ""Community needs emergency shelter,"" about the need for more tax dollars for homeless shelters. That editorial overlooks the multitude of church buildings that should be available. After all, isn't shelter for the homeless one of the missions of religion? Where does it stop?
\
Now the Vancouver schools are asking us to ""Vote Schools."" I have a couple of problems with that, too. First of all, there's entirely too much administration. If there is a shortage of funds for educational purposes, then why the remodeling of the building design of Fort Vancouver High School? Having noted the attire of the students, I think it is time for uniform dress codes, some effort to stop teen smoking and definitely time to teach both students and parents two words: accountability and consequences.
\
Citizens of Washington have been ripped off enough. No more taxes and a reduction in the sales tax are in order.

Two sides to urban sprawl
\
True quality living is within the reach of people in the Portland-Vancouver area if we will take charge of our own future and fire the social engineers that attempt to control our lives.
\
People in our metropolitan area are ready and willing to welcome bistate cooperation to improve traffic problems. However, they are not willing to continue paying for more socially engineered solutions that divert money from schools and transit to force us into smaller space just because urban sprawl has been propagandized to become synonymous with damage to the environment. Sprawl or lack of it can be both good or bad.
\
Congested living and congested travel impact everyone and everything. When too close neighbors infringe on each others' space, petty disagreements, crime and gangs are the result. Congested travel causes road rage, more air pollution and many wasted hours traveling. Mass transit can't fix this problem because only about 4 percent of the people find it convenient and are willing to use it.
\
To obtain the quality of life we all desire, we must provide the infrastructure for efficient movement of motor vehicles. To accomplish this goal we need to know where the traffic comes from and where it wants and needs to go.
\
With today's technology, solid data are available. Aerial photos of traffic patterns coupled with computer analysis will provide the facts that are needed to attack the transit mess. The next step is to prioritize the construction of necessary roads and bridges. Since this will be a bistate project, federal funds will become available.
\
A recent study by Oregon's Metropolitan Service District revealed that traffic congestion will be worse with the south-north light rail system in place than if it isn't built. Recognizing this and eliminating a flawed vision will benefit the bistate cooperation and all our futures.

Balance. That was the message sent forth Tuesday by Clark County voters, who wisely elected Steve Stuart to the influential post of county commissioner, one of only three. Stuart, a Democrat and an appointee to the post, advocates a more cautious approach to growth than did his opponent, Republican Tom Mielke.
\
And that makes Stuart a balancing influence on a board of county commissioners that seeks to reform the 2004 growth plan.
\
Late Tuesday night, Stuart appeared headed for victory with about 52 percent of the votes. According to local election officials, about 82 percent of the votes had been counted.
\
This choice by the voters, if upheld through the final results, is best for Clark County. Stuart not only maintained a high-road stance throughout a highly contentious campaign but also has found ways during his appointed term to work harmoniously with commissioners Betty Sue Morris and Marc Boldt.
\
Stuart supporters know him to be dedicated, informed, diplomatic and receptive to both complimentary and contrary opinions, just the right blend that's needed on a board of county commissioners that seems obsessed with blowing out the boundaries on the 2004 growth plan.
\
Mielke supporters can take heart in this reality: This race was for a one-year unexpired term, and Stuart will be held accountable by voters again in 2006.
\
At the Vancouver city level, voters clearly chose continuity as the preferred path. Royce Pollard will enter his sixth term and second decade as Vancouver mayor, and incumbent city councilors Jeanne Harris, Jeanne Stewart and Pat Jollota all were returned to office after serving well. Pollard, Stewart and Harris each were checking in at more than 60 percent late in the evening, Jollota at 55 percent.
\
Also at the local level, improvement and expansion of three Vancouver libraries appeared, sadly, to be headed for defeat. The proposed new library district was approved but, unfortunately, the funding appeared falling short of the required 60 percent approval.
\
The Port of Vancouver was given a well-rounded voice with the 60- percent-plus election of political newcomer Brian Wolfe as port commissioner. He'll do a fine job helping create more jobs while guarding the environment.
\
Statewide, of course, the main attention was on the initiatives. It's easy to see why voters were drawn to favor I-912; it would have repealed this year's gas-tax increase. Sounds great at first, but we preferred the opposite outcome as 13 transportation projects in Clark County were at stake, and per-motorist savings statewide would have been negligible. Fortunately, I-912 appeared at press time to be headed for defeat, by a narrow margin and with only about 42 percent of the votes counted. If that holds up, it's a great sign for traffic infrastructure projects statewide.
\
Also on the plus side, voters apparently, and correctly, approved by a wide margin a statewide ban on public indoor smoking and granted full authority to the state auditor on performance audits.
\
Congratulations to all who participated in the election. Whether through change or continuity, our governments continue to evolve not at the whim of the politicians but by the voice of the voters.

\
State transportation department officials will unveil their choice for improving a critical stretch of Interstate 90 on Tuesday, billed as a traffic and wildlife safety project that has the backing of environmental groups.
\
The adopted plan will widen to six lanes a section of the state's major east-west freeway from near the summit of Snoqualmie Pass to Easton and provide wildlife migration corridors. It will be released during a 5:30 p.m. open house at the Summit Inn, 603 State Route 906 at the Snoqualmie Pass summit.
\
For the first time, the department is offering those who are interested a chance to follow the open house via the Internet. A Web link to the open house will be available through the department's Internet Web site at www.wsdot. wa.gov/Projects/I90/SnoqualmiePass East.
\
Brian White, the department's project director at the regional office in Union Gap, said the preferred alternative to be announced Tuesday will cover the entire 15-mile section from Hyak to Easton.
\
The Legislature, using funds from the 9.5-cent gas tax increase, has allocated $387 million to widen the freeway from Hyak to Lake Keechelus.
\
Four options have been studied for the five-mile stretch. Among them are tunnels or bridges over the edge of the lake.
\
White said the area is subject to congestion with 27,000 vehicles crossing the pass each day, a high incidence of accidents and closures due to avalanches.
\
In addition to more lanes, the elements of the project that drew environmental support are the 14 passageways, a combination of bridges, culverts and an overpass, that will allow wildlife to safely traverse the freeway.
\
""It is a unique environment. The freeway is a barrier for animals and habitat,"" he said. ""This project will open the roadway to make it more permeable.""
\
Overall, the project could cost between $422 million to $922 million, depending on the adopted alternative and when the work is scheduled.
\
White called Tuesday's announcement a major milestone in the project.
\
After Tuesday's announcement, the department will issue a final environmental impact statement later this summer. Officials hope to start construction in 2010.
\
The Federal Highway Administration will make the final decision.

233," Fourth District legislative incumbents filed for re-election together Tuesday, saying they had unfinished business, while two Democrats and a Libertarian emerged to challenge the Republicans.\ Reps. Lynn Schindler and Larry Crouse and Sen. Bob McCaslin said they have worked well as a team for the Spokane Valley.\ ""It really helps when your senator thinks the same way you do as House members,"" Schindler said. ""When you have an issue that is a little bit contentious, you get the perspective of what the House is going to do and what the Senate is going to do and we can formulate some strategy.""\ Schindler, 55, who is seeking her second term, said she will focus on finding a permanent source for transportation funding and putting more money into the hands of local schools.\ McCaslin, 74, planned to retire when his term ended this year but changed his mind. McCaslin said last year he wanted to leave politics to settle down with his new wife, but the couple filed for a divorce earlier this year.\ ""I think after every campaign an incumbent thinks, `Do I really want to do this again,'"" McCaslin said. ""But it's a short session and there are some more things I want to do. If I didn't think I was doing a good job, I wouldn't be running again.""\ McCaslin was first elected in 1980. He said the Spokane Valley legislators hope to work on the state's Growth Management Act to give cities and counties more local control.\ Crouse said he quietly began preparing for re-election last year. He is seeking his fourth term.\ He said one of his goals is to eventually phase out state property taxes. He added that while he would like to find a long-term funding source for transportation projects, he is strongly opposed to a gas tax increase.\ Three challengers had emerged by Tuesday evening to face the incumbents.\ Political newcomer Carol Ford-Duncan, 46, said last month she will run for Crouse's House seat.\ Ford-Duncan, a Democrat, plans to file today in Olympia. The locked-out Kaiser Steelworker said she decided to run for office after she lobbied the Legislature earlier this year.\ She said her main focus will be on giving workers a living wage, extending health care for all residents regardless of income and protecting the environment.\ Democrat John Kallas, 48, announced Tuesday he will challenge Schindler for a second time. Kallas, a retired gang and narcotics detective, lost to Schindler in 1998 but said he had always planned to run again.\ ""This has been in the plans for two years. I have been burning the midnight oil studying the issues,"" he said. ""I expect to win this time and I will keep running, and running and running because I'm going to make it.""\ He said he will fight for a safe community, affordable health care, livable wages and health and dental services for all residents.\ Liberty Lake resident Robert S. Chase filed his candidacy Tuesday to seek McCaslin's Senate seat.\ Chase, a Libertarian, must get at least 1 percent of the vote in the Sept. 19 primary in order to appear on the general election ballot in November. He did not immediately return phone calls for comment.\ Rather than paying a filing fee, Chase gathered signatures to secure his candidacy. State law also allows candidates to gather one signature for each dollar of the normal filing fee for the office. Chase turned in 313 signatures."

With landmark changes to unemployment insurance, a fat tax-break package for Boeing and a no-new-taxes budget, Republican lawmakers are smiling as they leave Olympia this year.
\
Democrats, meanwhile, are looking for any silver lining in a gloomy cloud of defeat.
\
Senate Ways and Means Chairman Dino Rossi usually wears a confident smile, but as lawmakers adjourned on Wednesday night, it widened into a triumphant grin. Rossi, R-Sammamish, appeared with other GOP leaders and prominent business lobbyists to celebrate a session full of wins for business.
\
""We took the first step out of the wilderness,"" Rossi said, advancing the frequently used argument that Washington's systems of taxes and regulation are antibusiness. ""We have to have more. We have to go farther.""
\
Democratic House Speaker Frank Chopp was nowhere in sight on adjournment night. He even voted from his office as the House including members of his own party handed him a bitter defeat to end the session.
\
That defeat and perhaps business' greatest victory this year was a major overhaul of the state's unemployment insurance system. The revision was passed over the objections of most labor unions.
\
The change will save businesses about $200 million a year, mostly by cutting benefits for seasonal workers. Chopp, who fought doggedly against those cuts, tried to stay upbeat Thursday as he met with reporters to reflect on the session.
\
""If you look at the other key issues, we have an enormous list of accomplishments,"" said Chopp, D-Seattle, ticking off victories including a 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase for highway projects, a $2.6 billion construction budget, prescription drug legislation and a bill aimed at limiting the amount of deadly mercury in the environment.
\
But the anger and frustration that Chopp felt over the unemployment changes and other defeats quickly surfaced.
\
""These are real people, and lots of people,"" Chopp said of seasonal workers such as farm laborers, who stand to get $75 less a week in unemployment benefits. ""What does that $75 pay for? Food, rent, things for their kids. I'm worked up about this because of the impact on people's lives. They were treated unfairly.""
\
But the unemployment bill was just the last in a series of defeats suffered by Chopp and other liberal Democrats.
\
Emboldened by Democratic Gov. Gary Locke's proposal of an austere budget without tax increases, moderates in Chopp's own House majority helped the Republican Senate squelch any significant tax hike.
\
That cost teachers and the 76,000-member Washington Education Association the yearly cost-of-living increases they won at the ballot box in 2000.
\
The impromptu no-new-taxes coalition also cost newly unionized home health care workers their new contract, which was rejected by lawmakers leery of its $98 million price tag. The workers' union leaders complained bitterly about the Democrats' inability to deliver the contract.
\
On non-budget issues, animal-welfare activists among the Democrats fumed when lawmakers repealed the state's voter-approved ban on most animal trapping, although Locke later vetoed the bill. Some environmentalist Democrats even cried over a bill that loosened clean-water rules to smooth the construction of a new third runway at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
\
The Legislature's push to accommodate Boeing included not only a tax cut package worth $3.2 billion over the next 20 years, but also limits on hearing-loss claims, a bill vocally opposed by labor unions.

235,"EDITORIAL\The 3rd Legislative District is a rare Democratic stronghold in Eastern Washington, and it has two effective representatives in the House.\Rep. Timm Ormsby is the incumbent for the Position 2 seat, and he's being challenged by Republican Laura Carder. We endorsed Ormsby in the primary, because of his greater experience, accomplishments and grasp of the issues.\The Position 1 race is between Rep. Marcus Riccelli, a Democrat, and Libertarian Randy McGlenn, who also ran for the seat in 2014.\Riccelli's resume reflects a genuine concern for his constituents, who reside in a low-income district with pockets of extreme poverty. He is project manager for the Community Health Association of Spokane and was operations manager for the Northeast Community Center in Hillyard. He is also involved in Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Spokane, YMCA Youth Legislature Delegation and serves on the Daybreak Youth Service board.\He is concerned that services for vulnerable populations could be cut as lawmakers hammer out the details of basic education funding. If social services are cut, it could hurt the state's efforts to close the achievement gap between low-income and minority students and the rest.\Riccelli touts his leadership in getting the Legislature to adopt a transportation funding package that works for Eastern Washington. He notes that the Spokane area will be getting $1.30 in projects for every dollar sent to Olympia. This includes the completion of the north-south freeway. Riccelli also worked to secure the state's second medical school, on the WSU-Spokane campus.\We disagree with his vote against charter schools, and he ranges to the left of the board on some business issues.\We are intrigued by his idea of incorporating SAT scores to lighten the testing load in schools. An alternative assessment would still be needed for students who aren't on the college track.\Riccelli wants to pursue some ideas related to children's health by improving school meals (and if locally sourced food can be included, all the better). He'd also like to see a greater emphasis on physical education. Both efforts are aimed at stemming rising obesity and diabetes rates.\Randy McGlenn has the standard Libertarian agenda. Government is too big and inefficient.\He says the regulatory environment is such that only large companies can thrive, which is fine for Seattle, but not for Spokane. He wants to end the tax favoritism for companies like Boeing.\McGlenn would like to see the state move toward a consumption tax, which relies more on the sales tax or a value-added tax, while cutting business and property taxes. It would also preclude an income tax. He opposed the recent gas-tax increase, but he does want the north-south freeway completed.\The problem with McGlenn's agenda is that it doesn't have a caucus, and it's a particularly poor fit for his district, where government does provide valuable services.\Rep. Marcus Riccelli is a rising star in the Democratic caucus and a better fit for the district. He has earned a return trip to Olympia."
236,"Hilde Kellogg wavered this spring when the decision loomed to run for office again.\After six terms in the Idaho Legislature, the 77-year-old matron considered deferring to public sentiments that drive term-limit proposals.\But a sense of unfinished business changed her mind. Besides, she said, ""The ballot box takes care of any concerns that you'd have a career politician.""\Any of Kellogg's constituents who want to cut her political career short will have an alternative candidate in the May 28 primary election - 25-year-old Republican Jay Jump.\The primary will be the deciding election in this race. No Democrat filed to run for the House seat.\Jump is a newcomer and nearly unknown in North Idaho. But the first-year Gonzaga University law student doesn't consider his lack of political experience and unfamiliarity with North Idaho a problem.\Though he moved here just one year ago, ""I'm not going to be a transient and leave in three years,"" he said. ""I've made Idaho my home.""\Once he's finished with final exams this week, Jump will gather his campaign committee of fellow students and start getting his name out in front of the voters.\""My generation has been stereotyped as ... I guess lackadaisical would be the word,"" Jump said. ""I don't think that's true.""\Jump points to himself and Senate District 2 candidate Ian James, also 25, as two young candidates who have ""good ideas to move Idaho into the 21st century.""\When you ask Jump what those ideas are, they sound pretty similar to those advocated by Kellogg, who is 52 years his senior.\Both candidates consider the economy to be the cornerstone of solutions to the state's woes.\""If we have a good strong business environment, the revenue will come into the state so you can fund things like education,"" Kellogg said.\The backbone of a good economy is a good road system, Kellogg believes. She devoted the last legislative session to transportation issues, particularly a bill to establish a statewide revenue bond issue to improve Highway 95.\The proposed $300 million bond failed to win the Legislature's support because it competed with another bill that raised the gas tax.\Kellogg is known as a friend of business, having carried laws through the Legislature designed to attract business to the Post Falls area.\Jump also believes in industry incentives. He considers the Rathdrum Prairie an ideal place for light industry.\""That area is ripe for development,"" Jump said.\While Kellogg leans to the right on social issues, Jump is more ""middle of the road,"" he said.\Jump may preach privatizing, but he doesn't mean schools. A school voucher system, where tax dollars are returned to families who home-school or send their children to private schools, is the same as ""robbing money from our public schools,"" he says.\Another difference between the two lies in their age and experience.\Where Jump exudes youthful optimism, Kellogg's approach to politics is grounded in the pragmatic realm.\Much of a legislator's success lies in being able to talk to lawmakers from all over the state, she said.\""What you know is important,"" she said. ""But how well you interact with fellow legislators is very important."""
237,"
WASHINGTON In a rare breach with the president, Senate Republicans joined Democrats in rejecting a spending ceiling set by the White House for a six-year highway and mass transit funding bill.
\
The Senate voted 76-22 Wednesday to defeat an attempt to rule that the $295 billion bill added to the federal deficit and thus violated budget rules.
\
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who initiated the budgetary point of order against the bill, said it was ""quite simply, unequivocally, unquestionably, a budget buster"" and it ""seems a little bit inappropriate"" to ignore the spending limits set by the president.
\
The White House on Wednesday repeated its warning that President Bush would be advised to veto any highway bill that exceeded the $284 billion amount he had agreed to. The president ""urges the Senate to prevent any further delay and send him a bill he can sign,"" said Scott Milburn, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget.
\
Gregg was joined by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., in backing the president, saying the bill can only pass smoothly if Congress stays within the spending parameters laid out in the budget passed last week and backed by the White House.
\
But 33 Republicans, citing the deteriorating state of the nation's roadways and the importance of the bill to generating jobs around the country, joined Democrats in supporting the $295 billion level.
\
""We have to have this money for safety, for economic development, for continued growth and the health of our economy,"" said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., who heads the transportation panel of the Environment and Public Works Committee.
\
""As a conservative Republican, I wholeheartedly support it,"" said the committee chairman, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.
\
The House in March went along with the White House in passing a $284 billion bill for highway, public transit and safety programs through fiscal 2009.
\
But there's been strong support in the Senate for a more robust bill, and the leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., on Monday introduced a package of revenue measures that they said would allow an extra $11 billion for infrastructure funding without increasing the federal deficit.
\
They said they accomplished that by shifting some funds that normally go into the general Treasury fund into the highway trust fund, the main source for highway projects, and taking other steps to increase revenues. Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta discounted the committee measures as ""accounting gimmicks.""
\
""The bill before the Senate ... is paid for in its entirety principally by cracking down on abuse and closing loopholes,"" Grassley said. He added that White House insistence on a fixed figure will only lead to a repeat of last year's gridlock, when Congress and the administration failed to come up with a compromise bill.
\
Did you know?
\
Federal highway and transit projects are funded from the highway trust fund, which is derived from the 18.4-cent federal gas tax that drivers pay.
"
238,"
Attorney General Christine Gregoire is an excellent gubernatorial candidate, which makes it exciting for Washington voters that her opponent, Dino Rossi, is even better.
\
Rossi, a Republican who left the state Senate to race for the governor's office, performed pure magic in balancing the 2003 budget. Despite facing the largest deficit in state history, he did it without raising taxes, and he reorganized programs to protect many vulnerable citizens. And to Southwest Washington's benefit, Rossi and state Sen. Joe Zarelli of Ridgefield know each other well from working closely together on the budget.
\
As chairman of the powerful Senate Ways and Means Committee, Rossi's solutions came with a bipartisan boost. State Sen. Darlene Fairley, a straight-shooting Democrat from Lake Forest Park and ranking member of the same committee, told the King County Journal that Rossi backs up political salesmanship with a nonpartisan approach. Others admire the fact that Rossi's conservative views come without preaching, antics or aggressive behavior. Perhaps the Republican's Democratic family roots allow moderation on key issues.
\
Rossi is hospitable and puts people at ease. In the Legislature and with citizens, he makes a point to find common ground with others.
\
Compared to Gregoire, who is an abrasive, even harsh, go-get-'em lawyer, Rossi shines. While her style suits litigation, it won't likely be as effective as Rossi's would be in the governor's office working on a myriad of negotiations.
\
Rossi's solutions to health care problems facing individuals and employers are preferable to Gregoire's, and his commitment to keep taxes at a standstill while the economy continues to recuperate is wise. He is also likely to find ways the state can better target its resources, by carrying Gov. Gary Locke's Priorities of Government decision-making model further.
\
His mantra: Ask whether government should be doing a given task in the first place, and if so, what level of government can serve the need best? He is not averse to contracting out some services. ""Taxpayers should get the best for their dollar,"" he says, hoping for more competitive bidding between private and public service providers.
\
Rossi isn't opposed to all tax increases (though he is opposed to increases in the state sales tax). For example, he voted for the state's nickel gas tax to provide for needed transportation funding.
\
His hopes for the next four years, if elected Nov. 2, are detailed in his ""Forward Washington"" platform. Associated Press writer David Ammons described it as reminiscent of Gov. Dan Evans' successful ""Blueprint for Progress"" of 40 years ago. It outlines six reforms, from growing jobs by eliminating duplicative regulations and bringing health insurance carriers back to the state with the lure of removing unrealistic mandates, to continuing education reform, updating the state salary schedule for compensating teachers and restoring our state parks by funding them better.
\
Even with an attention to state parks, though, we will have to watch Rossi and his contribution to the stewardship of our environment. Business regulations cannot be streamlined to the point of environmental carelessness.
\
With that one reservation, we repeat that Gregoire is good, but Rossi's style and focus are even better. And in an era in which Tim Eyman and tax revolters have hijacked the system, it won't hurt to have an administrative crew in Olympia that doesn't have strong ties to the last one.
\
Rossi told us of the 2003 budget process he oversaw, ""We did what everybody said couldn't be done."" We expect him to do it again.

John Ahern.\ As of Oct. 28, Democrat Collins had collected $102,111 compared to Republican Ahern's $97,656 in the 6th District Position 2 legislative race.\ Though Spokane's 6th District has long been a Republican stronghold, the Democratic Party has invested heavily in Collins, whose business background could appeal to some voters who traditionally favor Republicans.\ Collins, a Spokane Regional Chamber of Commerce board member, refers to herself as a ""business Democrat"" in one campaign mailing.\ She recently sold her catering business to focus on the campaign.\ While the 6th District tends to go Republican, Democrats have garnered a significant share of votes recently. In 2000, Ahern defeated his Democratic opponent, former Spokane Mayor Jack Geraghty, by 419 votes - less than a 1 percent margin.\ Collins still faces an uphill battle.\ Ahern has been endorsed by the Association of Washington Business. His campaign calls to cut state spending, ease up on business regulations and be tougher on criminals resonated with voters in the September primary.\ He had a 15 percent lead over Collins in the primary, in which both candidates were unopposed within their parties.\ Raising money was essential to narrowing that gap, said Collins, who said she expects to spend $30,000 on television advertising.\ Collins described Ahern as a ""nice man,"" but said he can't match her community experience.\ In addition to the Chamber, Collins has been active in her neighborhood council, served on the Washington State Land Use Study Commission and worked on education projects with Spokane School District 81.\ Ahern, meanwhile, says his accomplishments during his first two years in Olympia have proved his ability as a legislator.\ The copier business owner is particularly proud of his work to bring a veterans home to Spokane, allow sex offenders information to be put on the Internet, and make tax increment financing possible in Spokane.\ Tax increment financing is used to collect property tax revenue generated by new construction in a designated area and use it to pay for public improvements within the area.\ ""If we'd had that in place five or six years ago, we'd probably have gotten Harper's Furniture,"" said Ahern.\ That company instead located in North Idaho.\ Economic development is a complex issue that requires attention to many other areas in the state budget, including education and transportation, said Collins.\ ""Protecting education is part-and-parcel to creating a state that has well-educated workers,"" said Collins.\ Providing higher education opportunities that prepare students for the ever-changing work environment helps both Washington residents and the companies they will work for, she added.\ Economic development is also one reason that Collins said she supports Referendum 51, the proposed gas tax increase for road repairs.\ ""It impacts our community for receiving items and shipping out the harvest of this area,"" she said.\ Ahern opposes R-51.\ Privatizing highway maintenance is the answer to the state's transportation problems, he said.\ Economic development depends on easing back on regulations that hurt businesses, and implementing the recommendations of Governor Gary Locke's competitiveness council, Ahern said.\ ""We'll run them all out on the floor for a vote if the Republicans overtake the House,"" he said, adding, ""We have a reputation as being the most business-unfriendly state in the union.""\ He cited large proposed increases in workers compensation rates as an example of state government hurting businesses.\ This sidebar appeared with the story:\ Job summary\ State legislators earn $32,801 a year.

OLYMPIA -- Washington lawmakers wrapped up their ambitious 15- week session Sunday night after passing a $26 billion state budget and rescuing a big gas tax plan to fix crumbling, crowded roads and bridges.
\
The budget plan requires a half-billion- dollar revenue package, including ""sin taxes"" on cigarettes and liquor. Smokes will go up by $6 a carton and the booze tax will rise by a stiff $1.33 a liter. The estate tax, called the death tax by foes, will be imposed on about 250 large estates each year.
\
Gavels fell at 7:17 p.m., closing down a 105-day session notable for the Democratic branding of nearly every issue. Majority Democrats, relieved to finish on time, gave themselves a rave review.
\
Gov. Christine Gregoire and Democratic House and Senate leaders were triumphal in a post-adjournment news conference.
\
""To the families of Washington state who are worried about their jobs, worried about education and worried about health care, I say to them your future just got better,"" the governor said.
\
The major drama of the final day was approval of a massive 16- year, $8.5 billion transportation package that devotes billions to megaprojects like Seattle's quake-damaged Alaskan Way Viaduct, and spreads construction money across the state. Ferries, rail and mass transit aren't forgotten, and hard-pressed cities and counties get a cut.
\
Both houses on Sunday passed a $26 billion state budget plan for the next two years over the objections of Republicans who argued new taxes weren't necessary.
\
The measure passed in the House, 56-42, and the Senate, 25-22.
\
""It's a commitment to the kids,"" said House Appropriations Chairwoman Helen Sommers, D-Seattle. She touted the dollars for education, children's health care, higher education and services for children.
\
Rep. Bill Fromhold, D-Vancouver, called it the strongest budget in a generation for K-12 schools and the state's higher education system.
\
House Majority Leader Lynn Kessler, D-Hoquiam, called it a budget of ""vision and compassion.""
\
Rep. Shay Schual-Berke, D-Normandy Park, said the ""compassionate and smart budget"" puts kids and vulnerable adults and seniors first.
\
But Republicans said conservatives were excluded from the process, and that taxes were needlessly boosted.
\
""This budget grows the government by over 12 percent,"" said the ranking Republican on Sommers' committee, Gary Alexander of Olympia. Democrats' talk of bipartisanship was ""a hoax,"" he complained.
\
Rep. Jim Clements, R-Selah, said Democrats have posted a sign, ""Wanted dead or live: the Washington taxpayer."" He added, ""The people on my side of the state can't afford this.""
\
The debate was much the same in the Senate. Budget Chairwoman Margarita Prentice, D-Renton, called it a compromise budget that represents Washington's strongest impulses.
\
""This is for the strongest schools, the healthiest economy and the greatest access to health care,"" she said.
\
The ranking Republican on her committee, Sen. Joe Zarelli of Ridgefield said the only compromise was between different flavors of Democrats.
\
""We couldn't say no,"" he said.
\
The Senate also passed a $3.2 billion construction budget and sent it to the governor. The measure provides state matching money for local school construction, builds a new prison in Franklin County, finances dozens of college buildings, and plows money into numerous state and local projects.
\
Aggressive Democrats, enjoying the fruits of winning control of both houses and, narrowly, the governor's mansion, praised their session as sensible, efficient and productive. They exulted in their ability to achieve a rarity: on-time adjournment.
\
They put their stamp on everything from the budget and labor issues to the environment and health care.
\
Democrats were jubilant about their accomplishments, and downplayed the tax hikes as minor necessities to replace revenue that disappeared when the state Supreme Court threw out the state's estate tax and ordered a lower tax rate for canned meat products like Spam and chili.
\
Republicans were aghast, saying Democrats overplayed their hand and needlessly raised taxes and passed bills, such as a more generous unemployment plan for seasonal workers, that could dampen the state's economic recovery.

With about a year of legislative experience under her belt, state Rep. Liz Pike, R-Camas, has been named to the House Transportation Committee, she said last week. As she announced the news, she also included some harsh words for light-rail supporters.
\
Her appointment comes as legislators tour the state, gearing up for the debate over a transportation package that would pay for Washington's most pressing transportation needs. This year, a transportation package that would have raised the gas tax by 10.5 cents per gallon failed.
\
""Most Washington citizens have told me they're already paying enough at the gas pumps,"" Pike said in a statement. ""Let's quit dinging motorists at the pumps for more money when they're not getting the best mileage for the dollars they pay to the state right now.""
\
Pike also said any new transportation package needs to favor road improvements over transit, such as light rail and buses.
\
""Traffic relief must be the highest priority of any transportation policy,"" Pike said. ""Light rail is a political ideology, not a transportation solution. It's a political agenda designed to change people's behaviors, reduce freedom of movement and expand the size of government.""
\
Pike was appointed in August 2012 as a state representative for the 18th District. In November, she was elected to a different representative post in the 18th. During the 2013 Legislature, she served on committees overseeing education, the environment, government spending, community development and tribal affairs.

Benton tries to influence CRC outcome in Oregon
\
State Sen. Don Benton, R-Vancouver, brought up many grievances with the Columbia River Crossing project in a letter he reportedly sent to Oregon state lawmakers late last week.
\
In the letter, posted on Lew Waters' Clark County Conservative blog, Benton hits on CRC opponents' main talking points. He mentions the project's need to compensate a few riverfront businesses because of the bridge's limiting height, the CRC's inclusion of a light-rail line, and the fact that Washington legislators did not commit any construction money to the project this year.
\
The $3.4 billion CRC was declared dead after Washington lawmakers declined to commit the state's share; Oregon legislators had said they would only commit their share if Washington did. Since then, a new version of the CRC has emerged as a pared-down $2.75 billion effort with Oregon solely at the helm. It would still replace the I-5 Bridge and bring Portland's light rail to Vancouver, but it wouldn't update any Washington freeway interchanges north of state Highway 14.
\
""I don't know what you have been told -- but despite two special sessions, the CRC project is dead in Washington because a majority of legislators recognized that the project was fatally flawed and did not have the support of their constituents,"" wrote Benton, vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee.
\
A majority in the Democrat-controlled Washington House approved a $10 billion transportation revenue plan that would have included Washington's $450 million share for the CRC. That transportation package, however, did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Washington Senate.
\
Senate Republicans now point out that House members did not pass the transportation package's bonding bill. Supporters of the package, however, say that bonding bill could have been passed next year without much effect on the plan.
\
Benton encouraged Oregon lawmakers to ask themselves why they would ""force tolls and light rail on the citizens of another state."" He also asked: ""Why replace a bridge that is structurally sound when dozens of bridges in the Portland area are in dire need of replacement or retrofitting?""
\
In closing, he asked Oregon to just let the CRC die already.
\
""Wouldn't your constituents prefer that you reclaim that $450 million and allocate it where it is needed?"" he wrote.
\
Oregon legislators will convene for a Sept. 30 special session, where they could vote on the Oregon-led CRC plan.

242," By pushing an ill-timed increase of the gas tax that siphons cash out of local wallets for West Side road projects, Democratic legislators fuel speculation they're all too willing to write off Eastern Washington voters. But one progressive political group is finally taking steps to present East Siders with palatable Democratic candidates and issues.\ ""Eastern Washington is an area progressives haven't invested in,"" admits Dean Nielsen, director of year-old Progressive Majority Washington. ""There are 63 county commissioners in Eastern Washington, and 57 of those are Republicans. Six are Democrats. In Spokane County, you have three Republican commissioners. There's absolutely no reason why Spokane should be represented by three Republican county commissioners.""\ Nielsen's a dedicated Democrat with a keen understanding of the state's political landscape. He also offers compelling ideas for growing progressive candidates at the grassroots level in toss-up areas and places where Republicans dominate. Even better, he's got an overall annual budget of $400,000 - part of which can be used to train candidates and target key state and local races.\ There's only one problem: Progressive Majority Washington has its HQ in ... Seattle. Last time I checked, there was already a pretty substantial progressive majority out that way. And although the group might open a Spokane office someday, it's currently rooted in the West Side like a grand fir on a lush Cascades slope.\ When I jokingly suggest Nielsen just doesn't want to live in Spokane, he says basing the Washington office in Seattle makes sense because, ""When you look at swing legislative districts, 90 percent of them are over here.""\ But Nielsen acknowledges that the hardest work for the state's progressives remains on the East Side - and he promises to help do it. Progressive Majority Washington held a candidate training event in Spokane last summer, he points out, ""which I believe is the first time a state Democratic organization has had a training [session] in Spokane in a number of years.""\ In addition, the group supported Laurie Dolan's 2004 run for the 6th District State Senate seat, which she lost by less than 1 percentage point. In Clark County, Progressive Majority helped Commissioner Craig Pridemore win the District 49 State Senate seat. Now Nielsen's team is trying to keep environmentalist Steve Stewart in the commissioner's seat Pridemore vacated.\ Progressive Majority's immediate Eastern Washington priorities include taking another shot at Republican-held 6th District seats, supporting Democratic candidates for Spokane County Commission and even targeting the legislative 4th District. The group's next candidate training events will be in Vancouver and Seattle, but Nielsen promises to host future sessions in Spokane and perhaps Yakima. Meanwhile, Eastern Washington progressives are welcome at the West Side events.\ Although he points to a Democratic resurgence in Montana and Colorado as proof of a party comeback in the rural West, Nielsen adds this caveat: ""Clearly, we have message problems in Eastern Washington."" It helps to have Spokane's Lisa Brown leading the Senate this year, he says. But Progressive Majority also wants to promote Democratic issues that will resonate with voters here. For instance, he talks up plans for creating high-wage jobs, cleaning up the environment and reducing our dependence on foreign oil through green-energy projects.\ ""If we're serious about gaining majorities, we can't write off large portions of the state,"" Nielsen says. That's a heartening message for local progressives. Still, it would be a lot more impressive to hear it from a Spokane-based group.\ Frank Sennett's weekly take on the nation's alternative press airs on Spokane Public Radio.

243,"
Brent Boger, the local Republican chairman, figures George W. Bush's political mess is partly responsible for Tom Mielke's defeat Tuesday in Clark County's hottest election.
\
Boger doesn't say it that way, but that's where his logic leads you, and it makes a certain amount of sense. And if it makes sense this time, what does that portend for next November's legislative and congressional elections?
\
Boger fears it could mean plenty.
\
As he sees it, there are plenty of people of Republican persuasion who didn't get around to voting this time Republicans who would have voted for Mielke if only they had voted. Instead, Boger suspects, a lot of Republicans saved the time and the 37-cent stamp and sat this one out. He says Democrats had a 3- to 4-percent higher turnout than R's in the county because the Republican base had the blues.
\
""I don't think people blame Tom Mielke for Iraq,"" Boger said on the morning after the night before. ""But the effect of the Iraq war on President Bush's popularity demoralizes the base. It makes it harder for them to go out and vote and harder for us to encourage them to vote.""
\
""Base"" is the political equivalent of a cocker spaniel: loyal, loving and forgiving. In some places, the base is all you need. Example: U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Seattle, who has been dubbed ""Congressman for life."" But Clark, although trending Republican, is still a swing county. It can go either way.
\
""If this had been (an even-numbered-election) year with plenty of offices on the ballot, it would have been very bad for Republicans,"" Boger said. ""I can't imagine Bush being this low a year from now.""
\
But what if he is, and the GOP base still has the blues?
\
""My advice is to see in March how things are going nationally,"" he said. ""That'll tell us whether to take a defensive or offensive stance in the (2006) elections.""
\
Republican-base 'blues' up north? The demoralized Republican base this year, if that's what it was, could have been a factor in Snohomish County (Everett), too. There, incumbent GOP County Commissioner Jeff Sax was unseated by Democratic challenger Dave Somers.
\
There's another similarity: Both Snohomish and Clark counties have undergone amazing growth in recent decades. Both Stuart and Somers are seen as more skeptical of development and more protective of the environment than their Republican opponents.
\
Still, such comparisons are shaky because of multiple local factors influencing elections. Boger suspects Stuart was helped considerably by anti-Mielke mailers sent by an independent group.
\
Issues count, too: Activists in both parties typically think election outcomes are due more to campaign tactics than candidate philosophies and stances. They're partly right. Stuart, for example, doorbelled far more than Mielke.
\
But what a candidate stands for usually gets through the noise of a campaign. Amid the mailers and the ads and the whispers and the e- mails and the tips about the candidates' marital and financial histories and complaints that each was getting big bucks from out of state (East Coast liberals for Stuart, Oregon developers for Mielke) amid all that, differences rose to the surface.
\
Then, it was the voters' turn, and they they picked Stuart.
\
Non-partisan GOP successes: Local Republicans did have success in a couple of non-partisan races, backing Stacee Sellers for mayor of Washougal and Julie Olson for Ridgefield School Board.
\
On the other hand, the local GOP didn't endear itself to business and civic leaders, including the Greater Vancouver Chamber of Commerce and Identity Clark County. Those Republican-laden groups opposed Initiative 912 to repeal the gas tax increase, calling it a threat to efficiency and safety on the highways. Nevertheless, the GOP favored I-912.
\
""There's a dichotomy in the local Republican Party,"" Boger said, describing it as rural and small-town north and east county vs. Vancouver and its suburbs.
\
The former includes the conservative base that emerged in the late '80s, muscled the moderate and business wing into irrelevance by the mid-'90s and has backed Mielke, Don Benton, Marc Boldt and others. The defeat of Mielke and Initiative 912 don't change that, but they might be a hint of things to come.

244,"Despite the anti-tax, cost-cutting rhetoric of the last election, Spokane City Council members are considering a proposal to raise city real estate taxes.\Mayor Jack Geraghty said Friday he is leaning in favor of the tax to help manage growth in the community. Councilman Orville Barnes said he already has decided to vote yes.\The public won't get a chance to comment on the tax until Feb. 28, when the proposal is expected on the council agenda.\""Maybe we'll change our minds when we hear the testimony,"" Geraghty said.\The proposal would raise the fee for selling a home or other property by 0.25 percent. The money would go into a special account for public improvements to support growth.\That means the owner of a $100,000 home would pay an additional $250 to the city at the time of sale.\Currently, the real-estate excise tax in the city amounts to 1.53 percent of the sale price. Much of that goes to the state for public schools, but the city also gets a slice.\If the increase is approved, the rate would go to 1.78 percent.\The extra $1.3 million would go for improvements to sewers, streets and water lines related to growth.\The real estate industry is in favor of the tax increase, said Councilwoman Bev Numbers, a real estate agent.\The Spokane County Commissioners in a 2-1 vote approved the tax in unincorporated areas last fall. Commissioner Steve Hasson voted no.\""Obviously, I'm concerned about raising taxes,"" Geraghty said on Friday. ""But in this particular instance, I think this is a good way to pay for infrastructure.""\But Geraghty and others may be in for a fight.\""I have red flags go up any time I hear a proposal for tax increases in today's economic environment,"" said Councilman Chris Anderson. ""People are taxed out.""\Last fall, Geraghty, Anderson and others campaigned on promises to cut waste from government and avoid new taxes.\Voters rejected higher business taxes for police and a local gasoline tax to pay for cleaner streets. Also, an initiative to limit state spending was approved.\Geraghty promised to cut 25 mid-level managers to save money during the campaign.\John Talbott, who lost the primary race to Geraghty, said the mayor ought to come up with budget cuts before endorsing higher taxes.\""Tax and spend, it's another rip-off,"" Talbott said.\Under the growth management law, developers are facing the prospect of impact fees to offset the cost of public improvements needed to serve growth areas.\Talbott said the real estate tax would simply relieve the pressure on developers to pay those impact fees.\""It's obvious the leadership given by Mr. Geraghty is not a leadership for the citizens, it's a leadership for the special interests,"" Talbott said.\Barnes said he supports the tax. When asked to identify projects that might be included, Barnes said he could not name any. He said to check with City Hall.\The city must identify a list of projects before it can adopt the tax.\City Manager Roger Crum said the council will use its six-year plans for water, sewer and street improvements as the basis for its list.\Dwight Hume, an agent for developers, said the industry wants to make sure the city uses the money for growth-related projects, not on other needs.\An example might be the extension of Barnes Road from Indian Trail Road to Nine Mile Road, or the widening of Five Mile Road just north of Francis Avenue.\In the past, utility ratepayers have financed extensions of water and sewer to the West Plains, Latah Creek Valley and other growth areas.\Finance Director Ken Stone said the biggest need is in streets. Gas-tax collections have declined in recent years while the cost of paving has increased, he said.\""If you don't pay for growth in an organized way, you pay for it later on,"" Stone said.\He also stressed that residents who don't sell their property will not have to pay the tax.\Credit: Staff writer"
245,"OLYMPIA - A ""cap-and-trade"" proposal passed the state House of Representatives on Friday, one of two climate bills Democrats hope to push through before the end of session Sunday.\The proposal passed 54-43 and heads back to the Senate, which must concur on changes in the next two days.\A cap-and-trade program in Washington would apply to the largest polluters in the state. It would set a cap on emissions that polluters would have to meet by 2023. If large polluters could not clean up their work to meet the cap, they would have to purchase allowances from the state.\""It's not too late for us to get this right,"" Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, said on the floor.\The state would then receive the revenue generated from those allowances, which it would use to improve the environment and invest in programs to help those disproportionately affected by climate change, including people of color and low-income earners.\Republican amendments debated on Friday would have allowed the revenue from the bill to be used to fund the working families tax credit, which provides rebates for low-income families. The proposal passed the Legislature years ago but was never funded. Democrats have said the rebate would finally be funded with the general fund in the upcoming budgets, so there is no need for the cap-and-trade revenue to be used for it.\Instead, the revenue should be prioritized to help those suffering the most from environmental pollution, Democrats said.\Rep. Debra Lekanoff, D-Bow, said the bill is needed to help tribal communities across the state. The only Native American member of the Legislature, Lekanoff said federally recognized tribes are ""fighting for their lives"" because of pollution.\""Today the people's House will right the wrong of 150 years of living in a pollution-based economy,"" she said.\Democrats said it is long overdue for the state to address climate change.\""It is unconscionable that we have failed to take action on climate change for this long,"" said Rep. Alex Ramel, D-Bellingham.\Opponents said the program would raise prices for the average Washington resident paying for fuel, electricity or food.\Rep. Mary Dye, R-Pomeroy, called the bill ""a trifecta of taxes embedded within an environmental policy, and it's bad news for the people of Washington state.""\An amendment added in the House would require approval of a 5-cent gas tax increase - likely part of other legislation - before the cap-and-trade program could start. Linking climate policy to new transportation revenue to pay for roads, highways and infrastructure is what Democrats call a ""grand bargain,"" which has been the subject of disagreement among lawmakers.\The idea would be to invest in new infrastructure while simultaneously cleaning the air, Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane, has said.\Two climate proposals, the cap-and-trade plan and a low carbon fuel standard, and their connection to a revenue package have been the subject of debate in the final days of the session.\Passing two major climate proposals and a new multibillion dollar transportation package is getting less and less likely.\Negotiations around a low carbon fuel standard are ongoing. Both chambers are trying to reach an agreement on the plan, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuel by 20% by 2035.\For now, a proposed transportation revenue package doesn't seem like it will pass this session, but lawmakers have indicated they're willing to work on it after session ends and call themselves back into special session when an agreement is met.\The climate proposals have been priorities for Gov. Jay Inslee since he took office.

246,"
OLYMPIA - With landmark changes to unemployment insurance, a fat tax-break package for Boeing and a no-new-taxes budget, Republican lawmakers are smiling as they leave Olympia this year.
\
Democrats, meanwhile, are looking for any silver lining in a gloomy cloud of defeat.
\
Senate Ways and Means Chairman Dino Rossi usually wears a confident smile, but as lawmakers adjourned on Wednesday night, it widened into a triumphant grin. Rossi, R-Sammamish, appeared with other GOP leaders and prominent business lobbyists to celebrate a session full of wins for business.
\
""We took the first step out of the wilderness,"" Rossi said, advancing the frequently used argument that Washington's systems of taxes and regulation are antibusiness. ""We have to have more. We have to go farther.""
\
Democratic House Speaker Frank Chopp was nowhere in sight on adjournment night. He even voted from his office as the House - including members of his own party - handed him a bitter defeat to end the session.
\
That defeat - and perhaps business' greatest victory this year - was a major overhaul of the state's unemployment insurance system. The revision was passed over the objections of most labor unions.
\
The change will save businesses about $200 million a year, mostly by cutting benefits for seasonal workers. Chopp, who fought doggedly against those cuts, tried to stay upbeat Thursday as he met with reporters to reflect on the session.
\
""If you look at the other key issues, we have an enormous list of accomplishments,"" said Chopp, D-Seattle, ticking off victories, including a 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase for highway projects, a $2.6 billion construction budget, prescription drug legislation and a bill aimed at limiting the amount of deadly mercury in the environment.
\
But the anger and frustration that Chopp felt over the unemployment changes and other defeats quickly surfaced.
\
""These are real people, and lots of people,"" Chopp said of seasonal workers such as farm laborers, who stand to get $75 less a week in unemployment benefits. ""What does that $75 pay for? Food, rent, things for their kids. I'm worked up about this because of the impact on people's lives. They were treated unfairly.""
\
But the unemployment bill was just the last in a series of defeats suffered by Chopp and other liberal Democrats.
\
Emboldened by Democratic Gov. Gary Locke's proposal of an austere budget without tax increases, moderates in Chopp's own House majority helped the Republican Senate squelch any significant tax hike.
\
That cost teachers - and the 76,000-member Washington Education Association - the yearly cost-of-living increases they won at the ballot box in 2000.
\
The impromptu no-new-taxes coalition also cost newly unionized home health care workers their new contract, which was rejected by lawmakers leery of its $98 million price tag. The workers' union leaders complained bitterly about the Democrats' inability to deliver the contract.
\
On non-budget issues, animal-welfare activists among the Democrats fumed when lawmakers repealed the state's voter-approved ban on most animal trapping, although Locke later vetoed the bill. Some environmentalist Democrats even cried over a bill that loosened clean-water rules to smooth the construction of a new third runway at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
\
The Legislature's push to accommodate Boeing included not only a tax cut package worth $3.2 billion over the next 20 years, but also limits on hearing-loss claims, a bill vocally opposed by labor unions.
\
""These are not easy issues to deal with as Democrats,"" Chopp said.
\
However, he pointed out that lawmakers did find money to give raises to new teachers and a 75-cent-per-hour increase for the home health care workers.
\
""Name one other profession in the state, other than corporate CEOs, that got a 10 percent pay raise this year,"" Chopp said. ""I think it's a great victory.""
\
And Chopp isn't the only lawmaker looking back at some losses this year. Republicans left some unfinished business as well.
\
House Democrats squelched the GOP Senate's proposals to freeze the yearly cost-of-living increase in the minimum wage, repeal workplace ergonomics rules and cap medical malpractice damage awards.
\
And cutting a deal with Democrats on the budget forced Senate Republicans to forego more than $100 million in tax breaks for businesses.

247,"
While the public was waiting just two blocks away, seven local elected officials spent 45 minutes Monday meeting with U.S. Rep. John Mica, the Florida Republican who chairs the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
\
Clark County Commissioners Marc Boldt and Steve Stuart, Vancouver Mayor Tim Leavitt, Battle Ground Mayor Mike Ciraulo, Ridgefield Mayor Ron Onslow, Washougal Mayor Sean Guard and Woodland Mayor Chuck Blum all met with Mica, committee member Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., and committee member Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Camas.
\
The meeting was 8 a.m. at Herrera Beutlers office on Officers Row, near the Clark Public Utilities building where more than 250 people showed up for a 9 a.m. listening session on how to meet the nations crumbling infrastructure needs.
\
The pre-session meeting was hastily arranged at the end of last week, said Casey Bowman, Herrera Beutlers spokesman.
\
It was all part of a larger effort to get to hear about our local challenges, Bowman said Tuesday.
\
(The local officials) represent constituents throughout Clark County, he said.
\
Leavitt said Tuesday the meeting was a good opportunity to talk about concerns over regulations, financing and investments.
\
They discussed funding alternatives, knowing that federal gas tax revenues are not keeping pace with the need for investments.
\
Leavitt said Mica and Shuster brought up tolling, a controversial aspect of the Columbia River Crossing project.
\
(They said) the reality is that tolling is a fact of life in many parts of the country and tolling is a fact of life (elsewhere) in the state of Washington, Leavitt said. Tolling is certainly one way to garner local public financing.
\
Stuart and Boldt also said they appreciated the chance to air local concerns.
\
Legally problematic
\
The meeting did put them in violation of the states open public meeting laws because a quorum of county commissioners attended without public notice. Theres no penalty for violating the law, however.
\
Somebody asked me to a meeting and I wanted to go, Stuart said. And Marc was there also. I was glad to be invited.
\
Stuart said he and Boldt talked about the regulatory environment that has increased costs and delays.
\
For example, the Salmon Creek interchange project was delayed almost a year because of federal stormwater guidelines that required the county not only to mitigate for the project, but also to plan for stormwater mitigation for potential development.
\
The countys third commissioner, Tom Mielke, was invited to the 8 a.m. meeting but did not intend.
\
Mielke spent the time standing in line waiting to get into the meeting at the PUD building; he ended up as one of five people whose names were drawn to speak during public comment. (He said the Interstate 5 corridor is full and hed rather have a third bridge across the Columbia River.)
\
The officials who attended the 8 a.m. meeting got more time to speak.
\
Ciraulo said Tuesday he had two messages for the members of Congress.
\
Unfunded mandates are oppressive to the city of Battle Ground and that we need additional federal financial assistance, he said.
\
Ciraulo said he and the other officials talked about their frustration with the bureaucratic red tape.
\
When a city or county has a project, considerable time and money is spent to meet federal mandates and regulations, he said.
\
Ciraulo told the committee members about the citys need for federal dollars to help address transportation issues.
\
Ciraulo said he felt Herrera Beutler and the congressmen were open and receptive to local officials concerns.
\
It sent a strong message to me that Chairman Mica came from Florida and Vice Chairman Shuster came from Pennsylvania to listen, Ciraulo said.
\
Guard said he spoke about the Port of Camas-Washougal dike that needs to be recertified. The dike was designed and constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers, but the Corps cannot recertify the dike unless there is a federally funded project involved, Guard said.
\
The port has to hire a private engineering firm that would also need to purchase an insurance policy for the recertification. Work is estimated to cost the port about $2 million.
\
The Army Corps of Engineers said it could do the work for about $200,000, Guard said.
\
Besides the cost savings, Guard said it makes sense to have the Corps recertify the dike.
\
Theyre the best ones to know it, he said. Theyre out there walking it every single year.
\
Guard also said removing some of the extensive reporting requirements for cities accepting federal funding would save time and money.
\
There have been some instances where it literally costs us more to take the federal funding than what wed get from the money, Guard said.

248,"The desolate-looking Boise Cascade Mill has stood vacant off Interstate 82 near North Eighth Street in Yakima for several years - largely unaltered from its former use. \Environmental hazards and a high cost to rehabilitate the facility, along with various other reasons, have stood in the way of the site seeing new life. But there may be a resolution in sight for the former lumber mill and log yard, which once employed more than 250.\The state Department of Ecology and the owners of the property - OfficeMax, Yakima Resources, Dunollie Enterprises and LeeLynn & Wiley Mt. - are working to get the 211-acre site ready for construction. In keeping with that momentum, the city of Yakima is also working to ready itself for installing roads, streetlights, utilities and other amenities to prepare the land for public use, said city spokesman Randy Beehler.\The public-private partnership is part of a nearly 20-year plan to develop the land to include public amenities, said Brad Hill, a spokesman for the site's current owners. He wouldn't comment about the current concept for the land but previous ideas considered by the group included an aquatics center or a minor league baseball field. Those ideas were abandoned. \Before the Boise Cascade site fell into disrepair in 2010, it had been had been used sporadically as a major lumber mill and log yard for more than 100 years. Since shutting down some seven years ago, not much has been done to make the site attractive to outside developers except for the demolition of a couple of buildings and the removal of wood waste by the owners, \That absence of progress isn't for a lack of trying.\The Department of Ecology conducted two preliminary investigations - in 2008 and 2013 - into contaminants present in the soil as a result of years of high industrial use and a now-unused municipal landfill nearby. \Those investigations found soil contamination from benzene, manganese and other elements requiring an environmental cleanup to make the site suitable for developers in retail and light industrial uses, such as clothing or electronic manufacturing plants, said Mary Monahan, site manager for the Department of Ecology. \For now, the property owners will have to conduct a study into how widespread the contamination is and what impact it may have on human health and the environment. Once that's complete, they then will have to develop a cleanup plan for the site.\Monahan said the process, which is anticipated to begin within the next month, will take about 11/2 years, after which the department and owners will work on a cleanup schedule.\""They're going to do some more investigation at the site to round out what we already have so we can make some decisions as far as cleanup,"" she said.\While the department will be closely involved in oversight, the owners will be responsible for the actual cleanup and associated costs. \A specific plan for the Boise Cascade site hasn't yet been devised, but cleanups often include removing contaminated soils, pumping and treating contaminated ground water, sealing off contaminated soils beneath a barrier or adding chemicals to promote the growth of microorganisms that break down contaminants.\The extent of the contamination and the cheapest way to clean it up will determine the cost, Monahan said. \After the cleanup is finished, the city and owners can begin improvements, including construction of roads and streetlights. Beehler said there isn't yet an estimated cost for those unscheduled improvements, but the city will most likely use $25 million in gas tax and additional state matching funds to bond up to $50 million in improvements within the next nearly 15 years. The money would have to be used by 2033, Beehler said.\""Without a road there or water, sewer or lights, very few developers are going to take that on, so it's in the best interest of the local community to foster economic progress, and some of that is to build infrastructure,"" Beehler said.\Additional infrastructure improvements include extending Bravo Company Boulevard into the mill site at an estimated cost of $15 million. Plans also call for the city to later use part of $110 million in state funds that would become available as early as 2021 to build on and off ramps from Interstate 82 into the site, as well as bridges over the Yakima River and I-82 to provide more access to the site.\Credit: By Kaitlin Bain"

Most of the standard tough-on-crimelawsalready have been passed in Washington, setting up a barrage of ""really, really tough on crime"" proposals that has even police officers begging for mercy.
\
State legislators accomplished many of their big-ticket goals last session, leaving themselves with little to do this session other than squabble over the gas tax. So they've latched onto crime-related measures - about 300 of them so far, or an average of nearly two per lawmaker.
\
No aspect of law enforcement is immune from an added dose of toughness, apparently. The state Senate passed a measure that would allow police to seize and sell vehicles of people accused of drunken driving - even before those people are convicted. Gov. Gary Locke supports this bill. The Senate also unanimously voted to allow judges to confine mentally ill offenders who show a ""likelihood of serious harm"" - even if they haven't committed a serious crime.
\
Sen. Pam Roach, the Eatonville Republican who chairs the Senate's Law and Justice Committee, wants to abolish the state's sex-offender treatment program. She argues that Mary Kay Letourneau's tryst with her 14-year-old victim proves the program is fatally flawed; imprisonment, she says, is the only answer.
\
Police officers and deputies are worried about sex offenders getting released without any treatment, if Roach has her way. And they're worried about proposals that would force county sheriffs instead of social workers to handle child-abuse complaints. ""We don't want to be worrying about whether they (children) are getting their diapers changed on time. We have enough to do,"" Larry Erickson, head of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, told legislators at a joint hearing last week.
\
One of the founding tenets of this nation's justice system is that people are innocent until proven guilty. A majority of our legislators, it seems, are convinced that the community is better served when people are guilty until proven innocent. They are arguing that prevention is a waste of time, rehabilitation is a joke and new laws are the best answer to every tough question.
\
Many tough-on-crime proposals have merit. But the best ones emerge because of an obvious hole in existing law. How many of those 300 crime measures are based on real need and community input, rather than lawmakers' posturing and re-election hopes?

Hardball for Hanford disturbingly overdue
\
Gov. Gary Locke and state Attorney General Christine Gregoire say they're ready to sue the federal government if it doesn't get serious about cleaning up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. It's about time.
\
No one can accuse Locke and Gregoire of overreacting. The Tri-Party Agreement governing Hanford's massive nuclear waste problem is now nearly a decade old. Yet the old atomic bomb factory on the Columbia River, 215 river miles upstream from Vancouver, is not a day closer to decontamination. Actually, it's much worse: After years of denials, the federal Department of Energy now acknowledges that radioactive waste has seeped into groundwater and is heading toward the river.
\
Time and again, the state Department of Ecology has allowed cleanup goals to be modified, deadlines to slip. Gregoire, who negotiated the agreement as head of Ecology, says such flexibility was needed because so little was known in 1989 about the dimensions of Hanford's waste problem.
\
Perhaps that's true. But the feds have adopted delay and demurral as their standard operating practice at Hanford. A project to bury low-level waste in grout was abandoned; leaky underground tanks, filled with a mysterious and potentially explosive stew of chemicals, still silently smolder; old reactor fuel rods continue to crumble and contaminate their water-filled coffins.
\
Meanwhile, an ambitious plan to turn high-level nuclear waste into safe, stable glass logs for burial exists only in the imaginations of scientists and engineers. And attention to the cleanup effort - which Hanford contractors were touting as their sole mission just a few years ago - is being distracted by a proposal to restart one reservation reactor to produce tritium to bolster the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
\
Enough is enough. Hanford poses a direct, if not immediate, threat to human health and the environment for miles in every direction. Locke and Gregoire should say no to tritium production - and sue, if they must, to make the feds keep their promise.

251,"This sidebar appeared with the story: KEEP IN TOUCH With all the legislative activity in Olympia each day, it can be difficult to keep up. Here are a few ways Eastern Washington residents can stay in touch. Telephone: The legislative hotline, 1-800-562-6000, allows callers to leave messages for legislators or learn when a meeting is scheduled. Hearing-impaired callers can dial 1-800-635-9993 if they have a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD). The hotline's hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays. Internet: The Legislature operates a World Wide Web site at www.leg.wa.gov. It provides updates on legislation, meeting schedules, and e-mail addresses for lawmakers. The governor's office has its own web site at www.wa.gov/governor. Television: TVW, the state's version of C-SPAN, provides daily coverage of the House and Senate sessions and committee hearings. TVW is broadcast on cable channel 5 in Spokane from 10 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It airs from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday. TVW also offers live audio coverage through its World Wide Web site at www.tvw.org.\The state's largest city is shut out of the legislative leadership in Olympia this year. But the Spokane area is in the catbird seat.\For a change, Eastern Washington lawmakers dominate the legislative leadership. Spokane-area lawmakers control seven committees, including the key Senate budget-writing panel.\Lawmakers from east of the mountains also hold top leadership jobs in the House, including the position of speaker and majority leader.\Controlling leadership posts is important. The majority party sets the legislative agenda in closed-door caucus sessions, and dominates conference committees, where the final deal is cut on all bills.\Committee chairs also decide which bills get a hearing, a crucial first step in the legislative process.\Sen. James West, R-Spokane, will hold the purse strings in the Senate as chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee.\This is a budget-writing year in Olympia, and it's the Senate's turn to go first. That gives West a chance to help set the tone for the state's spending for the next two years.\Sen. Eugene Prince, R-Thornton, is chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, which will consider important spending questions, including whether to raise the state gas tax.\Sen. Bob Morton, R-Orient, controls the Agriculture and Environment Committee; and Sen. Bob McCaslin, R-Spokane, is chairman of the Government Operations Committee.\That committee will hear all bills intended to amend the state's Growth Management Act, a major issue in Spokane.\In the House, Rep. Larry Crouse, R-Spokane, is chairman of the Energy and Utilities Committee, which will consider telephone deregulation proposals.\Rep. Cathy McMorris, R-Colville, controls the House Commerce and Labor Committee. That committee will hear bills this session to reauthorize an important state worker training program paid for by all employers.\Rep. Larry Sheahan, R-Rosalia, will lead the Law and Justice Committee, which will handle bills on social issues this session ranging from abortion restrictions to gay marriage.\Sheahan's committee will also take the lead on major legislation to reform the juvenile justice system.\The Spokane area's new legislative clout doesn't necessarily mean River City is in the money. West has already made it clear Spokane will be treated fairly, but not royally.\""It's not going to get carte blanche.""\But being treated fairly would be a big improvement.\In 1993 and 1994, the city was largely shut out of decision-making, when Democrats controlled the Legislature. Then in 1995 and 1996, when the GOP ran the House, lawmakers decided to go lean on spending, particularly in the capital budget.\For the past several years, the city has barely gotten anything on its wish list.\It may be different this year.\Outgoing Gov. Mike Lowry has put $21 million in cash in his proposed supplemental budget for 1997 to pay for a new health sciences building at the Riverpoint campus.\His proposed capital budget also includes $1.2 million for design of an expansion of the Cheney Cowles Museum.\""That should survive without any problem,"" said Rep. Duane Sommers R-Spokane. He wasn't as sure about the $21 million proposed for Riverpoint."

In his biography of Thomas Jefferson, author Saul K. Padover recounts how the new American envoy to France endeared himself to Parisians.
\
Following the footsteps of the legendary Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the man who would become third president of the United States was asked by Count de Vergennes, France's foreign minister, ""Is it you who replace Monsieur Franklin?""
\
Jefferson's response: ""No one can replace him, sir. I am only his successor.""
\
Likewise, no one can replace state Rep. Val Ogden when her term ends this year as Democratic representative from Clark County's 49th district.
\
Her grace, intellect, integrity and candor have been the foundation of her legislative career during almost 12 years in Olympia.
\
Voters must look for those characteristics in picking a successor not a replacement to Ogden.
\
Ogden exhibited a philosophical link to Jefferson after the Republicans virtually swept the 1994 elections in the country.
\
A Columbian story March 20, 1995, identified her as ""at least one Clark County legislator keeping the liberal faith, daring to vote no"" on major Republican programs.
\
She said: ""If it means you're concerned about individual liberties, if you think government should help people who can't help themselves and provide services we can't do for ourselves individually or privately if that's your definition of a liberal, I guess I am one. But I think that's the Jeffersonian concept of democracy.""
\
Philosophy resonated
\
That philosophy resonated well with voters, who kept her in office as long as she desired. No doubt they would have sent her back to Olympia this fall. She told Columbian writer Gregg Herrington that she would have been 80 years old at the end of a seventh term. ""You need to leave when you have full faculties. You want to leave when they still want you to stay,"" she observed.
\
The public service she performed in office was in a league with former state Sen. Al Bauer, revered on both sides of the aisle as a statesman.
\
Matthew and Susan Camp of Vancouver extolled Ogden's talents in a November 1994 letter to the newspaper. ""We have witnessed Ogden's hard-working, straightforward professionalism, and admired her sensitivity and care for the problems of her constituents.""
\
The same year, a Columbian editorial described her as a ""natural leader a shrewd negotiator (and) a principled lawmaker.""
\
While The Columbian editorially supported her and often lauded her legislative efforts, she didn't always return the favor.
\
Ogden was not shy about chiding the newspaper when she thought it was off-track in its coverage. During this year's session, she criticized an editorial that referred to legislators not being at their desks. This was a time of public hearings on pending bills before legislative committees. ""We're working,"" she said.
\
With the House deadlocked 49-49 in 1998 for the second time in state history, Ogden advised: ""We should concentrate on issues that involve security and peace of mind for working families. Life is about strong schools as well as good jobs and a healthy environment. These are things that matter for all of us.""
\
Picking fights is not her style, but she is not shy when challenged. State Sen. Don Benton, R-Pleasant Valley, lambasted state subsidies on local bus systems at a legislative breakfast in 1999. Ogden's rebuke: ""I've had calls from senior citizens, the disabled and others who depend on the bus service. I do not agree this is a waste of money.""
\
She was in strong support of a gas tax to help solve transportation problems. ""To sit and wait is not going to fix those potholes or solve that gridlock,"" she said in 2000. ""I'm sticking my head out and saying, let's go for it.""
\
Voters need to use the standards Ogden set to elect a ""new Val"" this fall, one with honesty, intellect, a solid knowledge of the community and its needs, and the courage to fulfill them.

253,"If Spokane Valley legislators have their way, motorists will be dealing with those bright orange construction cones along Interstate 90 for some time to come.\Sen. Bob McCaslin, Rep. Larry Crouse and Rep. Lynn Schindler -- all Spokane Valley Republicans representing the 4th District in Olympia said they hope to secure money to complete Valley freeway construction projects despite the lack of funding resulting from Initiative 695, which cut Washington's Motor Vehicle Excise Tax.\""We have to get money into the transportation projects 695 put a halt to,"" Crouse said.\Crouse specifically focused on the Sprague Avenue interchange project on Interstate 90. The project is set up in three phases. The first two were funded by the state gasoline tax. Phase three was to have been paid for with money from Referendum 49, which was intended to raise $2.4 billion over six years for road construction projects statewide.\But since the passage of I-695, that money isn't there.\At this point, Crouse said, it would take almost as much money to shut the freeway project down as it would to complete it.\Several I-90 projects in the Valley are already paid for, including construction of the new Evergreen Road interchange, a new loop ramp for Liberty Lake's Harvard Road interchange, and new freeway lanes from downtown east to Argonne Road.\Planned, but not yet funded, are the third phase of the Sprague Avenue interchange, and widening of both eastbound and westbound lanes from Argonne to Pines Road and Pines to Sullivan Road.\In an effort secure money for Valley road projects, Crouse and McCaslin said they will look through the state budget for projects that no longer need funding.\""I think the state's going to have to adjust itself to 695 rather than raising taxes,"" McCaslin said.\For example, last year the Washington State Patrol received money to set up a task force for tracking down drivers who went to other states for cheaper license tabs. Crouse said I-695 now makes it less expensive to buy tabs in Washington, so the task force is no longer necessary.\In addition to savings there, Crouse and Schindler are finding other ways to find construction money. ""We still have the gas tax,"" Crouse said. ""Not all of our transportaion funding has gone away.""\Schindler has signed onto a bill that would take the sales tax on construction materials out of the general fund and devote it to transportation projects. She said this bill would take care of a $320 million hole left by I-695.\She said she would also like to transfer sales tax collected on cars from the general fund into transportation.\""It will affect our 601 limit by only about 2 percent,"" Schindler said. ""I think we can live with that."" Even if she is forced to choose only a few road projects to fund, Schindler said she will not abandon any in the Spokane area.\""We have waited a long time for these projects,"" Schindler said. ""I'm going to fight tooth and nail for them.""\McCaslin said he doesn't think I-695 will hurt Spokane's construction projects as harshly as some have claimed.\""I think there's a lot of `the sky is falling, the sky is falling,'"" McCaslin said.\He went on to say he will push for cutting back Spokane Transit Authority in an effort to save money, if necessary. He said he sees several empty buses driving around town, which indicates some routes should be trimmed.\""The government doesn't have to provide you a ride to work,"" McCaslin said.\In addition to transportation issues, McCaslin and Schindler plan to submit a drunk driving bill to the Legislature. It would change the law so that a driver's fourth drunk driving conviction within seven years would be considered a felony. The penalty would be five years in prision with up to $10,000 in fines.\Schindler will also submit a bill that would allow DNA testing for prisoners who have been sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty. The tests would help determine whether the prisoner is really guilty, Schindler said.\""If you're going to take a person's life away ... you better be sure you have the right person,"" she said. Shindler said she will also fight a bill that would make flouride mandatory in all drinking water. She opposes the idea because she doesn't think enough studies show what flouride will do to the environment and to people's health.\She also believes it would cost Spokane County too much to put the flouride system in place."

Trial by loud-mouthed media is unfair and undermines a foundation of our society.The Feb. 15 column Wreckage left by Kitzhaber affects Clark County, too by Opinion page editor Greg Jayne, about Oregon Gov. John Kitzhabers scandal, took a cheap shot at Cylvia Hayes. This papers editor not only declared her guilty but also called her names gold digger and Medusa. Please. Influential members of the media should set an example of civil behavior and refrain from immature outbursts.There might have been improper influence, but is there evidence of wrongdoing? In her defense, Hayes has been an effective promoter of renewable energy and economic development in Central Oregon. It is the role of our legal system, not the media, to determine if she or the governor broke any laws.

Loving others is commanded of us
\
I read Pauline Warrens Feb. 16 letter Following ones belief is punished, decrying that an Oregon couple, who own a bakery, may lose their business because they refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of their religious beliefs. What Warren misses is that we all have the absolute right to our personal beliefs, religious or otherwise, but if we enter the public world of commerce then it is incumbent on us to serve all customers who come to us for service.Does she forget that many business people in the South believed that it was perfectly all right to deny services to African-Americans because they sincerely believed that God was for segregation? The law did not try to change these folks personal beliefs, but as they were in the public world of commerce it insisted that they provide services to all comers.Finally, Ill remind Warren that Jesus made only one addition to the Ten Commandments by saying, A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another.

Package conveys funds to our area
\
In response to the Feb. 12 article Washington Senate unveils $15 billion transportation package, I think the proposal is a beneficial move in funding transportation projects both locally and statewide, and I definitely approve of this proposal.The proposed three-year gas tax increase may be discouraging (especially to those on tight budgets or low-income backgrounds), but in the overall 16-year run the revenue could provide for various projects that improve existing road structures, build new ones, and fund various small projects and facilities.The idea of reducing carbon emissions is also very promising. Pollution is inevitable, but if the damage can be reduced, then our environment can be spared the consequences of daily transportation.My family and I drive long distances on a daily basis for school, work, and shopping necessities. Improved roads and facilities is something much looked forward to, especially in terms of relieving traffic congestion and smoother driving.Funding of $166 million is a lot of money for Clark County, and I hope that, unlike the past failed proposals, this proposal can prevail. Transportation in our local area is so important and demands to be well-maintained sooner rather than later.

WASHINGTON - A biking magazine once called him ""Mr. Bicycle,"" and Rep. Earl Blumenauer is living up to the name.
\
Whether fighting for bike racks at the Library of Congress or securing millions of dollars for bike trails, the Portland Democrat regularly shows off his pedaling passion.
\
As founder of the 26-member Congressional Bicycle Caucus, he fought to add showers to the House office complex so that sweaty bike commuters could have more places to wash off.
\
He bikes almost every day even if it means checking his two-wheeler at the White House.
\
""You see him everywhere on it,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ""You can be at a meeting or something, and he'll pull up on his bike.""
\
Some Congress members attended a fund-raising campaign at a Washington hotel last summer when they were summoned to the House floor. While most dashed for cabs and cars, Blumenauer put on pants clips, to keep his cuffs out of the bike chain, and pedaled off to vote.
\
""He doesn't just talk, he really does it,"" said Bill Wilkinson, executive director of the Bicycle Federation of America, recalling the fund-raising story. ""He's not abashed about the fact that he's really deep into these issues.""
\
Now Blumenauer has set his sights on perhaps his most ambitious bicycling goal yet an interstate highway system for pedalers.
\
""For less than the cost of a couple of miles of urban freeway, we could build a bike path in every congressional district in the United States,"" Blumenauer said recently, his bike parked near him in his office.
\
""What if we had a national system that would connect every city, and every school, with a safe bike path?""
\
The idea drew a chuckle from William Fay, president of the American Highway Users Alliance. ""They'd be beautiful, but they'd be empty,"" he said of the trails.
\
Fay complains that Blumenauer and his pro-bike colleagues take too many gas tax dollars for a small group of cyclists, adding to a backlog in road and bridge repairs.
\
Congress this year authorized about $260 million annually for bike and pedestrian travel improvements. Blumenauer calls it the best bike bill in U.S. history. As recently as the 1980s, Congress spent just $2 million a year for cyclists and pedestrians.
\
David Burwell, president of Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, said Blumenauer can take some credit for the bill's passage, although he gives most praise to key lawmakers such as Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., and Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
\
""Earl Blumenauer was very instrumental even when he wasn't in Congress,"" Burwell said.
\
As a state legislator, Blumenauer learned he could live in the state capital without a car. He boasts that he hasn't driven in Washington since his election in 1996, although he admits he occasionally takes a cab.
\
As a city commissioner in Portland, he organized a Bike In The Rain event on the statistically rainiest day of the year to show that it's not hard to pedal in the rain.
\
It didn't rain, but Blumenauer got his point across.
\
He was the commissioner in charge of the transportation department, and bike buffs credit him for helping transform Portland into one of the best cities in the nation for cycling.
\
About 4 percent of commuters take advantage of ample bike lanes, bike parking, bike racks on buses and spaces for bikes on light rail cars.
\
""We've discovered if you build it, people will come,"" said Rex Burkholder, founder of Portland's Bicycle Transportation Alliance.
\
Blumenauer is associated with the bicycle as much as he is known for the bow tie he always wears in public, which makes him look something like a youthful Orville Redenbacher.
\
But Blumenauer doesn't consider himself a hard-core cyclist.
\
He mostly likes how biking fits in with his ""livable communities"" agenda, which is Blumenauer's utopian effort to create places that are affordable, safe and clean, with strong schools, good jobs and good places to ride a bike.
\
Blumenauer says that more than 100 million Americans have access to a bike, and the majority of trips people take are only two miles to three miles in length.
\
If more of those people had safe places to ride, he contends, it would help clear traffic off roads, clean up the environment, control urban sprawl, lower crime and increase interpersonal communication.
\
""It also is a metaphor for what we need to do in this country, I think,"" he said. ""We have too many people that are disconnected from their communities, from each other.""

The 2013 legislative session will be a busy one.
\
State lawmakers will have to come up with a plan to make sure the state's education system is adequately funded while also working to improve the economy, legislators told Clark County business leaders Friday morning. And they'll likely grapple with a major transportation package that will include money to replace the Interstate 5 Bridge.
\
All nine legislators-elect from the county's 17th, 18th and 49th districts participated in the legislative breakfast, along with 14th District Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima. The 14th District now reaches into parts of eastern Clark County.
\
Many of the lawmakers pointed to the importance of securing funding for the Columbia River Crossing project during the upcoming session, although some of them continued to disagree on major elements of the megaproject.
\
State Sen. Don Benton, R-Vancouver, said he'll be happy to support a funding proposal for the CRC this session -- if the light rail line is removed from the project.
\
""The CRC project, in my opinion, has been an absolute boondoggle from the beginning,"" said Benton, who is expected to be vice chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee next year. ""If the light rail component comes off, then we can talk about funding for the CRC.""
\
In response to Benton's comments, Rep. Jim Moeller, D-Vancouver, said the CRC is a compromise project that includes the interests of many people, not just those living in Clark County. Moeller said any transportation package lawmakers come up with will include other megaprojects from across the state.
\
""There's a package that's going to come forward that's going to include funding for the CRC,"" Moeller said. ""It's going to include light rail because it's a compromise project. It's a compromise between the state of Oregon, and it's a compromise between the state of Washington, and two different cities, and the federal government, and we all look at the same thing differently.""
\
The $3.5 billion CRC project would replace the I-5 Bridge and nearby freeway interchanges, as well as extend a light rail line from Portland into Vancouver.
\
Democratic Sen.-elect Annette Cleveland said the light rail part of the project was agreed upon several years ago. Now it's time to move forward, she said.
\
In order for the project to stay on track, Oregon and Washington will need to commit this year to paying about $450 million each toward the CRC, proponents of the project say. Oregon's governor has outlined about that much in his budget proposal, and Washington's governor is expected to roll out her proposal next week.
\
The legislative breakfast was hosted by the Greater Vancouver Chamber of Commerce, the Columbia River Economic Development Council and Identity Clark County.
\
Speaking of stormwater
\
Many lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans alike, agreed that the state needs to fix its stormwater runoff regulations, which have affected some development in the county. If the state wants to attract business to the area, it needs to make environmental regulations clear and predictable, many legislators said.
\
Clark County refused to follow state stormwater runoff rules in 2008, getting the county in legal trouble. Opponents of state stormwater standards say they're too expensive, while proponents argue that the county's alternative method doesn't go far enough to protect salmon.
\
Rep.-elect Liz Pike, R-Camas, said each county should be able to create its own rules for stormwater runoff.
\
""We have fine elected officials in every county in this state, and I would like to usher in a program where each county has jurisdictional authority to manage their own stormwater,"" said Pike, who will serve as the assistant ranking member of the House Environment Committee next year.
\
Lawmakers also discussed the roughly $1 billion budget shortfall they'll face this session; revenue increases, such as a new gas tax; and ideas for complying with a recent state Supreme Court decision that ruled the Legislature wasn't putting enough money into the education system.
\
Lawmakers offered different opinions about bolstering the state's education system. State Rep. Paul Harris, R-Vancouver, said lawmakers should figure out how to pay for education programs before finishing the rest of the budget, and that asking taxpayers to vote on education money is too risky.
\
""Throwing money at the same education system is not going to work,"" Harris said. ""We have to educate differently.""
\
Moeller said he would like to see a balanced approach to funding all government programs, and to do that, new revenue is needed.
\
""If I have to give to somebody, that means I take from somebody else,"" Moeller said. ""We cannot continue to fund everything that is necessary based on reform only. We need new revenue. We need new taxes if we are going to fund everything that we said we are going to fund. Reform is not a funding stream.""
\
The 105-day legislative session begins Jan. 14.

257,"Butch Otter is among Idaho's most-elected politicians, having served 14 years as lieutenant governor and three terms in Congress before being elected governor four years ago.\But the folksy, rodeo-loving cowboy politician has run into trouble as the state's chief executive, failing to convince a Legislature dominated heavily by his own party to sign onto the centerpiece of his first-term agenda - upgrading Idaho's roads - and then presiding over historic cuts in school funding after he ran for governor promising to ""stand up"" for a better education system.\Now, Otter, 68, is facing five challengers in the GOP primary as he seeks a second term, and former nonpartisan citizen activist and mediator Keith Allred is the Democratic front-runner, facing just a token challenge from Lee Chaney Sr. of Preston. Allred actually out-raised Otter in the most recent fundraising period, pulling in $241,278 in campaign contributions from Jan. 1 to May 9 while Otter raised just $193,339.\Those gunning for the governor in the Republican primary include an outspoken Ada County commissioner; a prosthetic wig shop owner and hair-loss specialist from Post Falls; a grizzled anti-abortion activist from Wilder; an amateur comedian; and a veterinarian and former U.S. Senate candidate who's been touring the state towing a giant inflatable dinosaur behind his brightly decorated campaign RV and hurling tough rhetoric at the incumbent.\Otter's declined to engage with his challengers, refusing to take part in the only statewide debate and not even announcing his candidacy for re-election until six weeks before the primary election.\Otter, in a statement issued by his campaign last week, said, ""I've been tested and toughened by adversity, and I'm eager to take on the challenges ahead."" He said he wants to ""maintain a family- and business-friendly tax and regulatory environment,"" keep state government efficient and operating within its means, and fight unfunded federal mandates and ""unwanted restrictions on the people of Idaho.""\Those themes also are struck by many of his primary challengers. But Rex Rammell, the veterinarian and former elk rancher who's adopted ""T-Rex"" as his campaign alter-ego, said, ""Butch knows the right thing in most cases, (but) he does not have the courage to do it.""\Sharon Ullman, the Ada County commissioner, maintains that Otter, who originally campaigned to go to Congress to tell the federal government to ""butt out"" of Idaho, has morphed into a tax-and-spend politician, pointing to his hard-fought but unsuccessful gas-tax hike proposal. ""Which governor do we get in 2011 if he's re-elected?"" she asked. ""I don't want to risk getting the 2009 tax-and-spend governor back.""\Even the issue Otter has focused on most so far in his campaign this spring - his move to sue the federal government to try to block federal health care reform - wins him few accolades from his challengers, though most say they support it. Rammell says it won't work and he'd go a step further by just refusing to follow federal law, even if it's upheld in court. Ullman faults Otter for proposing to shift more of indigent medical costs from the state to counties, and says the lawsuit needs to be backed up with moves to encourage Idahoans to stay healthy.\Tamara Wells of Post Falls, who has operated Tamara's, a prosthetic wig shop in Hayden, for the past 41 years, said, ""I'm tired of the administration not doing anything for anyone here in Idaho, let alone protecting us from the federal government. ... We're just 'yes'd' out the door - they hear us, but they don't do anything.""\She's never run for office before but decided to challenge Otter because, she said, ""The whole administration is not done well under him, and for the state of Idaho, I think we are suffering terribly.""\White-bearded Walter Bayes of Wilder, who's poured more than $20,000 of his own money into full-color fliers declaring, ""As governor, it will be my sworn duty to stop abortions,"" rails about light prison sentences, wolves, porn, the need to ""return to God and his morals,"" and not forcing Idahoans to buy health insurance, saying on that point, ""Butch finally got one right!""\Amateur comedian Ron ""Pete"" Peterson of Boise says he's a former Otter supporter who now just thinks anyone but Otter should be elected governor.\The winner of the Republican primary will face not only the Democratic primary winner in November, but also two independents, Jana Kemp of Boise and ""Pro-Life,"" the candidate formerly known as Marvin Richardson before his legal name change; plus Libertarian Ted Dunlap. The primary election is on Tuesday.\Credit: Betsy Z. Russell betsyr@spokesman.com, (866) 336-2854"
258,"Chris Peck is the Editor of The Spokesman-Review.\The dictionary defines a naysayer as somebody who opposes, refuses or denies as a matter of habit. In Spokane, naysayers might also be defined as big trouble.\Their unchanging habit of voting no on everything local government or civic leaders put forward to cope with our region's challenges has raised the very real possibility that Spokane is on the verge of taking great leaps backward.\Naysayers appear to represent something between 20 percent and 30 percent of the Spokane people registered to vote. They shouldn't rule. Often, they do.\When they succeed in fuzzing up an issue with unfounded fears or sloppy rhetoric, or when they go to the polls in an election with a light turnout, they can - and do - prevail.\They twice voted no on the Arena, no on the science center, no on a gas tax for street repairs.\They voted no on city-county consolidation, no on computers for the schools, no on a funding plan for low-income housing.\On Tuesday, they likely will be voting no on the much-needed bonds to repair 50 miles of bumpy, potholed streets in Spokane.\And, some will get carried away with the power of no and cast a vote of no-confidence in city government by voting, ironically, yes for a costly, bureaucratic plan to impose a strong mayor form of government on City Hall.\Everyone has a right to an opinion.\Everyone has a choice to vote yea or nay on every ballot.\This is the wonder and power of democracy.\But here is the problem. Naysayers have become the very thing that they often decry: an elite so convinced it is right that it has stopped listening to anybody else.\A classic example of naysayer logic can be found in their discussion of the Spokane street bond vote.\Naysayers claim the $37.3 million bonds are too expensive.\In fact, a vote against the street bonds Tuesday assures that fixing the streets will cost much, much more in the future.\The math is simple. Five years ago, 57 percent of the city's arterials were in good repair. Today, only 31 percent are in good repair.\If another five years goes by without needed preventive maintenance, the cost per mile of resurfacing and rehabilitating the streets will likely double.\This point is lost in a blizzard of obfuscation about the need for City Hall to tighten its budget.\Fact is, city government already is tight in Spokane. The city spends 31 percent less per capita on city services than any of the four other largest cities in the state.\And do naysayers never drive city streets? Do they not see the ruts and ruination of a decade of bad winters? If they do drive, might they suggest where to find the money to fix the woefully rutted, pitted arterials?\They like to point fingers, yet rarely have an idea on how to accomplish much, except to suggest if they were in office things would be better.\Spokane has tried that with Chris Anderson.\The current city councilman, who has missed 13 straight council meetings while working on a movie, in L.A.. campaigned and was elected as a naysayer - promising to get things shaped up in City Hall, cut the waste, spend the money more wisely.\To date, Anderson has alienated everyone on the council and collected $1,500 a month for the three months so far that he has missed City Council meetings.\And how did Chris Anderson get into politics?\He was the first campaign manager for John Talbott, leader of the naysayers on the city street bonds.\Talbott's last money-saving idea, to roll back salaries of city employees to 1990 levels, also had exactly the opposite effect.\Once Talbott's initiative began to be distributed, nearly every city employee frantically joined a union. Today, only 20 city employees out of 2,000 aren't in a union, thereby raising the cost of local government.\A version of naysayer logic now appears to be at work among some supporters of the strong mayor initiative that will be decided on Tuesday.\Strong mayor sounds good. Get a grip on government. Cut the waste, all that stuff.\Except strong mayor likely will have the opposite effect. Under this concept, the mayor's salary would jump from $30,000 to $80,000. The mayor would hire an $80,000-a-year city administrator.\Each council member would be paid $30,000, up from $18,000. Since the mayor wouldn't be working at the direction of the council - in fact wouldn't even be going to council meetings - both sides would likely hire staff to gather data and draft competing legislative proposals.\The strong mayor proposal creates more government, raises political salaries and introduces an even more confrontational environment at City Hall.\Interestingly, Spokane has a strong mayor right now in Jack Geraghty. Quietly, without grandstanding, the mayor has forged an excellent working relationship with the City Council (Chris Anderson excepted).\He is working to strengthen ties with the neighborhoods and is focused on reforming Civil Service, which could genuinely improve the efficiency of local government in a way the strong mayor plan would not.\There is only one way to counter the naysayers.\Go the polls. Vote yes for streets, no for the strong mayor boondoggle."

OLYMPIA - Neither is a child of privilege. Both Republican Dino Rossi and Democrat Christine Gregoire have lived what retiring Gov. Gary Locke called ""The Great American Dream"" in his 1996 campaign.
\
Both grew up poor and worked their way through college Washington schools, not the snooty Ivy League. They started out in humble careers he waxing floors and scrubbing office bathrooms, she working as a clerk-typist for the probation office.
\
She went on to become an agency director and the state's first female attorney general. He staked out a successful real estate career and became one of the most powerful state legislators.
\
Both are skilled negotiators and are known for their good people skills.
\
Both had mothers who were in abusive situations. Neither has parents still living. Both talk about their strong marriages and the salve of home and hearth after the bruising days of politics.
\
Plenty of differences ...
\
But for all their similarities, Washington's finalists for governor have plenty of stylistic and policy differences.
\
* Style: Rossi, who at 44 is 13 years Gregoire's junior, always seems relaxed and chipper, with a sunny smile and warming up conversations with a good story or a ""dad-ism"" he learned from his late father.
\
Gregoire, who's funny, relaxed and a great conversationalist in private, comes off as tightly wound and laser-beam intense whenever she's on stage. She comes off as a passionate policy wonk, like, say, Al Gore.
\
* Background: Both are creatures of Olympia, but in different ways. It's true that Rossi made his money in the business world, but he made his political mark and the credentials to run for governor by serving in the state Senate for seven years. Gregoire has been at the Capitol since 1982, in the executive branch as ecology director and in the attorney general's office. As budget writer, Rossi knows state government inside out. As attorney general representing all the agencies, so does Gregoire.
\
* Inside-outside: It's true, as Rossi points out, that he has spent most of his adult life in the private sector, as a commercial real estate agent, and that Gregoire has been in government service since she graduated from law school. Rossi says he has a private- sector mind-set for making decisions and that Gregoire is government- centric. Gregoire says public service is noble and that solving problems is the same everywhere.
\
* Politics: Both have been called centrists, but the label probably fits Gregoire better than Rossi. She is a Gary Locke-style New Democrat, fairly conservative with money and liberal on social issues. She opposes the proposed sales tax increase for education and has said she'd try to hold the line on taxes. Rossi is a conservative on both social and fiscal matters; it's his style that comes off moderate. He talks about being a conservative ""with a social conscience"" and negotiated with Democrats on their budget priorities.
\
* Change: Both say they'd usher in change. Rossi says Democrats have held the governor's mansion for 20 years and he'd bring fresh perspective. Gregoire says she'd bring the ""right kind of change."" She's endorsed by the outgoing governor, but says she'd have her own approach.
\
* Abortion: Both are Catholic, but Gregoire bucks church teaching and pressure from the hierarchy to support abortion rights. Rossi opposes abortion, calling it a matter of conscience.
\
* Stem cell research: Gregoire wants Washington to take the lead in expanding stem cell research. Rossi doesn't; he wants the state to stay focused on diagnostics and therapeutics.
\
* Gay Marriage: Gregoire has said the state isn't ready for same- sex marriage, but that she opposes a federal constitutional amendment to ban it. Rossi favors an amendment if needed to stop the state from being forced to recognize marriages performed elsewhere.
\
* The economy: Rossi says the government needs to pare back regulations, restrain spending, work on health care and education, but mostly get out of the way and let the private sector, especially small businesses, create jobs.
\
Gregoire says Rossi doesn't understand that government has a key role in job creation and that a chief executive should be working 24- 7 to get the economy moving. She'd use $500 million from the tobacco settlement to kick-start a biotechnology research and jobs incubator in the state.
\
* Education: Gregoire, backed by the Washington Education Association, promotes full funding of voter-approved education spending initiatives for teacher pay and class-size reduction, efforts to lower the high school dropout rate, and more operating and construction money for colleges. Rossi says reforms and accountability should come before more money. He'd institute merit pay for top teachers and give local districts power to sack bad teachers and to oust disruptive kids from the classroom. He, too, supports higher education enhancements.
\
* Transportation: She calls last year's nickel increase in the gas tax a down payment and says Olympia should take responsibility for mega-projects like a new 520 bridge, repair of Seattle's Alaskan Way Viaduct and a new bridge from Vancouver to Portland. Rossi isn't promising more revenue and says opening commuter lanes and improving capacity would be his goals.
\
* Environment: Gregoire, the former ecology chief, says she'd have strong environmental policies and supports land-use planning. Rossi, who calls himself a conservationist, wants more local control in planning.

ELLENSBURG - The state's roads need work and if they don't get it soon, farmers trying to move their crops to market will definitely notice.
\
Asking for urgency, Gov. Jay Inslee called Tuesday for the Legislature to pass legislation that would fix the state's ailing roads and bridges.
\
""I'm here to report to you that we are in deep, deep trouble,"" Inslee said in his keynote address to the annual Economic Outlook Conference at Central Washington University.
\
Later in the day in Yakima, Inslee said in an interview that he will meet with legislators today in Olympia to see if an agreement can be reached on a transportation package.
\
Inslee said he has not made a decision about whether to call a special session next month. He has repeatedly said he will only call it if he has the votes to pass the legislation, which would have to include a revenue source such as a gas-tax hike.
\
""There has to be some source of revenues,"" he said. ""Hopefully, we get together and figure that out.""
\
In Ellensburg, Inslee headlined a collection of elected officials, economists and industry representatives discussing the future of the state's economy. About 160 people attended at the conference, hosted by the university's College of Business.
\
Inslee said the collapse several months ago of an Interstate 5 bridge in Skagit County, along with cuts to bus service across the state, will put more drivers on the road. It's one example of the need for a bipartisan transportation funding package for maintenance, he said.
\
""It's going to hit the ag industry next year,"" he predicted.
\
Inslee also talked up his other initiatives to improve the economy and boost job creation. Among them: an increased emphasis on science and technology education in schools; improving the business environment through continually improving the permitting and tax processes; encouraging all areas of the state to find a role in the aerospace industry; and investing in green energy.
\
""We know what we can do in this state when we embrace innovation,"" he said.
\
Other speakers touched on the state and national economy, as well as trends affecting agriculture.
\
Washington apple growers will need to develop bigger markets for their fruit in the coming years, said Todd Fryhover, the president of the Washington Apple Commission, as part of a panel addressing farming trends.
\
Fryhover said big apple crops are coming from the East Coast and Mexico, among other places. That will squeeze local growers.
\
""It's going to be a scary marketplace,"" Fryhover said.
\
Building relationships with large markets such as China and with consumers who use technology to make food-purchasing decisions is essential, he said.
\
Hay growers, too, must confront the importance of a rapidly diversifying global market, said Loren Lentz, president of the Washington State Hay Growers Association.
\
Japan used to be virtually the sole destination for Washington hay, but China, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have been increasing their purchases, finding it cheaper to import hay for cattle, horse and camel feed than grow it themselves, Lentz said
\
John Mitchell, a Portland economic consultant who speaks every year at the conference, delivered cautiously optimistic news that the U.S. economy is improving five years after the recession.
\
""It's growing, but it's growing slow,"" he said.
\
Same goes for the state economy, said Steve Lerch, executive director and chief economist of the Washington State Economic Forecast and Revenue Council.
\
With construction leading the way, employment is rising in most Washington industries, he said, and state revenue collections have returned to pre-recession levels.
\
After the conference, Inslee headed to Manastash Creek, where he heralded a project to restore flows to an area that dries up.
\
Construction started last month on the $3.8 million project to convert several miles of Yakima River diversion ditches to pressurized pipe, conserving water that will be used for farming and to make the creek passable for migrating salmon, steelhead and other fish.
\
The Manastash Creek improvements have been planned for 12 years but are heralded as the first construction project of the 30-year Yakima River Basin Integrated Water Resource Management Plan.
\
""I'm proud this is the first bill I passed as governor of Washington,"" he said.
\
The bill set aside $132 million, mostly for the purchase of private timberland in upper Kittitas County.
\
Overall, the plan calls for up to $5 billion in improvements.
\
Inslee was joined at the podium - and in autographing a section of blue pipe - by irrigation district officials and Johnson Meninick, cultural resources program manager for the Yakama Nation.
\
Meninick opened the ceremony with a prayer in the Yakama language, a song and bell ringing.
\
""Everything is important on this land,"" Meninick said. ""Nothing is unimportant.""
\
Farmers, too, shared in the excitement about Manastash Creek.
\
""I don't look at it as a victory, I look at it as an accomplishment,"" said Clarence Harrell, a hay and Sudan grass grower.
\
And he's excited for the future. His sons and a grandson, the fourth and fifth generations since the family settled the land, are already taking over much of his business.
\
""When we'd leave here we'd like to have something we did right,"" he said.
\
Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct the pricetag of the Manastash project.

261,"
Optimism and the promise of balance and bipartisan civility were among the big winners in Washington's rambunctious election.
\
After two elections of trying first an all-Democratic approach and then switching allegiance to the Republicans, the state's sensible, centrist voters finally got the bright idea to pick and choose people from both parties and then chain them together so that they must collaborate or fail.
\
More extreme views and candidates were rejected. The candidates who did best sounded bipartisan, inclusive themes.
\
Here are some of the winners and losers:
\
. Winners: Democrats. After serving as the doormat of the '94 election, the party managed to regain some of the ground it lost in congressional races by dumping a few of the more visible Republican ""revolutionaries,"" Randy Tate and Jack Metcalf.
\
Democrats have kept a lock -- or Locke -- on the governor's mansion for an unprecedented four straight terms and won all but one statewide office (Munro's). As expected, they made headway in state House seats, but couldn't keep their state Senate majority.
\
The state went for President Clinton in a landslide. His campaign had the best single event of the campaign: a bus caravan from Seattle to Portland.
\
Losers: Republicans. They can take great solace in winning control of the Legislature, but must be smarting at the congressional losses and the near shutout at the state level.
\
Republicans won so many offices in 1994 that they had only one way to go this year, and down they went. They'll need some strong rebuilding and refocusing if they expect to contest Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, retake some congressional seats and defend their legislative majorities in just two years.
\
. Winner: Balance. At both the national and state level, voters set up divided government -- Democrats as head of state and Republicans in the legislative bodies. Will it mean gridlock or progress? It's entirely up to the principals.
\
. Winner: Gary Locke. The new governor, who is already on the radar screen for the national and international media as the country's first Chinese-American chief executive, comes to office with little baggage. He ran a centrist campaign and made few hard-to-achieve promises. Locke also gets credit for a classy, highroad campaign and a humble, conciliatory victory address.
\
. Loser: Ellen Craswell. The Republican governor candidate simply never took hold. She won the primary with a clear-eyed, ultraconservative, religion-tinged message, but couldn't expand her appeal into the broad middle of the political spectrum where elections are won or lost.
\
. Winner: Labor. Organized labor awakened from a slumber to become a major player. Labor-backed candidates won.
\
. Loser: Negative campaigning. We all wanted to take a shower after an evening of watching television and seeing the parade of attack ads. Democrats told us Republicans intended to destroy Medicare, Social Security, the environment and education. Republicans told us Democrats were hopeless liberals, soft on crime and even willing to ""support the sex industry."" Trouble is, none of it was true.
\
. Winner: Demo women. Patty Murray crisscrossed the state for Democrats. Many won and she picked up chits for her 1998 Senate re-election bid. Half of the statewide offices will be held by women, including a potential new star, the state school superintendent-elect, Terry Bergeson.
\
. Losers: Republican women. Besides Craswell, two GOP women ran creditable, but losing, campaigns for statewide office: Ann Anderson for lieutenant governor and Lucy De Young for treasurer.
\
. Winners: Bears. Furry critters stand a sporting chance now that hunters can't use bait or hounds to find 'em.
\
. Losers: Pay-to-play. The bear initiative, it should be noted, was the only successful statewide ballot measure -- and the only one where sponsors didn't buy their way onto the ballot by paying signature-gatherers.
\
. Winners: Business. Most business leaders stayed neutral in the governor's race or endorsed Locke. They'll have friendly majorities in the Legislature, plus promises of tax rollbacks and incentives, a continuing war on regulations, and Locke's pledge of an open door.
\
. Losers: Do-it-yourself school reform. Voters elected Locke and Bergeson, the two strongest advocates of the state's new education reform law -- and overwhelmingly rejected initiatives to shake up schools in a more drastic way, vouchers for private school and authorization of publicly funded independent schools.
\
. Winner: Washington Education Association. The WEA put its muscle behind making all of this happen. (Irony: They'll have a tough time getting a pay raise for teachers in 1997, given the GOP control of the Legislature and state spending limits.)
\
. Loser: Gov. Mike Lowry. Who?
\
. Winner: Transportation. Surprise, surprise. Puget Sound voters approved a $3.9 billion rapid transit plan and Locke and others also predict a bipartisan plan to raise the gas tax to help address the growing traffic gridlock.
\
. Losers: Christian conservatives. It seems they can greatly influence low-turnout primaries and selected local races, but their power gets diluted in the mainstream.
\
. Winners: Demo senators. Their caucus lost control of the state Senate, but three of their colleagues hit the big times: Brad Owen will be lieutenant governor and president of the Senate and Adam Smith and Kevin Quigley are headed to Congress.

262,"
OLYMPIA -- About the time the Capitol campus flower beds are blooming, the Legislature goes underground. This year is no exception.
\
With three weeks left in the 1997 session, work on important bills from the budget and welfare overhaul to juvenile justice, land-use planning and a new stadium for the Seattle Seahawks are being decided in scores of private meetings and telephone conversations.
\
The public hearings are largely finished, and the real work is just starting. Most of it is being done by the Republicans who control the Legislature for the first time in 15 years.
\
As usual, the minority party, in this case, the Democrats, complain they are being frozen out of the process.
\
On the surface, most of the activity appears as neat and orderly as the beds of yellow daffodils outside the House and Senate office buildings.
\
But sometimes things fall apart and sometimes the public gets a glimpse.
\
A case in point is the train wreck Thursday over the much-negotiated proposal to clamp down harder on juvenile criminals.
\
Senate Law and Justice Committee Chairwoman Pam Roach, R-Auburn, balked at a compromise quietly worked out among legislative leaders and Gov. Gary Locke, mostly because she had not been part of the talks.
\
To cries of anger from fellow committee members, Roach tabled the measure.
\
She left, in tears, a closed-door meeting of the Senate GOP caucus Friday after a majority of her Republican colleagues made it clear they want to pull the bill from her committee for a vote of the full Senate, where it is expected to pass and be sent to the House.
\
Theatrics aside, the Legislature is set to complete its work by the April 27 adjournment of the 105-day session, said House Speaker Clyde Ballard, R-East Wenatchee.
\
Among the issues:
\
Budget: House and Senate negotiators are working behind the scenes to resolve differences on a two-year state budget.
\
The House has adopted an $18.99 billion version, about $103 million below the Senate and about $244 million below Democrat Locke's request level.
\
Prime differences are in education, level of pay raises for public employees, social services, the environment and the Basic Health Plan for the working poor.
\
Lawmakers also are considering construction, transportation and supplemental 1995-97 spending plans.
\
Welfare: Majority Republicans say they are close to agreement on a sweeping overhaul measure that the governor can sign.
\
They have been meeting with Locke's negotiators behind closed doors.
\
The main sticking points have been benefits for newly arriving legal immigrants, food stamps for all legal immigrants and more money for subsidized child care and other support programs.
\
Seahawk stadium -- A House hearing is scheduled for Thursday on a Senate-passed plan for financing a $425 million stadium project for the Seahawks. A close House vote is forecast. If both houses agree on a proposal, it would go onto a June special election ballot statewide.
\
Health care: The House budget contains substantial new costs for the 132,500 people who would get health care coverage through the state subsidized Basic Health Plan.
\
The Senate already has passed similar legislation, and the two versions must be reconciled.
\
Locke proposes far more modest changes in the program, but seeks a much larger enrollment.
\
A House measure to greatly deregulate the health insurance industry cleared the Senate Health and Long Term Care Committee last week.
\
Its prospects on the Senate floor are considered fair, but it may face a Locke veto.
\
Business taxes -- Locke this week is expected to sign a measure the Legislature sent him last week to roll back a 1993 business tax increase on services, such as work done by lawyers and architects.
\
The reduction would take effect in July 1998.
\
Locke vetoed a plan that rolled back taxes effective this July, saying the state can't afford the extra $100 million revenue loss. But he has said he would sign the new measure.
\
Charter schools: The House has approved bipartisan legislation that would authorize nonprofit groups to create publicly funded, but independent and largely deregulated, schools.
\
The Senate is expected to go along.
\
Locke and state school chief Terry Bergeson worked on the bill, scaling back some of the provisions to make it more of a pilot project.
\
Gay marriage: The Senate may vote on a House-passed proposal to place on the ballot a ban on same-sex marriage. Prospects for action are fair.
\
Growth management: Republican leaders of both houses will try to revive talks with Locke over ways to make at least some changes to the state's 7-year-old land-use planning law.
\
The law is drawing major resistance from developers and from many local governments in rural Washington, who consider it too stringent.
\
Locke has agreed to go along only with modest changes in the law.
\
The Senate this week is expected to send to the House a measure containing Locke's proposals in order to keep the issue on the table for possible negotiation in the final weeks of the session.
\
Prospects for significant legislation this year are poor.
\
Gas tax: Senate backers are hoping to line up enough votes this week to begin action on a two-step, 7-cents-a-gallon increase in the 23-cent tax.
\
The plan, currently awaiting a vote in the Senate Transportation Committee, would permit passage of a $3.9 billion state transportation budget.
\
Prospects for legislative passage are considered fair at best.

"
263,"Honor Vietnam-era veterans\Today, March 29, is national Vietnam Veterans Day. In addition, our state of Washington has designated a Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day on March 30 each year. Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans are those who served in our armed forces, in any location, from Nov. 1, 1955, through May 15, 1975. We Americans witness the national and local efforts to acknowledge thousands of men and women who may have been denied a proper welcome upon returning home more that 40 years ago.\Over the past three years on this weekend, several alliances had combined to sponsor the 50th commemoration of the Vietnam War at Vancouver Mall in honoring hundreds of our local veterans. This yearly event had commemorated the devotion, loyalty, and sacrifices of these veterans and their families. Our Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans are held in high esteem, and would receive personal recognition, a lapel pin, and a proclamation signed by the president.\Due to this current environment of social distancing, we have postponed this event unto later this year. However, we are asking our community in retaining this spirit of dedication by personally offering recognition, encouragement, and appreciation to our Vietnam veterans. This would continue the beauty of this celebration.\Thank you, Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans!\J. Ron Powers\Vancouver\How about that bridge?\Now would be a great time for that I-5 Bridge trunnion replacement. Just saying.\Kyle Legato\Vancouver\Flu deserves more attention\Looking at the statistics for COVID-19, the new coronavirus, and at the statistics for seasonal influenza, it appears that the worldwide reaction is unreasonable, over the top for COVID-19, or the casual reaction to seasonal influenza is insufficient.\Current seasonal influenza is the A H1N1, the same one that killed over 50 million people in 1918. Despite having an immunization, there has been more that 290,000 deaths worldwide, as reported by WHO.\The WHO reports over 23,593 deaths from COVID-19, worldwide. Out of 520,395 confirmed infections, 123,322 have recovered from the infection. Both viruses are basically airborne for transmission, with some surface contamination risk. Both are most dangerous to the very young, elderly, and those with chronic illnesses, especially heart and lung diseases. Precautions taken to avoid illness are essentially the same for both viruses.\Therefore, why isn't the seasonal influenza considered a pandemic and receiving the same news coverage?\Steve Engard\Ridgefield\Void of leadership is showing\In times of crisis, leaders step forward to deal with the problem. In the case of the pandemic we face, there is a total void of leadership from the White House.\First, he called the virus a hoax. Then he said one day it will magically disappear. Next were lies about not knowing sooner (the Chinese medical community sounded the alarm in January). Perhaps if Trump hadn't disbanded the piece of government whose job it was to deal with epidemics and pandemics, we might have been better prepared.\Even in his first major address, read from a teleprompter, there were three lies that had to be corrected within an hour of his speech. His daily drivel about how great our country is responding to this issue and how well prepared everyone is are constantly contradicted by medical personnel in multiple states. He fails to grasp an important concept: If you lie to the country more than 16,000 times, reasonable people will be skeptical of anything you say. This void of leadership must be changed in November.\John Lewis\Vancouver\Trump is in over his head\Here we go again! Trump attacking the reporters for doing their job. At the press conference covering the coronavirus on March 20, Trump attacked Peter Alexander, American journalist. He asked the president to calm Americans who were scared because of the coronavirus pandemic. The president replied with, “That is a nasty question and you are a terrible reporter and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.”\Later, someone else asked Trump's lapdog, Mike Pence, the same question, Pence replied with an appropriate answer “Don't be afraid. Be vigilant.” The day before, Trump joked about kicking journalists out of the briefing. He also said he would like to get rid of 75 percent to 80 percent of them and have only two or three that he likes in the room.\Trump needs to stop talking and let the professionals run the press briefing. We can't rely on the president to provide clear messages. All he does is rant and rave, talk about unrelated topics and not always answer the question. He has criticized the coronavirus as a “hoax.” Also, when the sun comes out it will magically disappear. Trump as usual is taking no responsibility for anything and blaming someone else.\When will the American people realize he is incompetent and way over his head to serve as president of the United States?\Lucia Halverson\Vancouver\Tax relief needed now\Gov.

OLYMPIA -- Washington lawmakers have sent only a trickle of major bills to Gov. Gary Locke's desk, but the pace is picking up as they face an adjournment deadline less than two weeks away.
\
Welfare, the Seahawks stadium, budget talks, and legislation on youth criminals, charter schools, the gasoline tax, same-gender marriage and other big ticket items of the session take center stage this week.
\
By law, the regular 105-day session must end by April 27. Republican leaders are trying to beat that by two days, to avoid spending more than one more weekend at the Capitol.
\
That's a tall order.
\
Even with both houses controlled by the same party, nearly all of the major pieces of legislation are in flux. GOP leaders exude optimism, and, in fact, unexpectedly gave the troops the weekend off.
\
The Democratic governor said in an interview that he, too, has high hopes that he and the Republican Legislature can find common ground on a wide variety of issues.
\
He's keeping his counsel on whether one mega-issue is resolved: welfare. On Thursday night, lawmakers sent Locke a sweeping bill that Democrats called ""veto bait."" Republicans say it represents their last, best offer, but Locke is considering his options.
\
Here is a quick look at the top issues facing lawmakers this week:
\
Budget -- House and Senate negotiators continue behind-the-scenes talks on ways to resolve differences on a two-year state budget. Senate budget Chairman James West, R-Spokane, said a formal negotiating committee may be created this week, with sessions open to the public.
\
The House has adopted an $18.99 billion version, about $103 million below the Senate and about $244 million below the governor's level.
\
House appropriations Chairman Tom Huff, R-Gig Harbor, said the main differences between the Legislature and the governor are in education, level of pay raises for public employees, social services, the environment and the Basic Health Plan for the working poor.
\
Lawmakers also are considering construction, transportation and supplemental 1995-97 spending plans.
\
Welfare -- Democrats expect Locke to veto the Republican-crafted welfare bill this week. The main points of disagreement include benefits for all legal immigrants and more money for subsidized child care and other support programs. The veto would trigger intense negotiation to find a compromise.
\
Youth criminals -- The Senate is expected to vote on a compromise measure to crack down on violent juvenile offenders. The House bill has sat for a week in Senate rules while warring Republicans worked to resolve their differences, which largely surrounded the level of punishment for 16- and 17-year-old offenders.
\
Seahawk stadium -- The House is expected to vote on proposal to authorize a June vote on financing plan for a $425 million stadium project for the Seahawks. A close House vote is forecast, with at least 60 of the 98 members objecting to a key component of the plan, a 2.5 percent excise tax on licensed sports-logo items. That would punch a $100 million hole in the $325 million public share of the project. The Senate already has approved a public vote, but would have to vote on any House changes to the financing plan.
\
Health care -- The House budget contains substantial new costs for the 132,500 people who would get health care coverage through the state subsidized Basic Health Plan. The Senate already has passed similar legislation, and the two versions must be reconciled. Locke proposes far more modest changes in the program, but seeks a much larger enrollment. A House measure to greatly deregulate the health insurance industry faces a Senate floor vote.
\
Business taxes -- Locke today planned to sign a measure the Legislature sent him to roll back a 1993 business tax increase on services, such as work done by lawyers and architects. The reduction would take effect in July 1998. Locke vetoed a plan that rolled back taxes effective this July, saying the state can't afford the extra $100 million revenue loss. But he has said he would sign the new measure.
\
Locke earlier this session signed a $62 million measure to continue for one year a modest property tax cut. He vetoed another $220 million in property tax cuts, which the GOP promptly sent to the fall ballot.
\
Charter schools -- A key Senate vote is pending on a House-approved plan to authorize nonprofit groups to create publicly funded, but independent and largely deregulated, schools. The House version picked up bipartisan support, but Senate education chairman Harold Hochstatter, R-Moses Lake, has refused to allow it out of his committee as long as it contains a requirement for charter schools to meet all the mandates of the state's new education reform law. Backers of the plan said the House bill probably will be pulled from the committee and placed on the Senate floor for a vote this week.
\
Gay marriage -- The Senate may vote on a House-passed proposal to place on the ballot a ban on same-sex marriage.
\
Growth management -- Republican leaders of both houses will try to revive talks with Locke over ways to make at least some changes to the state's 7-year-old land-use planning law. The law is drawing major resistance from developers and from many local governments in rural Washington, who consider it too stringent. Locke has agreed to go along only with modest changes in the law. The Senate is expected to send to the House a measure containing Locke's proposals in order to keep the issue alive.
\
Gas tax -- Senate backers are hoping to line up enough votes this week to pass a two-step, 7-cents-a-gallon increase in the 23-cent tax. The plan, currently awaiting a vote in the Senate Transportation Committee, would permit passage of a $3.9 billion state transportation budget. Prospects for legislative passage are considered fair at best.

YAKIMA HERALD-REPUBLIC
\
Ruth Pleasants isn't necessarily a fan of the governor, but she has some advice for lawmakers when they convene tomorrow and start eyeing a $1.4 billion budget surplus.
\
""When you have a surplus at home, you save it,"" said the Yakima resident.
\
Gov. Christine Gregoire also is using the household budget analogy to persuade the 2006 Legislature to save $900 million of the surplus and spend the rest mostly on one-time targeted investments ranging from education to the environment.
\
But whether legislators can restrain themselves is another matter. Republicans say the Democratic majority won't.
\
""The grab for the $1.4 billion is on,"" said Sen. Alex Deccio, R- Yakima.
\
Rep. Bill Hinkle, R-Cle Elum, said Gregoire isn't taking her own advice. He said her proposal to create a new agency for early childhood education is an example of bureaucracy run amok.
\
""If it's anything like OSPI, it'll grow like a cancer,"" he said, referring to the Office of the Superintendent for Public Instruction.
\
Gregoire rejected the criticism in responding to a question posed by the Yakima Herald-Republic during taping of a public access television show called Olympia On-Call. She said responsibilities for early childhood learning are presently scattered among several agencies, including social services, community development and education.
\
""There's no way when you've got that many agencies you can be effective,"" Gregoire said. She is requesting $1.5 million in her budget for the new agency.
\
That's just a taste of the political combat to come in the 60- day session.
\
Lawmakers also have 45 fewer days to get things done than the 105- day sessions that take place in odd-numbered years.
\
""It'll be short but fast-paced. There's lots of things on the agenda,"" said Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside.
\
That agenda includes bioenergy, an apparently bipartisan effort to grow a state industry around the production of alternative fuels from crops.
\
Both parties are also backing a host of bills aimed at improving the management of sex offenders. Gregoire said she supports tougher penalties on offenders who fail to register.
\
Rep. Jim Clements, R-Selah, who led last year's effort to create 880-foot community protection zones around schools, said he's adamant about renewing the law this year. It's set to expire in July.
\
""Our children deserve a higher standard when it comes to our criminal justice system protecting them,"" he said.
\
But drawing circles around certain neighborhoods and saying offenders can't live there can create a ""false security"" among communities, said Sen. Debbie Regala, D-Tacoma.
\
""If you keep limiting residency, pretty soon there's very few places to live and we have offenders who end up being homeless. It's the homeless offenders that are so much more likely to reoffend,"" Regala said. She is not opposed to the zones around schools, however.
\
Other items on the to-do list are more polarizing, and not necessarily along party lines. Take the WASLs, the statewide standardized test that this year's 10th-graders must pass in order to graduate in 2008. The exam is in the spring with results not available until the fall.
\
Gregoire wants to spend $38.5 million on remedial education to improve the percentage of students with passing scores. Right now, only 57 percent of the 10th-graders are considered ready. Gregoire said it's wrong to require students to fail twice before making them eligible for remedial help.
\
""We are failing those students,"" she said.
\
She also wants students to get their results more quickly so they can begin to work on their weaknesses.
\
Deccio said he doesn't think ""throwing more money at it is going to solve the problem.""
\
He noted that the Legislature has funded smaller class sizes but that problems educating certain students in the basics persist.
\
""WASL is becoming a very controversial issue even among Democrats. I think we've got too wide a curriculum that reduces time on the basics,"" he said.
\
As always, Tim Eyman's presence will loom over the session. He will be in Olympia to file SaveOur30Tabs.com, an initiative to roll back an increase in vehicle weight fees passed last year by the Legislature. Motorists began feeling the effect with their tab renewals this month. Increases range from $10 to $30 a year on cars and motorhomes will feel a $75 squeeze.
\
Milt Lapp of Yakima was taken aback when he renewed his granddaughter's tags on her 1990 Ford Tempo. The tab was $43.75. Legislators, he said, have lost his trust.
\
""They haven't really proven themselves,"" he said.
\
Max, a Yakima man who didn't want to use his last name, is glad Eyman is back on the license-tab watch. ""I hope he puts a stop to this,"" he said.
\
Revenue from the new vehicle weight fees was not part of Initiative 912, the measure rejected by voters that would have overturned the 9.5-cent gas tax.
\
Republicans will try for some tax relief, using the surplus as an argument that last year's sin and estate taxes can now be rolled back. They also have an 11-point ""Commitment to Washington"" agenda for the session, an effort to get beyond the default mode for the minority: criticize the majority at every turn.
\
""You don't want to just attack all the time. It looks like sour grapes,"" Newhouse said.
\
The ""Commitment to Washington"" includes proposals to eliminate day-use fees at state parks, repeal the estate tax passed last year and provide tax relief for farmers.
\
Sometimes it's necessary to go on the defensive. Newhouse said he expects an environmentalist-backed proposal to change the state's stock watering law, which was recently upheld in ranchers' favor by the state attorney general.
\
""I fully expect to have to defend stock watering. The AG opinion kind of draws a target around it,"" he said.
\
In a rebuke to the state Department of Ecology, Attorney General Rob McKenna found in November that the agency has no authority to set a specific limit on the amount of stock water that farmers and ranchers can draw daily without a permit.

Failing septic tanks spread disease
\
In the Jan. 5 story Mielke discusses his goals, newly elected county commissioner Tom Mielke opined that the county should stop requiring people with overflowing septic systems to fix them ... at least until they begin to disturb the neighbors. Mielke, who claims to be irritated by arrogant politicians, appears ignorant of the basics of sanitary science and public health. He has no idea how easily failing septic tanks fowl ground and surface water and spread disease.
\
During the 1800s, the sanitarians of old realized that cholera, typhoid and dysentery (that killed vast urban populations) were caused by human waste loose in the environment and the public water supply. Perhaps Clark County Health Department should collect all the failing septic sludge that surfaces each year and cart it to Mielkes front yard to see if it bothers his neighbors.

Roads need share of funding
\
Theres been a number of stories published in The Columbian in recent weeks regarding the diminishing resources of the Federal Highway Trust Fund. The Jan. 2 story Panel: Hike fuel tax to aid highways, was no exception.
\
It reported that a national commission was recommending a 50 percent increase in federal gasoline taxes because the current 18.4 cents a gallon gas tax and 24.4 cents a gallon diesel tax fail to raise enough to keep pace with the cost of road, bridge and transit programs.
\
As in most every story printed on this shortage of funds, there is never any mention of the millions of dollars that have been taken away from the Federal Highway Trust fund and spent on nonroad programs. Why isnt that front-page news?

Attraction of profit advances research
\
In his Jan. 7 letter, Sick to see how poorly U.S. compares, it sounds as if John Lacko wants to reach into my pocket and those of others so he can get health care from a system he is ashamed of. It must be a miracle he and his are in good health in spite of living in America.
\
It is the very attraction of profit that drives companies to develop medicines that save and prolong lives. What great medical advances have come from the governments of Cuba, Canada or the United States? Canada is one of the largest importers of American pharmaceuticals per capita.
\
Canada will welcome Mr. and Mrs. Lacko, and I say to them go and good luck with your health care. Or enjoy the sugar cane fields of Cuba in your retirement and take Michael Moore with you.

Good job done by county forces
\
I have read several complaints about the way things went during the Arctic Blast. I wanted to voice my appreciation for the people who work keeping the roads clear and the power on in the area of my home and commute. I live in rural Clark County at high elevation, and have nothing but good things to say about the plowing done by the Clark County crews.
\
Clark Public Utilities works diligently all through the good weather months, clearing branches away from the power and phone lines to lessen the chance of one snapping and taking down a power line in the winter. It works. We rarely lose power, and when we do, they usually have it fixed within a matter of a few hours. That is very good service in my opinion.
\
I grew up in Idaho, and the road plowing here is every bit as good, if not better, than it was there.

I totally agree with veteran Jerry Rudisills opinion of an Ashland, Ore., gallery fundraising event in his Jan. 9 letter, Exhibit disrespects our highest office. Throwing shoes at an image of our president and the American flag for money is disgusting.

If those participating in the exhibit agree with gallery co-owner Amy Godards reasoning of solidarity toward the Iraqi Journalist who threw the shoes at our President, please do as Rudisill suggested take the gallery and exhibit to Iraq or any other Mideast country. We do not need that kind of people here.

Not all Americans agree with the presidents policies, but the office and the American flag are still respected by all Americans except for a minority few like these gallery owners.

Im delighted to read that Jack Burkman is considering running for Vancouver City Council, as reported in the Jan. 11 story Jollota will call it quits after 20 years.
\
Several years ago, when Burkman was on the city council, I was upset about a proposed landfill near my home. I attended the meeting where the city council was to discuss whether to allow the landfill. Although I initially went into the meeting feeling as if the council wouldnt listen to the public, I came away with a much different impression.
\
Under Burkmans direction and guidance, the council listened to each of us testify, and was clearly collecting the facts and weighing the pros and cons of the proposal. I left the meeting knowing that a good decision would be made, and I could support it even if it meant a landfill. This was directly due to Burkman. We need Burkman back. Run, Jack, run.

Device creates a false sense of safety
\
I read the Jan. 12 editorial, Targeting DUI, concerning the benefits in using the alcohol ignition interlock as part of the probation process for DUI offenders. It is a simple matter to defeat the interlocking device by having a friend also known as a DB or designated blower start the car. I would imagine that one could use a can of compressed air to accomplish the same thing.
\
Installing those interlock devices gives society an unjustified sense of safety.

\
Correction: Joel Freudenthal is a fish and wildlife biologist working for the Yakima County Public Works and Flood Control Zone District. His employer was incorrectly listed in a photo caption on Sunday's Home Front section.
\
By DAVID LESTER
\
YAKIMA HERALD-REPUBLIC
\
County fisheries biologist Joel Freudenthal compares the urban stretch of the Yakima River to a nozzle that shoots water through the area from Selah to Union gaps.
\
Levees on both sides of the river restrict where water can flow, boosting its velocity.
\
The problem gets worse near the State Route 24 bridge where the channel is even narrower, further increasing water speed.
\
It's a recipe for spiraling repair costs in the future and potentially serious damage when the next major flood comes, Freudenthal said.
\
Just six years ago, the 1996 flood overtopped a levee south of the bridge and came within minutes of collapsing the levee near the Terrace Heights bridge, east of downtown Yakima.
\
Only quick action to reinforce the levee kept flood waters away from businesses and homes in the southeast Terrace Heights area.
\
But repairs served to further change the river channel.
\
The question for local flood-hazard officials like Freudenthal is how will the county spend money - more levee repairs or moving the structures, allowing the river to spread out and reconnect to the historic flood plain.
\
A proposal to set back the levees would have significant benefits to the county in reduced maintenance costs, reduced flood potential, and expanded habitat for fish and wildlife, said Freudenthal.
\
""If we can pull off an action that benefits the environment, reduces the flood hazard, reduces the (river's) energy and the flood heights, we think that is a good thing to do,"" he said.
\
It appears the county wouldn't have to shoulder the burden alone. A number of state and federal agencies are interested in the concept as a way to meet their own goals.
\
The ripple of interest stretches all the way to the Columbia River, where better fish habitat here would help comply with a requirement for protecting and restoring threatened and endangered Columbia River fish species.
\
A report on the effects Columbia dams have on listed species, called a biological opinion, requires three federal agencies - the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Bonneville Power Administration - to take steps to reduce harm to the fish. The corps and the bureau are responsible for the dams, and Bonneville markets the power the dams produce.
\
In addition to those agencies, the Northwest Power Planning Council also is interested in restoring flood plain habitat in urban Yakima. The council has recommended Bonneville help pay to purchase private property in the flood plain. Bonneville officials are working with the National Marine Fisheries Service to analyze what habitat lands should be purchased for permanent protection.
\
Improving fish habitat in the Yakima River - a major Columbia River tributary - would provide benefits beyond those created by changes in dam operations.
\
""If we can use the federal government requirement to do mitigation, we would be taking federal dollars to relieve pressure on our levee system,"" said John Knutson, the county's surface water manager. ""The ultimate result is less expenditures in local government.""
\
The Bureau of Reclamation already has purchased some flood plain land on the east side of the river, south of Terrace Heights.
\
But for those purchases and the levee setbacks to reach their full potential, something has to be done to remove the footprint of the State Route 24 bridge from the river flood plain several hundred feet to the east.
\
The entire Nob Hill interchange project from 18th Street to beyond the bridge, adding additional lanes of travel over the interstate to relieve daily traffic congestion, is on hold. Funding to complete the project's original design - $19 million - is included in Referendum 51, the 9-cent gas tax increase on the ballot this fall.
\
Erecting a larger bridge to span a new levee system could double the cost, to as much as $38 million.
\
State traffic engineers also are waiting for the county to define the extent of the flood plain, a move that would provide the basis to support the longer bridge. It would be another step toward relieving pressure on the levees and the existing bridge piers, which regularly must be reinforced because river flows continue to eat away at them.
\
A state-appointed committee wants the bridge project to proceed. It is one of three pilot road projects selected in the state - and the only one in Eastern Washington - to test whether the Transportation Department can more quickly obtain necessary permits so road projects can get done sooner. The key is getting all of the agencies that have a stake in the project involved early in the process.
\
One member of the committee, representing the state's building contractors, said he believes the flood plain and bridge replacement is a critical project.
\
The question, according to Willy O'Neal of Seattle, environmental manager for Associated General Contractors of Washington, is to get the ""alphabet soup"" of agencies to work together. If not, a chance to redesign the bridge might not come around again for several decades.
\
""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We need everyone to work together in a partnership to guarantee this is realized,"" O'Neal said. ""It benefits fish, people, transportation, and all wildlife habitat.""
\
""We need to be smart to figure out how to work together,"" he added.
\
The county's Knutson, who wears a number of hats including manager of the county Flood Control Zone District, has projected a cost of $13.4 million to move the levees away from the river. The rough outline, sought by the Army Corps of Engineers, estimates levee changes, some financial assistance for the bridge project, realigning county roads, and modifying the city of Yakima wastewater treatment plant discharge.
\
County commissioners created the countywide flood district several years ago to reduce the flood hazard.
\
Patricia Robinson, a Corps of Engineers planning division project manager in Seattle, said the county's proposal may be added to the plan for carrying out the Columbia River biological opinion.
\
While all the agencies believe the county's project has merit, it could take years to complete. Any funding from the three federal agencies would have to be part of their regular annual appropriations from Congress.
\
""This is a good project for ecosystem restoration,"" Robinson said. ""It takes us a few steps down the road to salmon recovery and provides benefits to the action agencies and to the local community.""

268,"OLYMPIA\OLYMPIA - After years of fighting for statewide climate policies, Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday signed into law five bills that aim to address climate change in Washington state.\But Inslee also vetoed parts of the legislation, a move that is expected to spark a lawsuit from leaders in his own party.\The slate of new laws signed Monday will put caps on carbon emissions, create a low carbon fuel standard, limit single-use plastics and reduce the amount of fluorinated gases from air conditioners.\""We are at our best today in Washington state by adopting the best climate change policies in America today,"" Inslee said.\At a bill signing at Shoreline Community College, Inslee signed two of the most controversial, and likely most impactful, pieces of climate legislation this session: a low carbon fuel standard and a ""cap-and-trade"" policy.\Both policies had a line that connected the implementation of the proposals to a 5-cent gas tax increase - a key compromise reached by legislators.\The line was an attempt from Democrats to strike a bargain on decreasing carbon while increasing funding for new roads, highways and other transportation projects.\Inslee vetoed the line in both policies, angering Democratic leadership in the Legislature who said it was the product of weeks of negotiation among lawmakers.\In a veto message, Inslee said the delayed effective date of the policies ""unnecessarily hinders our state's ability to combat climate change, one of the greatest challenges facing our state and the world today.""\Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane, said the vetoes ""undermine the legislative compromises that allowed these bills to reach the governor's desk in the first place.""\He said he agreed to support those compromises in order to pass those bills.\""I am concerned that undoing good faith negotiations will severely hurt our ability to reach agreement on important policies in the future,"" Billig said in a statement.\Billig joined House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, in calling for court action against the veto in the low carbon fuel standard bill, which they say overstepped his power as noted in the state Constitution.\The state Constitution allows for a governor to veto sections of a bill while signing the rest into law, but Inslee vetoed a specific provision.\The Legislature took Inslee to court in 2019 after he vetoed sentences in certain areas of the transportation budget. A Thurston County Superior Court judge invalidated those vetoes.\""He lost in court then,"" Billig said. ""He will lose again.""\Jinkins said in a statement the courts have consistently held that the Legislature is responsible for drafting laws and the executive branch is responsible for implementing them.\Braun called Inslee's subsection veto ""illegal.""\""That alone says a lot about why our political system has checks and balances on one-person rule,"" he said in a statement.\In a similar move last week, Inslee vetoed a section of a bill that would have required all new cars in the state to be electric beginning in 2030. That part of the bill was contingent on a road user fee for most vehicles.\In a veto message, Inslee said the goal of 100% electric vehicles is ""too important to tie to the implementation of a separate policy like the road usage charge.""\Inslee said a transportation revenue package still will get done, but he does not want to delay the implementation of the climate policies to do so.\Sponsor of the low carbon fuels standard Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, said the vetoes do not change the urgency of the Legislature to pass a transportation package. He agreed that the climate policies should go into effect as soon as possible, and he did not think tying the policies to a transportation package would have delayed the implementation.\The Legislature would have likely passed a new transportation package before the 2023 start date anyway, Fitzgibbon told The Spokesman-Review.\""In the end I don't think it would've introduced delay, but it would've introduced uncertainty,"" he said. ""I'm happy to see some of that uncertainty removed.""\Fitzgibbon said he does not agree with the decision to go to court over the issue. While the vetoes add some new elements, he still called Monday a ""historic day"" for the state's fight against climate change.\Under the new laws, fuel companies must start reducing their emissions a little each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20% below 2017 levels by 2038. Fuel companies can clean up their fuels by producing biofuels or mixed fuels. If they can't, they would be required to purchase ""credits"" to make up for emissions that go above the allowed amount.\Washington follows California and Oregon as the last of the West Coast states to implement a clean-fuel standard.\The cap-and-trade plan puts a cap on carbon pollution and greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2023. The largest polluters in the state would need to either clean up their work to meet the cap or purchase allowances from the state. The state would receive the revenue from those allowances.\Washington joins California with having a cap-and-trade plan.\In a statement from Megan Baldino, head of corporate communications at BP, the oil and gas company applauded Inslee for signing the bill as it could put the state on a path to net zero emissions by 2050.\""BP's ambition is to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get to net zero,"" the statement read. ""We look forward to working with state agencies as they develop rules to implement this program and help make our shared ambition a reality.""\Inslee also signed bills that would limit single-use plastics by restaurants. By mid-2023, foam containers made of a type of plastic known as expanded polystyrene, such as the ""clam shell"" takeout boxes will be banned and recyclable materials will be encouraged.\He also signed a bill that limits the amount of fluorinated gases. It authorizes the Department of Ecology to create a threshold for the amount of fluorinated gases used in new air conditioning and stationary refrigerants as well as establishes a recycling program for used air conditioners and refrigerants.\Inslee also signed a bill that would implement recommendations of the Environmental Justice Task Force, which would require an environmental justice analysis on all decision making and an equal distribution of environmental investments statewide. The goal of the legislation is to help communities who disproportionately experience the effects of a worsening environment, such as people of color and low-income communities.\MEMO: Laurel Demkovich can be reached at (509) 416-6260 or at laureld@spokesman.com\CREDIT: Laurel Demkovich The Spokesman-Review"
269," STATE LEGISLATURE\ Even in a place famous for its clouds and rain, last January was unusually bleak in Olympia.\ State lawmakers faced a $1.8 billion budget shortfall. They knew they would wrangle for months over a big hike in transportation taxes. And uncertainty loomed over Gov. Christine Gregoire's 129- vote victory over Republican Dino Rossi. When Gregoire gave her inaugural speech, many GOP lawmakers sat stone-faced, refusing to acknowledge her.\ A year later, it's still rainy, but the mood is very different.\ To many lawmakers' surprise, voters backed the gas tax increase. And though Republican legislators are still often unhappy with Gregoire, they acknowledge that she's the governor.\ On the money front, the state now has a very different problem: too much cash. After years of struggling to patch together budgets, economic growth has left lawmakers with a $1.4 billion surplus. Gregoire and top lawmakers are calling for restraint. They say most of the money should go into a rainy-day fund to pay the bills next year. Instead of cuts, leaders' biggest challenge this year will be keeping both foes and friends away from that surplus money.\ ""It's an election year and there's a billion dollars on the table,"" said Rep. Toby Nixon, R-Kirkland. ""But if we start passing it out, where does it stop?""\ This is the second year in a row of Democrats' political trifecta: They control the House, the Senate and the governor's office. They used their power last year to put money into schools, educators' salaries, health care and higher education. They passed environmentalist-backed bills setting ""green building"" standards for new public buildings, as well as a controversial law requiring tough new auto emissions standards here.\ This year, the agenda will be less ambitious. It's only a short 60-day session, unlike last year's 105 days.\ ""It's really a session to tweak and continue on the same path,"" said Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown, D-Spokane.\ Republicans - outnumbered 55-43 in the House and 26-23 in the Senate - say they'll try to win some victories by building ""philosophical majorities"" with conservative Democrats. Among the GOP's priorities: reducing regulations for business, property owners and health insurers; repealing the state's estate tax; and strengthening the state spending limit.\ ""The system is inherently built to grow,"" Senate Minority Leader Mike Hewitt, R-Walla Walla, said of the spending cap. ""Something has to be there to keep us in check.""\ Here are some of the major topics this session:\ Sex offenders: Spurred largely by last year's attack on the Groene family, allegedly by convicted sex offender Joseph Duncan, lawmakers in both parties want to toughen sex offender laws. Among the proposals: longer sentences, harsher penalties for sex offenders who fail to register with authorities, renewing ""community protection zone"" laws for schools and day cares, and electronic monitoring of some released sex offenders, perhaps for life.\ ""We know that Level 3 sex offenders reoffend,"" said House Minority Leader Richard DeBolt, R-Chehalis.\ The tough-to-mention truth, however, particularly in an election year, is that these things all cost money. (A prison bed costs about $27,000 a year, according to Hewitt.) Also, some prosecutors and victims' groups say, the harsher the penalties, the harder it will be to get people to testify against abusive family or friends. Changes in the law, Brown said, should be done ""with an eye not on what is politically popular and works on the talk-radio circuit, but with what works.""\ Energy: Eager to score points with both environmentalists and farmers, lawmakers in both parties are pushing changes to encourage homegrown fuels like biodiesel and ethanol. Democrats also want to require all diesel fuel in the state to include 2 percent biodiesel - a fuel made from vegetable oil. The percentage would rise to 20 percent by 2020.\ ""We want to move (alternative fuels) from the fringe to the mainstream,"" said Sen. Erik Poulsen, D-West Seattle.\ Gregoire and many lawmakers are also calling for more money to help low-income people pay their heating bills this winter.\ ""People need help right away,"" said Sen. Bob Morton, R-Orient. ""Like now.""\ Budget: Gregoire's proposed $500 million in new spending includes a $31 million raise for teachers and some school staff, more child abuse caseworkers, more state troopers, and $42 million to start cleaning up Puget Sound. She's also supporting a new $63 million life sciences building at Washington State University, paid for with interest off its timber and land-lease profits.\ In theory, most lawmakers seem to agree with Gregoire's call for fiscal restraint. But one-on-one, everyone seems to have at least one modest proposal. And there are 147 lawmakers.\ ""We're all going to ask for something,"" said Sen. Darlene Fairley, D-Seattle.\ Environment: Environmental groups and lawmakers want to build on last year's successes in Olympia with several proposals: cleanup dollars for Puget Sound and perhaps the Spokane River; a free drop- off system for old computers, TVs and other electronic waste, paid for by manufacturers; a ban on some toxic flame retardants; and more alternative fuel production.\ Gay rights: For more than a decade, liberal lawmakers have been trying to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in housing, employment and financial matters. (Such a law already exists for race, religion, sex and other categories.) This has repeatedly passed the House overwhelmingly, but last year died - by a single vote - in the Senate. Brown plans to try again.\ Not directly related, but overshadowing this debate, is a pending court ruling on the state's ban on same-sex marriage. The state Supreme Court decision could come at any time.\ WASL: With the high school class of 2008 required to pass the Washington Assessment of Student Learning to graduate, state lawmakers are getting nervous. Gregoire has proposed spending $38 million to help struggling students, and lawmakers are considering alternative testing for some students. Legislative leaders and Gregoire, however, say they don't want to solve the problem by watering down the test.\ Taxes and fees: Republicans want to do away with the state's estate tax, which they say breaks up family-owned businesses. But Democrats aren't likely to go along, since losing the tax means losing $100 million a year.\ Both sides, however, are discussing doing away with the unpopular ""day use fees"" that state parks now charge.\ Richard Roesler can be reached at (360) 664-2598 or by e-mail at richr@spokanenews.net.\ Credit: Spokane"

In what leaders are calling a major milestone, the Federal Transit Administration gave the go-ahead to plans for the Columbia River Crossing.
\
The federal nod means CRC leaders can go after funding, begin acquiring rights of way and start construction, which is set for late 2013.
\
But the formal Record of Decision doesnt come with a check to pay the expected $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion price tag. There is still lobbying of both Oregon and Washington legislatures and the federal government for funding, along with setting toll rates far from a done deal.
\
The U.S. Department of Transportation issues numerous records of decision without comment. But the department took the unusual step of releasing a statement on the CRC decision, and called the project which includes five miles of interchange improvements and replacing the bridges on Interstate 5, a bike and pedestrian deck and the extension of light rail from Portland into downtown Vancouver a long-term, comprehensive solution to address safety and congestion problems.
\
This project is a great example of why we need to strengthen our infrastructure. The old facility is outdated and it no longer meets the needs of the traveling public or commerce in the region, federal Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. It is one more instance of why the Obama administration is focusing on key transportation investments to create jobs, strengthen the economy, and provide travelers with affordable, efficient options for reaching their destinations.
\
The decision was also hailed by the governors on both sides of the Columbia River, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and local elected officials.
\
Weve been working really hard to get to this point, to get to a point where our federal partners ... confirm and validate all the work weve done in the past six years, CRC Director Nancy Boyd said.
\
Up next will be buying rights of way, particularly in the areas where the bridge will touch down, she said. Also staff members will begin having very hands-on conversations with folks thinking about how were going to sequence construction, as well as having serious discussions on both sides of the river about the funding needs to get the project under construction.
\
Challenges expected
\
The decision also rings the starting bell for critics to file lawsuits challenging the environmental work used to justify the project.
\
Vancouver business owner and staunch anti-CRC advocate David Madore said Wednesday that he plans to file a suit. He said the CRC has made a mockery of the National Environmental Policy Act.
\
Of course we will turn on the lights and expose the corruption, waste and betrayal of the public trust, Madore wrote in an email. Yes, we will fight this and work to restore sanity to our local government.
\
In Portland, several groups, including the Coalition for a Livable Future and the Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods, are also likely to use litigation to fight the crossing. Potential pollution in north Portland from added lanes, or whether enough alternatives of the current plans were studied, are possible points critics could make.
\
Wednesdays announcement didnt come as a surprise to David Sweet, a board member on Portlands Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods. But hes not convinced that the federal endorsement makes the CRC any more likely to be built.
\
It certainly doesnt mean that theres federal funding available, or state funding from either Oregon or Washington, Sweet said.
\
His was among a group of Oregon neighborhood and business organizations that jointly filed a legal challenge to the CRC in August. The groups took issue with a Land Use Final Order that Metro used to give its green light to the project, arguing the law shouldnt apply to something as big as the CRC.
\
Oregons Land Use Board of Appeals mostly shot down that argument in October. But the groups appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court, and the case is still pending. The court heard oral arguments this week.
\
Members planned to discuss possible litigation at a meeting Wednesday night.
\
The coalition still holds major concerns about the CRCs potential impact on health, the environment and traffic congestion a sentiment shared by a lot of residents, said executive director Paige Coleman. Wednesdays announcement doesnt change that, Sweet said.
\
We still believe that its a deeply flawed and inadequate document, and a deeply flawed project, Sweet said, later adding: I dont think the project is likely at all to be built.
\
CRCs Boyd said she expects lawsuits with a project of this scale.
\
This is a very major project, and big projects often end up being involved in these sorts of suits, she said. This is one of those points that we reach that they can come back and have opportunity for that.
\
Governors pleased
\
Impending court cases didnt dampen the enthusiasm of local and national politicians who support the project, however.
\
In a joint statement with Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, Gov. Chris Gregoire stressed the economic benefits of the project.
\
This is the culmination of years of hard work, thousands of hours of public input and reams of detailed and extensive technical analysis, Gregoire said. Businesses and jobs in Washington, Oregon and all along the West Coast depend on this economic corridor. By replacing the aging bridge over the Columbia River, we are strengthening our states competitiveness and laying a stronger foundation for a better economy. This decision moves us closer to fixing a significant economic bottleneck and getting people back to work.
\
The statement from the federal government also included enthusiastic comments from the administrators of both the federal highway and transit administrations.
\
Locally, Clark County Commissioner Steve Stuart also said he was pleased to hear of the federal support for the CRC, something he expected.
\
Another key milestone has been reached, and it has taken a lot of work to get this far, but there are still many miles to walk before we start construction, Stuart said. There are serious questions to be asked of our citizens regarding light rail, and there are many unanswered questions regarding state and federal funding of the project.
\
Rep. Jim Moeller, D-Vancouver, said finding Washington states share of the money to fund the CRC may come in the form of a transportation package put to voters for approval similar to recent gas tax packages that have paid for other projects across the state.
\
In the midst of a special session defined by budget woes, Moeller said the Washington Legislature clearly doesnt have the money to back the project now. The issue may come to lawmakers in earnest during the regular 2013 session, he said.
\
Moeller said hed like to see the process move ahead. The need for new bridges, roads and other infrastructure is still pressing, he said.
\
Those things dont stop, Moeller said. They build our economy.
\
The Portland Business Alliance also expressed its satisfaction with the federal decision, saying members support the increased freight mobility the construction will bring and that it was tremendous news.
\
Public discussions related to the bottlenecks at the I-5 Bridge across the Columbia River at Vancouver began in 1999 and have been nearly continuous since then. The CRC project formally entered the required decision-making process under the National Environmental Policy Act in 2005. One locally preferred alternative was selected in 2008 by the sponsoring agencies. A final environmental impact statement on that locally preferred alternative was released in September 2011.

A proposal for car industry
\
To the editor -- Instead of giving the automakers $25 billion, I suggest investing the money to buy back all cars that get less than 20 to 25 miles a gallon. If you divide $25 billion by $5,000 ,we could take 5 million cars off the road. Many of these vehicles could be purchased for a few hundred dollars.
\
The Big Three could put people to work disassembling and properly recycling all the parts. Or, we could set up recycling centers in each state, creating eco-friendly jobs. We could clean up the countryside by getting rid of these inefficient relics, we would lower our dependency on foreign oil and decrease greenhouse gasses. Putting billions into the hands of consumers would help our economy.
\
Instead of a bailout, I say we should invest $50 billion and take 10 million cars off the road. By taking passenger cars off the road, the car industry would have a very robust market for years. To pay for this, we should raise the gas tax at least 50 cents a gallon to pay for this sensible idea. We must think boldly for the long-term benefits to our economy and environment.
\
The auto makers are taking their plan back to Washington, D.C., on Dec. 2 . Time is of the essence. Contact all representatives.

A worthy endorsement
\
To the editor -- Joan Christopherson's Nov. 11 letter rails against the Yakima Herald-Republic's endorsement of Barack Obama. She cites Obama's lack of experience, which is a decidedly shallow approach because George Bush and his yes men, such as John McCain, have ample experience, and what good came of it? A $9 trillion national deficit, two unfounded, unjustified wars and a failing economy! Hurray for experience!
\
Experience takes a back seat to moral correctness and strength of character. I think Obama has demonstrated that quite dramatically during his campaign. A super rock star couldn't have drawn crowds so large. Those supporting McCain are in the minority, and put there by a member of a minority, and I see a certain poetic justice in that. What perplexes me is how many votes McCain got. Were these voters anti-black, or just prisoners of a Republican mind-set? Maybe both.
\
People weren't paying attention if they couldn't grasp Obama's empathy for the average American or couldn't recognize his superior intellect and self-composure under fire.
\
I applaud the Herald-Republic for being a liberal beacon of light in a region that is peopled by a few who should spend less time flag-kissing and more time soul-searching.

Digester is a good idea
\
To the editor -- Re: The Nov. 23 article, ""Cow power -- Digester makes dairy man a believer."" Good for the DeRuyter & Sons Dairy for investing in their digester. The first one that I ever saw was in Tillamook, Ore., about 15 years ago. A cooperative of dairies went together and would haul their liquid manure to a central location. The digester had a huge covered tank and there was no smell nor flies.
\
If all large dairies and feedlots would pave the feeding and milking areas, funneling the liquid effluent down to the digester, then there would be no groundwater contamination. The dairies could profit from the electricity produced, plus the cellulose left for peat moss to add to the soil.
\
Of course, the digester itself is very expensive and would take a large loan and would be several years before it would be profitable. It's a long-term business decision. Kudos to the DeRuyters and anyone else who would clean up their operation and do it with documented workers.
\
I know about dairies and feedlots because I owned a feedlot for my own weaner calves, which numbered about 250 head. And if there is no digester, there is smell.

Men get breast cancer, too
\
To the editor -- I am writing on a topic that is probably little known among most men. But, since our Baby Boomers are getting to retirement age, I think it is something that should be brought to their attention. I am talking about male breast cancer.
\
Most men don't even know that such a thing is possible. But our Baby Boomers, men in the 60- to 70-year range, are the ones who are most susceptible. Even though male breast cancer is 100 times less common than female cancer, men should at least be aware enough to do a self-check. They should also be informed enough to go to their doctor immediately if they notice any lumps or suspicious changes in their breasts.
\
My husband is a survivor of male breast cancer and would like to encourage all men to do this simple check periodically. He is forming a male breast cancer support group and if anyone is interested or would just like to talk to him, they can contact Roger Goff through Wellness House here in Yakima. The number is 575-6686.
\
Please, check often and stay well.

Thanks for a job well-done
\
To the editor -- As a daily subscriber to the Yakima Herald-Republic, I want to express my appreciation and admiration to Sarah Jenkins for the fine work she has done as editor. After she arrived at the Herald-Republic, I watched as the newspaper printed more professionally written articles, covered more relevant news, added more investigative pieces and adopted a more user-friendly format.
\
Under her watch, the Herald-Republic served the community very well by focusing on its issues in an inclusive manner. News that pertained to any group in the Valley was featured and objectively reported. Young people were introduced to the profession of journalism by means of the Unleashed team. Other young people who read Unleashed learned about the value of a newspaper. There also was a significant increase in the number of letters from readers that were printed, enabling us to voice our opinions and concerns.
\
Thank you, Sarah Jenkins, for a job done with excellence. I am certain you will thrive on the challenges that lie ahead in Kansas.

Is this the time for levies?
\
To the editor -- The following facts appear to be undisputed:
\
1. We are in the midst of the largest economic slump since the Great Depression (Banks going broke; the Big Three on the verge of bankruptcy; the housing industry in turmoil; unemployment skyrocketing; etc., etc., etc.)
\
2. The state of Washington has a huge deficit and monies that local municipalities have relied upon are drying up;
\
3. City of Yakima revenue is down and expenses are up; and
\
4. According to at least one source, the city of Yakima is ranked 302 out of 385 individual cities for crime rate in 2007.
\
With all of the above in mind, though, the city of Yakima continues to pursue the $34 million Aquatic Center and an Emergency Services levy that will tax the citizens another $1.3 million a year. Does anyone else see anything wrong with this picture?

"
272," The Idaho Spokesman-Review asked some of its readers to watch Sunday night's televised debate and e-mail their comments directly following the broadcast. Here are some of their impressions on the debate:\ I wish I had another choice. Butch Otter obviously is going to do a ""Chenoweth"" and make us look like fools. Linda Pall doesn't seem to have a good grasp of what Congress is about. Since I don't have a third choice, I probably will vote for Pall because I think I will have access to her while I know I will not have access to Otter. Unfortunately, given 1st District history, Otter will go to Congress. Too bad, we lose again. - Ann Souza, Cocolalla\ I'm angry Libertarian candidate Ron Wittig and Reform candidate Kevin Hambsch weren't allowed in the debate. Linda Pall supports the party line with big government and using my tax dollars to help out retirees (who have those castles on the waterfront) in the form of prescription drug benefits. Butch Otter has many Libertarian ideals (small government and power to the states) but comes short when it comes to really cutting back the federal government. - Kevin Jorgensen, Spirit Lake.\ Each candidate clearly represents their party's theme. Butch Otter's demeanor is arrogant, short and condescending. Linda Pall's presence is relaxed, and she has a desire to answer the questions. Otter's response to the question of education funding represents his overall view of federal involvement. Pall's answer to the question of relaxing the federal portion of the gas tax basically explains her general position on all items. My grades for the candidates are: Otter: technical expertise, B; preparedness, B; presence, D. Linda Pall: technical expertise, A; preparedness, A; presence, C+. (By the way, I've been a Republican since 1968, although at times I've been reluctant to admit it.) - George Rekow, Post Falls\ I thought Butch Otter was irascible, arrogant and either poorly prepared or informed. He seemed to view the reporter's questions as presumptuous intrusions, rather than opportunities to clarify political beliefs. He seemed truly stumped by the final question. Linda Pall was just slightly otherworldly, like someone in a grainy video of an old Equal Rights Amendment rally. Her responses to the questions sounded like canned Democratic National Committee talking points. I will vote for Otter based upon the substance of his answers. He also seemed to have a firm understanding of how to be Idaho's representative, not just a functionary of a national political party. And of course there are their teeth. - Paul Matthews, Rathdrum.\ I have decided to be undecided at this point. Responses that I found most swaying for Linda Pall: Her view of privatization of Social Security creating ""winners and losers."" I also liked her saying she is a hard worker. Responses I liked from Butch Otter: Blaming media for Idaho's reputation as racist. I agree with his question: ""Are there private property rights or not?"" Also, his wanting to be more accountable to the people in Idaho than to federal government regarding schools. I appreciated the debate in that it was better than nothing - but not much. - Mary Denise Taylor, Coeur d'Alene.\ Linda Pall spent so much time and effort running down Butch Otter that it's difficult to understand her posture on issues. I'm voting for Butch. - Teresa Martinson, Coeur d'Alene.\ It's obvious it's the ""same old, same old."" Butch Otter has a ""laissez faire"" attitude and for him the less government and the least taxes the better. He isn't for people of Idaho; he is for big business as he has been in his capacity as lieutenant governor. While Linda Pall had definite ideas (e.g., improve prescription drug benefits under Medicare), as to what she would do if elected to Congress, her game plan was weak. At least Pall does recognize the need to ""get things done."" On this premise I will vote for her. Pall seems to recognize the immediate issues of the high cost of prescription drugs, racism in Idaho, violence against women and poor education for Idaho. - Beth Allen, Sandpoint.\ I was impressed by both candidates. I think they gave reasonably direct answers. In the past, there have been some candidates who left me with the feeling I had no real choice; but after hearing this debate, I believe that no matter which candidate wins, the 1st District will have representation willing to listen to our needs, that the people will be heard. - Peggy Faust, Hayden.\ After examining the candidates' positions over the past few weeks and watching them debate, I have decided to vote for Linda Pall. She understands that racial diversity is necessary and inevitable. She understands Idaho is special, that we have some of the last pristine wild areas left in the country and that this distinction should not be sold off and fragmented. I fear that if Butch Otter were elected, Idaho's image of being backwards would remain. I fear that lower- income people would bear the brunt of subsidizing corporate welfare. I fear that the environment would be treated as a commodity that can be exploited without regard to the consequences. There are other candidates running for this position, but of these two, I feel Pall would be the best choice - Garrett Clevenger, Moscow.\ As a general rule, I detest political debates and wasn't pleased that as an Idaho voter, I was obliged to tune in. Butch Otter came across as a fairly typical politician, but, surprisingly, with a quiet voice. I feel he was uncertain whether or not he really wanted to win this election. In his summing up, he wasn't sure just what he wanted to say and by the time the summation was over, you weren't quite sure just what he did say. Linda Pall had some very interesting things to say. She also debated calmly and with good humor. Her issues, such as where any surplus monies should go, (toward paying on the national debt,) her strong statements about not touching the Social Security funds, and Medicare helping with prescription drugs covered many bases people are concerned about. Her summing up was tops, and her efforts made you feel this is a lady of integrity. - Phyllis Burrows, Hayden.\ I thought it was interesting that Butch Otter had little to say about the Violence Against Women Act that Helen Chenoweth-Hage voted against. He gave me the impression that the matter wasn't important to him. On prescription drug legislation, Linda Pall has the correct solution. This problem should be carried by Medicare, not by some insurance companies. It was interesting that Otter admitted that he has said in the past that Social Security is a failure. This sounds like Newt Gingrich six years ago, when the Republicans had their ""Contract with America"" after getting control of Congress. This is a huge turn-off for the millions of folks who are receiving Social Security, and depend on their monthly check to get by. Otter also said he didn't think there was a problem with hate crimes in Idaho. I guess he doesn't come up to the Panhandle very often. - Tom Akren, Post Falls.\ Butch Otter suggested he would bring unity to Congress, but when asked about his similarity with Helen Chenoweth-Hage's philosophy he said he was much like her. Linda Pall suggested that Chenoweth-Hage was a minority who voted against the Violence Against Women Act (which was just funded in Congress) and Otter didn't back down. Linda Pall suggested that the Bush plan for Social Security would create winners and losers who don't invest wisely, and asked who would bail them out if that happened. Otter had no response. Overall, this was not a very different debate on issues, except when Pall said she'd go to Congress and do all that she could to change the image of Idaho as a bigoted, racist state. And she is interested in ""We the People"" in Idaho, and has the energy to work toward changing that image so you will always be proud that you elected her to Congress. - Joanne Peters, Kellogg."

OLYMPIA - State lawmakers convene Monday for a 60-day session in a political climate dramatically different from the one they faced 12 months ago.
\
Then: Republicans, still smarting from Dino Rossi's loss to Christine Gregoire by just 129 votes in the 2004 governor's race, weren't ready to put the election behind them. The uncertainty over the outcome Gregoire was declared the winner on Dec. 23 left the new governor without detailed proposals at the beginning of her administration. Acrimony clouded the political process for weeks.
\
Now: Gov. Gregoire has grabbed the reins of state and laid out a specific budget and agenda for lawmakers to accept or reject.
\
Then: Lawmakers faced an expected $1.8 billion shortfall by the end of the two-year budget cycle.
\
Now: The state expects a $1.4 billion windfall by June 30, 2007, as state coffers continue to swell with revenue generated by Washington's housing boom.
\
Then: The state faced a huge transportation project backlog, with money to pay for only a small portion.
\
Now: To nearly everyone's surprise, voters defeated a measure to repeal the 2005 Legislature's 9.5-cent state gas tax increase. That means $8.5 billion in state money will be funneled to transportation projects over the next 16 years, including $244 million for 13 projects in Clark County.
\
Because 2006 is an election year, seasoned Olympia watchers predict a short, efficient session that will give incumbents facing campaigns something to brag about.
\
Democrats control the House, the Senate and the governor's office. That means Republican leaders will have an uphill battle advancing their key issues, including restoring state tax and spending limits, repealing the estate tax, and reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses.
\
Though GOP leaders are sniping at Gregoire's plan to spend $500 million of the $1.4 billion revenue windfall in her 2006 supplemental budget, both parties agree on the need to keep a healthy reserve to tide the state through leaner days ahead.
\
""We agree to keep a large amount in reserve, but we need to state what the reserves are for,"" said House Speaker Frank Chopp, a Seattle Democrat.
\
At a legislative preview sponsored by The Associated Press last Tuesday, Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate found much else to agree on, from guaranteeing every child health insurance to promoting biodiesel as a way to make Washington more energy-self-sufficient.
\
With mounting energy costs, the time is right to help Washington farmers grow the crops used to manufacture biodiesel and to guarantee a market for the product, legislators agreed.
\
""I think this will be the feel-good hit of the legislative session,"" said Sen. Erik Poulsen, D-Seattle, chairman of the Water, Energy and Environment Committee.
\
Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown, a Spokane Democrat, predicted the short 2006 session will continue the productive record of the 2005 session, with a focus on funding public school class size reductions and teacher pay increases already approved by voters, whittling away at the number of children who lack health insurance, and paying down the state's unfunded pension obligation.
\
""You will hear from some people that we need to cut taxes,"" Brown said. ""I think that would be the wrong approach. If we did that, it would set us up for spending cuts or tax increases two or four years down the road.""
\
Chopp said House Democrats will focus on investing in early learning, helping students pass the Washington Assessment of Student Learning, and assisting victims of the state's hot housing market who can't find affordable places to live.
\
House Republican leader Richard DeBolt of Chehalis struck a darker note, saying lawmakers should begin the session by cracking down on violent sexual predators with stiffer prison sentences and registration requirements. Washington should lead the nation in keeping its children safe, DeBolt said.
\
The GOP has made the issue a top priority. Republican Attorney General Rob McKenna plans to introduce legislation to impose stricter registration rules on convicted sex offenders. And Sen. Don Benton, R-Vancouver, vowed last week to introduce a version of Florida's ""Jessica's Law"" targeting sex offenders on the first day of the session.
\
But Senate leader Brown cautioned that keeping track of violent sex offenders is more complicated than saying ""We're going to lock them up."" Tight budgets require law enforcement agencies to make choices, she said, and perpetrators sometimes get off the hook.
\
Sen. Mike Hewitt, a Walla Walla Republican newly appointed Senate minority leader, called for restoring limits on state spending. ""The system is inherently built to grow,"" he said. ""Something has to be done to keep it in check.""
\
He noted that in 2005, the Legislature had 7 percent more revenue to work with than in the previous budget cycle but increased spending by 12 percent and had to raise taxes by $500 million to make up the difference. The two biggest drivers of increased spending, he noted, are health care costs and the pension system for state employees.
\
But Brown said the current cap on state spending, which limits its growth to the 10-year average of personal income growth in the state, is more effective than the previous spending limit, which lawmakers could adjust every year.
\
""This will assure that government doesn't grow faster than the private economy,"" she said.
\
Legislators from Southwest Washington best positioned to help shape the outcome of the 2006 session include Sen. Joe Zarelli, R- Ridgefield, whose role as minority leader of the Senate Ways and Means Committee gives him influence on both spending and taxation issues, and Rep. Bill Fromhold, D-Vancouver, whose expertise on education and pension issues makes him a valuable inside player.
\
However, few if any of Clark County's or Vancouver's legislative priorities are likely to become law in 2006.
\
The Legislature is unlikely to give local governments the power to use tax increment financing to encourage development, a top priority for the business community and the city of Vancouver.
\
At Tuesday's session, Brown agreed that new incentives are needed. ""We don't have all the same tools in our economic development toolbox that other states do,"" she said. But Chopp called tax increment financing ""a sort of arcane tool"" that has constitutional problems.
\
Both pointed to the Strategic Economic Development Trust Fund as something the 2005 Legislature created to help local governments court new development. The fund will be made up of unclaimed lottery winnings, which the governor's office will distribute to local communities to help fund economic growth.
\
Changes in the Growth Management Act sought by Clark County are not a front-burner issue, and the governor has put off proposing major changes in the state land use law until 2007.
\
The governor did not include money to finish the Washington State Patrol's Vancouver crime lab in her capital budget.
\
And the issue of ""sales tax streamlining,"" which would create a more equitable distribution of sales tax revenue from sales made over the Internet in Washington, is far too complicated for lawmakers to wade into in a 60-day session.

Other Legislative Issues
\
* Gay rights: A bill making it illegal to discriminate against gays in housing and jobs failed by one vote in 2005. Sen. Lisa Brown, D- Spokane, said Democrats will try again. Sen. Mike Hewitt, R-Walla Walla, said the issue is ""very difficult"" for some Republicans and owners of small businesses.
\
* Gay marriage: A ruling from the Washington Supreme Court on the constitutionality of the state's Defense of Marriage Act could come during the session, putting the question of gay marriage front and center on the legislative agenda. If the court rules that the law is unconstitutional, Brown said, ""there will be those who propose a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman."" She doesn't think there is legislative support for that, or for legalizing same-sex marriage.
\
* WASL: There's strong concurrence that the state should stick with requiring students in the class of 2008 to pass all three sections of the WASL before they can graduate from high school, and should give struggling students remedial help.
\
""I don't see us backing away from WASL,"" Brown said. But she added, ""We don't want education reform to be just about the WASL. Not all students test well. They may need alternative ways to demonstrate competency.""
\
* Public defense: The Washington State Office of Public Defense wants $27 million to make sure the state's legal system meets the constitutional requirement to provide attorneys for the poor. A 2002 national study ranked Washington 44th among the states in funding for public defense.

More jobs, less housing
\
Wendy Garrett is absolutely right in her Oct. 1 letter, ""Growth can be smart."" We need more jobs and less housing. We need a balance. This means our leaders have to stop playing nice and start playing cutthroat about the deadly serious business of recruiting businesses. Why hasn't every last business in Portland moved to Clark County? Our leaders should act like they are on a feeding frenzy at the incompetence of Oregon and Portland when it comes to business. They should be like tigers going in for the helpless prey.
\
This really is about having a sustainable community with great opportunity for our kids and their kids and generations beyond. To stay here and live as high a dream as they want.
\
It means living here not just because it is beautiful and you can get more house for the money than in California, but because you can actually get a good college education and a good paying job. Let's change this by putting our eggs in education and being very competitive in the deadly serious game of business recruitment.

Views are inflammatory
\
Jock Demme's Oct. 1 letter, ""Protest on foreign turf,"" is rife with logical fallacy. He makes personal attacks, e.g. Cindy Sheehan is shameless and the protesters were ""flotsam and jetsam."" He uses tautology, e.g. it's safe to protest against war in this country. And, I'd guess that he's hypocritical to suggest protesting on foreign soil as people like Demme are the same ones who burned Dixie Chick albums when they criticized President Bush while they were in England (I believe they would call it seditious to criticize America when on foreign soil).
\
But the real problem is The Columbian's policy of printing emotional and inflammatory letters instead of better letters which are based on some perceptible reason. Balance is not printing inane letters to make up for other, more thoughtful letters that are published. Balance is providing opposing views. The key being that the reasoning of opposing sides of an issue are presented. Printing letters like Demme's lowers the quality of public debate and serves no one and no institution, particularly The Columbian.

Agenda seems racist
\
Ed Lynch and some members of the American Land Rights Association act like racists. Take literature from Lynch's group Citizens Against Reservation Shopping or from ALRA and replace the word ""Indian"" with African, Hispanic, Catholic, Baptist, or any other ethnic or religious group. See what kind of reaction it gets.
\
When you refer to people who differ from yourself ethnically or religiously, as ""you people"" it is a definite racist remark making yourself secular from the other. The Sept. 22 story, ""Map fuels debate between anti-casino group, Cowlitz,"" reported that Lynch told David Barnett, spokesman for the Cowlitz Tribe, that he was spending his money to ""keep you people or your people where they belong."" He is admittedly funding segregation.
\
Lynch bases his ""facts"" on a map written by white settlers for white settlers. It is logical that a map from the 1800s may be slightly inaccurate on the location of Native lands, considering the maps weren't made for the Natives' benefit and Natives tended to move frequently.
\
Lynch's ancestors were probably not native of this area. Using his own logic, what is he doing here? I'm sure the Cowlitz ancestors were a lot closer to Exit 16 than Lynch's.
\
The attitudes these two groups, CARS and ALRA, suggest neither tolerance nor progress.

Allow ESA reform
\
So Congressman Brian Baird, D-Wash., thinks the proposed refinements to the Endangered Species Act are fiscally unsound. This tells me a great deal about him. It tells me he thinks politicians and others in power know better than we citizens what is good for us. It tells me he thinks it is OK for bureaucrats to, without compensation, force a homeowner to set aside some or all of their property to supposedly protect endangered species. My question for him is: If, as a society, we have decided it is necessary to protect these species, shouldn't all of us foot the bill? Is it fair to not compensate those whom we forcefully restrict the way they make use of their land? Do citizens own their land or does the government?

Vote for improvements
\
We citizens of east Vancouver can make a giant leap forward in our quest for more library space. The bond measure on the Nov. 18 ballot will improve three Fort Vancouver Regional Library facilities. However, the one we've been waiting for is a 25,000- square-foot branch that would give us more space for books, programs, and computers for patrons of all ages.
\
The tiny Cascade Park Library has clearly been outgrown by the fast-growing population on the east side. A larger building to be located adjacent to the Firstenburg Community Center will give us a modern library next to recreational and fitness services a wonderful destination for all.
\
Please decide to vote ""yes"" to create the capital library facilities district and ""yes"" to approve of the bond measure. It's time for east Vancouver to catch up in the area of public places and spaces.

Restaurant deterred
\
People who want to drink are going to drink whether we have a bar and grill here in Battle Ground or not. Why make a legitimate restaurant such as Lloyd's Grill, which we so desperately need in Battle Ground, be deterred or driven away because the owner wants a liquor license? There are plenty of drunk drivers who drive by schools all the time we just don't know who they are.
\
There are schools in Vancouver with nearby restaurants that serve liquor and yet the children don't seem to be in harm's way. By the time people go to have a drink the children will be away from the school. Accidents happen all the time. I see the crosses on the roadway of people who have died in car accidents.

I am sorry that we might not be getting a much-needed restaurant in Battle Ground.

Educated decision made
\
The Battle Ground School Board solidly showed its dedication to its mission as elected officials and made the right decision for our children to deny the alcohol permit at Lloyd's Grill. After the first public hearing a small group requested that the board seek more public input before they made a decision. The board paused and listened we can ask no more of our public officials.
\
Developer Elie Kassab and Mayor John Idsinga appeared oblivious to the fact that many parents in our community seek to educate and protect our children even at the expense of slowing ""economic development."" I support the Gardner Center and am confident that they will be creative and find a tenant that will be a good neighbor to our schools. I will patronize its businesses.
\
The board followed the letter of the law, and assured that our children will be educated in a safe environment. They also had the backbone to defend their legal and moral obligations in the midst of tremendous pressure. Our children have to deal with peer pressure all the time and stand up for their beliefs. They have been taught a valuable lesson in making the right choices.

King County gets enough
\
Chuck Morrison of Tacoma writes a Oct. 2 letter, "" Gas tax helps fund roads,"" wanting us to support the fuel tax. I think the points north of us get enough.
\
I buy gas through a card lock system. For 22 gallons of diesel the last time I filled up, it was $2.65 a gallon, plus $10.64 cents with all the taxes. I know I am kind of old, but I used to fill my car up on Saturday night, pick up my girl, go to a movie, and out to supper for $10.64. I know times have changed, but I still think the state gets enough, they just use it wrong, and most of the collected gas taxes go to King County.
\
As soon as King County's roads are fixed then Gov. Gregoire will see to it that ours get fixed.
\
I don't think she is going to be in office that long. Poor spending habits are what this is about, and no one on either side wants to change or improve.

275,"This sidebar appeared with the story: NORM RICE (D) Resume: Age 54. ... Bachelor's degree in communications, master's in public administration, University of Washington. ... Served 11 years on Seattle City Council before being elected Seattle mayor in 1989. ... Previously worked as writer and editor for KOMO-TV, reporter for KIXI radio, manager of corporate contributions and social policy for Rainier National Bank, director of government services for the Puget Sound Council of Governments, assistant director of Seattle Urban League. ... President of U.S. Conference of Mayors since June 1995. ... Named last month as one of the top 10 rising Democratic stars in the country by Time magazine. ... Born in Denver, moved to Seattle in 1968. Married, one son. Finances: Has $38,045 on hand, according to Aug. 27 report to the state Public Disclosure Commission. Raised about a quarter of his money from outof-state political contacts Rice made as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Why he's running: ``I want to help the people of Washington state build a better future.'' What he'll do first: ``I will make education our state's number one priority.''\Assured and comfortable with himself, Seattle Mayor Norm Rice projects a relaxed, warm manner and an easy sense of humor.\His genuineness refreshes. Greeted on the street by a supporter he doesn't know, Rice asks her name, rather than pretend to know it or blowing by in a cloud of bombast.\After nearly 20 years in public office, Rice, 54, knows who he is and is up front about his vision. He stands up for spending money on welfare for the jobless and protecting the environment. He doesn't fuzz his commitment to gay rights.\He says he would sign a bill legalizing gay marriage, backs gay adoption, and would amend the state's civil rights law to protect gay people against discrimination.\Meeting with Pierce County union leaders, Rice unequivocally opposes privatizing government services or contracting them out. ""The private sector doesn't do it better. It can be equal, but it doesn't do it better.""\On the combustible subject of taxes, Rice is equally up front. He says the gas tax should be raised and its application expanded to build not only roads, but alternatives, like rail.\He's opposed to rolling back the business and occupation tax, out of concern over cutbacks in federal money.\Rice supports some tax breaks, but says they should be targeted to create jobs, or give more small businesses a break from paying the business and occupation tax.\Education is first priority\He says education is his first priority. It was his salvation. His mother cleaned other people's houses. His father worked as a postman and ran a small restaurant.\Raised in Denver, Rice flunked out of the University of Colorado at 18. He stayed out of school five years, reading meters, working as a hospital orderly and at other jobs until realizing he needed a degree to get somewhere.\He came to Seattle to visit a relative at age 25 and started over, earning his bachelor and master's degrees at the University of Washington.\Rice was elected to the Seattle City Council in 1978 and to the mayor's office in 1989.\Rice doesn't describe himself as a technical expert or administrative whiz. As governor, he wants to offer leadership and bring people together from the bully pulpit of the governor's office.\""You can hire someone to write a bill or a budget, but you elect leaders.""\Critics say nice guy may finish last\Critics describe him as Mayor Nice, and some say he takes the chairman of the board approach to governing too far, distancing himself from the day-to-day workings of city government to the point of being disengaged.\""He seems to be very, very detached from the daily occurrences in the city,"" said Cynthia Sullivan, a Democratic member of the King County Council whose district includes Seattle. ""He's more reactive than proactive.""\Sullivan said Rice doesn't have intimate knowledge of Olympia to leverage the Legislature, or the bent of an administrator who sweats the details of governing.\""I want to know why he is running for governor. This is not his race. He doesn't know the statewide issues and he doesn't know the Legislature,"" Sullivan said.\Tina Podlodowski, a Democrat on the Seattle City Council, said Rice can be too slow to cut the rope on people who aren't performing.\""He gives people the benefit of the doubt too many times. Where some managers would say two strikes and you're out, he'd say three.""\But Podlodowski, a former Microsoft executive, praised Rice's style of leadership as that of a corporation CEO. ""He knows when to be a great spokesman and bring leadership to issues. But he doesn't try to do all the work himself. He hires good people to do it.""\Rice earns high marks for working to pump up the city's business community, creating jobs and revitalizing the downtown.\Bob Watt, president of the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce, said when the Frederick & Nelson department store closed downtown, Rice went to work.\He put together a combination of incentives, from a low-interest loan to changes in parking and street traffic patterns to attract new investment.\Now Nordstrom is planning a flagship store and national headquarters, and the block is a magnet for new businesses.\""He is very good at problem solving,"" said Watt, who also served five years as Rice's deputy mayor.\He and others praised Rice for understanding the value of a vibrant downtown and economic growth and taking steps to nurture it.\The city is frequently listed as one of nation's top places to live or do business.\Paige Miller, a Seattle port commissioner, remembered Rice traveling with her to China to cement relations with a shipping company, and his support to double another major shipper's business, generating 1,500 jobs.\Also willing to take political risk, Rice stepped forward to support a controversial new, third runway at Sea-Tac International Airport to spur economic growth. ""He stood up for the third runway when my neighborhood paper called it a third rail,"" Miller said.\Took on talk radio\One of Rice's campaign themes is standing up for convictions and taking the high road. He can rightly claim to have done so himself when confronted by baseless rumors that he had been caught in a homosexual tryst by his wife.\The rumors were aired during a statewide talk radio program last spring.\The safe thing to do, according to some, would have been to ignore the rumor, hoping it would go away, rather than give it wider exposure by confronting the source, a popular talk radio host.\Instead Rice surrounded himself with his family and area clergy and called a news conference, denouncing the rumor and ""hate talk"" radio, winning national publicity and positive reactions that still reverberate.\Searching for common ground\He has a knack for bringing people together to find solutions. When first elected mayor, Rice called an education summit. That puzzled some, because the mayor, like the governor, has no day-to-day responsibility for the public schools.\About 2,000 people turned out to meet at more than 40 locations throughout the city, and a multimillion dollar effort was born to boost early childhood education and readiness to learn programs.\The bully pulpit approach doesn't always work for Rice. The Seattle Commons, a massive park planned for downtown, bombed twice at the ballot, despite Rice's avid support. And Rice remembers an anti-crime initiative called Weed and Seed that antagonized entire neighborhoods as a failure.\Lack of communication was the problem, Rice said, and he believes it's usually at the root of conflict and screw-ups. Listening to all sides and bringing people together is the key to success in his view. It's a first instinct for him, learned as a child, Rice said.\""It's the blessing of the youngest child. I was always the one surveying the attitudes in the house. I was the peacemaker, the compromiser, the guy who can make things right. It's a craft.""\As mayor, he's made town meetings and walking tours of the city a priority, to stake out listening posts. As governor, Rice promises to work with people with very different convictions to forge solutions. While some prefer a more headcracking style, the Rice approach may be catching on.\At a recent Rice fund-raiser at her Tacoma home overlooking Puget Sound, Linda Bemiller uncorked some Washington chardonnay while her Dalmatian Dottie mingled with the string quartet on the porch and guests paying $50 to $100 a ticket.\""I think he's a consensus builder,"" Bemiller said as Rice worked the room. ""In today's political climate that's critical. In order to move forward we need someone who can build bridges."""

We barely know our neighbors
\
In our four-square-block neighborhood are at least 20 free-standing basketball goals in the streets.
\
Why must we have almost as many basketball hoops as we have basketball-playing children? Have sharing and a sense of community ownership completely disappeared? Whatever happened to the days of a neighborhood pick-up game with neighbors?
\
Suburban Americans have been conditioned by the housing developments in which they live. With no parks, community centers or other common places, where are we to meet and mingle with neighbors from down the street?
\
We stick to our comfortable back yards and garages and never know those other people who live less than 20 feet away. We teach our kids to do the same by erecting basketball hoops in the street even though the next-door neighbors have one and rarely use it. It wouldn't be right to ask those people across the street if the kids could shoot hoops. We barely know the Johnsons. Or is it the Johnstons?
\
It saddens me to think of what our children are learning about the nature of life (let alone the nature of basketball) when they play three games of one-on-one simultaneously in a cul-de-sac. Sharing and a sense of community seem to be less important than private ownership and possession. The value of patience is replaced by the reward of instant gratification. These lessons will undoubtedly manifest themselves in youth league games.
\
The essential problem our society faces is not the decline of team play in the game of basketball. The real threat to the good life that is sought in the multihooped middle-class neighborhood is the decline of team play in everyday neighborhood life.

No sign of who's guilty
\
In an Oct. 12 letter, ""Election questions weighed,"" Alfred Maurice mentions signs being stolen in the Cascade Park area.
\
By then I had lost two signs one several years ago and one just recently. My signs were for Linda Smith. I don't know who took them, so a person is innocent until proven guilty.
\
Erwin Hein
\
Camas
\
I am at a loss as to how Alfred Maurice deduced that supporters of Linda Smith are responsible for stealing campaign signs supporting Smith's opponent, Sen. Patty Murray. Using Maurice's logic, I suppose we can assume any damage to or theft of Smith signs is the work of Murray supporters.
\
Furthermore, Smith does not brag, as Maurice states, that her followers are all good Christians. Her support is much wider and more diverse than that. Many of her supporters are Christians. Some, however, are not. They do happen to have the good sense to support a candidate who truly cares about issues pertaining to this state and our country. You don't have to be Christian to care.
\
I have spent a great deal of time putting up signs supporting Smith for U.S. Senate, and I do resent the vandalism and theft that has plagued her campaign. However, I don't automatically assume that Murray supporters are to blame. If Maurice has any proof that a Smith supporter has damaged or stolen a Murray sign, he can let me know and I will handle it personally. Otherwise, I suggest he keep his accusations to himself. I don't condone this sort of behavior on the part of any campaign, but Maurice is out of line in making this sort of statement without facts to support it. This theft he speaks of was not committed by a Christian.

Election decisions discussed
\
It's hard for me to imagine a responsible state legislature having the temerity to put a piece of legislation as deeply flawed as Referendum 49 on the ballot, let alone expecting anyone to vote for it.
\
This so-called Republican transportation plan is really no plan at all. Instead, it represents credit card government at its worst, financing five years of road-building projects with 25 years of bonds. Referendum 49 is fiscally irresponsible. It represents a raid on the general fund that will inevitably force transportation needs to compete for funding with education and social services.
\
Referendum 49 is bad for the environment. By focusing almost exclusively on roads instead of other badly needed forms of transportation, it will add to water and air pollution, which is bad for people and bad for salmon.
\
Worst of all, Referendum 49 won't work. It won't solve our state's transportation problems. What it will do is saddle us with decades of debt and keep us from addressing our transportation needs in a comprehensive way.
\
Why not do it right? Gas prices are near historic lows. A gas tax is a fair user fee that allows people who use roads to pay for them. Let's encourage our state Legislature to come back with a workable plan.

In her Oct. 16 letter, Izetta Singer provides misinformation on Initiative 694, which bans partial-birth infanticide. She says the procedure is used to remove a nonviable fetus.
\
But I-694 bans the procedure from being used on a viable fetus, one that can survive outside the womb. She even calls this procedure rare, yet it was reported in 1996 that approximately 1,500 partial-birth procedures are performed each year in New Jersey. This many in one state can hardly be considered rare.
\
Singer is wrong again when she claims the American Medical Association has not commented on this procedure and that this initiative ""incorrectly terms a necessary medical procedure as a partial abortion."" The AMA has stated that there is no circumstance in which this procedure is necessary. Nowhere in the initiative's text is this procedure referred to as a partial-birth abortion.
\
Those who oppose this ban have in the past decried calling the procedure an abortion because that connotation would reflect badly on abortions in general. Now groups like the Concerned Women Against Abortion Ban call this procedure an abortion because of fears it will lead to bans on abortions within the womb. Whether this is an abortion or not to those opposing the ban seems to depend solely on how best to keep the procedure legal.
\
It matters little what you call it. The procedure that Singer defends amounts to piercing the back of the skull and sucking the brains out of an innocent human baby who has its head covered and cannot defend itself. It would be more compassionate to deliver the baby, blindfold it and then shoot it in the back of the head.
\
It is interesting what abortion supporters feel they must support infanticide in order to keep abortions without limitations.
\
Larry Rambousek
\
Washougal
\
Initiative 694 is a direct attack on a woman's right to choose a safe, legal abortion.
\
The hysteria over partial-birth abortion is a nonissue because in the state of Washington it is already illegal to abort a fetus in the last trimester of pregnancy, except to save the health or life of the mother. I-694 makes no exception for a woman who suffers a crippling illness or cancer.
\
The Washington State Medical Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology oppose Initiative 694, as do the American Association of University Women, the League of Women Voters and many others.
\
Washington voters have voted three times to support a woman's right to choose and should not have to consider and reconsider this issue over and over again. Abortion should be a personal decision between a woman and her physician.
\
Initiative 694 is so poorly written that it could result in the arrest of doctors for performing safe, legal medical procedures. Let's not turn back the clock to the time when women had to go to back-alley quacks for an abortion.

As an attorney in Clark County, I know how important it is to have a county clerk who is experienced and well versed in court procedure.

JoAnne McBride has worked long and hard for the citizens of this county and state. She has trained for and practiced her profession for over 18 years.

Is pool a worthy deal?
\
I don't have enough information to know whether giving the YMCA a million-dollar piece of property and waiving $161,000 in impact fees to put a pool in Vancouver's low-cost housing project is good or bad.
\
But this deal, reported in the Aug. 18 article, ""Pool, housing plan move ahead,"" like many others hatched by our city planners and approved by the city council, has a pungent odor to it.
\
Why don't I and others like me have the information we need to make intelligent decisions? Because the information is not readily available. We become aware of deals such as this only at the 11th hour. And that is by design. If we do not meticulously search every inch of The Columbian to stay abreast of events, we become aware of what is being contemplated only when the issue reaches headline proportions.
\
If we are lucky the city council will give us three whole minutes to present an argument for or against an issue that has been months and years in the making. That doesn't sound to me like anyone on our city council represents us. Otherwise we would be made aware of all the facts early in the planning phase.
\
Unfortunately, most of us don't have the time to stay abreast of these events because we are too busy earning money to pay our taxes. Our council members and city planners are all too well aware of that fact and use it to their advantage.
\
What I do know is that we have gone from being so broke last December, when our city manager and council wanted to raise property taxes higher than what is allowed by law, to becoming philanthropists. Was our city government lying to us then, or are they lying to us now? We have gone from our penniless state to a state of euphoria.
\
Our council has since given away, not one, but two $1-million pieces of the taxpayers' property, forgiven property taxes on one and impact fees on the other, agreed to refurbish Esther Short Park and the Murdock Building at no expense to the beneficiaries, given away free rides on our seldom used transit system and spent countless dollars in an attempt to convince us we did not know what we were doing when we voted ""no"" on a light-rail system. They couldn't get the voters to go for swimming pool bond issue, but it looks like they at least got a piece of one in the back door when we weren't looking.

No harm intended

It is likely that next spring I will announce myself as a candidate for Vancouver City Council. This will be the first time in 12 years that I have run for something, but I've run perhaps a hundred little campaigns in that time.
\
I ran these campaigns by trial and error. I was pretty much willing to try anything. I was not guided by any political logic or convention. This approach led to many failures but some successes as well. I invested a great deal of time in the Evergreen School District levy vote that set a record for turnout. And no neighborhood has more belly-to-belly, neighbor-to-neighbor contact than the Truman neighborhood, where we successfully conducted a road shutdown and safe-streets rally against all odds.

There has been an element of horseplay in some of my campaigns. I apologize for this to the extent that it caused undue worry or hardship. I never intended any real harm, and it was always my hope that I could cause some excitement that I felt was missing in the neighborhoods.
\
Even so, some may believe my actions disqualify me from public office. If so, they would do me a great favor by letting me know where I stand. It doesn't have to be in print; it can be a phone call or a letter. Perhaps the best place for me is where I am now, although the fight inside of me tells me otherwise.

Park impact is negative
\
Where are all the environmentalists and social engineers when we need them? Are they capable of dealing with visions and generalities but not with specific problems?
\
Clark County's acquisition of Lucia Falls Park will help answer these questions. The local residents and Heisson Neighborhood Association met with Clark County parks representatives for several years prior to opening the gate for public access. Residents' principle concerns centered around impact on adjacent property owners, the environment, pollution of the river, parking and roadways.
\
When the parks department did the work and felt suitable safeguards were in place, the gate was opened. The restroom was modernized but not without incident. Artifacts were uncovered, broken and supposedly replanted. This excavation and violation of the country ordinance probably only resulted in one department paying a fine to another department. A single restroom is not adequate today, and now the river and vegetation are being used on a regular basis.
\
The county responded to potential danger by cutting all the vegetation along Lucia Falls Road right up to the tributaries entering the river. You and I can't cut vegetation like this, but the public works department must think it is exempt, just as the parks department did in failing to identify an archeological site. The park entrances' sight distance was also not according to code and was partially corrected only after citizens called it to the county's attention.
\
Now with the warm days of summer and an open gate, people fill all the parking spaces available and flock to the sun-warmed water in spite of signs that read, ""No water contact."" This restriction seemed important to those discussing impact on the declining steelhead and salmon runs. The July 30 Columbian had a picture of a man jumping into the pool below Lucia Falls; no one in authority seems to pay attention.
\
Our parks department should lock the gate to Lucia Falls and learn to comply with county codes, or return the property to private ownership.

Politics matters
\
Friends of Clark County, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to conserve and protect our quality of life by educating and advocating for smart growth, is holding a candidates' debate as part of our effort to educate and get the community involved in promoting good growth management.
\
The event will be from 7 to 9 pm. Oct. 13 at Clark College. It will feature both Republican and Democratic candidates for the 49th District state House seats and the Board of Clark County Commissioners sharing, comparing and contrasting their views on growth-related issues.
\
The panelists, moderator and host are distinguished members of the community. All candidates, (Craig Pridemore, Don Carlson, Maureen Gallegos, Val Ogden, Bill Hughes) have agreed to participate, with the exception of county Commissioner Mel Gordon.
\
All candidates, especially incumbents, have an obligation to stand next to their opponents before the citizenry and share how they will represent us better for the next four years. This is especially true for that most important of issues in Clark County: growth.
\
I encourage readers to contact Gordon by e-mail at melgordon1yahoo.com to encourage his participation in this critical evening.

\
In endorsing Pat Fiske over state Sen. Don Benton, R-Pleasant Valley, in the Republican primary race for Congress, The Columbian completely ignored all that Benton has done for the people of his district and this state.
\
Benton voted against raising the gas tax. He worked hard and succeeded in getting WaferTech to locate here. He received the endorsements of 35 legislators. He was instrumental in getting the two major intersections on state Highway 14 on track as well as the Mill Plain Extension.
\
In what way has Fiske or either of the other GOP candidates materially effected the lives of everyone in Southwest Washington?
\
The Aug. 30 editorial, ""Fiske emerges on top in bid to replace Smith,"" said Fiske has a better chance of beating Brian Baird and being excellent in Congress. It failed to explain how Fiske can possibly beat Baird when he has shown himself to be an ineffective fund-raiser and hopelessly inept as a campaigner.
\
It would probably be best if The Columbian got out of the endorsement business. Frankly, this sorry example of it does a disservice to readers and all of the people of the 3rd District.

Voters expect well-managed and efficient government and should elect Dan Tonkovich as Clark County auditor.
\
Tonkovich is well-acquainted with the job, which by law includes recording all real estate transfers and liens in the county, heading the elections office and acting as the clerk of the Board of Clark County Commissioners.
\
The auditor maintains the official record of the county commissioners' decisions and must sign the warrants that pay the county's bills. Tonkovich has worked with the commissioners on a multitude of legislative, management and fiscal issues, including streamlining government following city annexation.
\
Tonkovich is the only candidate for auditor who has demonstrated a broad knowledge of government by giving his time to serve on intergovernmental committees that examine and direct issues such as law enforcement, health and transportation issues.
\
Tonkovich also took the city of Vancouver one step closer to fiscal and performance efficiency when he fought for, and won, funding for a performance auditor. Tonkovich's demonstrated experience in working with all levels of city and county government will make him a very successful county auditor.

It's blowing smoke
\
To the editor -- We have imposed total prohibition on smoking -- well not quite. The assumption is that we are safe because we have stopped the smoking of tobacco products. It imposes hardships on restaurants, bars, office buildings, and on, and on. A major battle has been won by a group of which I am not a member. I am also not a member of the tobacco smoking community.
\
Have you ever attended or viewed the drag races? In order to achieve maximum traction, a film of bleach is poured on the racing surface. The competitors ""burn"" their tires clean by spinning them in the solution for a few seconds. This results in a cloud of smoke that engulfs the competitors and fans. Unless there is a significant wind blowing, this process imposes a greater density of smoke than any original or second-hand tobacco smoke. There is something wrong when our neighbors are remanded to the street corners or other locations in order to exercise their habits.
\
I'm sure the business managers could provide an environment within their establishments that would be safe and to the satisfaction of their patrons/clients. We abolished the prohibition of John Barleycorn. I think the same should be done with this dictatorial imposition.

Crime: Get serious
\
To the editor -- Yes, leaving a car running is only a portion of the car theft problems. In my opinion, the major portion of the problem is these thieves get little or no time for their crimes.
\
I'm continually reading where little or no time is given for these crimes and many others. It's the amount of time that's given for the crime that will put a stop to all these crimes committed by our youth.
\
The youth of Yakima County commit a lot of crimes and do minimal time for everything. When they get out in a matter of days, they're out here bragging about what they've done to their ""homies"" and it becomes a domino effect.
\
If the courts would get serious about punishing these crimes, Yakima would eventually see a decrease in crime.
\
There used to be a saying, ""If you can't do the time, don't do the crime."" I see youngsters in and right back out of jail all the time. But hey, why not, the time is short and then they've got something to brag about.
\
Until the courts get serious about giving real time to crimes, Yakima will always be riddled with crime and it will just get worse.
\
Making the newspapers for crimes is glorifying to some and getting right out to brag about it is even juicier.
\
Start taxing the criminal and not the taxpayer. It'll work.

Cooperative spirit
\
To the editor -- You failed to mention the city's $654,000 contribution to the South 96th Avenue arterial construction project in your Dec. 4 editorial: ""City Should Help Shoulder Debt from Annexation.""
\
That paid for the installation of a sewer line that will attract development and add to property values and the city/county tax base. The fact that a city sewer line was installed in the county reflects the generally cooperative and pragmatic spirit that exists between the city and county when it comes to spending tax and ratepayer dollars for infrastructure.
\
With an annexation pending, it would be wasteful to build an arterial near city limits only to have developers rip it up for a sewer line a few months or years later. Citizens should expect this kind of forethought.
\
You also failed to identify the source of funds the city might tap to shoulder part of the county's road-building debt. It takes 18 months before the city can collect property taxes from an annexation.
\
In lamenting the loss of its road tax from the 300 acres in the 96th annexation area, you overlook the fact that the county will receive millions of dollars for street preservation, maintenance and grant match from the state's 2005 Transportation Partnership Package. The city will also get a share.
\
Through direct distribution of a portion of the 9.5-cent gas tax, the county will receive about $605,000 annually and the city, $320,000.

To the editor -- Once upon a time, the residents of West Valley tried to form a city, before the city of Yakima swallowed your area.

During the fighting, you were warned over and over that this was your last chance, and when Yakima annexes you, you will have to pay for your resistance.
\
The vote was lost. West Valley is part of Yakima, so enjoy the reward you are getting, according to the Consumers Report ad in the Jan. 2 newspaper, which says it reported in September 2003 that customers got low prices accompanied by worse-than-average service offered by Wal-Mart.

Value gift of child
\
To the editor -- January is ""LIFE"" month for many Christians around the world. It comes on the heels of Christmas where we were reminded that from the womb of the Virgin Mary to the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, Jesus took our place. From the womb to the tomb, Jesus showed us how much God values human life.
\
Abortion does not help women! It takes the lives of children and often sends women into a spiral of despair that does not end until and unless they come to grips with a decision they come to see as wrong and then seek forgiveness that can be experienced because of the empty tomb.
\
The greatest gift in this world today is the gift of a child. A few years ago, the mantra was, ""It's quality time, not quantity time that counts."" Wrong! Children need both. I like what philosopher Eric Hoffer said, ""Call not that man wretched, who whatever ills he suffers, has a child to love.""

To the editor -- Why send billions to Seattle for new highways to handle congestion when we have all this space and people here wanting high-paying jobs?
\
We have the Chinook camper building and other empty shells of business opportunities. Our Chamber of Commerce and real estate agents and legislators need to join together to woo business from Seattle. Our cost of living is lower due to housing, traveling distance and food supply.

Respect the domains
\
To the editor -- The debate, science/evolution vs. religion/ intelligent design forgets that science means using the scientific method: Testing logically derived theories with experimental observations to find the facts, the ""what"" and ""how"" of the material world, regardless of mystical understandings of ""why.""
\
Religion is not science, but faith-based beliefs about the mystical and mysterious, grounded in history and revelation. It speaks to the ""why"" of existence, not the ""what"" and ""how"" of science.
\
These different domains don't really conflict, just as the scientist's knowledge of botany doesn't conflict with the poet's rhapsody over nature's beauty, and the psychologist's clinical explanation doesn't conflict with the joy of love.
\
In the prescientific era, religion had to try to cover both domains, for lack of help. Today, wise religions relinquish the mechanics of the observable world to science, only claiming knowledge of the ineffable mystical ""whys"" of existence.
\
Evolution is not anti-religion but totally compatible with religion. It merely describes observable patterns in the traces of God's joyful creation over time. Its efforts to defend itself against the fear-based attacks of religion may seem antispiritual because it has been pitted against it. But, it makes no claim to say anything about the mystical. Not teaching religion in public schools respects the diversity of religions because the government takes no sides.
\
True religion has nothing to fear from science. The deeper truths of the spirit are not threatened by science. There's no need for fear or struggle over who's right. Each describes a different domain.

Taxpayers, take note

To the editor -- In the Yakima Herald-Republic's Jan. 5 edition:
\
1. ""FEMA shows faulty mindset by junking water."" Water that never reached the hurricane victims was dumped in the sewer. FEMA paid $250 per truckload to dump the water.
\
2. ""Suspect in custody before shooting."" Joshua Collett was released from custody just prior to a fatal shooting for which he now faces murder charges. He was released despite his confession and positive ID by his earlier shooting victim. Plus his past lengthy juvenile criminal record.
\
3. ""Murray won't return money tied to Abramoff."" Sen. Patty Murray does not intend to return $40,000 received from Indian tribes represented by Jack Abramoff. She made this decision because she states she does not know Mr. Abramoff. Duh? Is the senator not aware of the Senate hearings that have exposed the paper trail of such donations by Abramoff?
\
Just a sampling of what is reported daily by people in decision- making positions at a national and local level. But never fear, the taxpayer is here.

Pain of losing pet
\
To the editor -- My husband and I live on 17th Avenue between Tieton and Chestnut. On the night of Jan. 2, our black lab mix got out of the yard while we were gone. She was seen behind our house just 45 minutes before we came home to find her missing. She was wearing a collar with ID tags. We have done everything to try to find her, including offering a reward, but have had no luck so far. She is a part of our family and we are devastated to have lost her.
\
Please, please, please, if you find a dog that has ID tags, call the owner. They miss their pet and would give anything to have them back home. Also, if you see stray dogs without identification, call the Animal Control office so they can at least pick them up and take them to the Humane Society where they are warm, fed and watered.
\
There is nothing worse than wondering if your pet is safe, hungry, scared, cold or lost. Please help reunite beloved pets with their owners; the owners and their pets will appreciate it.

Cawley has fresh ideas
\
To the editor -- What do you call a man who owns his own business, holds down two other jobs, and wants to be our next councilman? I call that man Micah Cawley, and I'm voting for him for Yakima City Council. Micah knows the value of a dollar, is industrious, and has the best interests of our community at heart. Micah is all of 21 years old, yet he's more focused and hard- working than many people twice his age.
\
One of Micah's best personal traits is his positive attitude. He wants to take that attitude a step further; he wants to infuse City Hall with a can-do attitude and top-notch customer service. He's committed to improving service at City Hall from the utility counter to the building department. He's committed to improving our access to council through evening meetings and eliminating the 3-minute time limit on speaking to council. Micah will work hard to reduce our tax burden by regionalizing redundant government services.
\
I want a councilman who will bring fresh ideas to the problems facing our city. Micah knows a great deal about those issues we face, and he's studying hard to be the best councilman he can be, come Jan. 1. Please join me in voting for a brighter future for Yakima; elect Micah Cawley to the Yakima City Council.

Lover, I-900 a good fit

To the editor -- City Council candidate Bill Lover endorses Initiative 900 performance audits. He has had experience with performance audits.
\
I've talked to him about how they work and what they do. He has convinced me that they work in large companies, and said if elected he would work hard to convince council members how valuable they could be to the city. All levels of government need to control and reduce waste and ineffective spending.
\
Backers of I-900 say performance audits in the states of Texas and California have saved billions of dollars and identified billions more, strongly indicating they work in the public arena also.
\
It's time for our state and city governments to start embracing modern management methods of cost control.

Vote yes for I-900 performance audits and for Bill Lover, Yakima City Council Position 3.

Picture buying a home that has been built by someone who has no experience in the respected field of carpentry.

\
I still know that man. His name is Rockey Marshall.
\
He is still considerate, hardworking and helpful. In fact, he's one of the hardest working people I know, and he's always working to help others.
\
He's committed to making downtown a nice place to be again, and he has some great ideas about how to do it. He wants to see local businesses thriving and locals and visitors enjoying the unique tastes and sights Yakima can offer. Mostly he wants to help Yakima come up with a solid plan for revitalization, like other cities have done, and help everyone work together to make it happen. If anyone can do it, Rockey can.

I don't know all of the community volunteer work Rockey does, but I do know he cares about everyone in Yakima, and wants to make this a better place for all of us.

Voting for change
\
To the editor -- We still need a change at City Hall. Some of the new people who have stepped up to run for the council have different and seemingly better perspectives. All the Yakima City Council candidates and the incumbents seem to agree on one thing: The city has some huge, looming fiscal issues.
\
If you listen to Mayor Paul George, all he needs is the gas tax and more time to finish what is already started. Bernie Sims is a bureaucrat I don't agree with him much of the time, but it is obvious to me that his knowledge and understanding of the system will be important in making the policy changes we will surely need in the future.
\
Norm Johnson and Bill Lover have the managerial experience and background necessary to make independent, mature decisions and good policy to help Yakima live up to its potential.
\
My rationale is to vote not just for change, but for those who understand how to facilitate change. My ballot will be marked as follows: Position 1, Norm Johnson; Position 2, Bernie Sims; and Position 3, Bill Lover.

Yes on I-330
\
To the editor -- I'll vote for Initiative 330. I'll vote against I-336.
\
Unfortunately, neither malpractice reform bill addresses the heart of the problem: Many -- I suspect most -- malpractice judgments against doctors are unjust.
\
If my surgeon operates drunk, I should have recourse. But that is not what malpractice suits are usually about.
\
Doctors diagnose and treat complex diseases that attack complex people. They are not God: They cannot and should not be expected to know everything, to see every symptom, to connect all the pieces every time, to see every possible result of every possible treatment. The fact that some specialties (such as obstetrics) are considered high-risk for malpractice insurance seems clear evidence that we are punishing good doctors for not being God. When we punish good doctors, we punish patients.
\
I would enthusiastically support legislation to re-establish the wall between doctor malfeasance and complexity-of-medicine situations. Doctors should have absolute protection from suits for the latter. I understand that this would require legislative action and not just an initiative, so I'm looking at I-330 instead.
\
I-330 reduces the amount that may be unjustly taken from doctors, and thus from us, their patients. I-330 is a Band-Aid approach, but still an improvement.
\
But what is I-336? If a doctor is unjustly decided against three times in court, he loses his license -- and his patients lose. It also sets up a government-issue malpractice insurance boondoggle. I- 336 is salt in the wound.
\
I'll take the Band-Aid over salt any time.

I-990 a good step

To the editor -- After being diagnosed with breast cancer in October 1981, seven months later an unrelated diagnosis of non- smoker's lung cancer challenged me further. In these 24 years, cancer has at times consumed my life, offering few weeks away from needles, knives, radiation or scans. Jenn and Jeff have no memory of their cancer-free mother. It's one day, one medical test at a time. Trip insurance is part of any travel package. Lung cancer typically means a survival measured in months. Yes, I'm among the fortunate ones.
\
November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month. November 2005 brings the opportunity, through Initiative 901 (Healthy Indoor Air for All Washington), to take a significant step in the effort to reduce incidences of lung disease. My parents' generation was ignorant while my generation too often turns a blind eye.
\
I am told that quitting smoking is difficult. Let me challenge you to months of chemotherapy and surgeries. Peter Jennings, Dana Reeve -- you don't have to look to celebrities to understand how indiscriminate lung disease is. Look no further than your own community.
\
Without removing the right of choice, I-901 gives everyone the right to expect a healthy, smoke-free environment when we are in public, protecting us from second-hand smoke that we know to be significantly damaging. Various cancers, asthma, emphysema, heart disease and stroke are related to and exacerbated by exposure to tobacco smoke. I-901 is the next step in protecting our children from the ravages of disease caused by tobacco.

280,"FILE - In this Jan. 13, 2021 file photo, Washington Sen. Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, works at her desk on the otherwise empty Senate floor, at the Capitol in Olympia, Wash., during a joint session of the Washington Legislature being held remotely. The 2021 session of the Washington Legislature ended Sunday, April 25 and lawmakers had no shortage of weighty topics to consider while having to conduct their work amid a pandemic that meant most meetings and votes were conducted remotely. The Capitol building was also closed to the public since last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was surrounded by security fencing and national guard members at times due to fears of protests. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \Associated Press files \Speaker of the House Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, left, presides over a session of the House in Olympia on April 21 with most representatives attending remotely. The 2021 session ended April 25, and lawmakers had no shortage of weighty topics to consider while having to conduct their work amid a pandemic that meant most meetings and votes were conducted remotely. The Capitol building was closed to the public. It also was surrounded by security fencing and National Guard members at times because of fears over protests.\Included on list of wins: Capital gains and carbon output\Democrats scored one victory after another over the course of this year's 105-day legislative session, as lawmakers in the majority party eschewed incremental change in favor of sweeping, long-sought goals.\Just before the session concluded on April 25, liberal legislators shepherded major priorities through both houses and onto Gov. Jay Inslee's desk. Their list of policy wins includes a new tax on capital gains, a pair of carbon-curbing bills, and a $59.2 billion operating budget that pumps resources into the state's education and public health systems.\Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, said the year's productivity is owed in part to a lack of distractions. Facing a session slowed by its remote format, she and her colleagues were instructed to keep their attention narrowly tailored: Pandemic recovery, equity and environmental justice were the focus. Bills that fell outside those limits were not considered.\“We asked our members to limit our numbers of bills they introduced to around seven, and ensure that they were focused on those things,” said Stonier, who served as the Democrat floor leader over the course of the session. “I think that really helped us filter our attention and think strategically about those things.”\Lawmakers also passed a slate of bills aimed at increasing police accountability, including legislation establishing a statewide office to investigate use-of-force incidents and a bill that requires officers to intervene if they witness a peer using excessive force.\Two main strategies to reduce carbon emissions, a cap-and-trade program and a low-carbon fuel standard, passed both chambers just before the session concluded. However, in order to enact the pair of bills, the Legislature will need to pass a 16-year transportation revenue plan, which lawmakers say will need to be taken up in a special session later this spring.\Republicans feel ‘steamrolled'\Democrats could call the session — the first-ever legislative session conducted almost entirely via videoconferencing, as COVID-19 forced business-as-usual to a halt in Olympia — extremely fruitful.\But while a few measures passed with bipartisan support, many Republicans would use a different description: steamrolled.\“There were some bills that were just on greased skids, and there was nothing we were going to be able to do,” said Senate Republican Caucus Chair Ann Rivers, R-La Center. “Overall, when I think about the session, it was disappointing on a number of fronts.”\The approach was especially discouraging, Rivers added, because Washington is flush with resources. Despite dire warnings at the start of the pandemic that the state would face an $8.8 billion budget deficit, stronger-than-expected tax receipts combined with federal aid money left the state in an ideal position to scale back on existing regressive taxes, she said.\“Especially in this year of a $15 billion windfall, why wouldn't we choose another way to do this?” Rivers asked.\The Legislature took aim at crafting bills to right Washington's tax structure, which is among the most regressive in the country due to its heavy reliance on sales taxes. The first step, a new tax on capital gains revenue, passed despite uniform opposition from Republicans.\The bill imposes a tax on the sale of certain assets owned by wealthy people including stocks, bonds, and luxury goods like cars and fine art. Revenue from the sales in excess of $250,000 will be taxed at 7 percent; sales of homes, farms and retirement accounts such as Roth IRAs and 401(k)s are exempt.\Sen. Annette Cleveland, D-Vancouver, was one of the few Democrats who originally opposed the capital gains tax, claiming that the bill could drain the political will to pass other revenue-raising measures for infrastructure projects this year.\Cleveland cast her vote against Senate Bill 5096 when it first came to the floor. But when it returned to the chamber with House revisions, she switched her stance. Her changed vote may have been the deciding factor: The tax bill skirted through the chamber, 25-24.\If Inslee signs the bill, the tax will go into effect in 2022. It is expected to bring in $550 million in 2023. The revenue is earmarked for Washington's Education Legacy Trust Account, which funds child-care and early-learning programs.\“Looking at the data, there are fewer than 150 people in the 49th Legislative District that would be impacted by this,” Cleveland said, speaking about her own west Vancouver district. “There's a tremendous investment on every state dollar that we put toward early learning, and that's what the capital gains tax is aimed primarily at.”\The tax is also all but guaranteed to face a challenge in the courts. Opponents consider it a version of an income tax, which is in violation of the state's constitution. Republican lawmakers have also worried that the tax will discourage Washington's wealthy residents from putting down roots and creating jobs.\“The people this bill will ultimately impact are the very people that have worked hard, they've been wise in their investments, they have taken the good American dream, the free market economy here in America, and made it work,” Rep. Vicki Kraft, R-Vancouver, said during the bill's floor debate. ”Why would we penalize them for that?”\The second step toward a more progressive tax structure drew near-unanimous support on both sides of the aisle.\A bill expanding the Working Families Tax Exemption sailed through the Senate 47-2 and the House 93-3. It was a slam dunk — and a chance for Republicans to exercise some influence as the minority party, Rivers said.\“By putting it in our budget, we forced the Democrats to put it in theirs,” Rivers said.\The program was established in 2008 but left unfunded (a casualty of the Great Recession, and later the fight over school funding after the McCleary case, Rivers said). It's meant to offset the state's sales tax, which disproportionately impacts lower-income people.\Starting in 2023, Washington state will return an estimated $250 million to 420,000 taxpayers in payments ranging from $300 to $1,200, depending on household size and income level.\Environment and transportation policy\Democrats also passed a pair of bills aimed at curbing carbon emissions and raising revenue for clean energy transitions.\The first, a carbon cap-and-trade program, would limit emissions for businesses that produce greenhouse gases. They'll need to stay below a certain threshold of carbon pollution or purchase allowances from the state's Department of Ecology. That cap would decrease over time. The same bill increases the state's gas tax by 5 cents per gallon, on top of the existing 67.8-cent tax.\The other piece of legislation establishes a low-carbon fuel standard. It aims to incentivize energy companies like BP to produce cleaner fuel sources over time for cars, trucks, boats and airplanes.\The twin bills come with a caveat. They're linked to a sweeping 16-year transportation revenue plan, which didn't pass. Lawmakers ran out of time.\“I'm disappointed that we're looking at this scenario,” Stonier said. “I don't feel it is consistent with our legislative practice to tie things together like that.”\Rep. Sharon Wylie, D-Vancouver, serves on the House Transportation Committee. She said lawmakers will likely pick that work back up in the next couple of weeks. The transportation plan will need its own special session.\Planning for major projects, like the Interstate 5 Bridge replacement, also hinges on federal infrastructure dollars, she added. The Biden administration released a $2 trillion infrastructure plan last month that includes a pledge to fix 10,000 bridges nationwide.\“I think there's still a strong commitment to do a transportation infrastructure package that will carry us into the future,” Wylie said. “How we get there, we're still in negotiation, and I think what the federal government does or doesn't do will help us come together on that.”\Policing\Democrats were able to pass a broad array of bills this session aimed at increasing police accountability.\While most passed along party lines, a few gained bipartisan support from Southwest Washington Republicans. A bill that improves data collection on law enforcement activity passed with unanimous support from the region's lawmakers.\Rivers and Rep. Paul Harris, the minority caucus chair, crossed party lines to support a bill that would require police officers to intervene if they witness a peer using excessive force. Sen. Lynda Wilson, R-Vancouver, supported a bill that would lay out a process for selecting arbiters in negotiations with police unions.\Wylie served as sponsor on two key bills that made it to Inslee's desk: a bill banning neck restraints, chokeholds and no-knock warrants, and a bill that lays out rules for officer use-of-force and de-escalation tactics.\“A lot of the communities of color wanted their leaders to be front and center on this, so I took a lot of my direction from people who are dealing with the situation on the ground. I have friends that have had some very unpleasant experiences right here in Vancouver. We were driven by data,” Wylie said. “We have a pattern of disproportionate impact and behaviors that don't stand the common sense test. … We've had a real problem, and to deny that is to be naive.”\The slate of police-reform legislation introduced and passed over the last 105 days also includes a bill that establishes a statewide Office of Independent Investigations to examine police use-of-force incidents, including shootings.\“I just think it's a redundant piece of legislation,” Hoff said. “This bill grows government for no reason.”\Democrats argue that the broad policing reform was long overdue, and that more work will continue in future sessions.\“For the record, I don't know of any Democrats in Washington who want to defund the police,” Wylie added.\Calley Hair: 360-735-4558; calley.hair@columbian.com; twitter.com/calleynhair \CREDIT: Calley Hair The Columbian"

Artist rendering of one of the designs proposed for the new I-5 bridge.
\
More than 25 years ago, an interstate bridge was built between Vancouver and Portland without a public vote, without bridge tolls, without opposition rallies and without acrimony about iconic designs and urban sprawl.
\
Best of all, the Intestate 205 bridge was built for a fraction of the cost of the proposed Columbia River Crossing project, only $175 million. And the feds paid 90 percent of the bill.
\
It was a pretty straightforward issue, said Dick Carroll, who was district engineer for the then-Washington State Highways Department. The mission was to build a bridge across the Columbia River connecting the two states to provide an alternate route for I-5, and we accomplished that.
\
For better or for worse, the December 1982 opening of the Glenn Jackson Bridge, named after a former Oregon transportation commissioner, was a pivotal point in Clark County history.
\
Before the bridge opened, the county had slightly less than 200,000 people. Today, fueled by growth in the eastern suburbs, it has more than 425,000.
\
Replacing the Interstate 5 Bridge isnt expected to have nearly that effect on the community. But it has had a bigger effect in creating strife and unrest years before construction begins if it ever does.
\
The recent uproar over bridge design prompted Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski to ride the MAX light-rail train last week in an attempt to shift the focus to economic development and congestion relief.
\
Don Wagner, Southwest Washington administrator for the Washington Department of Transportation, said he is not surprised the project has taken on almost epic significance for people on both sides of the river.
\
The Columbia River Crossing is seen as such a huge project in the metro area that anything we do, if we do it right or if we do it wrong, will have a lasting effect on the future of both Oregon and Washington, Wagner said.
\
This is really, really big. And I think everybody knows if this bridge gets built on their watch, their kids and a whole bunch of people are going to ask, Did they do the right thing?
\
Limited conflict
\
More than 30 years ago, the debate surrounding the I-205 bridge had more to do with where and when to build the crossing, not whether the project itself was a good idea.
\
The process was not without conflict. There was disagreement over its potential effect on Portland International Airports expansion plans. The bridge was redesigned to provide a bike path.
\
The I-205 project was subject to extensive review, with an April 1976 environmental impact statement predicting the projects effect on air quality, urban development and wildlife habitat on Government Island.
\
It wasnt just a slam-dunk, as I understand it , Wagner said, that somebody decided on Tuesday they were going to build a new bridge and on Thursday the new bridge instantaneously went in.
\
But there wasnt much talk about urban sprawl, at least not much that Carroll, the states top transportation manager in Vancouver during the 1970s, remembers. If anything, the focus was to promote growth.
\
There was an interest in the development of east county, Carroll said. At that time, Im sure there were those that had urban sprawl syndrome.
\
In contrast, the crossing offices studies say a bigger I-5 bridge wont trigger sprawl. Officials there say there are few, if any, parallels with construction of Interstate 205, which opened up large tracts of rural Clark County and parts of the Portland area to homes, stores and offices.
\
Even David Bragdon, Oregons Metro Council president who has questioned if a wider I-5 bridge would induce more sprawl in north Clark County, sees a difference between the Columbia River Crossing and I-205.
\
The circumstances of this project are different, Bragdon said during a Jan. 9 meeting. Its not the 1970s. Its not 70s planning. I get that.
\
PDX dictated design
\
In the 1970s, there was little debate over bridge design. The I-205 projects proximity to Portland International Airport dictated a flat design without suspension towers and other features associated with iconic crossings.
\
Wagner said that bridge design tends to ebb and flow with time. He contrasted the monumental bridges Conde McCullough designed along the Oregon coast during the 1930s with those built in later years.
\
Every one of the McCullough bridges are ornate, one-of-a-kind bridges, Wagner said. You then went into this era of what I call the interstate. ... Find something that works and repeat it as many times as you can and make it as inexpensive as you can because, by golly, we want these federal dollars to go as far as they can.
\
Back in the 1970s, the federal highway trust fund was flush with gas-tax proceeds. Today, the federal government is facing projected deficits just to build already approved projects. Tolls, something that werent even discussed 30 years ago, are projected to be the Columbia River Crossings biggest revenue source.
\
Wagner said the envisioned financial package illustrates how much times have changed.
\
The I-205 bridge was built with interstate completion funds, Wagner said. You probably wouldnt have quite as many conversations about tolling and everything else if this was the good old days, when the federal government paid 90 percent.
\
Back then, Washington and Oregon split the remaining 10 percent of the costs, or less than $9 million apiece. Thats a bargain price, considering that the city of Vancouver today estimates it would cost more than $10 million to upgrade a 10-block stretch of downtowns Main Street.
\
More than a bridge
\
The Columbia River Crossing encompasses more than replacing the aging twin spans, which opened in 1917 and 1958. A bridge with up to 12 lanes of traffic, six in each direction, plus wide emergency shoulders, is the biggest piece of a project expected to cost $3.5 billion to $4.2 billion.
\
The bridge would cost about $1.2 billion, with freeway improvements and light rail adding billions more. Still, thats almost seven times more than the I-205 bridges $175 million cost 30 years ago. Adjusted for inflation, the I-205 bridge cost $386 million, still a fraction of the Columbia River Crossing project.
\
Doug Ficco, Washington director for the Columbia River Crossing project, who remembers inspecting the I-205 bridge during construction, said several factors make a new I-5 bridge considerably more costly.
\
During the late 1970s, the Washington side of the river was largely rural, with little existing development or traffic, a much different setting from what workers will face should a replacement I-5 bridge ever get under way, he said.
\
We are in a very dense urban environment where we are trying to build this large project, Ficco said. Having room to build it makes a lot of difference.
\
Crossing engineers are designing a wider project than the Glenn Jackson Bridge, with room for six lanes in each direction plus breakdown shoulders. There are more stringent seismic standards to be met. And the bridges will be designed and built to carry the additional weight of light rail.
\
Environmental issues, particularly complying with the Endangered Species Act and other modern environmental laws, adds cost to the project, Ficco said. Finally, the $1.2 billion estimate includes the cost to remove the existing twin spans once a new bridge is opened.
\
Value in looking back
\
Wagner said there is something to be gained by looking back at the I-205 bridge as the region debates the current project.
\
But I dont think you can just say, It worked then so lets do it today, he said. Because the world has changed.
\
My nervousness is with reasonable inflation, the price of this project, at a 3 percent inflation rate, goes up about $10 million a month when we delay, Wagner added. If you delay it another 10 years, all of a sudden you have another billion in cost.
\
Carroll, who spent 35 years working for the state before leaving in 1981, said he carefully monitors the Columbia River Crossing, but stays away from the politics.
\
When I left DOT, I made a pact I wasnt going to get involved in transportation issues, he said.
\
The I-205 bridge was constructed based on transportation and engineering issues, he said.
\
It did not have the body politic that is involved with any project today, not just the I-5, he said.
\
I did it when life was simple.

282,"SHBA ENDORSES SHEA, TOO\Recently, The Spokesman-Review editorial board published its endorsement for representative in the 4th Legislative District. In the piece, it only mentions Josh Arritola as the recipient of the Spokane Home Builders Association (SHBA) endorsement. In fact, Rep. Matt Shea and Arritola have both received an endorsement.\As the incumbent, Shea has a strong record; however, both candidates enjoy support from a wide array of community, industry and business leaders. Both candidates would fight hard for Eastern Washington and both emphasize priorities expressed by members of the SHBA.\The differences between the two candidates are most apparent in the means each would employ as a legislator. On transportation, Shea has focused on implementing cost-saving reform measures, while Arritola indicates his focus would be on getting a gas tax package to the governor's desk. Both are viable methods of funding the north-south corridor to completion.\On regulatory issues, Shea has made the removal of government barriers his priority, while Arritola has stated he would focus on improving regulatory speed. Again, both efforts would be helpful for our members and local small businesses.\You can view all of our endorsements at: www.shba.com/VoterGuide.\Jason Lawrence\Spokane\ISIS AND THE ELEPHANT\Am I the only one who notices the elephant in the room?\President Obama appears to think that using his paintbrush to paint the walls gray will hide the elephant in the room. He paints elaborately and keeps all eyes on him. Why is he using a paintbrush? Because that's what he has in his arsenal. But a paintbrush is not very effective at addressing the problem of having an elephant in the room.\The men in ISIS act from the heart, and no airstrike will change a man's heart. Their actions stem from a religious conviction. And the only way to win this war is to change their religious convictions. Doing that would create a doorway and allow the elephant to leave the room.\Ann Winkler\Veradale\RISCH HURT SCHOOLS\When Jim Risch served as fill-in governor for Dirk Kempthorne in 2006, he called the state Legislature into a one-day session and rammed through a bill that eliminated $260 million of property tax support for public schools and replaced it with about $210 million in sales taxes. The recession hit and sales tax revenues tanked, decimating funding available for schools.\Now, Idaho public school districts are underfunded and critically dependent on supplemental tax levies for funding. That is just one of the reasons I'm voting for Nels Mitchell for the U.S. Senate. Idaho is long overdue for a break from shortsighted career politicians like Risch.\Mike Young\Boise\DOWNTOWN TRANSIT IDEAS\It seems a healthy and appropriate time to talk about the future of the city's public transport. I think we should move beyond the us vs. them discussion. We are lucky to live in a dynamic city, one of the few whose downtown is thriving. I think the big picture should include improving the system and solving some of the issues at the same time.\The Amtrak building is beautiful, but more importantly, potentially a much better location if we change our thinking a little.\Most people who have visited Portland,before and after the light rail system, have seen the vast improvement along its route. Imagine a transport encircling the downtown, not unlike the ringstrassa in Vienna.\The ideal place for the hub of transport is on the perimeter. The intermodal area is close to the growing Riverpoint campus and well-positioned to start a circular route by the new Grand Hotel and Convention Center, skirting the park to Monroe Street, then looping south and back.\In the short term, perhaps some hybrid trolleys circulating, but in a few years GPS-guided vehicles. No need for light rail infrastructure in the near future. Let's think big.\William DeLine\Spokane\WILHITE A PROVEN LEADER\District 4 deserves a state representative who has proved she can actually deliver on her promises, not someone with little experience who rides on his father's name.\Diana Wilhite is a compassionate conservative who shows respect for people with different opinions. Spokane Valley voters elected her to start up the new city. She made sure the budget was balanced and that public safety and good roads were top priorities. She's been the owner of a small business for 33 years. She's been active with the United Way and with public schools. She worked hard to protect the aquifer and get sewers in the Valley. She's worked for affordable energy that's also good for the environment. She has strong family values, married 40 years with two grandchildren.\That's just part of her track record. Voters elected and re-elected her to the first Spokane Valley City Council for seven years, and she was also mayor for three years. She served on many important boards: chair of the Spokane Regional Transportation Council; the board of trustees of Inland Power and Light for nine years; the United Way of Spokane County Board for six years; Eastern Washington University's Business Advisory Committee for nine years, with two years as chair; and Central Valley School District's Committee on Student Housing.\She served onSpokane County's Citizen Committee that finally got sewers put into the Valley. She was a 4-H leader for 4 years.\Vote for Diana Wilhite and vote for competency, compassion and respect.\Margaret Mortz\Spokane Valley\BEGGS TO BRING JUSTICE\As a person who has volunteered in various settings over the 50 years of my adult life, in areas of domestic violence, suicide, mental illness, substance abuse, homelessness, feeding programs, LGBT rights and peace and justice issues for the community of others, I was quite impressed with Breean Beggs and his efforts on my return to Spokane in 2005.\My observations and participation with him in efforts to bring voice and recognition to efforts to provide justice for all, as guaranteed in our Constitution, have marked a slow and steady progression to his choice to run for Spokane County prosecutor.\As a person of absolute integrity, honesty and fearless engagement in issues that our city and county leaders avoided facing and lied about, Beggs will bring a sea of change to the office of county prosecutor.\Simply read the list of endorsements for each of the two candidates. You will be persuaded as to whose side each of the men vying for office has supporting them. It's a simple choice.\My vote is for Breean Beggs. It is time for him to come in from the outside edges, having fostered large changes in our justice system from there, and finish the heavy lifting in effecting change on the inside of that office.\John Olsen\Spokane\WHY THE CANCER FUSS?\I'm so tired of hearing all the warm and fuzzy stories of cancer survivors. What is all the fuss about?\I was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2003, had surgery in March and participated in Bloomsday that following May. I never got on a pedestal and bragged about it or joined a group of cancer survivors or wore a pin proclaiming I was proud for being a cancer survivor or any of that.\What is this ridiculous obsession with society today about sharing one's private affairs with the world? Why does anyone care? I say enough already; get on with your life and shut up.\Carla Amparan\Spokane\SUPPORT FOR CLAY\During this campaign season, I gained great respect and admiration for the people running for public office in my home of Stevens County. One person I found to be particularly genuine and passionate about his cause is Michael Clay, who is running for District Court judge.\Clay has extensive experience in many facets of law that are clearly communicated on his website. More importantly, I truly believe that Clay has very deeply held ecumenical conservative values that I believe will help him fairly apply the law in Stevens County.\It is infinitely more difficult to get a sense of a person's character by just reading articles in a newspaper or listening to others articulate their impressions of them. His trust-but-verify attitude when it comes to the safety of our community reminds me of the first president I voted for and the last executive leader I had complete confidence in, Ronald Reagan.\I admire Clay for his tireless dedication to making justice become a reality for the citizens of Stevens County and offer my enthusiastic and heartfelt support to Michael Clay for District Court judge.\Mark Eastabrooks\Chewelah, Wash.\JONES READY TO LEAD\I am a career educator in Idaho and am concerned with the current state of education for our children and support for our educators.\I haveworked with Dr. Jana Jones for over 30 years as a colleague in early education and as a colleague during her tenure as state director of special education and chief deputy superintendent of public instruction under Dr. Marilyn Howard. She has equal skill and passion for children and families, and for working honestly and effectively in fiscal and political arenas.\What Jones wants for Idaho's kids is simple: safe schools, great teachers, smaller class sizes and challenging classes that prepare our kids for the future of their choice.\Jones is a fourth-generation Idahoan who has spent over 40 years in education. She knows the job, and will be able to hit the ground running.\After her selection as the Republican nominee, Tom Luna introduced Sherri Ybarra, and told reporters she would continue the work he's done the past eight years. We can't let that happen. Idaho can't lose another generation of students to Ybarra's bad ideas.\Please join me in supporting Dr. Jana Jones for superintendent of public instruction in Idaho.\Mary Bostick\Moscow\'REAL CHANGE' A WASTE\Fact: The city of Spokane and Downtown Spokane Partnership spent $25,000 on publicity for their anti-panhandling crusade called ""Real Change"" that was launched in August. Apparently $20,000 was funded by the city. In other words, taxpayer dollars.\Fact: The ""Real Change"" campaign, to date, has raised a whopping $212.\What a waste of money, time and effort to unfairly paint all panhandlers as lazy, low-life addicts. I think our taxpayer dollars could have been better spent on actually providing homes for the homeless. What do you think?\Shame on our elected officials, city staff and the DSP for authorizing and spending these funds in this mean-spirited and worthless manner.\Joan Medina\Spokane\REALISTIC ABOUT I-594\I am writing about I-594, the universal background check initiative. While I do wish that our country wasn't infiltrated with so many handguns, I'm a realist, and, more importantly, I respect the rights and beliefs of Americans who disagree, including many of my friends, so I accept that privately owned guns are here to stay.\Please put away any fears of a systematic government weapon seizure; there are far too many registered gun owners for any agency to do so without the alarm sounding. And there are no plots to ban firearms.\I don't think there is any solid reason to vote against the universal background checks called for by I-594. Any legal semantic problems with the initiative's exact wording (preventing borrowing a weapon at a firing range, for example), would be quickly fixed through legislation. The intent of the initiative is clear.\The bottom line is: Regardless of the number of guns in criminal hands, or sold illegally to people who then commit crimes, universal background checks would prevent gun deaths without restricting the gun ownership rights of qualified Washington citizens or making anyone less safe. Please, please join me in voting I-594 into law.\Jeffrey Ellingson\Liberty Lake"
283,"
They share similar visions of the Vancouver they want: a city offering safety, good employment and recreational opportunities for its citizens, ease of travel and an identity worthy of pride.
\
But the eight people running for four positions on the City Council, including mayor, represent a broad range of experience and approaches.
\
No matter which City Council candidates come out ahead on Nov. 4, east Vancouver will be a winner. Five of the eight candidates are residents of the newly annexed area, and because of the way the races divide up, east Vancouver is guaranteed at least two representatives on the seven-member council.
\
Thats important to many residents who were annexed into the city but felt cheated out of real influence. The City Council added two unpaid, nonvoting members to represent annexed east Vancouver this year only.
\
In 1998, those temporary positions will disappear, and the council will return to a seven-member board. Both ad hoc council members are running for permanent council positions.
\
Council members earn $750 per month and serve four-year terms. The mayor makes $1,150 per month and serves a two-year term.
\
Here are summaries of the races:
\
Burkman vs. Baker
\
In the Position 2 race, ad hoc Councilman Bob Baker, the owner of a small hydraulic equipment business, faces Jack Burkman, a Hewlett-Packard Co. engineering manager and longtime neighborhood activist and planner. Both men are from Cascade Park.
\
Burkman, who has served on the Clark County Planning Commission, describes himself as a problem solver who pays particular attention to the process of getting things done. Originally a product-oriented manager, Burkman said, he has learned the hard way that product defects can be traced to process defects.
\
The citys new tree ordinance, which aims to protect trees from clear-cutting by developers, is an example, Burkman said.
\
Some kind of ordinance is necessary, but four years of tense negotiations resulted in a complex and confusing regulation, Burkman said. Developers and neighborhoods dont get what they both want: ease and predictability of application.
\
When it takes a four-year process, somethings not working right, he said. Lets take a look at how they did this.
\
Burkman wants an increase in the city ratio of six acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. That goal is too low, he said.
\
Burkman believes in a city council thats not afraid to debate the issues openly. Bond measures tend to fail, he believes, partly because citizens are suspicious of hidden agendas that may influence council members views and votes.
\
The council should be able to disagree in public, he said.
\
His opponent, Bob Baker, has proved himself unafraid of debate and disagreement. As one of two council representatives of annexed east Vancouver, Baker brings a sharp sense of scrutiny to council issues and discussions.
\
He thinks the recent rezoning of rustic Biddle Lake in east Vancouver for possible residential development was a mistake. He thinks the citys new urban camping ordinance covered subjects homelessness and perpetually parked vehicles too disparate for a single law.
\
As both matters arose, he argued his points forcefully.
\
As an ad hoc councilman, he couldnt vote.
\
Like Burkman, Baker supports creative thinking about transportation problems and a thorough exploration of all mass-transit options.
\
He decries city streets that were designed with only cars in mind.
\
There are no turnouts for bus stops, no allowances for the future, he said.
\
As we build density, it doesnt have to mean more traffic. It means we have to move more people.
\
No lover of impact fees, Baker acknowledges they are here to stay.
\
He wants longtime residents to get over what he calls an us-vs.-them mentality that blames newcomers for the costs of growth.
\
Our community is only as good as the investment we all make in it, Baker said.
\
The contest between Baker and Burkman has generated the campaigns chief controversy. Burkman has complained that Bakers materials violated election rules that reserve the term retain for incumbents.
\
Baker isnt the incumbent in the Position 2 seat being vacated by Linda Horowitz.
\
The Clark County League of Women Voters and the state Public Disclosure Commission are both studying the matter.
\
A Columbian investigation last month found Baker has defaulted on thousands of dollars of personal and business debt.
\
Unapologetic, Baker said the ups and down of his business history have prepared him well for the tough decisions the city council faces.
\
Sannes vs. Harris
\
John Sannes, a C-Tran bus driver, faces Jeanne Harris, a small-business consultant and ad hoc council member, in the Position 3 race.
\
Both candidates also come from annexed east Vancouver.
\
Harris describes herself as very passionate about social issues, and she wants the City Council to get more involved in promoting collaborations between government, nonprofit and educational agencies.
\
For example, shed like to get schools working with social-service agencies to provide supervised after-school homework sessions and other resources for at-risk youth.
\
What happens to youth with problems right now? she said. There are no facilities in our community for a kid thats got problems.
\
She supports development of light industry in Camas-style corporate parks in Vancouver so residents can both avoid the commute and enrich their own community with consumer and tax dollars.
\
When our money goes south, it doesnt come back, Harris said.
\
We need to find ways to keep it here.
\
Transportation is a key, Harris said.
\
She wants to customize C-Tran van-pool routes for those major employers; she also envisions a light-rail system that runs along Mill Plain Boulevard, connecting downtown with a new east Vancouver transit center.
\
Transportation issues top the agenda of her opponent, Sannes, who wants stepped up planning for road maintenance, road improvements and new construction. East Vancouver interchanges are in need of attention, he said.
\
Sannes wants C-Tran to expand its operations and pay special attention to convenient services for riders.
\
Sannes opposes raising impact fees and favors increasing local gas taxes by up to half a penny per gallon to help pay for schools. Impact fees are keeping people from buying houses, he said. A slight increase in the gas tax would be easy for people to swallow.
\
In fact, cities dont have the authority to raise gas taxes and gas taxes can only be used for building roads.
\
Sannes, who ran for the Board of County Commissioners last year, said he goes to neighborhood meetings as often as he can. I believe I would get the voice of the people onto the City Council, he said.
\
Pinzone vs. Jollota
\
A sharp philosophical distinction between candidates is apparent in the Position 1 race. Competing are Joe Pinzone, a fiscally conservative corporate executive, and Pat Jollota, a two-term City Council incumbent whose focus is quality of life.
\
Pinzone, a vice president at Sharp Microelectronics Technology Inc. in Camas, has positioned himself as a traditional conservative tough on waste and spending.
\
He wants to scrutinize the citys budget and review those details with an independent auditor, he said.
\
The council is not getting the depth of information it needs on budget matters, Pinzone said. It needs to be more assertive, to ask questions, to get tougher with city staff.
\
Pinzone has attacked the citys controversial new tree and archaeological ordinances as costing more, and achieving less, than they were designed to do.
\
We want to make this an environment friendly to business, he said.
\
We need to stop passing ordinances that drive up the cost of development and doing business. Those costs are only passed on to consumers, he said, whether theyre looking for affordable homes or weighing support for expensive bond measures.
\
Jollota, his opponent, has come out squarely in favor of both rules as forcing developers interested in profits above all else to include the quality of life in their moneymaking plans.
\
This isnt intended to penalize everyone, Jollota said of the tree ordinance.
\
There are some good developers who do very good work. This is intended to stop abusive, clear-cutting.
\
A Los Angeles police dispatcher for 22 years, Jollota has made public safety her top priority, leading grass-roots fund-raising efforts to provide city firefighters with thermal-imaging helmets.
\
She supports beefed-up training for public-safety officials and wants to study the possibility of the Vancouver Fire Department providing basic ambulance service.
\
As development progresses in downtown and other areas of the city, Jollota wants special emphasis to be placed on safety and crime deterrence through building design. She frequently cites the example of Minneapolis, Minn., where pedestrian skyways were planned and lit in a way that keeps them remarkably crime-free.
\
Pollard vs. Olson
\
Incumbent Mayor Royce Pollard has taken advantage of a strong showing in the Sept. 16 primary to advance a new and potentially unpopular idea: seeking bistate support for tolls on both the Interstate 5 and I-205 bridges.
\
That would generate untold millions of dollars in cash and bonding capacity, Pollard said. That could fix every transportation problem weve got. That would do it all.
\
The idea might never happen, but Pollard said he would lead a discussion on the issue in his second term.
\
Pollard has led the charge to redevelop downtown Vancouver as a cultural and business base. Its a smart business decision, he said, because downtown has been a tax user for years and produced nothing. Now it will become an economic engine and an area all Vancouver can be extremely proud of.
\
Pollard also pointed with pride to the citys Columbia River waterfront development in the past 10 years and the growth of neighborhood associations.
\
Ten years ago there were seven neighborhood associations. Now there are more than 40.
\
Pollards challenger, telecommunications salesman Matthew Olson, says Pollard is retired and hes doing this as kind of a hobby. Im closer to what real people out there are.
\
Olson has said he thinks Pollard is doing a fine job but insists he not the incumbent has the energy required to lead the city.
\
As mayor, he said, he would retain Pollards emphasis on downtown redevelopment. Any successful city has a thriving downtown, he said.
\
Olson wants to see the city search for more opportunities to make money without raising taxes; one example, he said, is a more efficient recycling system.
\
He suggested offering citizens the opportunity to vote on key issues once per month.
\
The city government shouldnt be making major decisions the citizens should be making those major decisions. They should tell the government what it should do.
\
Key to Olsons candidacy is his insistence that the city become much friendlier to fledgling small businesses. His experience in starting a lunch stand a few years ago convinced him that the city permit process is unfriendly to small-scale entrepreneurship.
\
The city should publish how-to manuals and offer tax breaks to small businesses, he said. Theres got to be a plan to help them, he said.

"
284,"
In Clark County and across the state, headlines were dominated in late 1999 by an anti-tax, anti-government revolt and the state ballot measure that channeled those feelings into a law taking effect today. The Columbian has selected Initiative 695 as the top local story of the year.
\
The top 10 Clark County news stories of 1999 also include the building boom in and the hopes for downtown Vancouver, growth across Clark County, the fight over the proposed amphitheater at the fairgrounds, teens in trouble and tension in the Columbia River Gorge.
\
Here are the top 10 stories of the year, as selected by a poll of Columbian newsroom employees:
\
1) Initiative 695
\
Twenty people who had jobs at the Southwest Washington Health District in Vancouver this week won't be reporting to work Monday morning. Their jobs and 10 other vacant positions were eliminated, effective today, in the wake of Initiative 695's approval by state voters in November.
\
With the jobs will go functions of the local agency's lab, where water and blood tests routinely were done for the public. Other cutbacks will be less obvious to outsiders, but presumably could result in reductions or slowdowns in service.
\
The campaign on I-695, its passage and preparations for its implementation accounted for The Columbian's top story of 1999. The story will be a dominant force in 2000 as well. For example, cuts in C-Tran bus routes here are expected, and plans already are on hold for construction of an interchange at state Highway 14 between Cascade Park and Camas, among others that had been set for the county.
\
How it shakes out over the long haul depends on state lawmakers and the governor in the upcoming legislative session and on the State Supreme Court, which some students of government predict will rule I- 695 unconstitutional.
\
In the meantime, I-695's repeal of the state Motor Vehicle Excise Tax is saving most Washington families several hundred dollars a year while putting a $750 million annual hole in the state's income picture.
\
2) Downtown revitalization
\
Vancouver officials spent 1998 talking about redeveloping their dilapidated downtown.
\
In 1999, they stopped talking and started doing. The results to date: more than $200 million worth of projects proposed, started or completed.
\
Ground was broken during 1999 for the upscale $25 million Heritage Place condominiums near Esther Short Park. The park was closed for half the year for its own facelift.
\
A Portland developer decided to build a $21.5 million six-story office-residential-commercial building where motorists enter downtown from Interstate 5 northbound and state Highway 14.
\
After years of searching, Vancouver found a developer willing to spend $60 million to redevelop the former Lucky Lager brewery site.
\
City officials, boosted by strong support from all but one member of Southwest Washington's legislative delegation, persuaded the 1999 Legislature to approve a sales tax credit to help finance a $75 million-plus sports arena-convention center-hotel complex.
\
The year was not without downtown setbacks. More Vancouver residents started questioning the wisdom of the special events center. Kaiser Permanente pulled out of the Prestige Place project, a proposed 12-story office building north of the brewery property.
\
And the Vancouver City Council's decision to condemn the Monterey Hotel rankled some who believe the city is heavy-handed in deciding what should stay and what should go in downtown.
\
3) Amphitheater
\
A proposed 18,000-seat amphitheater is likely to loom even larger in 2000 than it did in 1999.
\
It was big in 1999. The $10.1 million theater was the subject of many acrimonious public meetings.
\
It delighted city promoters who saw its potential for making Vancouver an entertainment beacon between Seattle and Eugene, Ore.
\
It horrified many of the venue's neighbors who worried about the noise, traffic and devaluation of their property.
\
While the organization Stop the Amphitheater Today continues to fight the amphitheater in Clark County Superior Court, county officials plan to sign a lease with the theater builders, Q Prime, a New York-based company.
\
STAT vows to fight the amphitheater all the way to the state Supreme Court, but county commissioners stand behind the theater, which would cover 134 acres of the 212-acre county fairgrounds, including associated parking.
\
4) Growth
\
The streak came to an end in 1999.
\
For three straight years, Columbian reporters and editors voted growth as the year's biggest story.
\
In 1999, the story could muster no more than fourth place.
\
Population estimates indicate that Clark County added 9,000 people during the 12-month period that ended March 31. The 2.74 percent increase, still heavy by traditional measures, was the smallest increase seen during the 1990s, a period when Clark County grew by as much as 5 percent in a single year.
\
Growth is still a huge issue in the community, particularly with the Mill Plain Boulevard corridor east of Interstate 205 shut down to more development because of traffic problems.
\
Schools struggled to keep up with surging enrollment. Cities looked for ways to pay for road projects in a post-695 environment. And county government imposed a new fee to clean up dirty runoff that has contributed to the decline of salmon and other species now afforded protection under the federal Endangered Species Act.
\
5) Teens in trouble
\
Six Clark County teens are awaiting trial for murder in Clark County Superior Court. On April 1, 18-year-old Ryan May and Jacob Gamble, then 19, were charged with second-degree murder in the death of 18-year-old Daniel Carroll, who died from being kicked in the head at a crowded Vancouver house party. On May 5, a judge ruled Michael Thomas Humphreys, 14, would be tried as an adult on charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder in the September 1998 shooting of Ridgefield residents Jay and Kim Kennedy. On Dec. 3, Tiffany Williams, 17, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in connection with the death of her father, Clinton Williams of Washougal. Also charged were Tiffany's boyfriend, 16-year-old Kollin Folsom, and friend Jason Shrader, 19. Police also arrested Elijah Klar, 17, as an accomplice to murder but prosecutors have yet to file charges.
\
The May and Gamble trial is set for Jan. 31; Humphreys' trial is set for Feb. 7; and trial for Williams, Folsom and Shrader is set for Feb. 22.
\
6) Transportation
\
For more than 15 years, plans for renovation of Interstate 5 from Main Street north sat on the shelf, waiting for money to dust them off.
\
In 1999, it finally happened, and the $41 million rehab was off and running. The year also marked high-gear movement of the Mill Plain Extension project, a much-talked-about industrial route between I-5 and the west Vancouver industrial area that also had waited years for funding. Still another aging highway idea was rejuvenated by bulldozers, backhoes and truckloads of money: The first segment of the Padden Expressway, first proposed more than 20 years ago, was opened to traffic.
\
The year also saw notable events in Washington-Oregon transportation issues, including start of a repainting job on half of the Interstate 5 Bridge. In August, relations between some public officials on both sides of the river hit a sizeable chuckhole when Metro Councilor Jon Kvistad proposed that Washington commuters be tolled to cross the I-5 Bridge to pay for Oregon highway projects.
\
That brought caustic rebuttal, and things were apparently smoothed over when Kvistad and other members of a bistate transportation committee later voted unanimously for a proposed Oregon highway projects list that would provide some money toward the breaking of a southbound I-5 bottleneck at Delta Park.
\
But that depends on Oregon voter support in spring for a gas tax increase there.
\
7) Shoalwater Bay
\
Plans by the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe to build 1,580 town- houses at the Ridgefield Junction turned into nothing more than talk in 1999.
\
News of the tribe's plans last spring sent city and county officials scrambling to respond to a project that could have turned Clark County's 20-year comprehensive Growth Management Plan on its head.
\
But as the new year begins, things continue to look up for local officials and residents.
\
New legislation approved last fall will require the tribe to reach a ""legally enforceable agreement"" with the county before the land can be accepted into federal trust and removed from property tax rolls.
\
Tribal leaders have made no effort to contact county officials after announcing plans in October to change their town-house proposal to a more palatable industrial or mixed-use development.
\
It's possible, though, that the entire project could disappear this year if a lawsuit against the Shoalwaters progresses.
\
The couple who signed the land over to them as an apparent donation are alleging a deed conveying the property to the tribe was mistakenly executed and recorded.
\
8) Michael Gallatin guilty
\
On June 21, 38-year-old Michael Wayne Gallatin was convicted by a Clark County jury of raping five women. The three-week trial gave jurors a course on DNA evidence, which senior deputy prosecutor Tom Duffy relied on to tie Gallatin to the attacks that dated to 1993. All five victims testified, including two women whose young children had been sleeping in the next room during those attacks. While Duffy asked for the maximum sentence under state law ---- 47 years and four months ---- Superior Court Judge Robert Harris handed down an ""exceptional"" sentence of 60 years. The longer sentence was for the fifth victim: After raping the woman three times, Gallatin sodomized her before leaving her Vancouver mall-area apartment in April 1998. Harris gave him 26 years for that rape alone.
\
Gallatin is at the Clallam Bay Corrections Center awaiting a hearing on his extradition to Oregon, where he faces a murder charge in the 1997 death of a Clackamas woman.
\
9) Columbia River Gorge politics
\
Politically speaking, it was a busy year in the Columbia River Gorge.
\
In January, the Columbia River Gorge Commission ruled that Brian and Jody Bea's partially completed house, prominently visible on a bluff near Prindle, violated the Gorge Management Act and must be moved. In July, Clark County Superior Court Judge James Ladley ruled in a lawsuit by Skamania County that the commission had acted properly. The matter is on appeal.
\
The commission's executive director, Jonathan Doherty, resigned in June. In November, Claire Puchy replaced him. After two years of politically motivated budget cuts, the commission got its funding restored and gained several new members, including two from Vancouver.
\
A controversy over property appraisals in the Gorge Scenic Area stalled land purchases and prompted U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton to freeze funds for new acquisitions.
\
Washougal city officials floated the idea of expanding their urban growth boundary into the Scenic Area; the watchdog group Friends of the Columbia River Gorge said it would never support a major boundary change, which would require an act of Congress.
\
10) Waterfront development
\
Vancouver continued to tap the riches that the Columbia River waterfront holds.
\
Tidewater Cove was the biggest waterfront project announced during 1999. PNW Realty Inc. agreed to purchase 37 acres from the Ray Hickey family. The Lake Oswego, Ore., company wants to build a $120 million project that includes more than 300 town house condominiums, two office buildings, at least one restaurant and a marina.
\
California-based Trammell Crow also began construction on a $25 million rental town home project known as Parc Riata at Columbia Shores near the popular Beaches and McMenamins restaurants.
\
Residents enjoyed more of the river last year with the July opening of a waterfront trail through Tidewater Cove. Walkers, joggers and cyclists can follow a lighted 14-foot-wide path from Esther Short Park in downtown Vancouver to the outskirts of Wintler Park on the Columbia River.
\
Development wasn't all residential. In September, the Port of Vancouver dedicated its $17 million rebuilt Terminal 2.
\
The next 10 top stories
\
Staff members also selected an additional 10 stories that were important to Clark County:
\
* Voters in Camas, Evergreen and Washougal school districts passed school bond measures.
\
* The year had an up-and-down job market in Clark County, which included WaferTech's expansion and Hewlett-Packard's 350 job cuts.
\
* An e-coli bacteria outbreak in Battle Ground Lake made 34 people sick in the latter part of the summer swimming season.
\
* Philanthropists George and Carolyn Propstra donated millions more to the Vancouver School District, and Clark County's Richard Hermanson gave $500,000 to Michigan schools.
\
* Leslie Zolbe, a 12-year-old Salmon Creek girl, received an outpouring of 4,000 people's support, as they had their blood tested to find a bone marrow donor for her. In early September, Leslie received a transplant. Despite passing the 100-day post-transplant milestone, she developed some complications that required additional testing.
\
* Allegations of sexual assaults on the campus of Washington State School for the Deaf in Vancouver resulted in parent protests and a blue-ribbon committee to examine concerns and ways to improve the school.
\
* The city of Vancouver paid 15-year-old Lieshell Booth $800,000 for a 1997 incident in which a flash-bang grenade she found in an abandoned police training site blew off one of her hands.
\
* The group running the Columbia Arts Center folded, and the former church is for sale by its owner, the city of Vancouver.
\
* A proposal to deepen the Columbia River shipping channel cleared several hurdles.
\
* The folk-art ""Rainbow House"" in downtown Vancouver was sold to the county and later demolished to make room for a parking structure.

"
285,"Famed physicist Albert Einstein, who knew a thing or two about time, wasn't too worried about what was on the horizon.\""I never think about the future,"" Einstein told a gaggle of reporters aboard an ocean liner docked in New York in December 1930. ""It comes soon enough.""\With apologies to the professor, today marks the start of a new decade in Spokane, and perhaps now is the time to think about our future. The 2020s are projected to include the completion of major public works projects in the Inland Northwest, along with changes to the way we learn and communicate with each other. Perhaps most important to Spokane's residents is the performance of a certain basketball team that soared to new heights in the 2010s, setting themselves up to potentially crest the mountaintop in the next 10 years.\Here are a few stories you can expect to read about in the pages of The Spokesman-Review before 2029.\The Gonzaga's men's basketball team hangs a national championship banner at The Kennel: At the risk of jinxing one of the most successful basketball programs in the NCAA over the past 10 seasons, the Bulldogs have been priming themselves to hoist the national championship trophy for the better part of a decade.\Gonzaga has made five straight trips to the Sweet 16, the longest such streak in the country. And they've done it by adapting their style of play and incorporating new, young players into a tradition of winning basketball, said Jim Meehan, who covers the Zags for The Spokesman-Review.\""What's really changed is that now every year, they seem to have a shot,"" Meehan said.\Winning the NCAA Tournament is a gantlet where one slip-up in March can derail a season. The Zags found that out the hard way in 2013, falling as a No. 1 seed in the round of 32 to underdog Wichita State. Their current streak of Sweet 16-or-better finishes began two years later, with the team reaching the national championship game in 2017.\Strong finishes in the WCC regular season have begat favorable seeding in the conference tournament, which has resulted in favorable seeding for the NCAA Tournament, Meehan said. This year's team, which closed the calendar year at No. 1 in both the AP and USA Today/Coaches Poll rankings, is also likely headed for another 30-win season, which will put them in contention come March.\""I think the expectations now are enormous,"" Meehan said.\Still, if this run from Mark Few and his squad continues, it's only a matter of time before the Zags are celebrating a championship down Spokane Falls Boulevard.\Spokane continues to grapple with opioid and nicotine addiction, vaccine-preventable diseases and heat-related problems: What's old will likely be new again in the field of public health in Spokane, said Bob Lutz, the health officer for the Spokane Regional Health District.\The region's struggle to deal with the fallout of over-prescription of opioid painkillers, the damaging health effects of climate change and children getting hooked on nicotine are all likely to continue to be challenges in the new decade.\""Unfortunately, what we're seeing now is kids are being introduced to tobacco, unbeknownst to them,"" said Lutz, referring to the exploding popularity of vaping among the area's school-age population.\A 2018 study published in the journal Tobacco Control found that 63% of survey respondents between the ages of 15 and 24 who reported using the popular vaping product Juul were unaware it contained nicotine. In Spokane County, 27% of 10th graders reported using e-cigarette products in the past 30 days in a 2018 survey conducted by the health district.\Lutz said that showed younger people were getting hooked on the drug through means other than cigarettes. With regulators now pushing to ban certain flavors and restrict sales to those age 21 and older, many e-cigarette users may return to more traditional sources of nicotine in the coming decade because of their addiction, Lutz said.\""It's definitely an issue in the past, and it will definitely be one going forward,"" he said.\That's also true of opioid abuse. Even though prescriptions for addictive painkillers have fallen since their peak in Spokane County in 2008, Lutz said, the number of overdose deaths on substitute, illicit drugs such as heroin and methamphetamine continue to climb in the region, according to statistics compiled by the Medical Examiner's Office.\""With fewer prescribers, and all kinds of regulations and guidelines, people are turning to illicit substances to take the place of opioids, including heroin and fentanyl,"" Lutz said.\Another area of concern for the health district is the declining number of children vaccinated against preventable diseases, and the return of illnesses that have been eradicated or reduced by herd immunity.\Susan Sjoberg, manager of the health district's program promoting immunization against communicable diseases, said recent resurgences of whooping cough in Spokane and the measles in Western Washington portend future battles against illnesses once considered eradicated.\""That's what we spend a lot of our time, now, doing,"" Sjoberg said of promoting inoculation.\Spokane is also in the midst of a hepatitis A outbreak that began in June among unvaccinated adults, Sjoberg said.\It's too soon to say whether a measure passed in 2019 by the state Legislature limiting the exemptions to vaccination that parents can seek for their schoolchildren, and a requirement that administration of those vaccines be medically verified, will have an effect going forward, she said.\The other potential major driver of public health news in the 2020s will be the changing climate, Lutz said. In addition to wildfire smoke concerns, drier and hotter summers will have the largest impact on those who can't afford climate control in their homes and on those living on the street.\""The elderly, the really young and the homeless are much more susceptible to heat-related problems,"" he said.\Wearing your reality on your face: At the beginning of the 2010s, virtual reality was still relegated to the arcades and the excited talk of Trekkies dreaming of a real-life holodeck.\But social media juggernaut Facebook turned heads in 2014 when it spent $2 billion to acquire Oculus, an up-and-coming tech firm developing a virtual reality headset. The company had sold 3.6 million of its headsets between the beginning of 2018 and July, according to figures released by market research firm SuperData.\While there are still many skeptical of the technology's ability to breakthrough to the average consumer, others are more bullish on the potential of virtual reality. Or, perhaps, augmented reality, which blends the real world and heads-up displays to create a unique experience for the user.\""I picture walking into a grocery store, and walking down the cereal aisle while wearing AR glasses, and all of the cereal boxes are moving,"" said Rand Miller, who co-created Cyan Worlds, the Mead-based video game developer responsible for the hit '90s computer-game franchise ""Myst.""\Miller has been moving his company more toward the virtual reality space, first with ""Obduction,"" an adventure game created for traditional PCs that the company later rebuilt for virtual reality headsets. Now, Cyan is working on ""Firmament,"" a video game intended to be played on VR equipment, including the Rift.\The advent of augmented reality, the likes of which Miller sees in the future, doesn't come without its social pitfalls. Miller has watched his young relatives playing VR games in a crowded living room, unaware of each other's existence. VR pushes people away from each other, he said, while augmented reality leaves the possibility for human contact.\""In 2026, or '27, my wife and I will be sitting on the sofa and I'll say, 'Do you want to watch Netflix?' "" Miller said. ""And with my hands, I'll draw a screen on the wall, and I pick what we're going to watch.""\There's also the problem of people experiencing their own realities in real-time, unaware of what someone else in the room is seeing. While the technology holds great potential for informing and entertaining the public, it runs the risk of furthering the divide between people, a scenario Miller said he's very much aware of.\""There's a 'Black Mirror' aspect to all of this,"" Miller said, referencing the TV series that explores the potential evil present in technological advances.\Sixth-graders in Spokane will start to attend middle school: Over the next five years, students in Spokane Public Schools will experience middle school more like a majority of American public school children.\Beginning in fall 2021, sixth graders will start attending three-year middle schools throughout the city. The transition, which will take place over four years in phases throughout Spokane, is taking place after voters approved $495 million in construction bonds in 2018. That money will be used, in part, to build three new middle schools and replace the existing Shaw, Glover and Sacajawea middle schools.\The new schools will be built on land near the rebuilt Joe Albi Stadium in the Northwest neighborhood, on former Water Department property off North Foothills Drive near Gonzaga Prep and on the South Hill near Mullan Road Elementary.\Moving sixth graders to a new building will ease crowding in the district's elementary buildings, and was approved by 91% of respondents to a districtwide survey in 2018.\The exact date of the switch, and which students will attend which school, is still being worked out by the district.\Motorists will be zipping from Interstate 90 to Wandermere on the highway... maybe: Spokane's white whale of a public transportation project has a current expected completion date of 2029, but that long-sought day may be delayed further after voters statewide passed an initiative limiting car tab fees.\Much of the funding for the 10.5-mile-long highway, connecting the Wander-mere area to the Thor and Freya interchange near Interstate 90, comes from gas tax fees.\But in an op-ed penned earlier this month, Washington Department of Transportation Secretary Roger Millar conceded that Initiative 976 had caused the state agency to put some of the work on hold while lawmakers determine how to move forward with future budget priorities.\The decision has angered some conservative groups, which argue the move was an attempt to put pressure on the courts and public to overturn the initiative.\Beth Bousley, a spokeswoman for the department's Eastern Region, said in an email this week that any revisions to the completion date won't be known until after the state Legislature approves its biennial budget this spring.\When it is completed, the $1.5 billion project will reduce the time to drive from I-90 to Wandermere to 12 minutes. Lawmakers are bullish on the possibility of freight moving quickly to the region from Canada and not clogging area roads, including Division Street.\Brush fires, smoke likely to continue in the region, but their annual severity could vary: The smoke and constant reports of brush fires are likely to continue in Eastern Washington, but their severity is up for some debate and will likely depend on how much fire-prone growth is thinned from the region's forests in the coming decade.\A 2013 study by the College of Environment at the University of Washington used climate modeling to predict that 800,000 acres of forestland would burn in Washington state annually, beginning in the 2020s. That projection is based upon greenhouse gas emissions and climate data, and concluded that areas of the ""Palouse Prairie"" that would burn by the 2040s would be double that of previous years, as well as more widespread fires in areas of the state that rarely burned.\Portions of that prediction have already come true. The Washington Department of Natural Resources reported this year more fires starting west of the Cascades, causing the Legislature to approve larger-than-normal funds for wildfire fighting and suppression.\Since 2014, the number of acres reported burned in the state has exceeded the 10-year average four times, including exceeding 1 million acres during the 2015 firefighting season.\But in 2016 and this year, fire totals were much closer to the lower end of the spectrum. That's evidence of wildfire totals regressing to the mean after years of anomalies, said Cliff Mass, a professor of atmospheric sciences at UW.\""The difference was, the meteorology was very different,"" Mass said of this year's less severe fire season. ""We had more moisture in 2019 and it wasn't as hot.""\While fire and smoke totals could grow to the heights seen in 2015, 2017 and 2018, those years were outliers, Mass said. His writing, including a popular meteorological blog, has drawn some criticism from environmental groups for being too conservative in their estimates of climate change's effects.\Downtown travelers will hop aboard the electric Central City Line bus in 2022: Spokane Transit Authority is still aiming for May 2022 for completion of its Central City Line, a modern electric bus that is intended to move 1 million passengers between Browne's Addition and Spokane Community College each year.\STA is in its final design phase for the line, and in 2019 secured all the funding necessary to complete the $92 million project.\Planners said earlier this fall that passage of I-976, which has put the completion date of the North Spokane Corridor in question, won't affect the Central City Line work, and the agency confirmed that in an email this week.\Construction is scheduled to begin in the spring.\When completed, passengers will be able to hop aboard the bus in Browne's Addition and make stops at the STA Plaza, the Spokane Convention Center, the University District and the community college, as well as other major intersections downtown. During peak operation times in the morning and evening, an electric bus would arrive at each station every 71/2 minutes.\Political campaigns continue to spend big, use unregulated social media space to spread their messages: Political candidates will likely look to digital advertising more and more in the next decade, forcing social media groups to develop an approach to misinformation, said Travis Ridout, a professor of government and public policy at Washington State University who specializes in political advertising.\""They're going to continue to use big data in order to micro-target their messages,"" he said.\Facebook and Twitter have both had to respond to charges originating during the 2016 presidential election that their platforms had been used to spread falsehoods damaging the prospects of candidates.\Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded by pledging the platform would ban political ads, a promise that has been met with skepticism as the social media giant tries to develop policies to implement the ban. And Facebook has said it will not do its own fact-checking of content promoted on its platform.\That leaves Congress to try and develop some public policy around campaign messaging, a scenario that doesn't seem likely given the current partisan climate in Washington, D.C., Ridout said.\""In part, Congress is constrained by a court that equates political speech with free speech,"" he said, referring to the landmark Citizens United decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010, which paved the way for more dark money groups to involve themselves in political campaigns.\Such spending has filtered down to the local level, as independent expenditures - political communication made on behalf of a candidate without their involvement - ballooned in the 2019 Spokane municipal elections, totaling more than three quarters of a million dollars.\Ridout said it's uncertain when that type of spending could be seen again at the local level, but it will be another four years before so many political seats are up for grabs in Spokane.\""It seems it kind of goes in bursts and spurts,"" Rid-out said of local spending.\Contact the writer:\(509) 459-5429\kiph@spokesman.com\Ahead\CREDIT: Kip Hill | The Spokesman-Review"
286,"Here is the third in a series of reports in which Spokane Valley City Council candidates address issues in their own words.\All the candidates were asked the same questions. They were given a maximum of 1,100 words, to be distributed as they pleased.\This installment features the city's most crowded council race, which pits two retired ministers, a teacher and a developer.\One of the retired ministers is incumbent City Councilman Ian Robertson, 72. He was appointed Aug. 4 to fill the position Councilman Steve Taylor vacated on June 30.\Robertson's best-known challenger is developer Dean Grafos, 66, who has been one of the leading critics of the city's Sprague-Appleway Revitalization Plan. Until recently, Grafos also was a major contributor to a now-failed disincorporation drive.\The other challengers are retired minister Ed Pace, 62, and substitute teacher Ed Foote, 36.\The Aug. 18 primary election was over when a special filing period for Robertson's position was conducted in late August, so the race may be decided by a plurality instead of a majority.\State law says whoever gets the most votes gets the job. No runoff election is required.\Question: What in your education or experience qualifies you to represent Spokane Valley residents?\Foote: I have spent almost my entire life, except for 1 1/2 years, living in Spokane Valley. All of my schooling has been done in Spokane Valley and in the Spokane area. I am a certified teacher, and that means that I work with the youth of Spokane Valley every work day, and their parents indirectly, as a substitute teacher. I voted for incorporation as soon as I was old enough to vote, and when it came up to vote. I ran for the city council during the first election, along with 48 others. I've run twice for 4th legislative district state House of Representatives position 2, which got me to ring doorbells, meet and talk to voters anywhere I could, and talk about and research the issues that are on voters' minds. I am now a precinct committee officer for my precinct, 4429, as their Democratic representative at the most local level.\Grafos: I've lived in the Valley almost 40 years, married into a Valley family and raised two children in this special place. I'm an Eastern Washington University grad, a real estate broker and have many years of successful experience in land development, construction and sustainable business models, in addition to community and church work. I am invested in this community personally and professionally as a tax-paying business and property owner and employer. I am dedicated to maintaining our quality of life and economic vitality.\Pace: Representatives/ councilpersons must be able to listen, study, deliberate, and stand firm.\Listen: As a pastor I excelled at listening to folks going through crisis and facilitating resolution and healing. I also became very good at listening to entire congregations and either determining the consensus of the whole group or identifying and understanding the various factions.\Study: As an English major (B.A. from EWU), a graduate student (M.Div. from Trinity Lutheran Seminary), and a technical marketing professional (Hewlett-Packard) I became skilled at wading into complex problems, studying them, and articulating the essence of the issues involved.\Deliberate: From serving in leadership roles in the U.S. Army (1st lieutenant), electronics industry (supervisor and product manager), and in churches (pastor), I developed exceptional skills in meeting leadership, group problem solving, facilitating process improvement, and resolving conflicts.\Standing Firm: As a pastor, I excelled at standing firm once a decision was made, even in the face of severe, angry criticism.\Robertson: In education, I received my diploma in theology from Nazarene Theological College, Manchester, England. I received my Bachelor's of Divinity from Nazarene Theological Seminary, Kansas City, Mo. I was certified in production and inventory management from American Production and Inventory Control Society.\I have led nonprofit organizations for 50 years. I formed a non-profit organization to operate the HUB Regional Sports Center. I served on the Planning Commission since the incorporation of Spokane Valley, participating in the development of our comprehensive plan, the associated development regulations, and the Sprague-Appleway Revitalization Plan.\Q: As a City Council member, would you vote to place disincorporation before voters? Why, or why not?\Foote: I wouldn't vote to place disincorporation before voters, because that was already done back in 2006, and voters turned it down in bigger numbers than those who voted against incorporation in 2002. It must be acknowledged that a large number of Spokane Valley residents are upset over higher taxes since incorporation, especially those imposed by the County, but putting the city into receivership (if disincorporation passes) makes no sense to me.\Editor's note: Spokane Valley residents have never voted on disincorporation. There were unsuccessful petition drives in 2003, 2005 and this year.\Grafos: If elected, I'll help shape a sustainable budget and influence the direction and tone of this city to better serve the community. Valley citizens and businesses have often been marginalized, met with confrontation, obstructionism, and arrogance. Their frustration takes many forms, notably the movement to place disincorporation on the ballot. Over 40 percent of the registered voters signing the petitions is a true ""report card"" on citizen dissatisfaction. Signing the petition for a RE-VOTE is a perfect example of our democracy in action.\Since last summer, however, unfavorable annexation actions resurfaced in Washington making disincorporation a risky option. Thus, I won't put this issue on the ballot unless bankruptcy looms. I'll work for a well-managed, business-friendly community that fuels job creation and appreciates its citizens. I am committed to working within the system to rein in explosive spending and change the tone at City Hall.\Pace: Yes, the residents of Spokane Valley should vote on disincorporation. Any time public concern over an issue rises to the level that petitions are circulated, signs sprout like weeds, and folks won't stop talking about it - public study, debate, and popular vote are needed.\Robertson: I would not. My life has been one of bringing people together to meet goals. Disincorporation would split the community. I am a team player. Together, we need to develop the vision and goals that reflect all of our local ambitions and values. As a planning commissioner, I have listened carefully, read, and weighed every side of each issue. We have to start with a plan for the future. Now let's work together to make Spokane Valley the City of Choice for all of us. ""If we put the present against the past, we will lose the future."" -Winston Churchill.\Q: Would you keep or overturn the Sprague-Appleway Revitalization Plan? What about letting voters decide? Do you think they would confirm the plan or scrap it?\Foote: I agree, for the most part, with the Sprague-Appleway Revitalization Plan, except for one thing: there are no plans for a future light rail track and light-rail stations at all. All of the proposed plans for a city center, with the exception of the above plan, show a light-rail track and a central station with park-and-ride space as a central component. In fact, it was the Spokane Transit Authority's light-rail plans that first showed a city center for Spokane Valley. I think that more work needs to be done before putting the measure in front of voters, but I can't say for sure if the plan would pass or not as is.\Grafos: Overturn. The SARP is ironically less about revitalization and more about transferring wealth from many small businesses and property owners to a select few in the U-City area through a reallocation of retail entitlements and special-interest zoning. By destroying the value of hundreds of parcels outside this area through slow-death nonconformity and down-zoning, the city hopes to force people and businesses to relocate to U-City, leaving the prosperous eastern part to wither away. It is a misuse of power. Costing almost a million dollars, this plan also includes a costly city hall and traffic revisions for the couplet, Appleway and Sprague.\I'll never reject voter input. The voters do need, however, informed choices to accomplish revitalization where all benefit. ""A rising tide lifts all boats."" As for confirmation, the consultant for the SARP said the plan would not work without a library at U-City, a proposal voters soundly rejected. I also believe, though citizen's desire revitalization in some form, they reject spending millions for this questionable plan and new city hall. America is a free market-driven economy, not a ""planned"" economy.\Pace: I would vote to overturn it. But, I would push for putting it on the ballot and letting the voters decide. I believe they would scrap the plan.\Robertson: I would definitely keep it. All organizations need to have a plan for the future. As the old saying goes, ""If we fail to plan, we plan to fail."" However, any plan, whether a moon-shot or enhancing our city, must be subject to midcourse corrections to meet changing circumstances and environments. Somehow we've forgotten that the purpose of the plan is to revitalize Sprague and Appleway, resulting in new jobs, increased property values, and exciting new opportunities for businesses. State law prohibits voters from deciding this issue. It is the responsibility of the council after receiving extensive community input.\Q: If you want to scrap the plan, how would you revitalize Sprague and reduce the number of vacant commercial buildings?\Foote: Incorporate light rail into the city center plan.\Grafos: ""Where others see ugly, I see opportunity!"" WinCo and the alternative school come to mind. However, the anticipated SARP and the promise of huge financial gains for select U-City properties have actually hindered more development. Scrap the plan and return to the comprehensive plan zoning which helped spur Valley growth. I pledge to work tirelessly with all entities involved for our economic future including Greater Spokane Inc., the Valley Chamber of Commerce, and other interested groups. The University City area has potential, and with properties more in line with true values and some bottom-up creativity, development will follow. The market should decide, with acknowledgement of business life spans. The Valley as a whole will benefit, once again a business-friendly, job creating community. The ""new"" Building and Planning Department will remove roadblocks, not create them with additional costs and delays. Our economic vitality depends on it. Again, ""a rising tide lifts all boats.""\Pace: I would turn our free-enterprise system loose to revitalize Sprague naturally by:\A. Create tax and other incentives for businesses to locate along Sprague.\B. Remove restrictions that might discourage large retailers and manufacturers from locating in Spokane Valley, while still welcoming small businesses.\C. Make city government be totally customer-focused and passionate about helping businesses and property developers obtain permits, licenses, etc.\D. Give all the city's grant money to the Chamber of Commerce and ask them to use it to recruit businesses to the Sprague area.\Robertson: Not applicable.\Q: Do you favor the city's policy of hiring contractors whenever possible to provide municipal services? In particular, what about the city's contract with Spokane County for police service?\Foote: I supported the incorporation of the city with the understanding that it would take care of as many services as possible, doing the best job at the lowest cost. I feel that hiring the county as the biggest contractor for many services is defeating the idea of even having a city, since so many of us Valley residents were tired of high county taxes and not receiving the most efficient services. I would like to see the city take over its own police service, which would save us $1 million a year. I support private contractors only if they do a better job at a cheaper cost.\Grafos: Yes. Well-written contractual agreements, both public and private facilitate lower costs and increase efficient use of taxpayer dollars. The sheriff's contract with the city is a prime example. Not only do you gain access to additional available resources (such as SWAT teams) you limit liability and avoid prevailing wage rates and benefits based on like-size Washington cities most often found in Western Washington. Thus, though initial personnel costs may be lower for a short period of time with a city force, over time, much higher prevailing wages will be imposed through arbitration. Added to increased capital and equipment costs, police issues will be politicized and in control of a city manager who is not accountable to the voters. Remember the snowplow fiasco which now saddles us with six much-used state Department of Transportation dump trucks plowing our 438 miles of roads? An emergency declaration, an out of state contractor with a no-bid contract that excluded local tax-paying companies from participation in the bidding process.\Pace: Yes, as long as contractors are selected by a fair competitive process. The city should look at contracting with the county for more than police service - building permit administration and public works engineering for example.\Robertson: I'm for doing whatever needs to be done in the most cost-effective manner. Generally, private and public contractors provide better service, lower cost, and more flexibility. The contract for police services, led by Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich and Police Chief Rick Van Leuven, is an outstanding example. I have supported this direction from the beginning. Other examples that have been highly successful include Senske for parks, AAA Sweeping for street sweeping, and the YMCA for providing lifeguards and swimming instruction.\Q: The City Council passed a 6 percent telephone tax to help pay for street maintenance, but says it's not enough. What would you like to do?\Foote: Ask the voters to approve a bond on a long-term street maintenance and repaving program, just like Spokane did.\Grafos: Road maintenance like snowplowing is a safety and quality of life issue. Prioritize the mission of each city department; insure that the operating costs and personnel associated with that department are essential to the health, welfare and safety of the public. Eliminate all nonessential spending and reallocate special funds like the over $5 million civic building fund to cover shortfalls. Raising taxes before cutting the budget is irresponsible.\Pace: I am opposed to raising taxes. I would do the following:\A. Develop performance measures and goals for street traffic flow such as: same-day snow removal and pothole repair; continuous reduction of traffic accidents; continuous improvement in commuter satisfaction.\B. Instruct the city manager to meet the goals within the current budget and income level.\C. If the goals aren't met, replace the city manager with someone who can meet them.\Robertson: Since the incorporation of our city, citizens have made it clear that streets were to be a high priority. We were receiving $2.5 million per year from the gas tax for maintenance: sweeping, plowing, sanding, and grass mowing. Annual expenses were $4.2 million. Our staff developed a budget to keep within the $2.5 million but it required excluding all residential snowplowing. I believed that this was unacceptable and, given the few ways in which cities are permitted to raise funds, supported the 6 percent telephone tax, the same tax used by all larger cities within our state.\Q: The city is running short of money for its program of full-width street repaving after sewer construction. What would you do?\Foote: I just had my street repaved two years ago, after we finally got the sewer lines to come through my neighborhood. I was afraid that they wouldn't do full-width street repaving, but fortunately they did. What to do to continue this program? I would look at state and federal programs that could pay for the program, or look at options to have part of the money paid to Spokane County Utilities for sewer construction and service costs to go into this program.\Grafos: Again, cut the budget before imposing taxes! We must prioritize and make hard choices not lazy solutions to rein in the explosive growth of expenditures and looming deficits. The city's population increased by about 4,970 persons over the last five years but the operating budget increased by an unsustainable and staggering $10 million per year! Painting a rosy picture of a balanced city budget when all reserve funding will be depleted in four short years is irresponsible and self-serving.\Editor's note: City officials estimate that the general fund increased a total of $7.8 million, about 6 percent a year, from 2004 through 2009. An accounting change this year budgeted the anticipated $13.2 million general fund ending balance as though it were an expenditure. Most grant-funded capital projects are separate from the general fund.\Pace: Stop the program, freeze tax increases, and wait until city revenues increase through natural growth of the city. This means letting developers develop and letting businesses do business.\Robertson: I believe there is adequate money available for full-width paving in the general fund's ending fund balance and/or the service level reserve fund.\Q: Spokane Valley's best-paid employee, City Manager Dave Mercier, will earn $166,102 this year. Are city officials paid too much, too little, just enough?\Foote: Until the city can be self-sufficient and can run cheaper and more efficiently than under the county, there should be no pay raises for any elected officials. The city manager's pay is excessive considering what the average Spokane Valley resident makes. I thought that a city manager made much less than the amount stated above. Same with other city officials. It would be nice for the voters to decide on an appropriate amount, but at the same time, I know that the city is trying to find and retain top talent in city management. Still, it would be nice to make the same amount as top city officials are making at taxpayers' expense.\Grafos: If you add in benefits and allowances, not bad for a person who is here just a few days a month! For his level of education and experience, he is paid enough. However, for his top-down, authoritarian style of governance imposed upon this city, negatively changing the tone of this community and how the citizenry is responded to, he is paid way too much.\Pace: I don't know. A regional salary survey should be done for all city jobs so that pay ranges are comparable to those in similar cities. An individual's salary within his/her job's pay range should be performance-based. The City Council should develop performance measures, set performance standards, and oversee an annual performance evaluation process for all city employees. Performance measures and standards should be based on input from city residents and businesses.\Robertson: When the city was formed, we had to borrow $50,000. Now we have cash reserves of $35 million to guard against a rainy day. Anyone who can take a city from having to borrow $50,000 to a cash balance of $35 million, when other cities and counties are eliminating jobs and cutting back services, is certainly doing his job very well. His salary represents only 0.17 percent of our present budget, and studies have shown that his salary is very competitive.\Q: Would you prefer an elected mayor instead of an appointed city manager to control the city's day-to-day affairs, as in Spokane? How about a Spokane-style ward system for the City Council?\Foote: Spokane has had issues both with city managers and ""strong"" mayors. Since mayors are elected by the voters and not by seven people in the council chambers, I would prefer a mayor running day-to-day affairs. One change I would love to see is to have the city broken up by wards so that certain areas aren't over-represented by city council members like it is now. Each area of the city should have its own city council member, someone from the neighborhood.\Grafos: Approximately $1 million in payment vouchers are approved weekly by your part-time council. Fiscal accountability, responsibility and transparency are difficult under this form of government. These vouchers are presented to the council several days prior to required approval, usually given only a cursory glance. For all practical purposes, under this form of government, the city and its agenda, direction, and priorities are dictated by the wishes of a strong city manager and a correspondingly weak city council. Thus, noninvested participants and consultants drive the community. Sharing resources and combining some departments with other local governments such as Spokane County may result in a more efficient utilization of scarce taxpayer dollars.\Pace: The mayor should control the day-to-day operations of the city through the city manager. The city manager needs to be a professional whose education and career is running cities. The mayor, on the other hand, should be a citizen who serves one or two terms and is done. The mayor should be elected directly by the city's voters and should be the CEO of the city government and the chairperson of the City Council. It would be ideal if each neighborhood (Ponderosa, Kokomo, Midilome, etc.) and each business district (Sullivan, Sprague, Fairgrounds area, Valley Mall area, etc.) elected a representative to serve on the City Council.\Robertson: No, no! For nonprofits and governments, there needs to be separation between legislative and administrative duties. While some think the city manager runs the city, he is there to make sure the city runs effectively and efficiently, following the governing policies set by the council. Because somebody can win an election, it does not follow that he/she is a good manager of a multimillion dollar enterprise.\When you have ward systems, each ward competes with the other. My interest is not in serving one group of people but what is best for the entire City.\Q: Should Spokane Valley build a new City Hall at the University City Shopping Center, buy the building it now rents or do something else? Should it continue paying rent?\Foote: For now, Spokane Valley should continue renting its current spaces until the city center is started, then a permanent City Hall should be built as planned. We need a heart to our city, and a City Hall in the center of that heart.\Grafos: The city will deplete its reserves in about four years. We should rent, curb growth and the need for more space. We should renegotiate rental rates.\Pace: Continue paying rent.\Robertson: We need to have a plan so that we can consider long-term costs and benefits of each option. If that plan requires borrowing money through bonds or additional funds earmarked for capital improvements, then we will take that plan to the voters at that time. With the uncertainty of the economy, let's continue to rent.\Q: What are the city's best accomplishments?\Foote: One, that we've managed to survive six years as a city, when critics said that we wouldn't have made it at all. Two, that our sense of self is still strong, that we were never part of Spokane and never will be, and that we have our own culture here. Three, that the city services are more efficient than under the county. Four, that we have a good police force out here, even if it's under county control still. Finally, that despite all of the problems and roadblocks, there are still plenty of people who do go to City Council meetings and make their voices heard, and run for City Council.\Grafos: The park system and CenterPlace, given to the city by Spokane County.\Pace: My perception is that police coverage has increased. But, in the past six years Sprague keeps getting uglier and my property taxes have jumped up significantly.\Robertson: We know how to maintain a financially viable city even as our nation goes through the worst downtown in the economy since the Great Depression. Our safety, security and emergency planning are exemplary. We have a council and an administration that know how to work together as a team for the common good. The city has been proactive in securing outside funding for roads and parks.\WHO'S RUNNING\Spokane Valley voters will decide in the Nov. 3 general election which of 10 candidates will fill five positions on the City Council. However, Gary Schimmels and Tom Towey are unopposed. Incumbent Ian Robertson has three challengers: Dean Grafos, Ed Pace and Ed Foote. Incumbent Diana Wilhite is challenged by Brenda Grassel, while state Sen. Bob McCaslin is running against Mayor Rich Munson. Council members are paid $750 a month and the mayor, who is chosen by other council members, gets $975.\Credit: John Craig johnc@spokesman.com, (509) 927-2165"

YPD Respect
\
To the editor - In reference to the arrest of Ricardo Jimenez, it's about time he faces up to his charges of assault, a five-year- old DUI, and a suspended license violation. In addition, police say he uses a phony ID. Anyone convicted of these charges belongs behind bars, regardless of ethnicity.
\
It appears to me that some of the other alcohol-drinking adults should have also been arrested for interfering with the officers.
\
I am sick and tired of hearing about so-called YPD police profiling and brutality against Hispanics. The YPD has always treated me with respect, including the Yakima traffic judge.
\
All of my three children are half-Mexican, speak Spanish, and are proud of both heritages - Hispanic and Anglo. I was married to a Hispanic woman from Chihuahua, and love the Latino people and culture. So, this letter is not meant to be ""against"" Hispanics.
\
Last, if anyone has ever lived on the Mexican border, you will remember what the Mexican police are like. For example, if you are stopped for a traffic violation, your car will be impounded, or you'll have to pay a bribe. I know, because I have been in both situations. Our police and sheriff's deputies are some of the best in the state of Washington. They literally put their lives on the line each day to protect the public.

Don't Go to War
\
To the editor - It jumped out at me! (""Bush Won't Act Alone,"" Yakima Herald-Republic, Sept. 5). President Bush states he will take the debate to enter a war with Iraq to Congress because ""the world must understand, as well, that its credibility is at stake."" Bush wants this war against Iraq to save his credibility. He's going to condemn to death many innocent people, causing further destruction to a country already in dire straits, to save his credibility. Bush claims we must attack Saddam Hussein because he threatens us with ""weapons of mass destruction.""
\
Former President Jimmy Carter states (The Washington Post, ""The Troubling New Face of America,"" Sept. 5), ""the American people are inundated almost daily with claims from the vice president and other top officials that we face a devastating threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and with pledges to remove Saddam Hussein from office, with or without support from any allies. As has been emphasized vigorously by foreign allies and by responsible leaders of former administrations and incumbent officeholders, there is no current danger to the United States from Baghdad.""
\
Carter continues, ""We cannot ignore the development of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, but a unilateral war with Iraq is not the answer. ... It is crucial that the historical and well-founded American commitments prevail: to peace, justice, human rights, the environment and international cooperation.""

Contact your legislators today and tell them to vote ""no"" to an unjust war!

Try Harder
\
To the editor - As a nationally published writer, I embrace the opportunity to read the thoughts put to paper by young writers. For the past two years I've enjoyed reading Unleashed, as young journalists flexed their literary muscles. That was until I read young Wendy's Sept. 3 column. To be blunt, I have never read a more pointless, worthless, time-wasting piece of mindless yammering in my journalistic life. This was something I read, and literally thought, ""There's four minutes of my life I can never get back.""
\
I'm of the belief that Wendy isn't completely to blame for this slaying of the journalistic arts. If I understand the set-up of Unleashed, there's a teen-age editor down at the newspaper who gave the green light to have this poorly penned piece of tripe published. I also may have mistakenly been under the impression that there was a professional member of the Herald-Republic staff chaperoning Wendy.
\
Miss Johns, hopefully, will clip out this piece I've written and save it.
\
This will be so that years from now if she does become a writer, she can dig out this yellowed piece of newsprint and say ""Thank you, Mr. Beetchenow, for making me try harder.""

Is It Brutality?
\
To the editor - Is it brutality when a citizen refuses to step out to the street when told to do so by a police officer? Or is it brutality when the citizen resists, starting to hit the officer or reach for his gun? Is it brutality when the officer follows standard procedure and calls in backup, ready to deal with resistance by use of force? Is it brutality when those individuals charged by our society to keep order exercise that charge, using force as necessary to manage people who are not willing to comply with directives given peaceably?
\
A rational argument can be made for special treatment for cultural minorities on language issues, like bilingual ballots. However, when people refuse to comply with the appropriate directives of law enforcement and they need to strengthen their response to do their job, there is no rational argument for special treatment. This is not brutality, even if seen through the lens of a different culture.
\
In some countries the police may steal your car or take bribes, but not here. This culture is run by reasonable laws, not hysterical emotion. Police here are hired to enforce the law. When they encounter resistance, they are authorized to use force when necessary. That's why they are given guns.
\
Appropriate use of force is not brutality. Perhaps it takes hard experience to learn this. Don't resist the police. That's asking them to use force, which they will do, as needed, until compliance is achieved. That's what they're hired to do.

Kids' Safety
\
To the editor - Now that school has started again, I would like to remind drivers that passing a school bus when red lights are flashing in either direction on a two-lane road is against the law. On a four-lane road, only those going the same direction as the bus must stop.
\
When orange flags are flying through school zones, the speed limit is reduced to 20 mph.
\
Also, please don't forget to allow children to cross the street when they are standing at the curb at a designated crosswalk.
\
Most importantly, please immediately call 9-1-1 if you should see any suspicious people hanging around school grounds, bus stops or any place where children typically are. With the recent child abductions in the United States, it is up to all of us to protect not only our own children, but all of the children within our community.
\
Please do what you can to make Yakima and the surrounding towns the safest possible for our children. They depend on us; let's not let them down.

Wine Opposition
\
To the editor - Re: The Aug. 16 editorial about no wine at the wine information center.
\
I say glory be. At least someone in state government has their head on straight. We don't need yet another place to purchase wine. It is only a stone's throw to another place to purchase wine. It would probably do a person good to walk that short distance. The fresh air might clear their head and they might decide to do something worthwhile with their money.
\
I find it hard to believe that no one else has written opposed to spending $350,000 of highway money for a wine center!
\
It is good to know that the transportation department had a lot of money not needed for roads and highways so they can spend it for projects like this to get more drunks on our roads. Since they have all this extra money, it gives us really good reason to defeat the proposed increased gas tax for roads. Let's use that money to feed our families.
\
Will the new wine center tell the story of all the broken and maimed bodies, the broken marriages, ruined homes and hungry children and ruined lives due to too much wine? How about the increased cost of law enforcement, etc.? The increased load of cases in our courts?
\
There is just no end to the benefits of increased wine sales! But the name of the game is anything for a few bucks, isn't it?

On Disabilities
\
To the editor - Cheri Covert's Aug. 26 letter made reference to a statement from me regarding Washington's services for people who have developmental disabilities.
\
I would like to invite people to learn more about developmental disabilities, which can occur in any family. A good starting point is the Internet Web site ""The Changing World of Developmental Disabilities,"" which can be found at http://www.wa.gov/dshs/cwofdd/ index.html.
\
The federal government recently completed its periodic audit of Washington's program, which serves more than 11,000 people with developmental disabilities who are living at home and receiving partial federal funding assistance for services in their homes and communities as an alternative to being institutionalized.
\
The audit recommended procedural improvements, and cited deficiencies that are being corrected, but gave Washington's program high marks for assuring quality care and for its strong licensing, inspection and enforcement program.
\
For details about the recent federal report, visit the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) Web site. The following address is a good starting point for that information: http://www.wa.gov/ dshs/mediareleases/2002/pr02212.shtml.
\
I would like to thank all of the DSHS employees and community partners who are working hard to help disabled citizens live fulfilling lives and contribute to their communities.

Not Listening
\
To the editor - Your Sept. 9 editorial, ""Public Has Its Say as County Ponders Land Use Changes,"" is a day late and a dollar short. The public has been trying to have its say for longer than a year. Yakima County Planning has turned a deaf ear to the public. Most ag task force members quit in disgust with planning personnel, rather than as represented now. Since then the public has not had the opportunity to discuss or debate this most complex subject.
\
At present, input is limited to a five-minute statement at a public hearing. This is not nearly enough time to discuss the whole issue. The items the planners are willing to bring forward exclude many other issues that are allowed by the Revised Code of Washington.
\
Section 1 of the state Constitution states that ""governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and are established to protect and maintain individual rights."" The governed have not consented to these rulings, and individual rights are being sacrificed at the expense of public policy without compensation.
\
The way things are being handled by Yakima County, the process isn't going to work, just as so many times before. This story deserves a great deal more attention by the Yakima Herald-Republic from now on. The people of Yakima County need to express their opinion via letters to the editor, calling county commissioners, speaking at public hearings (not just attending) or some other means of communication. It won't change unless you start.

Be Humane
\
To the editor - Five weeks ago, my family fostered three small kittens and their mother from the Humane Society. We hope they will get a good and loving home. By fostering them, we gave them a chance at being adopted.When I returned them, every cage was full again. Again I brought back home three more kittens too small for adoption, hoping to give them a chance, too.
\
It is great fun having them in my home and hard to take them back. But we hope we make a small difference in their lives.
\
I used to be one of those people who turned their heads, not wanting to know what was going on with the pet population of Yakima County. I can't anymore. And neither should you. It's not just going to go away by ignoring it.
\
Please do whatever you can to help. First and always have your pet spayed or neutered. Go to your shelter to adopt or foster a pet. I can only hope your heart goes out to them, like mine did. If you can't foster or adopt, how about donating pet food, cat litter or volunteering?
\
Maybe your small difference and my small difference will make a big difference.

The Language
\
To the editor - I have a question prompted by the Sept. 9 article concerning the GMC Training Institute and the free lessons in equipment operation offered to farm workers. While I applaud any effort to educate unskilled workers, in the case of Claudia De Paz and many like her, I feel that part of that education should be focused on learning the English language.
\
That being said, my question (and one that should have been asked by the reporter) is: How can a person live in this country for 21 years and not learn the language? With all the other concessions offered, I am sure there are free English lessons available for anyone who wants to learn.
\
I, for one, feel it is disrespectful and rude not to learn the language of the country that offers so many opportunities for a better life. But, as long as merchants, employers, churches, radio stations, politicians, etc., make it easy to get by without knowing English, why bother? Maybe it would be easier to wait until it becomes mandatory for anyone seeking a job in this Valley to learn Spanish. And, if you have checked the help wanted ads lately, that may not be too far off.

Evil U.N.
\
To the editor - The ""fox in sheep's clothing"" has arrived! The great deceptor would now like for us to believe that he is ready to take the United States into his flock of sheep!
\
Using the recent anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as a platform, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had the guts to say ""There could be no greater affront to the spirit and purpose of the United Nations than the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Everything that we work for - peace, development, health, freedom - is damaged by this horror.""
\
Was he confused? The United Nations organization actually accepts, funds and protects terrorist and inhumane nations such as Syria, Libya, socialist Russia, and communist China! How could Kofi Annan confuse our American values and attributes with that of his ""one world government"" agenda being carried out by intruding U.N. ""peacekeepers?""
\
What is even more appalling is that you and I are funding the U.N. - with our tax dollars. And while the kingpin of the U.N. is giving us verbiage about how terrible terrorism is, we are actually supporting his clubhouse that includes nations actively involved in terrorism. We can fight terrorism firsthand by getting out of the U.N.!
\
Most people reading this letter may think that the U.N. is just what Kofi Annan says it is. Not so. I urge anyone who appreciates our freedom as Americans to please check out The John Birch Society. You will find the information available to be refreshingly honest and factual.

Fund Them
\
To the editor - I hope our county commissioners and state legislators fund our law enforcement agencies. I would ask them to please, please fund them. I don't know how else to put it. I hope they hear me. I hope they recognize them because they do one of the most difficult and threatening jobs. Underfunding has led to a crisis situation for citizens and the officers who try hard to protect us. Public safety and officer safety should be at the top of government's list of priorities when budgets are considered.

Reckless Bush
\
To the editor - President Bush, in his foreign policy actions, shows his contempt for the rule of law. He scraps or ignores treaties that were born from decades of patient international planning and negotiations that at least 10 preceding presidents were involved in. Not being informed about foreign issues, he is easily manipulated by the hawkish advisers who surround him.
\
Bush is now preparing to send U.S. armed forces off to invade Iraq. No other nation wants this, not even our European allies, except for Britain.
\
The Arab countries in the Middle East are unanimously opposed, and that includes Kuwait, the country we protected from Iraq in the Gulf War. Amir Moussar, Secretary-General of the 22-member Arab League, warned that a U.S. attack against Iraq would ""open the gates of hell in the Middle East."" I don't think he's kidding.
\
Trudy Rubin, in her Sept. 9 column published in the Yakima Herald- Republic, skewers the new and dangerous Bush doctrine of ""preventive attack."" She points out that a preventive attack on Iraq ""sets a global precedent that may boomerang.""
\
Bush is not using wisely the awesome power he has at his fingertips. Hopefully, he will come to his senses and realize that there are other countries in the world and that he can't just go it alone and do as he pleases. Right now, he is recklessly leading the world along the path to international anarchy - the law of the jungle.

No Passing!
\
To the editor - Recently, my teen-age son (with his driver's permit) was driving me, my daughter and her friend down the Naches- Tieton Grade to watch my nephew play his tuba in the Naches Parade. Right on the curve where a solemn blue cross reminds us of when, just a few months ago, 18-year-old Josh Miller tried to pass a semi- truck and was killed - here comes, in our lane, a man in a white car trying to pass a semi.
\
I'd just like to know what was so important that it was worth risking the lives of a mother, three teen-agers, a truck driver, the driver of the SUV that was behind us, and his own life? Why was it so important that he get to the top of that hill 30 seconds (if that) sooner?
\
I'd also like to know what makes people think they have the right to take chances with our lives?! Whenever you are on that grade, or any other road that is clearly marked ""No Passing"" or has double yellow lines all the way up, please obey the laws - for your own safety and for ours.

288,"
The proposed light-rail line for Clark County will:
\
1. Be a money-burning boondoggle of galactic proportions, destined to enrich only consultants and construction workers while doing nothing to dynamite commuters from their cars.
\
2. Cost local taxpayers virtually nothing while strengthening the economy, unclogging the freeway, cleaning the air, and, for once, showing those espresso-sipping Portlanders that Clark County citizens have the sense to tie up with a forward-thinking transportation network.
\
Those viewpoints roughly characterize the extremities of opinion on the Feb. 7 vote on Clark County's share of the proposed $2.85 billion rail line from Clackamas Town Center to 99th Street in Hazel Dell.
\
The middle ground is vast, heavily peopled by voters who don't know how they'll choose. That's according to a Columbian poll, published Wednesday, which found that 38 percent of 400 respondents were undecided.
\
Supporters of light rail have a $200,000 vote-yes fund that has paid for a telemarketing campaign, and, with The Columbian's contributed help, distribution of brochures. Opponents, relying on their own nickels, have waged a heavy letters-to-the-editor effort.
\
Some of the opposition to the $237.5 million Clark County piece of the project has an isolationist, go-back-where-you-came-from ring. Much of it also revolves around the no-new-taxes battle cry that helped a thundering herd of Republicans into Congress last November.
\
Supporters paint a bleak picture of a gridlocked Clark County circa 2002, slowly dying from two-bridge arterial-sclerosis.
\
While the arguments rage, this is certain: On Feb. 7 voters here will be asked whether to increase the sales tax and motor vehicle excise taxes by 0.3 percent each. Most of the county now has a 7.6 percent sales tax, so approval would push it to 7.9 percent.
\
As for the pocketbook effect, you can play Push the Decimal: the additional tax would be 3 cents on a $10 purchase, 30 cents on $100 or $3 on $1,000.
\
The impact of a motor vehicle excise tax increase is tougher to describe. The more cars you have, the more expensive they are and the newer they are, the more tax you pay. One estimate (see accompanying story) pegs the yearly impact on a typical family at less than $30.
\
The money would pay for a river crossing and light-rail line to the 99th Street area. Buses also would be added to C-Tran's 109-coach system to serve the rail stations.
\
Preliminary forecasts say the entire MAX segment, referred to as the south/north line, would carry about 60,000 riders daily by the year 2015, with 38 percent getting on or getting off in Clark County. Numbers aside, supporters admit that even with light rail up and running, commuters might not notice a difference in traffic. ""This is not a single magic bullet,"" said John Magnano, Clark County commissioner.
\
""I'm not saying it's going to massively reduce congestion on I-5,"" said Les White, executive director of C-Tran. ""But what we have now, this ain't nothin'. It's going to get worse before it gets better.""
\
Light rail, therefore, could only be expected to slow the pace of congestion, not eliminate it.
\
Vocal opposition
\
Although it is apparently loosely organized and certainly lacks the $200,000 Friends of Light Rail campaign war chest, the opposition to the Feb. 7 ballot measure has been vocal. Its members include Marvin F. Case, publisher of the Battle Ground Reflector.
\
Case has argued against the project, and his Jan. 4 editorial warned about cost overruns and a federal deficit too large to justify light-rail expenses. But while Case allowed himself just six paragraphs for his ""Just say no"" editorial, he allowed county commissioner Magnano nearly a third of the opposing page for a pro-rail opinion piece.
\
The Columbian has supported light rail generally and the Feb. 7 ballot issue specifically in a series of editorials. In Camas, Post-Record managing editor Craig Clohessy said an editorial on the issue will appear this week. As of Monday, the paper's position had not been determined. ""There's still some debate,"" Clohessy said.
\
Among the more visible opponents has been Arthur Olson, a chiropractor who commutes two blocks from his home to his office in the Evergreen area. Olson was one of three county residents who penned a vote-no statement for the pamphlet recently mailed to voters.
\
In a letter to The Oregonian's editor late last year, Olson wrote that he was ""totally against light rail,"" but that it should be built along Interstate 205 ""if you insist.""
\
Last week, he told The Columbian, ""I'd be totally against putting that thing anywhere at this point.""
\
He raises a litany of objections. One is his concern about the number of honor-system fare cheaters, estimated at 4 percent, on MAX. ""What they're going to be serving (with rail) is a bunch of people who are riding for free,"" he said. ""Why don't we just say, Hey, everybody, jump on and ride for free.' But then again, I don't believe in that, either.""
\
He is appalled at the cost of light-rail cars: ""Those puppies are $2 million apiece. Two million for a trolley. That's incredible.""
\
He is opposed to additional taxes: ""Those of us who are working and paying taxes are already doing enough.""
\
He says a third highway bridge between Ridgefield and Oregon would be a better solution, but acknowledges that Oregon officials have been dead set against more crossings: ""I'm just saying that a third bridge would be a viable alternative, but if you can't get people from Oregon to say yes, then it's probably a moot point.""
\
He is not concerned about the air pollution that officials say could restrict industrial development in Clark County: ""Our air quality is a whole lot better than most places, and most of it (pollution) comes from Oregon, anyway.""
\
And he is not convinced traffic will become intolerable: ""I don't think it's absolute gridlock. Maybe one or two times a year.""
\
Unanswered questions
\
Some of the opposition to light rail stems from unknowns.
\
For example, upcoming or ongoing studies will eventually determine how the river will be crossed (a tunnel will be considered but engineers say it is highly unlikely); and precisely where the route would go in downtown Vancouver (several downtown Vancouver streets are under consideration, with the northerly portion of the line following I-5).
\
Rail proponents are also quick to point out that Portland-area voters approved a $475 million light-rail property tax measure while highly controversial aspects, such as crossing the Willamette, are unresolved.
\
Even the details of predicted future transit ridership, with and without light rail, will have to wait until the environmental impact statement for the project, which would be done this year.
\
More certain, say planners, is the reason I-5 was chosen over I-205. Although the freeway and bridge are better suited to rail conversion, fewer riders were predicted to use I-205, making the project cheaper initially but more expensive on a per-passenger basis.
\
The I-5 corridor also was chosen to encourage denser development there instead of urban sprawl along I-205.
\
I-5 development, planners argue, could slow the conversion of prime industrial land to residential property. A lack of industrial land means fewer higher-wage jobs and fewer parcels of land producing relatively large tax income for the county.
\
The other specter raised by rail supporters is the potential threat, to what is known as the ""airshed,"" by vehicle pollution and thereby restrictions on industrial development.
\
Will Congress help?
\
The question of local financing, however the numbers add up, inevitably leads to assertions that the south/north rail idea is a pipe dream that will turn into a pipe bomb when the Republican congress lights a no-funding fuse.
\
Lawmakers, promising to balance the federal budget, are eyeing plenty of cuts, including that perennial whipping boy, the multibillion-dollar Amtrak passenger rail subsidy. Light-rail opponents say transit plans such as Clark County's would be likely targets.
\
Not so, argues C-Tran chief White.
\
As for the source of his optimism, ""I've seen all the proposals,"" said White, the head of a national legislative committee for the American Public Transit Association.
\
The money for the local project would come from a mass transit trust fund, soon to hit $6 billion, that has been built by gas-tax increases approved during the Reagan and Bush administrations.
\
Congress is looking to cut outlays from general revenues, not trust-fund money, he said.
\
The senior pro-rail members of the Pacific Northwest's congressional delegation also are superbly situated to push through funding, said White. Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and also chair of that committee's transportation subcommittee.
\
""He will build the budget to submit to himself,"" said White.
\
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., is on the subcommittee, and relative newcomer Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is on the Appropriations Committee.
\
At the state level, Gov. Mike Lowry has budgeted for the Clark County project. However, after years of arguing, the $6 billion Seattle project is finally moving ahead, and could come in competition with Clark County's much smaller request. Funding the Seattle project would require additional state revenue, White said.
\
What if it passes?
\
White said that if voters approve the tax measures, he will ask the C-Tran board, comprised of elected officials from around the county, to increase the sales tax by 0.1 percent (the measure allows 0.3 percent) and the motor vehicle tax by 0.3 percent, effective July 1.
\
The money raised from those increases would pay Clark County's share, $11-12 million, of the estimated $36 million bill for engineering and environmental impact studies for the entire south/north route. (For Portland's Westside project, voters approved $110 million for construction in 1990; bonds to pay $15 million in engineering costs were sold in 1992, White said).
\
It is envisioned that the Clark County tax at the lower rate would go through the end of 1997; assuming federal money is approved, the tax would then jump to the 0.3 percent rates for both taxes as specified in the Feb. 7 ballot issue.
\
If federal funding falls through, the tax increases will be dropped in 1998.
\
Although opponents mutter ""Oh sure,"" at that suggestion, White says state law prohibits spending the tax money on anything other than the light-rail project and related transit improvements.
\
That timetable gives light-rail planners until 1997 to secure the millions needed to complete the project. White is bolder in his prediction: ""I believe that in summer they're (federal officials) going to earmark that project.""
\
With green lights at all funding intersections, the tax would continue for 20 years, raising the $237.5 million local share, money for 163 new buses at about $200,000 each, and covering debt service.
\
With those costs paid, the taxes would be rolled back to where they raise only the money needed for rail-line operating expenses, now pegged at about $4.5 million a year. It would not be possible to build extensions to the line without again asking voters.
\
What if it fails?
\
The next feasible date for a re-run of the light-rail election should the measure fail and C-Tran board decide to try again would be in May.
\
That, said White, would be the last chance. By summer, the northern terminus of the south/north line must be determined: 99th Street if voters have approved the tax measures; the Oregon side of the river if the measures fail.
\
Beyond the possible May election, ""That's it. It's over,"" said White. Without light rail, ""We will begin to remove our commuter buses from I-5 in 1998-99, and put them in service on other lines. It wouldn't make sense to have them on the freeway. They would just be sitting in traffic with everybody else.""
\
More than any light-rail proponent in the region, White can be credited with the politicking that put Clark County in line for a piece of the MAX system.
\
In the 1980s, Portland light-rail planners were virtually ignoring the north side of the river.
\
Clark County was last in line in the metro area, with no chance for connection until sometime after 2020.
\
As traffic counts on I-205 swelled faster than expected, White and others successfully made the case that any north-south MAX extension should not be undertaken without giving Clark County residents the chance to hitch a ride.
\
White said he is hopeful about the election outcome, but adds, ""I don't want to be portrayed as overly confident.""
\
He sidesteps the question when asked how much the issue means to him personally. ""It would have been lost effort if the community never had a chance to decide whether it wanted light rail,"" he said. ""In 1988 the answer was no, no matter what. If we had never had the chance, that would have been a true tragedy."" IN FAVOR: Joe King Age: 49. Clark County resident 20 years. Occupation: Partner in Cannard, King & Associates Insurance. Former state legislator. We're growing, like it or not
\
The Interstate 5 Bridge currently fails during peak hours, and as we've seen recently, a wreck on the Interstate 205 Bridge can tie up traffic indefinitely on I-5, Mill Plain, state Highway 14, and every street in downtown Vancouver.
\
Among the critics of the extension of Portland's MAX system into Clark County, none has stepped forward with a realistic alternative to light rail.
\
By conservative estimate, 120,000 new residents will be joining the traffic on our roads within the next 20 years. Growth in Clark County will continue, whether we like it or not. What kind of growth do we want? Do we want a future that looks like we've seen in Southern California, where 212 hour commutes are common, or growth that is planned and managed so that we can move people, not just cars, and thereby retain our wonderful quality of life?
\
Read the opponents' comments for clues about whether they are advocates for realistic options or just people who say NO to everything. Then, ask yourself if their vision of Clark County doesn't look a lot like Los Angeles. Jane Van Dyke Age: 42. Clark County resident 15 years. Occupation: Homemaker, member of Clark Public Utilities board, active in PTA, president of Columbia Land Trust. Buses will not solve the problem
\
For now and for our future we should support the transit and light-rail ballot measure.
\
The proposal for increased transit services and light rail is a plan to maintain and preserve our quality of life, to add transit service around the county and across the Interstate 205 Bridge, to support economic development during construction and commercial development at the transit stations, to improve our air quality and to tie us better to the greater Vancouver-Portland region.
\
Ridership is up on C-Tran all around the county and especially on the commuter routes to Portland. Traffic on the I-5 Bridge is at capacity; more buses on the bridge will not solve the problem. Leveraging our money with the already committed Oregon funds of over $400 million and committed federal funds (that will otherwise be spent on transit in other parts of the country) will bring jobs to our community. A trip on light rail will eliminate 99 percent of the carbon monoxide produced by a car on that same trip. Remember, cars are our biggest source of air pollution. Light rail has been and will continue to be built in Oregon. Let's not let it end at the river. Mac Sebree Age: 62. Clark County resident 18 months. Occupation: Editor of Light Rail Annual and editorial consultant for Passenger Train Journal and Pacific RailNews. It's later than you think
\
As the major cities of the West, one after another, made the decision for light rail, objections centered around the immediate need for this investment. Why not wait until traffic gets impossible? Why not, in the meantime, pump money into highways.
\
Well, it's later than you think.
\
The time to make a relatively affordable $235.7 million investment is now, and give this gift of mobility to our children. Otherwise they will be forced to pay much more for less.
\
Sometimes, Americans are willing to make modest short-term financial commitment for a real payoff later in alternatives to gridlock, a better environment, and a wiser use of scarce resources.
\
We must remember that Vancouver will remain no mere satellite of Portland, but increasingly come into its own yet tied inevitably to its transport grid.
\
Citizens of Edmonton, Calgary, Portland, Sacramento, San Jose, San Diego and other western cities are delighted with the light rail systems they created with their votes. By no means are they happy with all that government does, yet they continue to fund extensions with tax dollars.
\
Let the South/North line be built. We and our children will not be disappointed. OPPOSED: Judith Anderson Age: 49. Clark County resident 30 years. Occupation: Homemaker and activist, president of Concerned Citizens Committee, a tax watchdog group. C-Tran is much more flexible
\
Don't let a tiny minority of good ol' boys stick you with a new tax that only makes them richer. There is not enough public benefit to justify the massive public spending required for the light-rail project.
\
People no longer need or want to go into central city areas for work, shopping, medical care or recreation. At best, three to four percent of us will use light rail.
\
C-Tran is still largely unused and much more flexible in its ability to meet changing service needs than a fixed light-rail system. Put more buses on if more service is needed.
\
Amtrak is available for those who wish to take the train along the Interstate 5 corridor or back and forth to downtown Portland. Reduction of congestion or pollution attributed to light rail is a myth according to the best research.
\
Portland's MAX, one of the most efficient light-rail systems in the country, carries only one third of one percent of the trips in the service area.
\
We've been robbed enough by the white-collar Fat Cats that feed at the trough in C-Tran alley. Vote no to higher taxes for light rail. Lars Amlie Age: 55 Amlie lives in Oregon, ""But I pay $500,000 in taxes every year, have 80 employees and a $4 million annual payroll, so I figure that gives me the right to complain."" Occupation: President and owner of Automotive Services Inc., in Vancouver. It'll cost $40,000 per family of four
\
My opposition to light rail for Clark County is based on economics and social impact. Our federal government is broke (the deficit is now pushing $4 trillion and climbing), funds for education are lacking, criminals go free as a result of prison shortages and our elderly have a difficult time making ends meet. In spite of this disastrous outlook we are moving forward with a transportation program so costly it dwarfs anything else we have done in this region. Ten to $12 billion will be spent for light rail in the Portland-Vancouver area over the next 10 years, according to Tom Walsh, CEO of Tri-Met, at a forum at the Quay in 1989.
\
This is $40,000 per family of four in the metro area. How can this outrageous cost be justified? (A family of four also shares $80,000 of the National debt. Source: Congressional debate, Jan. 19, 1995).
\
Light rail is a rigid system that cannot be moved once installed. Supporters of light rail will promote housing developments near the system to encourage ridership, resulting in corridor living in high-rise apartments which in 30 years will result in ghetto living.
\
Conclusion: Community engineering at its worst, while the cost-benefit ratio and social impact tear at the fabric of a rapidly fading American dream. Bruce Holmstrom Age: 48. Clark County resident 12 years. Occupation: President of Vancouver Oil Co. $27,000 a foot for 25 miles
\
Good sound transportation planning is essential to our citizens. Mass transit should certainly be part of the equation. However, for the foreseeable future mass transit will be a very small part of our county's demand.
\
Light rail, however, has been elevated to a crisis level, and our citizens are being asked to make a major funding commitment with little hard evidence to show what the real costs will be.
\
The estimated cost of $2.85 billion is an enormous sum. The present plans for the south/north light-rail system would span a distance of approximately 25 miles at a cost of $27,000 a foot.
\
What about cost overruns? Massive projects always far exceed estimates. The Denver airport, the L.A. light rail project and Tri-Met's West Hills light-rail project come to mind. Shouldn't the voters be told the risks?
\
Are we as a community so sure light rail is worth more to our citizens than other worthwhile projects?
\
Further, a yes vote only guarantees more bus service. And they get the money even if the light-rail project fails state or federal support. I urge a no vote Feb. 7.

Tax rebates, energy savings, long days of scorching sunshine.
\
Still, not one customer in the Lower Yakima Valley participates in solar power net metering.
\
""You don't see a lot of interest,"" says Vic Parrish of West Richland, the closest consumer to the Lower Valley to use net metering.
\
It seems so logical -- use the abundant sunshine to power air conditioning.
\
However, solar cells, which convert the sun's rays into electricity, are so expensive it would take years -- how many years is up for debate -- for homeowners to realize the savings.
\
That doesn't mean no one uses solar energy.
\
For example, farmers sometimes use solar panels to power remote irrigation pumps. Homeowners also install panels to help heat water in their swimming pools.
\
But they don't take part in net metering, a system that plugs those panels into the regional power grid shared by electric utilities. When the houses need it, the solar-generated power goes to the homes, meaning the customers have to buy less.
\
When the houses does not need it -- when homeowners are on vacation, for example -- that electricity goes into the power grid for everyone else, while the homeowners' meters actually turn backwards to credit their accounts.
\
The state mandates that utilities offer the net-metering program.
\
Sounds good, but no one is doing it.
\
The numbers outside the Lower Valley aren't much better.
\
Out of 145,000 customers in Washington and Northeastern Oregon, Pacific Power has one guy in Pendleton using net metering.
\
Benton County Public Utility District has nobody.
\
Benton Rural Electric Association has Parrish.
\
Parrish installed a bank of solar cells when he built his West Richland home a year ago. He estimates it will generate six kilowatt hours, about 60 percent of what his house, designed from the ground up for efficiency, will use.
\
By his estimates, it will take him about nine years for his electric savings to make up for the cost of his equipment, which carries a warranty for 25 years.
\
He calls it both a business and a moral decision.
\
""In my mind, I just paid my electric bills a little bit early, and I'm doing some good things for the environment,"" Parrish says.
\
Parrish is the chief executive officer for Energy Northwest, a Richland power supplier best known for operation of the 1,250- megawatt Columbia Generating Station, the only commercially operated nuclear power plant in the Northwest.
\
But Energy Northwest also invests in other forms of generation, including the White Bluffs Solar Station, which produces 29.5 kilowatts of electricity, enough for six or seven households, Parrish says.
\
Sweetening the deal for Parrish, Benton REA just decided to participate in a state-tax incentive. For every solar-generated kilowatt, the association will give its members, such as Parrish, a 15-cent credit on their bill and recoup the money with a write-off from the cooperative's state utility tax.
\
Benton REA spokesman Troy Berglund says the office has been flooded with inquiries about net metering. About 50 people attended a class in June and checked out a bank of six panels the cooperative installed in its parking lot near its Prosser office. The system is plugged into to the net-metering program.
\
Berglund says the association estimates it will pay off the panels, which cost about $9,000, in more than 23 years, about as long as the equipment's lifespan. That's even factoring in the new tax incentive.
\
However, once members heard that, interest faded.
\
The association plans another class this fall, this time to discuss the new tax incentive.
\
About 90 percent of the Benton REA's juice comes from hydropower.
\
Still, solar power shows signs of gaining popularity.
\
State voter Initiative 937, dubbed the Energy Independence Act, aims to require utilities to purchase escalating percentages of its power from renewable sources, other than hydroelectricity. (Most utilities, including Benton REA, oppose the initiative.)
\
Renewable Energy Corporation started construction in mid-August on a $600 million facility in Moses Lake that promises to manufacture each year enough solar-grade polysilicon, used in solar panels, to provide electricity for 75,000 homes.
\
And California recently passed a 10-year, $2.9 billion package of incentives and mandates to encourage solar power.
\
Berglund says the cooperative encourages solar power but wants to be honest about the cost today. Vendors often promise homeowners a ""positive cash flow.""
\
""That's irresponsible to tell people that,"" he says.

Tax rebates, energy savings, long days of scorching sunshine.
\
Still, not one customer in the Lower Yakima Valley participates in solar power net metering.
\
""You don't see a lot of interest,"" says Vic Parrish of West Richland, the closest consumer to the Lower Valley to use net metering.
\
It seems so logical -- use the abundant sunshine to power air conditioning.
\
However, solar cells, which convert the sun's rays into electricity, are so expensive it would take years -- how many years is up for debate -- for homeowners to realize the savings.
\
That doesn't mean no one uses solar energy.

For example, farmers sometimes use solar panels to power remote irrigation pumps. Homeowners also install panels to help heat water in their swimming pools.

He even installed solar collectors on the White House roof.\By Reagan's second term, the White House panels were gone, and so were the tax incentives.\But interest in solar energy didn't vanish. Gradually the technology improved and, as it did, the industry moved beyond its niche of hippies and survivalists and began courting utility companies, government agencies and homeowners with personal computers and espresso makers.\Now, some proponents say solar energy is about to go big time. As evidence they point to:\Political correctness. The White House once agains sings the praises of solar.\Public policy. Washington state recently became the 21st state to pass a law making it easier for residents to enjoy the convenience of utility power, plus the satisfaction that comes with using sunshine to run the stereo.\Sales. Trace Engineering of Arlington, Wash., the world's leading manufacturer of power inverters and battery chargers used in solar-electric systems, reports annual sales growth of 30 percent and rising.\Solar electricity still costs as much as 10 times what utilities charge. And regions like the Inland Northwest can go days - even weeks - in winter without enough sunlight to perk up exhausted batteries.\But 2 billion people on Earth are without electricity, and their best chance of getting it may be solar.\That's important to environmentalists, because solar is much cleaner and safer than fossil fuels and nuclear reactors.\Entrepreneurs appreciate solar for another reason: the potential fortunes to be made bringing affordable electricity to the Third World.\The key to affordability is mass production. Each time solar sales double, the cost drops 20 percent.\Solar's future is particularly important to Washington state, where companies account for 10 percent of world sales.\Washington State University Cooperative Extension agent Mike Nelson, a self-described ""cheerleader for solar,"" predicts international solar-electric sales could someday dwarf the computer-software industry's impact on the region's economy.\""With solar,"" Nelson points out, ""it's easy to get the amount of power you need exactly where you need it. The only issue I see is who's going to serve those markets.""\Last April, President Clinton and Energy Secretary Frederico Pena acknowledged the industry's potential when they unveiled the administration's Million Solar Roofs Initiative, a program to encourage installation of 1 million solar-energy systems on U.S. buildings by 2010.\Similar arguments echoed in Olympia last month when Washington became the first Northwest state to pass a ""net-metering"" law that permits homeowners to feed renewable energy - solar, wind or minihydro - back into the power grid and earn full retail credit.\At least one lender in Washington - Coulee Dam Federal Credit Union - already grants low-interest loans for solar-electric systems. And Clark Public Utility District in Vancouver soon may offer interest-free loans.\Are we on the verge of an energy revolution?\Or will enthusiasm fade, as it did in the 1980s?\The biggest obstacle to any national solar-energy agenda is money. Sunlight may be free, but the equipment needed to convert it to electricity isn't.\Since the 1950s, when the first photovoltaic (PV) panels were developed to power U.S. satellites, the cost of solar technology has dropped dramatically - from $20,000 per panel to $400.\But in most cases solar electricity still can't compete with power flowing through the Northwest energy grid.\Residential customers here pay their local utility about 5 cents for a kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity - enough juice to run a 100-watt light bulb for 10 hours.\By comparison, solar electricity costs as much as 50 cents per kWh, once you calculate the price of buying and installing panels, batteries and other components.\""I spend a lot of time talking people out of putting in a PV system,"" says North Idaho solar dealer Steve Willey, who has lived off-grid since 1978. ""It's not appropriate for everyone.""\Willey's Backwoods Solar catalog, which he mails to 20,000 customers, lists six examples of complete home PV systems, from $733 ""starter"" kits to a $28,500 ""high power"" outfit.\Yet even the $28,500 unit requires homeowners to rethink their relationship with energy.\Electric hot water and baseboard heaters are out. Energy-conservation habits such as turning off unnecessary lights and ferreting out ""phantom loads"" - stereos and other devices that use energy even when they're turned off - are essential.\One way to make solar electricity more competitive with utility power is to increase demand, allowing economies of scale to kick in.\That's the idea behind Clinton's Million Roofs Initiative.\Dennis Hayes, president of the nonprofit Bullitt Foundation and national coordinator of the first Earth Day, initially was skeptical of the Roofs Initiative, calling it ""a public relations ploy with no budget and no regulations.""\""Since then,"" he observed recently from his Seattle office, ""a lot of people have jumped into it, from the Department of Energy and EPA to Housing and Urban Development and Fannie Mae.\""What's good about the Million Roofs program,"" says Hayes, ""is that it moves us a little in the right direction.\""What's bad about it is that (the federal government) isn't talking anything like the kinds of dollars required to drive down the learning curve to the point where we're competing for a meaningful fraction of the world's energy supply.\""They're treating solar energy the way it's been consistently treated by politicians for the last quarter-century - as a symbol, a totem,"" Hayes says. ""They bow to it and do some little stuff around the edges, but they don't take it as seriously as they do oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear power.""\Not surprisingly, fiscal conservatives are unenthusiastic about spending the billions of tax dollars Hayes says are needed to ""drive down the learning curve.""\Even some solar-industry insiders wonder about the wisdom of politicians jumping in too enthusiastically.\""One of the real risks of these programs is that expectations are set too high in terms of technological performance and cost,"" Siemens Solar executive Chester Farris told Forbes magazine last month. ""Ultimately, it disillusions the consumer.""\But by not jumping in, this country risks being left behind by Germany and Japan, which both have aggressive, government-subsidized solar-energy programs aimed at capturing international markets.\Currently the United States is a world leader in PV manufacturing. But Scott Sklar of the Solar Energy Industries Association warns that we could ""see a replay of the `VCR Syndrome,""' a reference to what happened when video-recording technology developed here was lost to overseas manufacturers.\Washington's new net-metering law is similar to ones already in place in Germany and Japan. It allows small-scale renewable-energy producers connected to a utility to literally spin their electric meters backward on those sunny (or windy) days when they generate more electricity than they need.\(Federal law already requires utilities to purchase power from independent producers but allows them to pay substantially less than the retail rate they charge residential customers.)\Tom Starrs, a Vashon Island attorney and consultant who has helped draft many net-metering laws, including Washington's, says the impact of these laws has been modest.\""In most states with net metering,"" he says, ""the number of customers using them is frequently fewer than 10."" Okanogan County Electric Cooperative in Winthrop, Wash., began offering net metering last June, but none of its 2,000 customers has signed up.\""That's part of the reason these laws pass,"" says Starrs. ""Utility officials don't perceive them as a real threat.""\Even so, he says, ""Net metering is paving the way for the future by lowering the threshold at which these technologies will become more economical. With net metering,"" says Starrs, ""perhaps solar technologies will be cost-effective within five years instead of 10, or in 10 years instead of 15.""\Actually, solar electric already makes sense in some cases.\Northwest utilities charge an average of $17,500 to extend a power line one-half mile to a remote building site, and homeowners still face monthly bills for power consumption.\With that same $17,500 up-front investment, rural homeowners can install a solar power system that won't fail during winter storms, and never have to pay monthly energy bills.\But the real growth market for solar is overseas, in places like Nepal, where 18 million of the country's 20 million people have no electricity.\Because of difficult terrain, extending Nepal's power grid costs as much as $70,000 a mile. Until recently, most Nepalis' only alternative was to illuminate their homes and monasteries with smelly, noisy, sooty kerosene lanterns.\But according to a report in Home Power magazine, two Americans have launched a business that manufactures and distributes a complete PV system that fits into a single doko - a traditional bamboo backpack - and can be easily installed in the typical Nepali home or shop.\The system sells for $600 and is powerful enough to operate three compact fluorescent lights for four hours a night, even during the monsoon season.\""Women are happy not to have to wake up and struggle with kerosene lanterns for half an hour in the dark before their families wake up ... and can handle food without smelling like kerosene,"" Home Power reports.\""Best of all, children are better able to see at night to study. This is especially important during busy agricultural times, when work in the fields consumes all the daylight hours.""\""By putting solar cells on the roof, we're going to send solar sales through the roof,"" Energy Secretary Pena boasted last year when Clinton's Million Roofs Initiative was announced.\John Mottl, the busiest PV installer in Washington state, isn't convinced.\Since he started Rainbow Solar on Orcas Island in 1987, Mottl has helped more than 300 clients tap the sun's energy with systems costing $2,000 to $25,000.\""The problem is, solar electric can't compete with utility power anywhere in the country,"" he says. ""The subsidies aren't there like they are elsewhere in the economy.\""On a strictly economic basis, it doesn't make sense for people to choose solar.""\The Bullitt Foundation's Hayes points out that not everyone makes decisions based solely on economics. And he cites surveys that indicate 10 percent of the American population - what he calls ""true-blue greens"" - are willing to pay a substantial premium to do what's best for the environment.\""Unfortunately, a decent fraction of those people tend to be relatively poor,"" he says. ""Twelve thousand dollars (for a PV system) may be half their annual income.""\WSU's Nelson calls net metering a big piece of the energy puzzle. But Washington's new law may be compromised by forthcoming energy deregulation.\For instance, Washington Water Power Co. plans to itemize its electric bills to more accurately reflect what customers are buying - energy and service. So instead of paying 5 cents a kWh, as they do now, residential customers will pay about half that for electricity, and pay a separate service fee for being connected to WWP's grid.\The result: Future net-metering customers may earn half the credit they could now - or about what they would have earned before the law was passed.\""Building a solar customer base is going to take a sales job,"" Nelson acknowledges, ""and you're talking about an industry that doesn't have a lot of marketing experience.\""I wish I could get Nike to take the whole thing over,"" he jokes. ""With that sort of marketing, we could get everyone thinking they were an inferior species of human if they didn't have photovoltaics.""\Without major incentives, a sudden jump in utility rates or a major technology breakthrough - none of which PV advocates predict - the solar industry is likely to keep inching along until, as Hayes says, ""we get to that point where everything gets magical, just as it did with computer chips,"" and photovoltaics start looking like a bargain.\Ironically, demand among the world's poorest countries could trigger enough PV sales to bring prices down and make solar technology competitive in rich nations.\The best part of that scenario, Nelson says, is that emerging nations could then leapfrog our dirty 20th-century energy solutions and go directly to clean 21st-century technology.\Mottl shares Nelson's enthusiasm for solar's future, but he remains cautious.\""I remember when I got my solar technician's degree in '79,"" says Mottl, ""and people were predicting things might change in five or six years. I hear the same thing today.\""I'm on the front line, and in my heart of hearts I don't believe there's going to be any mainstream change in the near future.""\Yet even at today's price, Mottl says, solar already is the best choice for many Northwest residents - people either too far off the grid to buy utility power affordably, or environmentalists with enough discretionary money to choose renewable energy the way others choose high-priced sport utility vehicles.\""For those people,"" he says, ""solar electric is a proven long-term solution that's really wonderful.\""That's what keeps me in this business."""
292," With 1.6 billion inhabitants, Earth has a huge need for consumable energy. Yet, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory calculates that on any given day, so much solar energy falls to Earth it would take 27 years to consume. How to effectively tap that energy is the question.\ South Hill resident Tina Flint has taken the first step. She's installed a 112-watt photovoltaic (PV) device on the roof of her garage. A PV device, or solar panel, uses semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. The postage-stamp sized PV cells are connected to form modules, which can be combined into an array of sizes and power output. The modules make up most of a PV system, which can also include electrical connections, mounting hardware, power-conditioning equipment and storage batteries.\ But batteries aren't necessary with Flint's system because generated electricity is fed into Avista Utilities' grid. Through an arrangement called ""net metering,"" what Flint's system generates is deducted from her monthly bill. If her production exceeds usage, she gets a credit.\ ""Avista estimates my current system generates 140 kilowatt hours per year for an approximate savings of $8.40,"" Flint says. The cost of her system in 2002, including installation and labor, was $1,480.44.\ According to The National Renewable Energy Laboratory that differential is the norm, because though solar technologies have made huge technological and cost improvements, they remain more expensive than traditional energy sources.\ Flint says she first looked into renewable energy options not for financial gain but in an effort to be more environmentally responsible.\ ""When I bought my home,"" she says, ""I became more attuned to the wetlands in the neighborhood, to air quality, water quality, and the adverse long-term effects of devastating our natural environments. Solar was a way I could begin to respond responsibly.""\ Lawmakers, too, are responding. With wide bipartisan support, the state's legislators this spring passed two renewable energy-related bills. The first, SB 5101, provides a renewable energy feed-in production incentive to homeowners and businesses. Those who purchase and install PV systems, earn a credit of 15 cents-per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity generated by their systems up to $2,000 annually.\ In addition, if the system's components are manufactured in Washington, owners can increase their 15 cents-per kWh credit up to as much as 54 cents. The aim of the bill is to increase market demand for renewable energy systems.\ A second bill, SB 5111, aims to stimulate the renewable energy system supply sector. SB 5111 provides tax breaks for renewable energy businesses that locate themselves in economically depressed and low population counties in the state. The aim here is to spur manufacturing and create jobs.\ According to SB 5101, the legislation will take effect ""When light and power businesses serving 80 percent of the total customer load in the state adopt uniform standards of connection to the electrical distribution system ...."" Tony Usibelli, director of the Energy Policy Division of the state's Department of Community, Trade & Economic Development, says the standards adoption process is underway and targeted to be completed by the end of this year.\ Avista's net metering program is part of the initiative. Also, Avista will offer first-year generation incentives to new solar energy producers.\ Because of those incentives, Flint says next year she'll add to her solar array.\ ""People can't be naive anymore,"" she says. ""We all need to take responsibility and do something ourselves. If we'd be more self- sufficient, we'd reduce the demand on oil and gas and be more environmentally responsible.""\ Sun, sun, sun.

Rick Campfield of SunModo, third from left, and John Harley of Brimma Solar, second from right, talk about the future of solar energy at a Thursday event held at Brimma Solar in Vancouver.
\
Boosters of solar power on Thursday unveiled a new report about the increase in use of that renewable energy as part of a larger effort to support the federal governments push to slash carbon pollution in the face of climate change. Thursdays event also put the spotlight on Vancouvers growing private solar sector, as backers of solar power in Washington gathered to discuss the issue at the facilities of two local companies: Brimma Solar and SunModo.
\
The report, Lighting the Way, authored by Environment Washington Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group, documents the decline in the cost of solar energy, the increase in its capacity in the U.S. and policies adopted by states to encourage its use.
\
The report shows that per capita solar power capacity grew 56 percent in Washington since 2013, putting the state 15th in the country for solar power capacity per person added since that time. However, the state in 2014 ranked No. 25 for total solar capacity and for solar capacity per capita.
\
We need to go bigger, Bruce Speight, executive director of WashPIRG and a representative of Environment Washington, said Thursday after he presented the report.
\
Speight was joined by others including: Rick Campfield, CEO of SunModo, a producer of mounting hardware for solar systems; John Harley, vice president of production for Brimma Solar, which specializes primarily in residential solar installations; state Sen. Annette Cleveland, D-Vancouver; and Dena Horton, Southwest Washington outreach director for U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.
\
Campfield said a confluence of forces federal and state government incentives, the decreasing cost of technology and consumers who want to leave something behind, a better planet are making solar power come on strong. He and Harley both said its important to maintain those government incentives, which include a federal tax credit for solar energy, and a state sales tax exemption and production incentive.
\
We go where the state incentives are, Harley said.
\
Reduction targets
\
The release of the Lighting the Way report comes as the Obama administration made public last month its Clean Power Plan. That plan uses state-by-state targets to cut heat-trapping emissions 32 percent by 2030 from levels recorded in 2005.
\
The Environmental Protection Agency says the plan will save about $45 billion a year by both reducing energy use and cutting health costs for asthma, lung cancer and other illnesses triggered by air pollution, according to a report by U.S. News & World Report. The EPA also says the plan will cut roughly $85 a year from the average Americans utility bill.
\
However, backers of fossil fuels and some utilities have blasted the measure. As reported by U.S. News & World Report, Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican representing the coal-heavy state of Kentucky, has urged state leaders to reject the plan, arguing it will undermine reliability and increase electricity rates.
\
In a news release issued Thursday by Environment Washington, the group said its research shows that solar power could easily meet about half the pollution-reduction targets required by the Obama administrations plan.
\
In 2014, Hawaii was the top state for cumulative solar electricity capacity per capita (312 watts per resident), according to the Lighting the Way report. By another measurement total solar electricity capacity California led the nation with nearly 10 gigawatts, the report said.
\
Pro-solar policies adopted by most or many of the leading states include minimum renewable energy requirements for utilities, according to the report, and net metering, in which solar energy system owners are credited for the electricity they add to the grid.
\
By way of context, the sources of electricity generation in the U.S. in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, were: coal (39 percent), natural gas (27 percent), nuclear (19 percent) and renewable (13 percent).

Designers of a super-green home in Felida want it to generate as much energy as it consumes.
\
Yet there's no getting around a blazingly clear fact of life in Southwest Washington: Our drizzly climate presents a significant obstacle for generating solar energy.
\
Proponents still believe it's possible, but only by wringing every ray of sunshine out of the sky - and only if the home's occupants live an extreme version of the Northwest's eco-friendly reputation.
\
To meet the Living Building Challenge, the house must net zero energy over the course of a year.
\
It won't be a total energy island. The house will be hooked to the same Clark Public Utilities transmission system that serves the rest of the bungalow-style homes in the subdivision. It will employ a net metering device to distribute surplus energy to the grid when the sun is shining and take in electricity at night and when the sky is overcast.
\
Builder John Fazzolari went into the project believing net-zero energy would be the toughest obstacle.
\
Lately, he's been more encouraged.
\
""I actually feel like we've got a pretty good grasp on that,"" he said. ""I'm pretty sure we have the plan that's going to work.""
\
Others consulting on the project aren't so sure
\
""There's no way in the world there's going to be enough room on that roof to put enough solar panels to make the house net-zero,"" said Mike Lubliner, a building science specialist with the Washington State University Energy Program in Olympia.
\
Later, he qualified the statement. While it may theoretically be possible to generate a substantial amount of energy, even in a predominantly cloudy climate - Lubliner, backed by a U.S. Department of Energy program, is working up a computer simulation to find out just how much the house will need - he said it won't come close to meeting the typical modern American's demand for energy.
\
""It's all about lifestyle,"" Lubliner said. ""You've got to get somebody who doesn't have a big-screen TV, who isn't on the computer all night who uses a clothesline, not a dryer.""
\
In designing what is believed to be the nation's first single-family house built to the greenest of green certification standards, designers face a daunting array of challenges. The building must meet 16 prerequisites under six broad categories of sustainability: energy; site design; materials; water; indoor environment; and beauty and inspiration.
\
""That's why this is a 'challenge,' "" project organizer Brandon Tauscher said.
\
Besides slathering the south-facing roof with photovoltaic panels, meeting the net-zero energy challenge is forcing designers to eke out efficiencies everywhere they can find.
\
A solar water heater will be placed amid the greenery on the ""eco-roof"" of the adjacent garage. High-efficiency windows will maximize heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. The house will be tightly sealed and efficiently ventilated. A ""smart"" system will monitor and, potentially, adjust energy usage throughout the house. A ductless heating system that uses pipes filled with liquid refrigerant will efficiently regulate room temperature. Designers are even contemplating heat exchangers that would, for example, be able to capture heat from hot water poured down a sink.
\
Designers can't afford to skimp on appliances, said Chuck Dougherty, a consultant with Vancouver-based Synergy Design Group who is coordinating the home's design. The design must anticipate the way people are likely to live.
\
""You can't just buy a small fridge, because the homeowner will just buy another one to stick in the garage,"" Dougherty said. ""You end up shooting yourself in the foot.""
\
The same principle applies in reverse on the energy-supply side of the equation.
\
""We don't want to oversize it,"" architect Timothy Buckley said. "" 'Bigger' doesn't mean more efficient, and it doesn't mean 'better.' ""
\
And it definitely doesn't mean cheaper.
\
""Cost is going to be a factor,"" Buckley said during a meeting of consultants earlier this year, ""and John reminds us of that nearly every day.""
\
Fazzolari initially estimated the cost of solar panels alone to be $80,000, but he now believes it will be substantially less. Covering roughly 800 square feet of the south-facing half of the roof should allow the panels to generate roughly 8 kilowatts, which Dougherty figures ought to come fairly close to meeting the needs of a highly efficient and relatively small 1,780-square-foot home.
\
""We're in pretty good shape,"" he said.
\
Fazzolari, who ultimately must find a buyer willing to pay top dollar for a house with a composting toilet, is maintaining his enthusiasm.
\
""We're building a sports car,"" he said. ""An efficient sports car."" Chart shows how the home will make the most of sunshine.

295," If a settlement worked out last week in the River Park Square case means the troubling saga will soon be over, no one will greet the news with more relief than the men and women who produce The Spokesman-Review each day.\ When the daily newspaper of a community is owned by the same company that is in the middle of a loud public squabble, it makes for awkward journalism. Admittedly, The Spokesman- Review fell short in some respects: some ethical lapses in news reporting, too much boosterish hyperbole on these opinion pages. How far the newspaper has come in reclaiming its credibility is a judgment that must be made in the minds of readers.\ In the meantime, a discomfiting environment does not absolve a newspaper of the duty to care about its community, report on its doings and comment on its interests.\ And, indeed, the conflict has left Spokane's interests scarred. A $4.2 million agreement between the city of Spokane and its former bond attorney follows a series of out-of-court deals that dispense with the main financial claims arising out of the complex financing arrangements for the downtown parking garage and mall.\ A handful of lesser matters remain to be tied up, but the core questions seem to have been resolved, at least as far as the law is concerned.\ The psychological healing may take considerably longer. Let us hope it is accompanied by learning, so the mistakes made during this experience will not be repeated.\ Plans for redevelopment of the downtown mall into the modern fixture that graces Main and Post today were laid at a time when civic influence resided in a network of close-knit alliances. The people who got things done, and had for generations, knew and trusted each other. They cooperated, and they had numerous successes to show for it. That's how Expo '74 happened. That's how Spokane International Airport got built.\ At a roundtable discussion about Spokesman-Review credibility four years ago, developer and RPS critic John Stone contended that civic projects in Spokane tended to be judged less on merit than on pedigree. If the right people were behind an idea, it got backing; if not, it didn't.\ Stone's remark, right or wrong, resonated with some citizens who felt optimistic forecasts about the mall project should have been challenged more aggressively. They weren't, though, and parking meter revenues that weren't expected to be seriously exposed ultimately became encumbered. Community block grant development funds were put at risk.\ Those consequences were sad enough, but the personal and emotional fissures may have been worse.\ On one side, distasteful lawsuits were filed against public officials who aired their vigorous opposition to the development. On the other, vitriolic accusations were leveled, reflecting unwillingness to accept honest miscalculation as anything less than sinister conniving.\ Today we know projects of this magnitude need to be more open and more streamlined, and there are encouraging signs that the community is eager to bridge the angry gulf and pursue other opportunities. Some toxins nevertheless remain to be flushed from the civic bloodstream.\ But if Spokane could rebuild from the fire that leveled it in 1889, it can revitalize itself after being scorched by the past several years' civic flames. A few stubborn embers still smolder, but the court settlement provides a welcome splash of retardant.\ Credit: Spokane"
296,"Doug Clark can be reached at (509) 459-5432 or by e-mail at dougc@spokesman.com.\ `Pack up Spokane government.\ Stick it in a circus tent.\ Bye. Bye. Spo-burg.""\ I've been working up new lyrics to the cherished American standard, ""Bye Bye Blackbird,"" ever since last Friday.\ That's when I read with horror that Mayor Jim West was actually eyeballing this harebrained scheme to: A) Sell our grand old City Hall and ... B) Relocate our municipal government into the Metropolitan Mortgage Tower of Financial Ruin.\ ""At this point we're just kicking the tires,"" offered West in a front-page story.\ Hey, West. Sell off City Hall and I'll lead the charge to kick your mayoral patootie.\ With its majestic view of Riverfront Park and art deco architecture, the City Hall is a civic treasure.\ Spokane couldn't ask for a more dignified and attractive administrative focal point.\ I don't blame developers for wanting to turn the former Montgomery Ward store (808 W. Spokane Falls Blvd.) into rooms for the rich. It's in their greedy nature. If they could get away with it, they'd sublease the downtown library and turn Manito Park into a housing development.\ City Hall is a prize because it has those three magic essentials of real estate: Location. Location. Location.\ The Met tower has curb appeal, too.\ If you're into soulless 17-story rectangles.\ This building is one of the most cold, unimaginative structures in Spokane. It's the Great White Whale looming over the downtown business core.\ If West relocates City Hall there he could pose for souvenir photographs on the roof with a harpoon in his hand.\ Thar she blows, Mayor Ahab.\ Then there's the karma factor. I'm not superstitious, but I wouldn't spend the night in the Met Tower.\ Done in by financial investigations and a bankruptcy filing, the once-bustling home of Metropolitan Mortgage & Securities, Inc., is crawling with bad mojo.\ But I know West. He's like a bulldog with a T-bone once he gets an idea stuck in his brain.\ There may be no way to save City Hall. The best we can hope for is to convince hizzoner to latch onto a luckier alternative.\ Such as:\ People's Park - This woodsy setting along the Spokane River in Peaceful Valley has long been a destination resort for free- spirited nudists who enjoy dangling their modifiers in public.\ In such an open and relaxed environment, city workers would feel free to doff their duds and show the world that Spokane government has nothing to hide.\ River Park Square Garage - Moving City Hall into the notorious downtown Garage of Doom could solve our biggest municipal headache. Rent from the city might turn around this money pit and maybe even settle some of the legal squabbles.\ True, working in the RPS garage might be a bit drafty during winter. But at least the move would be a breeze since the garage and City Hall are already conveniently linked via skywalk.\ Sam's Pit - The rockin' roadhouse at 528 E. Second has been sadly out of business since the cops raided it for the last time in the early-1990s.\ Once home to itinerant blues musicians, card sharks and women of negotiable virtue, Sam's was the place to go for some of the best barbecued ribs around.\ Headquartering the city there would be a stroke of genius. Who wouldn't want to go pay a parking ticket when you could also pick up a chunk of Sam's famous cornbread.\ Well, that's all I could come up with on such short notice.\ If any of you readers out there have better City Hall relocation sites, please send them to me via the information listed below.\ If we don't act soon, I fear we may all be singing a sad, sad tune: ""Jim West moved our City Hall, Near the Gap at NorthTown Mall.\ Bye. Bye.\ Spo-burg."""
