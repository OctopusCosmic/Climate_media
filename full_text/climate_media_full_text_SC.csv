The proposed federal Clear Skies Act includes a loophole that would exempt six of 10 Lowcountry power plants from regulations to control mercury emissions, an environmental advocate said Wednesday.
\
In response, U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., who sits on the federal committee where the legislation is stalled said the Public Interest Research Group is ""simply wrong."" Moreover, power company officials said they are improving emission controls at the plants that would be affected and are not looking to dodge regulations.
\
The Clear Skies Act died in the U.S. Senate's Environment & Public Works Committee in March. But PIRG believes the Bush administration is still pushing for it, and the House of Representatives plans an April 21 hearing on the legislation.
\
It is, in the view of all sides, environmental politics as usual.
\
The PIRG report on power plants follows the establishment in March of the first-ever U.S. Environmental Protection Agency controls of mercury emissions by such plants -- ""cap and trade"" regulation allowing companies to buy and sell credits from cleaner plants and avoid improving dirtier plants.
\
Proponents say it gives industries economic flexibility to defuse ""hot spot"" pollution areas around the country. Environmentalists say the EPA regulation is weak and flawed; 10 states have sued to stop it.
\
The Clear Skies Act would replace the Clean Air Act. Environmen- talists contend its market-based regulations and would reverse improvements made under them.
\
""Not only does the bill let power plants buy and trade the right to pollute toxic mercury, but it lets some polluters off the hook entirely. It makes a bad bill even worse,"" said Kate Prevost of PIRG.
\
Not so, according to Wesley Denton, spokesman for U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., who sits on the environment committee.
\
""The Clear Skies Act will improve South Carolina's environment,"" Denton said. ""This is a partisan group looking to score political points.""
\
The loophole that environmentalists refer to exempts from regulation individual power plant smokestacks that discharge 30 pounds or less of mercury per year.
\
Mercury is a naturally occurring metal but is also blown out of smokestacks at coal-burning plants, falls into the water and onto the ground. Eaten by humans mostly in fish, it can cause neurological damage to developing fetuses and can harm the way children think, learn and solve problems. Some studies have linked it to adult cardio-vascular problems.
\
How much mercury it takes to cause those problems is a matter of heated debate.
\
Environmentalists contend a minuscule amount can cause damage. Industry and public-policy research organizations say mercury warnings are based on a higher level than most people reach.
\
A half-dozen coal-burning power plants operate in or close to the four counties around Charleston and discharge a total of about 700 pounds of mercury per year.
\
Among them, three of four units at Santee Cooper's Winyah plant near Georgetown and the three units at Scana's Canadys plant would be exempt under the act.
\
The Winyah units discharge a total of about 79 pounds per year; the Canadys units, 54 pounds. They are among 16 units across the state discharging a total 316 pounds that would be exempted, a PIRG release said.
\
""Winyah is a state-of the-art environmental control facility,"" responded Laura Varn, Santee Cooper spokeswoman. Scrubbers now being added to its smokestacks will cut mercury emissions 90 percent by the end of 2005, she said.
\
""Loopholes are not what we're about as a company. We absolutely will continue to comply with every aspect of the Clean Air Act,"" said Mary Green Brush, a Scana spokeswoman.
\
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the environment committee chairman, criticized PIRG as a ""left-wing political group more interested in partisanship than sound environmental law"" and its report as ""not worth the trees cut down to print it.""
\
The number of power plant units that would be exempt from regulations is ""irrelevant because these units emit extremely small amounts of mercury,"" Inhofe said in a statement.
\
Prevost disagreed. ""If Congress passes Clear Skies, the states would no longer be able to sue and power plants would likely get away with pumping toxic mercury into our air for years to come,"" she said.

In a blow to coal-burning utilities and the Bush administration, a federal appeals court said Friday that the Environmental Protection Agency illegally exempted power companies from tough laws to cut mercury emissions.
\
The decision nixes a controversial plan by the EPA to buy and sell ""mercury pollution credits,"" a program critics say is a multimillion-dollar giveaway to the power industry at the expense of residents near coal plants.
\
Conservationists hailed Friday's ruling, saying it would force utilities to install better equipment to scrub mercury from coal plant smokestacks.
\
The ruling adds heat to a growing backlash against building coal- fired power plants, a major source of greenhouse gases, and some said it would make it more difficult for Santee Cooper to get its $1 billion Pee Dee plant off the ground.
\
""It's a victory for people's health, for the environment and for everyone who fishes and eats fish from South Carolina rivers,"" said John Suttles, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center who helped represent a coalition of states and conservation groups that sued the EPA.
\
Power companies in South Carolina and EPA officials said they were disappointed with the ruling.
\
A Scana official said the cap-and-trade pollution credit plan for South Carolina would effectively reduce mercury pollution.
\
""It is still too early to say what impact this may have on our company, but whatever the final rules are for mercury emissions reductions, we will comply,"" said Robert Yanity, a Scana public affairs coordinator.
\
Santee Cooper already has scrubbers and other pollution-control equipment on its coal plants, ""so we think (the ruling) will have a marginal impact,"" said
\
Laura Varn, vice president of corporate communications. ""I don't see it having an impact on rates, either.""
\
The roots of the court's decision stretch back to the 1990s, when Congress grew frustrated with the EPA's lax efforts to reduce mercury and other hazardous air pollutants.
\
Mercury is a potent neurotoxin linked to brain damage and other health problems. Man-made mercury pollution generally comes from the stacks of coal-fired power plants, factories, cement kilns and incinerators. It drops from the air into rivers and lakes, where it collects in the tissues of fish and other animals.
\
South Carolina has a severe mercury contamination problem, with warnings to avoid eating certain fish from more than 1,700 miles of rivers, mostly on the coastal plain.
\
For a recent series, The Post and Courier had people who eat freshwater fish from several hot spots tested and found they had unusually high levels of mercury in their bodies.
\
In 2000, with studies showing mercury could affect 300,000 to 600,000 newborns a year, the EPA classified mercury as a ""hazardous air pollutant"" under the Clean Air Act. This meant utilities had to more aggressively reduce mercury emissions, potentially costing the industry billions of dollars.
\
Under the Bush administration, the EPA reversed course, exempting power plants from these more-stringent rules and instead creating a cap-and-trade program in which utilities could buy and sell credits equivalent to one ounce of mercury pollution.
\
The cap-and-trade program enabled some utilities to avoid spending money on new equipment by purchasing these mercury credits.
\
Opponents say it's wrong for utilities to buy their way out of pollution problems at the expense of residents near the hot spots where studies say mercury emissions land.
\
In its ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the EPA's move was an unlawful violation of the Clean Air Act.
\
The decision comes less than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court hammered the administration for failing to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants.
\
In a statement, the EPA said the ruling would delay efforts to reduce mercury emissions. ""Because of the court's action, the U.S. now has no national regulation to cut mercury emissions from existing power plants,"" Jonathan Shradar, an EPA spokesman, said in a statement.
\
Not true, Suttles said. The judge's ruling means utilities must now operate under the original, more-stringent rules from 2000.
\
He added that the ruling has major implications for Santee Cooper's proposed coal-fired power plant on the Pee Dee.
\
Under the previous rules, utilities that wanted to build a new coal-fired power plant had to identify the best way to reduce mercury emissions. Suttles said Santee Cooper's current plans fall short of this standard.
\
Varn of Santee Cooper said the ruling would have no effect on the Pee Dee plan because ""it's going to be the cleanest in the country when it's built.""
\
Fourteen states, along with conservation groups and Native American tribes, filed the lawsuit against the EPA.
\
South Carolina wasn't involved, choosing to follow the EPA's cap- and-trade approach.
\
Officials with the state Department of Health and Environmental Control were studying the ruling Friday afternoon and had no immediate comment on its effects in South Carolina.

The Senate may address the issue this fall.\The House bill would reduce carbon emissions using a cap and trade system similar to the system used to prevent acid rain, would establish new energy-saving standards for new buildings and appliances, protect consumers from energy price increases, invest in new clean energy technologies and require electric utilities to meet 20 percent of their electricity demand through renewable energy sources and efficiency by 2020, according to the bill summary.\Greenville County Council Chairman Bruce Kirven, one of several speakers, told the crowd who gathered for an Energy Citizens barbecue and country music at the Carolina First Center that the House bill is an ""overly complicated new law no one can say for sure will work or not.""\The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association with nearly 400 oil and natural gas corporate members, is a member of Energy Citizens, according to institute spokeswoman Karen P.

The short-term Lowcountry warming of the past few sweltering days doesn't prove long-term global warming. But Republicans' rising rejection of the clear consensus on human-influenced climate change does prove that too many conservatives are ignoring scientific reality.
\
As columnist Steve Chapman wrote on our Commentary page Sunday, ""Republicans like [Sarah] Palin often compete to see who can sound most indifferent to the environment.""
\
That ignorant game isn't confined to the Republicans who might run -- or are already running -- for president. As Mr. Chapman points out, the National Journal reported last year that ""of the 20 serious GOP Senate challengers who have taken a position, 19 have declared that the science of climate change is inconclusive or flat-out incorrect.""
\
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney bucks that party trend, risking his 2012 presidential bid in the process. So does ex-Utah Gov. John Huntsman (see Margaret Carlson's column on today's Commentary page).
\
Three weeks ago, Mr. Romney dared to tell a town-hall meeting in Manchester, N.H.: ""I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing.""
\
Right-wing radio star Rush Limbaugh played that clip for his legion of ""dittohead"" listeners a few days later, then offered this succinct analysis: ""Bye-bye, nomination. Another one down.""
\
Really? Must any GOP presidential nominee now march in lockstep with Mr. Limbaugh's condemnation of climate change as a ""hoax""?
\
Maybe Mr. Romney, frequently accused of ""flip-flopping,"" will reverse himself on this issue in an effort to placate not just ""El Rushbo"" but a large chunk of GOP voters. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who's also seeking the Republican nomination, has already retreated from his prior support for a cap-and-trade system on carbon emissions.
\
But acknowledging climate change doesn't require abandoning free-market principles.
\
And beyond the fortunes of individual candidates, the collective credibility of the Republican party -- and the conservative movement -- is at stake.
\
When did rejecting accepted science become a conservative concept?

Despite extreme views to the contrary, the United Nations climate summit opening Monday in Copenhagen is neither a blatant fraud aimed at facilitating one-world government nor a last-gasp chance to avert catastrophic sea-level rise. It is a worthy effort to seek international agreement on reasonable ways to achieve needed reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions.
\
Many people still dispute the scientific community's general consensus that the steep rise in such emissions from human activity over the last century has significantly contributed to a long-term warming trend. Some even dispute that this indisputable consensus exists.
\
Yet there's no disputing an extended and accelerating decline in Arctic ice and glaciers in Greenland, Europe, South America and elsewhere, and a similar rise in sea levels. And you don't have to share our view -- and the view of most scientists -- that carbon emissions are significantly contributing to those trends to see that those emissions need to be lowered.
\
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has been catching heat for advocating that goal. He offered this practical defense of his position last month: ""Global climate change is not a religion to me, but I do believe carbon pollution is harmful to the environment and I want to find a way to fix that problem. But it's got to be good business.""
\
Yes, temperatures have fallen slightly in the last decade -- after a sustained rise. Yes, a fresh academic scandal shows that some scientists were willing to cook the books to strengthen their case for global warming (see George Will's column on today's Commentary page).
\
But reducing our burning of gasoline would reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reducing our burning of coal would reduce its pollution of our air. And if sea levels keep rising, they eventually will imperil coastal areas -- including ours. Reducing emissions will mitigate their contribution to a potential disaster that ultimately could threaten the Lowcountry's shoreline.
\
Emissions can be reduced without devastating the already-struggling U.S. and global economies. Indeed, the development of alternative energy sources holds huge economic promise. The race to more efficiently harness the power of the wind and the sun is on -- and our community is competing in it, with a major wind turbine project in the works for the Clemson University Restoration Institution at the former Charleston Naval Base. As Sen. Graham put it: ""The green economy is coming.""
\
America also needs to generate more of its electricity from nuclear power, which doesn't emit carbon. That requires solving persisting waste-disposal problems.
\
The mission of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions requires cooperation among nations, including China and India, where carbon emissions have been increasing at a rapid rate. Indian officials did follow the leads of the U.S. and China Friday in announcing emissions targets. Still, a ""cap and trade"" billl had gone nowhere in our Congress this year, and prospects for major agreements in Copenhagen appear slim.
\
That high-profile summit will, however, fuel heated rhetoric from both extremes of the climate change debate. Just don't let all that hot air cloud the common-sense case for reducing carbon emissions.

The Charleston County Republican Party's executive committee took the unusual step Monday night of censuring U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham for stepping across the GOP party line.
\
County Chairwoman Lin Bennett said the unanimous vote ""is an effort to get his attention. They (party leaders) are just fed up, and they want him to know they're fed up.""
\
The resolution mentions Graham's cooperation with U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., on a bipartisan energy bill, and his support for the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program and the time he called some opponents of immigration reform ""bigots.""
\
""U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham -- in the name of bipartisanship -- continues to weaken the Republican brand and tarnish the ideals of freedom, rule of law, and fiscal conservatism,"" the resolution reads.
\
Bennett said the resolution passed unanimously by a voice vote among about 50 of the party's 104 executive committee members.
\
She said party faithful have talked about the resolution for a while. ""The feeling is if you're not going to uphold the platform, then why bother to run as a Republican?"" she said.
\
Graham's spokesman Kevin Bishop said his boss has a lifetime conservative voting record of 90 percent and last year was rated the 15th most conservative senator by National Journal.
\
""Like former President Reagan, he strongly believes elected officials need to find common ground and work together to solve difficult problems like making our nation energy-independent and protecting our environment,"" Bishop said. ""Working to solve problems and being conservative are not mutually exclusive. You can do both and that's what people in South Carolina elected him to do.""
\
Warren Sloan, a James Island Realtor and the county party's third vice chairman, said he wrote the resolution because he was upset with how Graham treated the crowd during recent town hall meetings.
\
""We have people in office who are not living by the Republican way,"" he said, ""and yet nobody says anything about it. Lindsey Graham is a perfect example of that.""
\
Throughout Graham's career, he has fashioned himself as a pragmatic politician willing to reach across the aisle and compromise to reach a solution. His recent willingness to support a cap-and-trade energy bill is just the latest example.
\
""I don't think that it will cause Lindsey Graham to do anything differently than he has already done,"" Bennett said, ""but it's a message from the voters and activists in Charleston County that they have had enough.""
\
But Clemson University political science professor Dave Woodard said Graham may have overreached on the cap-and-trade issue.
\
""I think he's in trouble. I really do,"" Woodward said. ""Obviously, he doesn't run for a while (2014, to be exact), and he's hoping people forget, but I think that's not going to be the case. I think if he gets a serious challenge in the primary, he'll be in real trouble.""
\
Bennett said Monday's vote was the first time in more than a decade, if ever, that the county party had censured a sitting Republican officeholder. Earlier this year, the state party censured Gov. Mark Sanford after his extramarital affair and absence from office while visiting his mistress in Argentina.
\
Graham not only won the GOP primary in Charleston County with 69 percent of the vote but also was one of the few Republicans to win in the county in the fall's general election.

AH:Ex-negotiator says warnings unheeded
\
Climate change represents a very real problem that this nation is not addressing in an encouraging way, according to Frank Loy, who served as chief U.S. negotiator on climate change in the Clinton administration.
\
Whatever this country does, it needs to get started, said Loy, who is in Charleston this week after serving as co-chair of an Aspen Institute Environmental Policy Forum in Aspen, Colo.
\
The bipartisan group of leaders represented business (including coal burners and auto makers), the environment, government and science.
\
Although participants had diverse views, their off-the-record discussions brought total agreement that would not have been seen even five years ago, Loy said.
\
No one challenged the scientific evidence that greenhouse gases are increasing, that the increase is a threat to living things and to the climate and that mankind is causing the change, he said.
\
""If we have a problem, it is totally irresponsible to ignore it,"" he said.
\
Forum participants generally agreed that this country should do something about what Loy described as a problem 100 years in the making.
\
So-called greenhouse gases, especially created by burning carbon, accumulate and stay in the atmosphere for perhaps 200 years.
\
At some point it will be too late to stop the global warming trend, Loy said. Voluntary actions, while important, don't come close to reaching necessary reductions in emissions, he said.
\
""You need to send a signal particularly to the business community that at some time in the near future, carbon emissions have got to have a price.""
\
Loy would like to see a tax on carbon emissions or carbon burned, but many people question whether that is politically feasible.
\
So talk at the forum turned to possible regulations, particularly a cap and trade system to limit emissions, he said.
\
Congress would have to set limits and ways for corporations to trade if one exceeds ceilings and another cuts pollution more than is required.
\
Loy said he would recommend a cap and trade system spreading throughout the American economy and all carbon consumers.
\
The electric generating industry represents 33 percent, for instance, while automobiles produce 45 percent.
\
""It's a signal that carbon is not going to be free,"" Loy said.
\
He does not support joining the United Nation's Kyoto Protocols, which the Bush administration has rejected.
\
The kind of cap and trade system that Loy favors would be too severe for the Kyoto Protocols, he said, but he believes that if this country takes serious action, the world will follow.
\
Loy, who served as U.S. Undersecretary of State for Global
\
The attorney, who has worked on climate change for 20 years, has served in top federal and private business positions including as president of Penn Central.

Now the bulk of textile jobs have moved overseas, many plants are shuttered and unemployment grew further in the recession.\Richard Cash and Jeff Duncan, the two contenders in a June 22 GOP runoff election for the congressional seat, both have called for less taxation and less regulation on businesses in order to enable existing businesses to be successful and continue to provide jobs and to attract new businesses that would create new jobs.\Cash, a Powdersville businessman who owns a fleet of ice cream trucks and a used vehicle business, called for creation of ""a friendly business environment"" and opposes ""undue"" regulation such as cap and trade and ""ObamaCare"" requirements under the president's new health care legislation.\""The private sector will create jobs when the business environment is friendly and jobs will shrink when it's not,"" said Cash, who has a degree in economics and business administration from Furman University. ""Under this (Obama) administration, they're going to shrink.""\The U.S. ""has lost a tremendous number of manufacturing jobs,"" and trade agreements need to be revisited, Cash said. ""As a nation we need to ask ourselves if we are willing to pay more for quality goods made in America"" or buy less expensive products manufactured overseas. ""It needs to be discussed.""\Duncan, a Laurens County real estate broker and auctioneer, said lower taxes would result in more capital for businesses and more jobs, and U.S. businesses should be freed of an unfair regulatory burden not shared by companies in other nations.\American businesses need free and fair trade agreements, said Duncan, a Clemson University graduate.\The nation needs to pressure its trading partners to also regulate areas such as child labor laws and workplace safety, and fix unfair trade agreements with China, which puts U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage by manipulating its currency, Duncan said. He opposes pending cap and trade and health care regulations he said would ""create uncertainty to future profitability for companies.""\Duncan wants to fast-track approval of new nuclear plants planned in the state and said that would create thousands of construction jobs ""off the bat"" and ""good, long-term stable jobs"" once plants are in operation.\Both candidates said if elected they would work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to better manage Upstate lakes that are important regional economic engines. The Greenville News has reported that economic benefits aren't currently considered an official purpose of the three Corps of Engineers lakes in the 3rd District -- lakes Hartwell, Russell and Thurmond. Both candidates want that changed.\Cash said economic benefits stemming from recreational use of the lakes should be part of the formula used to decide downstream releases from the lakes. He said he would ""work to get that changed so we don't have those wild fluctuations at Hartwell.""\Duncan said lake levels are tied to real estate sales and quality of life, and that the states, counties and residents of the Savannah River Basin need ""a seat at the table with the Corps in discussing the lakes and water flow. That's one area where I think a congressman can act as a liaison.""\Both candidates want to reduce dependence on foreign oil, and support expansion of nuclear plants and reprocessing of spent fuel. Both support offshore drilling but question drilling at depths that resulted in the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.\Cash said the regulatory role of government in energy needs to be examined, although not abolished. Government regulations have stymied development of new nuclear plants and new oil or gas fields, said Cash, who believes the free market should have a greater role in solving energy problems.\Energy is a national security issue and we need all energy options, including offshore drilling, Cash said. The problem is that BP ""didn't have a plan for a worst-case disaster and that's just inexcusable,"" Cash said.\""They didn't have a plan and they need to be held accountable for that. We don't need to approve any more drilling at that depth until we know there is a plan for worst-case disaster.""\With free market support, new natural gas discoveries could be tapped to power 18-wheelers and reduce dependence on foreign oil, he said. He also believes research and development of alternate energy sources should be privately funded and not subsidized by government.\""The free market usually comes up with the best answer,"" Cash said.\Duncan said more nuclear plants need to be built because nuclear energy is a ""good, stable clean energy source,"" and by reprocessing the current waste ""we wouldn't have to create any additional fuel rods for quite a while.""\The 34 years worth of spent fuel at Oconee Nuclear Station can be reprocessed at the Savannah River Site, said Duncan, who believes the solution to the energy problem is to expand nuclear, refine fossil fuels and fast-track new nuclear facilities.\Duncan, who has visited offshore drilling rigs and served on a federal Department of the Interior Continental Shelf subcommittee on future natural gas leases and exploration, remains supportive of offshore drilling but believes that on shore and near shore sources that currently are off limits could be tapped to eliminate the need to drill in deeper water.\On renewable energy, Duncan calls for ""American solutions to American energy issues"" including renewable wind, solar and hydrogen. However, those alternate sources of energy are insufficient to provide the power needed and nuclear energy ""is the way to go,"" Duncan said."

South Carolina's economy stumbled unexpectedly in December, sending its unemployment rate to a record high of 12.6 percent.
\
Employers slashed jobs at an unusually high rate after several months of stability, casting broader concern over what appeared to be the start of economic recovery.
\
""All of a sudden there were more jobs lost at the very end of the year when the trend was for things to be stabilizing or almost improving,"" said economist Don Schunk of Coastal Carolina University.
\
November's rate was 12.3 percent, which also set a record high. Leading up to that month, the state's unemployment rate hadn't strayed more than a percentage point for nine months.
\
Simply put, 1 in 8 South Carolina residents want work but can't find it.
\
Put Daniel Goff in that category.
\
Despite his business management degree, computer science experience and eight years of restaurant management, the West Ashley resident has looked for a job for two years without much luck. He has taken a modest-paying job as an auto mechanic ""to keep the electricity on.""
\
""I feel like it's not getting any better,"" said Goff, 27, of the job market. ""I don't know what the answer is, but there's reasons why businesses are closing. People don't have money.""
\
Unemployment rates typically rise during the end of a recession as hopeful jobless residents start applying for positions at the first sign of good news. But South Carolina, which lost 9,900 jobs throughout the month, recorded an unusual and substantial loss of 4,000 jobs in the business and professional services sector.
\
""When you see a drop there, that's a sign of something going on,"" Schunk said.
\
Employers typically cut jobs during December as the holiday season unravels and the slow travel season takes hold.
\
Statewide, the tourism industry cut 5,200 workers, a figure that's in line with seasonal trends. The Charleston metro area lost 1,500 tourism jobs in December, likely the reason why the area's unemployment rate rose from 10 percent to 10.2 percent.
\
South Carolina reported the fourth-worst jobless rate in the country behind Michigan (14.6 percent), Nevada (13 percent) and Rhode Island (12.9 percent).
\
Forty-three states saw their unemployment rates worsen during December, dousing hopes that employers would begin hiring workers once consumer confidence and spending picked up.
\
""Businesses are just not at a point where they're going to be hiring people or investing in their business,"" said Mark Vitner, a Charlotte-based economist for Wells Fargo. ""There's so much uncertainty in the business environment.""
\
With health care reform unresolved, business owners don't know how much they'll have to spend on benefits for new workers, Vitner said. Manufacturers that are heavily regulated by environmental agencies are hesitant to buy equipment without knowing how cap-and-trade rules will affect their balance sheets.
\
Meanwhile, tight lending markets could worsen as the federal government stops buying mortgage-backed securities in a few weeks.
\
""I think that folks are really beginning to wonder whether the worst is past or not,"" Vitner said.

The goal is nothing less than reducing energy consumption in homes and businesses throughout Charleston.
\
And the plan is to do it without government mandates and without new demands on local taxpayers.
\
If the city pursues recommendations it received from a consultant last week and can make the plan work, Charleston could become a national model for energy efficiency, while creating green jobs and helping property owners cut their utility bills.
\
""This is really a phenomenal program that the city is working on,"" said Claude St. Hilaire of Home Energy Group, a local company that consults on green building projects.
\
Mayor Joe Riley pledged in 2005 to substantially reduce Charleston's greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change. Reducing the energy needs of buildings throughout the city would go a long way toward meeting his pledge.
\
""We could make a big impact,"" Riley said. ""It's a great idea, and very workable.""
\
St. Hilaire said it's easy to cut at least 10 percent from a building's energy demand, and if everyone in the United States did that, dozens of power plants would not be needed. Serrafix, the city's Boston-based consultant, thinks savings of 25 percent are possible.
\
Making potentially tens of thousands of private homes in Charleston more energy-efficient sounds like a tall order, and there would be lots of hurdles to clear, but the premise is simple.
\
Serrafix has proposed that the city create an organization that would be a one-stop shop for energy efficiency projects.
\
From this single organization a building owner could arrange a home energy audit, find out what changes would produce the greatest savings, learn about rebates and government incentives, select an approved contractor, and have the work done with no up-front cost. The building owner would realize utility bill savings immediately, and pay off improvement costs over an extended period of time through a surcharge on their water bill.
\
""We envision providing the building owner with everything they need to do except for signing the pieces of paper,"" said Andrew Gottlieb, project manager for Serrafix.
\
Every building in the city gets a Charleston Water System bill, so Serrafix decided that water bill surcharges would be an easy way to handle extended payments. The city collects its stormwater fee the same way, as a water bill surcharge.
\
The commissioners of Charleston Water System have not approved the concept but likely will be asked to do so at one of their upcoming meetings.
\
The math that could make the Serrafix concept work comes from eliminating the large up-front costs consumers can face when planning efficiency improvements, while balancing long-term payments against utility bills savings.
\
That's how they do it in Babylon, N.Y.
\
Save now, pay later
\
""Our goal is to get residents a positive cash flow from the outset,"" said Steve Bellone, Babylon's administrator.
\
The town on Long Island, with about 216,000 residents, is eight months into a revolving-fund efficiency program of its own. After about two years of planning, the Long Island Green Homes program was launched using $2 million from the town of Babylon's solid waste reserve fund.
\
""We have to explain to them that there's no catch,"" Bellone said. ""You're making your house healthier, more comfortable, and better for the environment, at no cost to you and no cost to taxpayers.""
\
In Babylon, if a homeowner is expected to save $100 a month from efficiency improvements financed by the revolving fund, they could pay $80 a month until the cost of the improvements are paid off and keep the remaining $20 of monthly savings. When the upgrades are paid off, the homeowner then realizes all the savings.
\
The town covers its overhead costs by charging 3 percent interest. Homeowners who participate can get ""green"" certificates from Babylon, which the town expects will be useful as real estate marketing tools.
\
""This is not a government handout or bailout,"" Bellone said. ""It's a self-sustaining program that creates jobs, helps the environment, and saves people money.""
\
Efficiency upgrades can create lots of local jobs because of the labor-intensive nature of the work installing insulation, windows, water heaters, heating and cooling systems, and more.
\
""There are huge green job opportunities here, and this is often work that can be done by small businesses,"" said Riley.
\
Bob Fleming lives in Charleston and runs Classic Remodeling. He's been looking at efficiency improvements as a business opportunity.
\
To see how the numbers work out, he is using his own home as a test case and started by paying the non-profit Sustainability Institute to perform an energy audit.
\
Fleming said that even for a building professional, there's a lot of conflicting information about energy improvements, and it's not always easy to know what makes the most sense. In his case, the energy audit showed that his less than five-year-old home needs more insulation and had more air leakage than he expected.
\
He's also considering energy-efficient lighting, a water heating upgrade, and solar panels.
\
""All this stuff makes a lot of sense, but a lot of people don't want to put the money up front or can't get financing,"" Fleming said.
\
He said the city's initiative sounds like a very good idea, because it eliminates the financing hurdle and simplifies the decision-making.
\
Of course, homeowners already have the ability to make efficiency improvements to their houses. They could arrange a home energy audit, research tax credits and incentive programs, hire contractors, and take out a home equity loan in order to pay for the work and spread out the payments.
\
""I think that for your average consumer, it's pretty difficult,"" Fleming said.
\
The program in Babylon, as well as the one Charleston is considering, are aimed at uncomplicating the process.
\
'Steal their stuff'
\
When Serrafix principal Doug Foy first came to Charleston in March 2008 to address the Charleston Green Committee formed by Riley, he said other cities have taken steps to improve efficiency, and Charleston should borrow from those ideas.
\
""Steal their stuff,"" Foy told the committee. That's what Serrafix is doing now, on the city's behalf, building on what's been done in Babylon, in Cambridge, Mass., in Seattle and elsewhere.
\
""I think the reach and scope of what we propose for Charleston is broader and deeper than what Babylon has been able to do,"" Gottlieb said. ""We think the public sector has an important role to play, in the start-up, but there isn't enough public money out there to retrofit every building in Charleston.""
\
Where Babylon's plan is part of the town government, Serrafix proposes that Charleston create a quasi-governmental organization that could potentially go to private financial markets to raise money for a revolving fund.
\
For example, the organization could sell bonds at favorable interest rates, backed by Charleston's ability to collect debts from property owners.
\
Hamilton Davis of the Coastal Conservation League said contracting with Serrafix could help the city get a program started faster than it might otherwise and might avoid some of the stumbles that could happen if the city created the initiative on its own.
\
""If we can do it in Charleston, then we can do it in other places in the state,"" he said.
\
Gottlieb said that if the federal government creates a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, the city's organization could raise funding by selling emission credits based upon the local energy savings.
\
Serrafix was hired by the city to develop a plan at the urging of the Coastal Conservation League. The company's initial report, delivered last week, was funded by private donations to the Green Committee.
\
The city has applied for grants to pay Serrafix up to $600,000 to deliver a turn-key program for the city that could be up and running next spring.
\
""We would get the city to the point of having a fully functional partnership, able and ready to raise money and begin providing services,"" said Gottlieb. ""You won't find, in any one place, the breadth of what we have proposed for Charleston.""

The Winyah power plant near Georgetown nearly doubled its annual emissions of three toxic pollutants in the past nine years, according to a report released Thursday by a coalition of environmentalists. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham said the report was done by a group whose members have a political agenda.
\
The Clear the Air coalition cited the Santee Cooper plant as among the worst in the country for increases in the amount of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide discharged.
\
Santee Cooper said the accusation is unfair.
\
""In 1995, Winyah was shut down the entire year except for two weeks because of a turbine fire,"" said utility spokeswoman Laura Varn. If the 1995 numbers are removed, the plant's increase drops by half for carbon dioxide and nine-tenths for nitrogen oxide. Moreover, the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted by the plant decreases.
\
""It's important to extract fact from fiction,"" Varn said. ""Santee Cooper meets or exceeds all state and federal environmental standards.""
\
The report was released as the Senate begins subcommittee hearings on the Bush administration's Clear Skies Act, which contains provisions opposed by environmental groups.
\
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, one of the coalition members, said the report relied on federal Environmental Protection Agency numbers and didn't break down days of operation for as many as 700 of the biggest polluters it included in the report.
\
""We will be looking into ways to verify this in future reports so that these types of discrepancies don't reoccur,"" said PIRG spokeswoman Kate Prevost.
\
""The Winyah plant still increasedits emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide if we take the period from 1996 to 2003,"" she said.
\
""The bottom line is that the people downwind of this power plant, the people most at risk, are they better off? The answer is no.""
\
In the report, South Carolina's 13 power plants ranked 18th worst among the states in 2003 for the amount of sulfur dioxide discharged (a 15 percent increase), 21st in the amount of nitrous oxide (15 percent decrease) and 24th in carbon dioxide (48 percent increase).
\
The report found that nine of the state's 13 electric power plants increased carbon dioxide emissions from 1995 to 2003, including Winyah, Santee Cooper's Cross and Jefferies plants in upper Berkeley County and South Carolina Electric & Gas Co.'s Williams plant in Goose Creek. SCE&G's Canadys plant in Colleton County decreased its emissions.
\
Carbon dioxide emission is the primary cause of global warming, Prevost said. Nitrogen oxide causes smog. Nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, or soot, have been shown to cause asthma and other lung problems.
\
The toxins, along with the neurotoxin mercury, are the major pollutants released by power plants, she said.
\
A PIRG news release said the Clear Skies initiative's proposed ""cap and trade"" rules allow the dirtiest plants to delay cleanups by buying credits from newer and cleaner plants. It characterizes South Carolina plants as among the oldest and dirtiest in the nation.
\
""The Bush administration plan allows power plants to become dirtier and dirtier,"" Prevost said. ""We urge Senators (Jim) DeMint and (Lindsey) Graham to do what's in the best interests of South Carolina.""
\
""The president's plan caps the emissions of a thousand power plants nationwide, permanently cuts three kinds of emissions and forces reductions without lawsuits,"" said DeMint spokesman Wesley Denton, whose boss sits on the subcommittee. ""His belief is the Clear Skies Act clears up the air, clears out the courts and creates jobs.""
\
Graham's spokesman, Kevin Bishop, said PIRG has a political agenda. ""Senator Graham appreciates PIRG's interest in promoting a cleaner environment. If PIRG has a genuine concern for promoting clean energy, they will reverse course and support President Bush's and Senator Graham's efforts to build new nuclear power plants in the United States.""
\
Varn said that by 2009, 90 percent of Santee Cooper's facilities will have state-of-the art environmental technology.
\
""We live here, too. I have a 17-month-old child, and I would not be working for a company if I thought they were hurting my child,"" she said.
\
""There are a lot of different reports,"" said Brian Duncan, SCE&G spokesman.
\
""We do and will comply with all regulations of state and federal agencies whose responsibility it is to look out for the health and safety of the public. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to meet changing environmental regulations in the past decade, and that is ongoing.""

CHARLESTON -- U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., drawing fire from energy industry group after saying he would seek bipartisan consensus on energy and global warming, said Friday reducing pollution and energy independence go together.
\
The lawmaker told reporters he wants a bill to do both.
\
An energy industry group, the American Energy Alliance, started running radio ads in the state this week criticizing Graham's position on cap and trade carbon taxes. The ads say that approach will cost jobs.
\
Under cap and trade, emission credits could be bought by companies who don't want to pay for equipment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
\
In a recent article in The New York Times written with U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the lawmakers said they would seek consensus.
\
""A legitimate bipartisan effort can put America back in the lead again,"" they wrote.
\
""Global climate change is not a religion to me but I do believe carbon pollution is harmful to the environment and I want to find a way to fix that problem,"" Graham said Friday.
\
""But it's got to be good business. None of the bills in the House or the Senate right now are good business. They would really hurt manufacturing and they would hurt rate payers,"" he said.
\
He said offshore drilling can be done in an environmentally responsible way and envisions allowing new nuclear plants and investing in clean coal technology to make use of the nation's 250-year stockpile of coal.
\
But he said some sort of emissions regulations are needed too.
\
""If you don't control carbon people are going to keep building coal-fired plants,"" he said. ""You have to make carbon emissions such that it's worth your time to invest in wind solar and nuclear. I think carbon controls can be reasonably had without disrupting our economy.""
\
Graham said it's better that Congress act, noting that two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled the Environmental Protection Agency can regulate carbon emissions.
\
""So you're looking at unelected bureaucrats controlling our economy rather than members of Congress,"" he said. ""We need a bill. We need a reasonable regulatory bill.""

12,"dbell@greenvillenews.com\An experimental power plant that Duke Energy Corp. is building in Indiana could help expand the market for the power-generating turbines that General Electric Co. makes in Greenville.\Usually, the multi-ton turbines that GE makes at its plant on Garlington Road burn natural gas to generate electricity for power plants.\But the two that Duke plans to install at the power plant it's constructing in Edwardsport, Ind., will burn a gas made from coal.\Duke also plans to capture up to half of the carbon dioxide generated by the plant and store it underground in what could be a first-of-its-kind demonstration of so-called ""clean coal"" technology.\The $2.3 billion plant will remove pollutants from the coal before burning it in gas form to create electricity and steam in a process known as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle.\The process is more expensive than the one used in conventional coal-fired power plants, but it's gentler on the environment. And the extra cost would be more justifiable if the Senate joins the House in passing legislation to limit carbon dioxide emissions.\If that cap-and-trade bill becomes law, and Duke's plant proves the viability of the clean coal technology, the market for Greenville-made turbines could expand, said Monte Atwell, general manager of gasification for GE Energy.\""It gives us another option to play in the power generation space that we don't have today,"" he said.\The government will also need to adopt regulations governing carbon dioxide storage, he said.\Legislation put forward by U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis of Greenville as an alternative to the cap-and-trade bill would also give power companies an incentive to adopt clean coal technology, a spokesman for the congressman said.\Duke spokeswoman Angeline Protogere said her company hopes to capture up to half of the plant's carbon dioxide, storing it in underground saline aquifers or pumping it into oil wells to enhance recovery from depleted fields, a process that's done now. Duke has applied for a federal grant to offset some of its costs for the carbon dioxide storage.\Clemson professor David Bodde said science still has a lot to learn about storing carbon dioxide underground permanently on a large scale.\""The question is can you measure what happens to the carbon when it goes underground? We don't have very good instrumentation to do that,"" said Bodde, a business professor, nuclear engineer and former deputy assistant secretary in the Energy Department.\Still, Bodde said he's optimistic about the prospects for clean coal technology.\""I believe we are going to have to do something about this carbon buildup in the atmosphere, and I think this is one of the better ways to do it,"" he said.\General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt told The Greenville News in 2007 that business at the company's Greenville plant would likely grow if the market embraces coal gas technology in a big way.\""If the coal market went to gasification, that's extra good for Greenville,"" Immelt said while in Greenville for the company's annual shareholders meeting. ""That's additive and very good for Greenville.""\GE is also developing a $100 million research plant in Wyoming, the biggest coal-producing state, as part of its efforts to study clean coal technology."

When Chinese President Xi Jinping's handlers arranged his flight from Seattle to Washington, D.C., on Thursday, they made sure he would land after Pope Francis had left. Xi didn't want to be overshadowed by the rock-star pope.
\
But, apart from timing, comparisons between the pope and Xi are unavoidable. The two leaders command the two largest constituencies in the world, 1.2 billion Catholics and 1.2 billion Chinese, respectively. And they hold polar opposite views on how to address the problems of their flocks and the world.
\
Pope Francis believes that solutions must emerge from the bottom up, while Xi seeks to solve everything from the top down.
\
During his U.S. trip, Francis stressed repeatedly that individuals have a moral responsibility to work together to preserve the environment, fight corruption, and ameliorate conflicts. His urgings were not just spiritual homilies but calls for grassroots political action to press legislators to act.
\
Citing four American heroes who turned ""dreams into action"" -- Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton -- the pope made clear that individual efforts to effect change are as important as those of the political elite.
\
Xi, on the other hand, is an authoritarian, distrustful of grassroots efforts. Despite his family's communist pedigree, Xi was forced to labor in the countryside for years during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution; he appears to have emerged with the belief that order must be strictly imposed from above.
\
So Xi has moved to squash China's expanding civil society and its remaining free media, and shows a Mao-like propensity to rule from the very top.
\
What's so fascinating is that Francis and Xi are addressing many similar problems -- especially pollution and corruption -- but from a totally different perspective.
\
The pope pleaded in Congress and at the United Nations for individual and governmental action to combat man-made climate change. Meantime, Xi proposed a cap-and-trade plan that would supposedly limit China's greenhouse gas emissions. Chinese action on this front is essential, as Beijing has surpassed the United States as the world's biggest polluter.
\
However, it's hard to have confidence in a Chinese government that blatantly manipulates statistics and markets, and seeks to control (and hack) the Web. When China's stock market recently tanked, the government's reaction was to bend the stats back into shape by forbidding press coverage, banning sales of shares, and intervening massively to fix prices.
\
This hardly inspires confidence in a market for cap and trade.
\
Similarly, Xi is waging war on Chinese corruption from the top down, by publicly firing and arresting a number of party officials. In a country as huge as China, fighting corruption from such heights is likely to fail.
\
In a sense, Pope Francis is daring us to demonstrate that our model is preferable to China's. He is trying to mobilize individuals to join together to work for the common good, and legislators to act responsibly as well.
\
Yet, as he observed in Congress, the discontents and contradictions of U.S. democracy can thwart such efforts. All the more so if legislators make war on all regulations, including those that curb pollution or combat destructive behavior by banks.
\
As if to confirm Francis' analysis, the Republican House speaker, John Boehner -- a devout Catholic who had invited the pope to address the joint session -- announced his resignation Friday. The conservative Boehner had been hounded by GOP extremists who seek to shut the national government down, yet again -- something the speaker opposed.
\
The pontiff has thrown down a challenge for Americans to do better. He urged Congress to ""confront every form of polarization,"" and individual Americans to pursue ""dreams that lead to action.""
\
The difference between Francis and Xi is basic: The pope believes in democracy's endless prospects for renewal by committed individuals and legislators. We have the chance to prove him right or wrong.

In his attempt to counterbalance South Carolina's win over Clemson on Saturday, Frank Wooten, in his column on sports obsessions, seemed to take great joy in discussing the fact that the Gamecocks don't make a habit of coming out on the winning end of this game very often. He chose to give readers a history lesson of sorts on the head-to-head meetings between the two teams.
\
And I was under the impression I was only paying for a newspaper. Instead, I was getting a sports almanac as well. What a deal! Two-for-one!
\
Janet Jackson once addressed that way of thinking in a song titled ""What Have You Done For Me Lately?""
\
In other words, history is just that -- history. It's done, it's over with, finished. What's now is important. If Clemson fans find the need to rely upon drudging up things that have happened in the past in order to make them feel good about the present, well, they have my sympathy.
\
That being the case, I wish all the Clemson fans out there a Merry Christmas and leave them with this holiday sentiment:

Obama's gift

Obama will take one more trip overseas before the Christmas holidays to continue the abatement of American status and power in the world when he attends the Copenhagen Climate Treaty Conference. Will his signing of this treaty be his Christmas present to all of America?
\
This treaty is a legally binding document to cut greenhouse emissions through the following goals:
\
Goal 1: Transferring wealth from industrial nations (the United States) to developing countries.
\
Goal 2: Dictating the energy use and consumption of industrial nations (the United States).
\
Goal 1 equals global Socialism and Goal 2 equals global dictatorship; together they equal a ""One World Order.""
\
If this treaty is signed the United States will be subjected to laws, rules, regulations and taxes of a ""one world,"" socialistic governing body.
\
This administration is constantly violating our rights and freedoms under the pretense of ""doing what is good for America and Americans."" This ""goodness"" must be stopped now. This treaty must not be signed.

Health care debate
\
Retired judge Vic Rawl, in his Nov. 10 letter in response to Roper St. Francis CEO David Dunlap's commentary on medical malpractice and health care reform, argues that reform of our current malpractice system would play no role in controlling the costs of defensive medicine that may be linked to the rising price of health care. He recited specific S.C. laws while rhetorically asking doctors if tort reform has ""reduced the cost of your medical negligence insurance?"" Suffice it to say that those who describe malpractice insurance as ""medical negligence"" insurance have a bone to pick with doctors.
\
Since the tort reform laws Judge Rawl cited were enacted, malpractice premiums in South Carolina have dropped, but it's too early to estimate how much. In Texas, where tort reform began in 1995, malpractice premiums have dropped by an average of 21 percent, and the Texas Hospital Association has reported a 70 percent decrease in the number of lawsuits filed against state hospitals. According to the Congressional Budget Office, national tort reform would save $54 billion over the next decade.
\
Judge Rawl has a strong opinion, as so many do in this health care debate. However, signing his letter as ""retired judge"" seems odd. It implies that he is above the fray. Perhaps a better suited moniker would have been ""trial attorney,"" which he also is.
\
Don't misunderstand -- there is nothing negative with regard to Judge Rawl being an attorney. Thirty- six percent of Congress and 54 percent of the Senate are also attorneys, as is President Obama. The health care reform act recently passed by Congress excludes states like South Carolina and Texas from incentives to develop ""alternative medical liability law"" if they ""limit attorneys fees or impose caps on damages.""
\
If we want health care to be like health care in European countries, then it's logical to think that there will be proposals like Mr. Dunlap's to make medical malpractice law similar to what exists overseas. I personally don't agree with Mr. Dunlap's idea, either, but I wouldn't describe it as ""out of character"" and ""quite misleading.""

It will be through that approach that the body politic can advance. Rather than search for and punish ideological purity, perhaps rallying around a constructive voice would be more useful.

Creating jobs
\
Some $3.8 billion has been spent by the federal government in South Carolina, and we struggle to clearly put numbers on jobs created or ""saved.""
\
Compare that to the $170 million incentive package used by South Carolina to lure Boeing to the Lowcountry. Direct impact is supposedly going to be 3,800 long-term jobs. We can argue about the multiplying factor of other jobs that will be directly tied to those 3,800.
\
I've heard perhaps 20,000 jobs will be indirectly created. Certainly it will be more than 3,800, though.
\
Shouldn't the U.S. government have used the same strategy South Carolina used to go to businesses not currently located in America and tried to ""lure"" those companies to the United States? Some will argue we shouldn't spend money on foreign companies, but at a minimum shouldn't the government be trying to make the United States the most attractive business environment worldwide to drive jobs into the nation, not away?
\
Now consider how deficit spending, cap and trade, and the current House proposal for health care are being viewed by foreign companies. Are we moving in the right direction?

Teachers survey
\
Last year the Charleston Teachers Alliance released a survey addressing discipline issues in the classroom. The survey results showed progress, yet there was still room for improvement. Superintendent Nancy McGinley downplayed these results by telling The Post and Courier that ""those who responded weren't necessarily a representative sample.""
\
When the next CTA survey showed positive scores for Dr. McGinley, she embraced the results, saying, ""I'm very encouraged by their feedback.""
\
Our most recent CTA survey showed a number of issues that the district needs to address and now the results are being downplayed by board member Ann Oplinger who said, ""The CTA survey represents a fraction of teachers.""
\
District leaders need to make up their minds as to how they are going to respond to survey results. They should not dismiss what they don't want to hear while embracing the positive. The CTA is the largest teacher advocacy group in the district. The issues we bring up are legitimate and need to be addressed. This means action that teachers can see, not just talk.
\
If the district is going to say that the CTA is not a representative group then they need to provide hard data to prove this. Making a statement that the teachers you talk to are positive has no statistical merit.
\
If the 800-plus teachers who completed our most recent survey are not a representative group, I welcome the district to send a list a teachers who would be a representative group for our next survey and the CTA will be more than happy to have them participate. All teachers are welcomed to participate.
\
Teachers are the most valuable asset in the public education system. We spend countless hours in the classroom doing all we can to help our students succeed.
\
This is our passion. We know what works and what needs to be fixed. The district needs to stop downplaying our voices, listen, and take measurable action to help teachers so we can better help our students.

Dumbing down
\
I realized at an early age that my strengths were not cerebral. I also realized I was blessed with abundant common sense and the ability to see what is happening around me and to make the right moves.
\
So maybe that is why I see as clear as a bell the similarity of what was going on that caused the revolt against England and the creation of our country, and what is going on today.
\
Our government is acting exactly as England did. Taxation without representation. Lending a deaf ear to the majority, and bribing the needy to be useful idiots. Is it just an accident that the education system in this country has downplayed our proud history to the point where college grads don't know the three branches of government, or the difference between the House of Representatives and the Senate? But they know only too well all the perceived negatives of the country that protects them.

Community help
\
Your recent article about faith-based medical clinics in Charleston confirms my belief that big government should be limited and we should (and will) care for our own on a local level.
\
How can we ignore the track record of federal programs rife with waste and fraud? The First Time Homebuyer's Program has already shown $400 million in fraudulent claims in less than one year.
\
Social Security and Food Stamps are said to loose $2 billion annually in fraud and overpayments. The postal service posted a loss of over $3 billion this year. Medicare and Medicaid waste more money than any other federal program costing us $60 billion annually. The list goes on and on. Now we are encouraging the federal government stepping in to manage our health care? Say it isn't so.
\
I am privileged to be a member of one of the churches featured in the article. Two years ago the Remount area of North Charleston was considered one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the nation. Seacoast Christian Community saw a chance to make a difference. The church reached out with support and resources.
\
This year 104,000 pounds of food are being distributed through the Dream Pantry. Clothing is being provided through the Dream Closet to the tune of 70,000 pieces. Approximately 3,000 meals were served for Thanksgiving. In its first year of operation, the Dream Center Medical Clinic will serve 5,000 patients. It is estimated that this will save approximately $10 million out of the health care system, saving taxpayer dollars.
\
Seacoast didn't wait for the government to fix it. They took care of their own. We need to cut back federal programs and follow folks like Seacoast in finding solutions to care for our own.

15,"
South Carolina's senior senator has caught grief from some on the right for teaming up with Massachusetts' senior senator to seek compromise climate change legislation. But before accusing Sen. Lindsey Graham of straying into far left field with Sen. John Kerry, consider the praise that their joint efforts -- including a recent, co-written, widely published column -- have drawn from not just heads of prominent environmental groups but heads of prominent corporations.
\
The U.S. Climate Action Partnership, in a letter to the senators, applauded their ""leadership in seeking a bipartisan path forward"" on this issue, adding: ""We share your goal of enacting an energy and climate policy that is environmentally sound, economically sustainable and protective of our national security.""
\
And: ""Currently, Europe, China, and India are investing heavily in the development of new clean-energy technologies, trying to seize the global competitive edge. Properly designed climate legislation and a favorable investment environment can foster and reward U.S. innovation, create jobs at home and put us at the front of this race.""
\
Among the USCAP members who signed that letter were the CEOs and presidents of the Nature Conservancy, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and the Environmental Defense Fund. However, also signing were the chiefs of Alcoa, Caterpillar Inc., ConocoPhillips, Dow, Duke, DuPont, General Motors and Shell -- hardly a list of the usual pro-regulation, anti-business suspects.
\
Like them, Sen. Graham is pressing for an energy bill that reduces greenhouse gas emissions without reducing the strength of economic recovery. As he recently told The Associated Press: ""Global climate change is not a religion to me, but I do believe carbon pollution is harmful to the environment and I want to find a way to fix that problem. But it's got to be good business.""
\
Stressing that ""good business"" point, Sen. Graham advocates practical, productive incentives to make it ""worth your time to invest in wind, solar and nuclear.""

The Senate has begun ""cap and trade"" hearings. Clashing views on this matter are getting mighty warm in Washington -- and in our letters to the editor.

16,"
WASHINGTON -- Senators working on a compromise climate bill unveiled the basics of their plan for the first time on Thursday, including encouragement for new nuclear power plants, a continued use of coal and a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target that's lower than what the Senate had been considering.
\
Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, are looking for a plan that wins enough business support so that senators will see it as a win for the economy and a way to line up more support for it. So far, Graham is the only Republican to speak favorably about the plan, and many Democratic senators also are uncertain because of worries about energy costs and jobs.
\
The framework was announced after weeks of talks between the three senators and their colleagues.
\
""The idea of unlimited carbon pollution in perpetual form doesn't sit well with most Republicans,"" but they're concerned with the costs of limiting them, Graham said. Success in getting enough votes to pass the bill depends on support for nuclear energy, an agreement to continue to burn coal, and a ""meaningful"" expansion of oil and gas drilling that adds to the U.S. supply, Graham said.
\
""If we can't make this good business, it won't happen,"" Graham said. ""I believe we can.""
\
Graham said he was on board with efforts to craft a bill because he saw it as the best opportunity to reduce dependence on foreign oil and create jobs.
\
""I believe the green economy is coming. That's not a question of if it's going to happen, it's just when it's going to happen. The sooner the better for me, because the jobs of the future I do believe lie in energy independence and cleaning up the environment,"" he said.
\
The White House called the framework announcement ""a positive development towards reaching a strong, unified and bipartisan agreement in the U.S. Senate.""
\
Kerry said that the framework sends a message to the international climate negotiations in Copenhagen that the Senate will take action next year to pass a law requiring U.S. emissions reductions. A global climate treaty cannot be reached without it.
\
'Disappointing'
\
Frank O'Donnell, the president of the environmental group Clean Air Watch, called the compromise ""tremendously disappointing,"" adding that ""it reads like a coal production manifesto.""
\
The framework said that ""coal's future as part of the energy mix is inseparable from the passage"" of the bill."" It said lawmakers would offer ""significant resources"" for ""clean coal technology"" and promote ways to capture carbon emissions and bury them underground.
\
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., planned to introduce an alternative bill -- a ""cap and dividend"" plan that would charge for pollution and return most of the money directly to Americans.
\
The Kerry-Graham-Lieberman plan includes a cap-and-trade plan for emissions allowances.
\
Their plan also includes protections for U.S. businesses from unfair competition, a limit on the price of allowances and protections for consumers and businesses from energy price increases.
\
Certainty
\
Kerry said that large companies are asking for a limit on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels because it would give them the certainty they need for making investments.
\
The plan calls for emissions reductions ""in the range of 17 percent below 2005 emission levels"" by 2020, the same level that President Barack Obama proposed in the international negotiations. A Senate climate bill passed by the Environment and Public Works Committee without Republican support called for a 20 percent reduction by 2020.
\
The 17 percent target is equivalent to only a 4 percent cut from 1990 levels, far less than the 25 percent to 40 percent reductions suggested by scientists for developed countries.
\
The specifics will be worked out by Senate committees meeting in January and February, and the goal is to have a bill for debate in early spring, Kerry said.
\
In another development, the House voted on final action to spend $1.5 million on a study of U.S. taxes to determine how much they provide incentives to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., proposed the plan. His office said final agreement in the Senate was likely.

This report shows how Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., voted on 50 of the most newsworthy issues considered by the House from Jan. 27, 2009, through Aug. 2, 2012. Mitt Romney, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, has selected Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate. Further details on Ryan's voting record can be found at www.voterama.info.
\
2012
\
1. Payroll-Tax Cut: The House on Feb. 17, 2012, voted, 293-132, to extend until Dec. 31 a law allowing workers to contribute 4.2 percent of their pay to Social Security, down from the standard 6.2 percent. The $100 billion cost of financing the tax cut was to be deficit spending, and the bill's remaining $50 billion in outlays were to be offset by revenue measures. A yes vote was to send the Senate a bill that also funded long-term jobless benefits and protected from Medicare cuts. (HR 3630)
\
Ryan voted no.
\
2. Medicare Cost Panel: The House on March 22, 2012, voted, 223-181, to abolish the Independent Payment Advisory Panel created by the 2010 health law to curb Medicare costs with Congress having a say in its decisions. A yes vote was to pass a bill that also made medical-malpractice changes such as capping punitive-damage awards at $250,000 and limiting attorneys' contingency fees. (HR 5)
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
3. The Paul Ryan Budget: The House on March 29, 2012, passed, 228-191, a Republican budget for fiscal 2013 and later years that would eventually privatize Medicare, make Bush-era tax cuts permanent, cut personal and business taxes, simplify the tax code, slash deficits and cut domestic spending. The measure was named informally after Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. A yes vote was to pass HCR 112.
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
4. Voter ID Laws: The House on May 9, 2012, voted, 232-190, to prevent the Justice Department from interfering with state voter ID laws. This followed the department's blocking of such laws in South Carolina and Texas as racially discriminatory. The department acted under authority of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. A yes vote backed the amendment to HR 5326.
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
5. Violence Against Women: The House on May 16, 2012, voted, 222-205, to renew the Violence Against Women Act for five years at funding of $680 million annually. Democrats disputed this Republican bill mainly because it omitted provisions in a bi-partisan Senate-passed bill to expand protections for battered women who are illegal immigrants, Native American women who are assaulted on reservations by non-Indians and gays, lesbians and transsexuals. A yes vote backed the GOP bill (HR 4970).
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
6. Energy v. Environment: The House on June 21, 2012, voted, 248-163, to expand oil drilling offshore and on federal lands and shelve new environmental rules for refineries. A yes vote backed a bill (HR 4480) that also changed the Clean Air Act by requiring its regulations to be based primarily on economic impact, not health factors, which is the existing standard.
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
7. Health Law Repeal: The House on July 11, 2012, voted, 244-185, to repeal the 2010 health law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, most of which had just been found constitutional by the Supreme Court.

\
Ryan voted yes.
\
8. Congressional Health Plan: The House on July 11, 2012, refused, 180-248, to remove members who voted for HR 6079 (above) from the taxpayer-subsidized health plan for lawmakers, civil servants, federal retirees and others. A yes vote was to discharge these members from the federal plan on grounds they do not deserve far better insurance coverage than most of their constituents receive.
\
Ryan voted no.
\
9. Defense-Spending Freeze: The House on July 19, 2012, voted, 247-167, to freeze the core defense budget for fiscal 2013 at the 2012 level of $518 billion while protecting military healthcare and pay levels and $87.7 billion in war outlays from cuts. Eighty-nine Republicans and 158 Democrats backed the measure. A yes vote was to trim the 2013 defense budget (HR 5856) by $1 billion.
\
Ryan voted no.
\
10. Federal Reserve Audit: The House on July 25, 2012, voted, 327-98, to direct the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to audit the Federal Reserve, an independent agency, this year.

\
Ryan voted yes.
\
11. Regulations Freeze: The House on July 26, 2012, voted, 245-172, to bar new federal regulations having an impact of $100 million or more on the economy from taking effect until the U.S. jobless rate drops below 6 percent. Presidents could waive the ban to meet emergencies. A yes vote was to pass HR 4078.
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
12. Weather-Related Regulations: Voting 177-240, The House on July 26, 2012, defeated an amendment to HR 4078 (above) to prevent interruptions in regulations protecting the public from ""extreme weather, including drought, flooding and catastrophic wildfire.""

\
Ryan voted no.
\
13. Republican Tax Cuts: Members on Aug. 1, 2012, passed, 256-171, a GOP bill to extend Bush-era tax cuts for all incomes through 2013. The bill also kept estate taxes low, retained 15 percent as the capital-gains and dividends rate and allowed certain credits for the working poor to expire. A yes vote was to pass HR 8.
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
14. GOP Tax-Code Overhaul: The House on Aug. 2, 2012, passed, 232-189, a bill setting forth the House Republicans' wish list for any overhaul of the Tax Code debated in the next Congress. A yes vote called for making the code flatter, closing loopholes, ending breaks, cutting rates and limiting tax revenue to 18 or 19 percent of GDP (HR 8)
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
15. Home-Mortgage, Charitable Deductions: The House on Aug. 2, 2012, defeated, 188-235, a Democratic motion stating that any Tax Code overhaul should retain deductions for home mortgages and charitable contributions. The underlying bill (HR 8, above) did not identify tax breaks Republicans would like to see repealed. A yes vote was to retain the two tax breaks.
\
Ryan voted no.
\
2011
\
1. Climate-Change Science: Voting 184-240, members on April 6, 2011, refused to embrace the Environmental Protection Agency's ""scientific findings...that climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks for public health and welfare."" A yes vote backed the amendment to HR 910.
\
Ryan voted no.
\
2. Greenhouse Gases: The House on April 7, 2011, passed, 255-172, a bill denying the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions linked to climate change and challenging the science upon which those regulations are based. A yes vote was to pass HR 910.
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
3. Expanded Offshore Drilling: The House on May 12, 2011, approved, 243-179, energy drilling in several Outer Continental Shelf regions where it is barred for environmental reasons.

"
18,"
On March 27, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a rule on new power plants in the U.S., limiting CO2 emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity produced to 1,000 pounds. This is about what a state-of-the-art, combined-cycle, gas-fired power plant emits, and far below what the best coal-fired plant can accomplish without extremely expensive (and currently commercially unavailable) carbon capture technology.
\
While the new rule has certain exceptions and allows for phasing in the new technology over many years, it adds to the woes of the largest single source of electric power generation in the country.
\
Last year's cross-state air pollution rule and mercury emission limits hit coal hard. The clear winner was the natural gas industry.
\
There's nothing wrong with natural gas, and improved extraction techniques like hydraulic fracturing have vastly expanded recoverable reserves. However, there is no need to use government rule-making to push electricity generation toward natural gas faster. Doing so distorts markets, increases risks to the electric power industry from a rapidly changing regulatory environment, and increases the hardship on coal industry workers.
\
Coal mines alone, not to mention coal-burning power plants and coal transport (e.g., railroads and coal shipping), employed more than 86,000 Americans in 2010. The rule is particularly disheartening for some of the most economically depressed regions of the country, like West Virginia.
\
In addition, costs could increase in the long term for regions heavily dependent on coal for energy.
\
Grandfathering existing power plants would ease the economic impact, though the rule means that rising demand for electricity is more likely to be met through natural gas and other sources. While current price trends favor natural gas, the EPA's rule means we have fewer options in the future, should that trend change.
\
The EPA assumes that market forces favoring natural gas will prevent the construction of new coal-fired power plants even without the rule -- though if this were the case, one wonders why the coal industry would bother to protest.
\
The EPA says that ""this proposed rule is not likely to produce changes in emissions of greenhouse gases or other pollutants,"" which indicates that either the rule is unnecessary, because lower natural gas prices are already leading where the EPA wants to go, or that it will have costs the EPA has not anticipated.
\
Either way, this calls the rule into question.
\
Of greater concern is that existing coal-fired power plants may fall under similar restrictions later. While EPA administrator Lisa Jackson has indicated that there are ""no plans"" for a rule like this to apply to existing sources, one is likely on its way.
\
At a recent House subcommittee hearing, assistant administrator Gina McCarthy refused to give assurances that CO2 emissions from existing sources would not be regulated later under this administration. More ominous, an agreement the EPA made with environmental groups in 2010 more or less forces the EPA to apply some sort of CO2 restriction to existing power plants eventually.
\
With the current rule and future carbon regulations, environmentalist organizations and the Obama administration are able to bypass Congress' rejection of cap-and-trade carbon limits.
\
There is, indeed, more than one way to skin a cat.
\
Most disturbing is the EPA's continuing determination to force disruptive changes on energy production with no apparent regard for costs. Even if ordinary market forces are tipping the scales in favor of natural gas, the EPA's muscle-flexing on cross-state air pollution, mercury emissions and now CO2 emissions indicates its compliance with an international green agenda based on dubious science and worse economics.
\
A study released last fall by the Cornwall Alliance demonstrates the weakness of the alleged link between coal-plant mercury emissions and risk to human health.
\
The connection between anthropogenic CO2 emissions and human health -- the foundation for the new rule -- is far weaker than commonly supposed. There has been no statistically significant increase in global temperature in the past 17 years, although CO2 concentration has risen apace [ECB1] -- largely falsifying the claim that increased CO2 is a major driver of global warming and that any future warming from it will be dangerous.
\
Since low-cost energy tends to lead to better health through economic growth, the EPA would be well-advised to pay more attention to the economic impact of its rules.
\
The legal basis for the rule -- the EPA's assertion that CO2 threatens human health through global warming and therefore the EPA is authorized to regulate it -- is under challenge in the courts. Congress, too, could reverse the new rule.
\
However, even if these rules are rescinded, the impact on energy production is likely to persist. Electric utilities will be reluctant to invest in coal-fired power plants when the EPA could make the investments financial disasters by issuing another rule of this sort. And while the natural gas industry is the current beneficiary, the EPA could easily decide to target it, too, since it also creates CO2 emissions.
\
Each new EPA regulation that ignores costs in pursuit of its reckless green agenda creates an environment of higher risk for the entire industry.

Keep it clean
\
The article in The Post and Courier regarding the trashing of the beaches hit home with me.
\
I am a property manager, and I am discouraged to see the lack of pride residents exhibit. I do have residents who take care of their areas and do not leave debris and trash around the property.
\
I have two compactors on the property and still people will throw bags on the top or just throw it over the enclosure. Other properties have the same issues, including residents not cleaning up after their pets.
\
I ask everyone on any property to take care and pride in where you live. Don't wait for someone else to do it.
\
I can guarantee that your environment will be a better place to live and you will have a happy property manager.

Dowd's attack
\
The July 7 Maureen Dowd column titled ""Diva Sara's folly"" is one of the most vicious attacks on the governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, to come down the pipeline from the liberal press.
\
Dowd attacked Gov. Palin's ability to make value judgments and decisions by stating, ""Sarah wanted everyone to know that she's not having fun and people are being mean to her ... ."" She also referred to the governor as: ""Caribou Barbie is one nutty puppy.""
\
To illustrate her point, Dowd then wrote derogatory statements about Richard M. Nixon, deceased, LBJ, deceased, and Dick Cheney, who unfortunately for Maureen, is very much alive.
\
Whatever Gov. Palin's plans are, she will continue to draw attacks from the drive-by press.
\
As for The New York Times and its staff of liberals, they're living on borrowed time.

Keller's example
\
I always enjoy reading the history column to remind myself of what took place on a certain day. I was disappointed when I didn't read a historical note of the birth of one of the bravest, best-educated and best-known disabled Americans, Helen Keller.
\
Born June 28, 1880, Ms. Keller helped shape our perception of disabled Americans.
\
She was the first deaf/blind person to earn a bachelor's degree. She read English, and also French, German, Greek and Latin. She was a supporter for women's suffrage before women's liberation was even talked about.
\
At the age of 22, Keller published her autobiography, ""The Story of My Life"" (1903). For someone with such a profound disability, she certainly made a mark in this world.
\
She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson and was made an honorary lifetime member of the Lions Club International, the fraternal organization who's mission it is to assist the blind and deaf.
\
Lions Clubs International (LCI) is the world's largest secular service organization with over 44,500 clubs and more than 1.4 million members in 203 countries around the world.
\
Lions members exemplify their motto, ""We Serve,"" focusing on programming related to sight conservation, hearing and speech conservation and other programs that support the local communities where Lions live.
\
As a proud member of the Charleston Lions Club, we understand the importance of Ms. Keller's many gifts to the world.
\
We would like to invite anyone interested in helping those in need to become a proud Lion.

'A lifesaver'
\
Brian Hicks' article concerning animal shelters in the June 1 issue titled ""Saving furry friends gets tougher"" has been a lifesaver for GBSI Animal Refuge, at least for awhile. The majority of responders have told us they read the story in The Post and Courier.
\
Although we've not reached our $35,000 goal, we thank God for enough funds for about the next six months.
\
On behalf of my wife, Faye, our volunteers, ""The Barkers,"" and myself, I extend to Mr. Hicks and The Post and Courier a very heartfelt thank you for your consideration of our cause.
\
Thank you also to all the readers who took from themselves to help these animals. Donations are still needed, and we are thankful to anyone who can assist us when they can.

No waiting
\
Recently, I had a reason to visit the emergency room at St. Francis Hospital. Needless to say, it was quite busy. Once I was in a room, I was quite the center of attention. The doctors and all of the technicians were very much on top of things.
\
After my problem was diagnosed, I was admitted to the hospital and then sent to the primary care unit for monitoring. The nurses and the technicians were extremely professional and efficient.
\
Granted, our system is expensive and is not perfect, but why would anyone want socialized medicine?
\
Do we want to wait? And possibly die waiting? I do not.
\
Why do you think people from some other countries come here for treatment? I think the answer is obvious.

Health care
\
Thank goodness for my government-run health care. I have been a beneficiary of Tricare (formerly Champus) for 26 years due to my husband having served a full career in the U.S. Navy.
\
We have a $500 family deductible, 25 percent co-pay and can choose our own doctors (many whom I have been seeing for over 20 years).
\
Our prescription drugs usually cost between $3 and $16. If this administration's health-care plan can come even close to the wonderful insurance the federal government has provided my family, it will have come a long way in finding a cure for our nation's health-care woes.

Foreign beef
\
I recently went to my local grocer and found the labels of origin on the beef products somewhat helpful. This little sticker prevented me from buying T-bones from Mexico at half the price of the American brand.

The savings will not persuade me to buy foreign beef. How can anyone buy a less expensive grade of beef at the expense of an American job?

Haste makes waste
\
I hope America is paying attention to the way our new Democrat-controlled Congress is choosing to govern.
\
Recently, Democrats pushed a cap-and-trade bill through the U.S. House that will have far-reaching consequences on our environment and our economy.
\
They passed it on a slim margin not based on its merits but through political pressure on their members.
\
A 300-page amendment was filed at 3 a.m. Congress had to vote on it without even having time to read it.
\
The American people are so strongly against this bill that the volume of phone calls made to oppose it shut down Congress' phone system. The bill now moves to the Senate where we can be sure Democrats will try the same tactics.
\
Let's hope our two Republican senators will stand up for the democratic process and the American people, and stop this disastrous energy bill from becoming law.

I am sorry that Paul M. Clements misunderstood my WPA article, but he is entirely right. The government should not be involved except to sanction the project. I wrote previously that ""The people in power could also ask U.S. billionaires, millionaires and other citizens who have some money to spare to donate money so that WPA workers could be paid."" Instead of that, a patriotic philanthropist could start a foundation similar to the Gates Foundation. That foundation could be run by a person with business sense like Bill and Melinda Gates.
\
The project that I suggested is expansive and expensive, but vital. How many lives have been devastated and how many businesses ruined or delayed by the 2008 floods and wildfires? How much money has been spent by state and federal governments to repair the damage? How much tax revenue has been lost to states and the federal government because businesses are not operating and their employees not working in those areas? How much tax revenue has been lost because farms have been flooded or destroyed by drought, and the farmers have lost the income from the crops? If the reader wants to see some of the costs to our government, check Wikipedia's article on the 2008 floods in the Midwest. Our environment has been so harmed that we will continue to have droughts and floods, and Americans need to be protected from these disasters. We Americans must realize that, because we live in a democracy, we are the government. The people in Washington, D.C., in Columbia and other government offices are public servants. If you believe in the idea that I described, write to these public servants and write to television stations, radio stations and newspapers.

Carbon tax supporter Thomas Friedman ridiculed Gov. Rick Perry's ""rejecting the science of climate change."" Former EPA Administrator Carol Martha Browner, however, classified last year's BP oil spill (some 206 million gallons) as the worst environmental disaster the U.S. had faced. Friedman and Browner apparently disagreed over the primacy of environmental crises. Perhaps man-made climate change did not weigh first among Ms. Browner's worst disasters because it has not been a clear and present danger.
\
Man-made pollution of coastal waters and harbors, however, has been a clear and present danger since 1972. Stormwater runoff pours over 27 billion (not million) gallons a year of untreated sewage into New York Harbor alone. The District of Columbia itself discharges 3.2 billion gallons of untreated sewage into its nearby waters each year. They are not alone.
\
Untreated runoffs plague many waterways at home and abroad. Runoffs, whether from toilets or parking lots, include varying amounts of toxic chemicals, heavy metals, exotic pharmaceuticals and biological disease hazards.
\
What has been the response to this clear and present ecological disaster? A 2004 settlement with federal environmental officials requires Washington, D.C., to build a $1.4 billion underground stormwater storage system during the next 20 years. The relative lack of urgency contrasts poorly with the relentless push for global cap and trade or tax schemes.
\
The reason for Friedman's harping may not be obvious. In 2009, Friedman described his evident dismay with the enviable lifestyle of ordinary American workers:
\
"" ... more and more people can now see how we live, aspire to our lifestyle and even take our jobs so they can live how we live. So ...by 2050, ...many more will live like ""Americans"" -- with American-size homes, American-size cars, eating American-size Big Macs.""
\
Careless turns can be onto one-way streets, Mr. Friedman.

Lindsey's lapses
\
I know we are stuck with Sen. Lindsey Graham for five more years, and we need to concentrate our electoral energies on things we can accomplish in the more immediate future.
\
That having been said, Sen. Graham's column supporting climate change legislation, written with Sen. John Kerry, just confirms that Sen. Graham's philosophy of governing is damaging to our system of constitutional democracy.
\
In addition to the usual pabulum about bipartisanship and the need to develop all types of energy, much of which the Democrats would never actually agree to do, what is really disturbing is that Sen. Graham says we need to pass the legislation in order to head off the Environmental Protection Agency, which would impose even more onerous regulations than those in the current climate change bill.
\
So let's get this straight -- regardless of the costs of the bill to taxpayers, we should support this legislation based on our fear of the unelected bureaucrats at the EPA, who have the power to supersede the democratically elected Congress -- and Lindsey Graham sees nothing wrong with that?
\
And he and Sen. John McCain want to remake the Republican Party in their image?
\
I see something seriously wrong with that.

No problem
\
The Post and Courier has been banging the drum to ""do something"" about man-made carbon dioxide emissions, even when there is no evidence that the increased CO2 is causing any harm.
\
Let's review some science facts. Of the heat-trapping ""greenhouse gases,"" 96 percent is composed of water vapor versus 2 percent CO2. Most of the CO2 comes from natural respiration of people and animals. Carbon dioxide makes up only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere.
\
Increasing carbon dioxide concentration is in fact beneficial, resulting in more rapid forest growth and increased crop yield.
\
Global warming alarmists conveniently overlook that the earth has been cooling since 1998, even as CO2 levels continue to rise.
\
Also overlooked is that the concentration of real pollutants, such as lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulates, is significantly lower than it was decades ago.
\
When was the last time we had a smog alert in Charleston?
\
What CO2 cap-and-trade legislation will do, as President Obama revealed in a January 2008 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board, is make electricity rates ""skyrocket."" More expensive electricity and transportation fuels will contract our standard of living and cause an increase in our already high unemployment rate.
\
Let's continue to improve our environment by growing the economy and improving our technologies.
\
We can't have economic growth and use less electricity and fuel.
\
We don't need a government scheme to solve a problem that doesn't exist.

The rest of his letter does little to clarify the issue to my mind.

Secure your place in the queue.
\
The curtain is about to rise.
\
A trio of local film festivals unspools for the spring season, sporting as extensive and diverse a playbill as organizers can mount in a highly competitive (and thoroughly saturated) national movie-event environment.
\
Charleston Film Festival, March 11-14
\
Opening the run is the first for-profit fest to be held at the Terrace Theatre. The new Charleston Film Festival is the brainchild of Terrace owner Mike Furlinger, who hopes his inaugural event will distinguish itself by taking a somewhat unconventional path.
\
""I think we are doing a couple of groundbreaking things this year,"" he says.
\
Among them is a one-day showing March 12 of British director Jon Amiel's controversial ""Creation,"" in which Charles Darwin (Paul Bettany) copes with the death of his daughter by absorbing himself in the work of ""The Origin of Species."" Also starring Jennifer Connelly, Jeremy Northam and Toby Jones, the movie has generated a split of opinion between audiences as well as among critics.
\
""On Saturday, and for the first time, we are going to have a Gay Pride block of films beginning at 7:15 p.m.,"" Furlinger says. ""Then there's a Mother Earth block, in which green films are emphasized.""
\
The latter features ""The Whole Truth,"" which presents both sides of the cap-and-trade issue, and ""Acid Test: The Global Challenges of Ocean Acidification,"" narrated by Sigourney Weaver.
\
More mainstream fare includes ""The Red Baron,"" a look at the career of World War I German fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen. Included in an array of locally produced films are the much-praised documentary ""The Curious Mister Catesby,"" the short film ""Letters From Home"" (shot on the set of ""Army Wives"") and writer-director Nick Smith's action feature, ""Cold Soldiers.""
\
The only event not housed at the Terrace on James Island will be the closing festival gala and awards ceremony, which will be held downtown at the Terrace Hippodrome. All tickets for the gala are $5, which includes open bar and food.
\
""In several cases, instead of simply awarding a trophy, we are also going to screen the winning films at the gala, as is the case in two shorts categories and one in the documentary group,"" Furlinger adds.
\
The CFF marks a break between the Terrace and the similarly titled Charleston International Film Festival, which originated at the James Island theater but has since moved to the American Theater downtown. The break was not an especially amicable one, but all parties evince enthusiasm over the programming they've devised.
\

\
Festival of Ballycahill, March 13-17
\
Sure and it is! Three independent films from the Emerald Isle, a land of consummate storytellers, will be featured during the first Festival of Ballycahill, a celebration of Irish arts, crafts and culture.
\
Named for the Anglicized version of the Gaelic word for Charleston (Baile Chathail, or town of Charles), the festival culminates on St. Patrick's Day.
\
All films with be shown in Room 309 of the College of Charleston Simons Center for the Arts.
\
Screening on March 14 will be ""Saviours,"" a low-budget boxing documentary set in Dublin and directed by the team of Ross Whitaker and Liam Nolan. It will be followed on March 15 by writer-director Lance Daly's ""Kisses,"" the tale of a teenage runaway who flees an abusive father to find a brother who ran off two years before, and on March 17 by ""A Film With Me in It,"" Ian Fitzgibbon's bleakly funny comedy of an out-of-work actor who seems to be causing those around him to have freak accidents.
\
The films are sponsored by the Center for the Documentary at the College of Charleston. For updated details, go online at www.ballycahillfestival.com.
\
Charleston International Film Festival, April 8-11
\
Entering their third year, festival directors Summer Spooner and Brian Peacher take particular pride in the fact that their nonprofit fest, the area's most expansive since the heyday of WorldFest in the mid-'90s, is on track to be an Academy Award Qualifier by year five.
\
""This is hard to achieve and a big deal, especially for any future CIFF film winners,"" says Peacher, also noting that this year the CIFF is teaming with the audience interactive site B-Side, which likewise had a first-time association with the recent Sundance Film Festival. ""What it means is if they win at our festival, they may be considered for an Oscar.""
\
Having moved to the American Theater downtown, the CIFF's aim continues to be that of offering ""the very best of emerging and veteran filmmakers from the Lowcountry, the U.S. and across the globe.""
\
Showcasing premieres and sneak previews, as well as appearances by directors, producers, cinematographers and screenwriters for post-screening Q&A sessions, the festival again encompasses an array of free entertainment industry panels and workshops, a screenplay competition, nightly after-parties and its customary Awards Gala. Joy and Noelle Vaccese of New York have been named winners of the poster contest for the official image of the 2010 festival. The Vacceses also were the Audience Choice Award Winners for Best Animation at the 2008 festival.

Honor flight
\
April 24 may have been just another ho-hum day to most of you, but to several score of World War II veterans, it was anything but. Honor Flight of the Lowcountry treated us to a memorable day with a trip to Washington, D.C., to visit a variety of war memorials which included the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, the Viet Nam Wall, the flag-raising atop Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi Memorial, and the remarkable memorial to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
\
From the very beginning of our day to its climactic end we experienced nothing but kindness and patience truly above and beyond.
\
I'm not sure what my fellow travelers expected, but I was not prepared for the rousing welcome on our arrival at Washington's Reagan Airport, nor the one we received on our return to Charleston. We were honored, not only by airport and military personnel, but by families, family friends, personal friends, total strangers, and the traveling public, as well.
\
To the many Honor Flight volunteers, the Mount Pleasant Police Department, USAirway personnel, the TSA inspectors and the food purveyors our heartfelt thanks for truly a day to remember. If I have overlooked anyone, be assured it was not intentional and I would hope to be forgiven.
\
On behalf of a group of grateful veterans, thank you.

Budget blunders
\
How much more money could we find if we audited the many special accounts that the state has? In the April 18 paper I saw where the budget was overstated by $60 million which they found in the wrong account.
\
The state board of Economic Advisors says it was a mistake. If I had made a $60 million mistake, someone would know in a hurry. Meantime people are being overtaxed and losing jobs. Someone should look into these special funds for tax scofflaws and give us answers.

Litmus test
\
After reading the AP story about the tea party and how it would affect November elections, the quote from Matt Schlapp, a political advisor, stands out for me. ""The American experience is if you don't go through one of the two major parties or you don't home in on a single issue as a litmus test, it's very difficult to be impactful across the country.""
\
This quote is the answer to the question of why and where this unorganized ""hodgepodge"" of groups has come from. America wasn't founded on the principles of the Democratic or Republican parties. It was founded on the very basic and common understanding laid forth in the Constitution.
\
Real Americans have had our eyes opened by the results of living so many years with our eyes shut. Real Americans will not always agree on everything and the two parties have created a status quo that real Americans cannot always align with down two lines. The tea party is not leaderless. We are responsible for our own destiny. We, the People, are the leaders.
\
We, the People, will remain free as long as we allow it, and I hope that is forever.

'Paddling buddy'
\
Every so often you encounter someone in your life who lives in a different reality than you or your friends. A mystic who you respect and admire but who ""marches to a different drummer."" For me this person was Cotton Harness. A lawyer who lived his passion for the environment, he drove a hybrid Honda before it was cool and spent years designing a ""green"" house for his retirement. His specialty was mediation and he taught other lawyers and judges.
\
He loved his family and his dogs -- his family might say in the reverse order. And he loved to paddle. That's where I come in. I was his paddling buddy. We paddled many of the whitewater rivers in North Carolina and I can vouch for the fact that he knew most every rock on the bottom of these rivers.
\
You see, Cotton had a mild overestimation of his paddling skills. He once paddled an entire river ""blind"" after he lost his glasses at the ""put-in."" But that was OK, nothing bothered him and he was in Heaven on any river. I hope he's there now waiting for me.

Positive changes
\
I, for one, am tired of my city, Folly Beach, being the unofficial drinking destination for most of the 15- to 25-year-olds in Charleston County and beyond. The proliferation of bars, to the detriment of restaurants, and the refusal of our previous mayor to even consider banning public drinking on our beach is the last step in the deterioration that started with the building of the Holiday Inn in 1985, followed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989.
\
Rental McMansions replaced cozy beachfront bungalows and unbridled drinking on the beach spawned countless bars, or perhaps it was the other way around. We remember the days when Folly was a family destination where young kids were safe and the streets relatively drivable. Now it appears the McMansions are only rented for college-age house parties, and the streets are littered with trash.
\
Where else in Charleston County can one drive down a street and see upended trash cans with trash spilling out every day of the week? There were 42 on East Cooper Avenue at my last count.
\
There is an approach to resolve these issues that may work. Follow the lead of every other beach in South Carolina and ban alcohol. Enforce the trash bylaw that requires cans be put out on the day of pickup and then removed. Encourage one real restaurant to open on Center Street. Not so long ago we had Cafe Suzanne's, the Sea Shell, Andre's, Delores', the Sandbar, and the Anchor Line, to name a few that were so good they were dining destinations.
\
Closing Center Street every few weeks so that folks can walk around showing off their bikinis and tattoos and drinking alcohol is not high on the list of what the residents I have spoken to want.
\
We have a mostly new administration so there is hope that positive change is on the way.

24,"Republican presidential candidates raced around the Upstate on Wednesday, as signs emerged that Newt Gingrich could be closing on frontrunner Mitt Romney three days before South Carolina's first-in-the-South presidential primary.\A CNN/Time/ORC International poll showed Romney leading with 33 percent of likely South Carolina primary voters, with Gingrich gaining ground at 23 percent.\Rick Santorum got 16 percent, followed by Ron Paul with 13 percent and Rick Perry with 6 percent. The poll covered a five-day window that included a debate in Myrtle Beach.\Meanwhile, in a cascading flood of robocalls, direct mail pieces and advertisements, Romney appeared to shift tactics, aiming a multiround blast at Gingrich after mostly focusing on Santorum in earlier days.\A major poll emerging today could reveal more shifting winds, while tonight's CNN debate offers a final large-scale face-off before voters go to the polls.\Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, campaigned at Wofford College in Spartanburg on Wednesday morning, telling an enthusiastic crowd of more than 300 that Gingrich taking credit for job creation while he was House speaker was like ""Al Gore taking credit for the Internet.""\Santorum talked to voters in Laurens, turning to the global warming issue to distinguish himself from Gingrich and Romney.\Perry strolled the streets of downtown Greer at midday Wednesday, mingling with storeowners and customers and sharing his ideas with several dozen supporters wearing campaign stickers.\In Easley, Gingrich hammered home a conservative's message and his intent for a new direction for the nation. He once again labeled Romney, the GOP front-runner, ""a Massachusetts moderate.""\""With your help, we will win the primary on Saturday,"" Gingrich said. ""That primary will establish that a conservative is the front-runner for the nomination and in Florida, and beyond, we will finish the job.""\Florida's presidential primary is Jan. 31.\Gingrich also took aim at President Obama, criticizing the Democrat's governance of domestic affairs, foreign policy and energy matters.\Gingrich touted his leadership success on welfare reform and balancing the federal budget. He plugged his support for supply-side economics, a plan of tax cuts and less regulation, favored by former President Ronald Reagan.\The atmosphere in Easley was festive, with a vendor selling Gingrich-for-president buttons.\Merle Rogers, an Anderson resident who joined the crowd at Mutt's BBQ, said he already has decided to vote for Gingrich.\""I feel like Newt has more experience in government, by far, than any of them,"" said Rogers. ""He's an extremely intelligent man, very smart. And we're going to need somebody smart to help us get out of some of these messes we're in.""\Paul, after campaigning in Spartanburg on Tuesday, returned to Washington to vote against another increase to the debt ceiling. He was back on the stump by Wednesday night, joining an anti-abortion forum in Greenville by video feed.\Perry, Gingrich and Santorum appeared in person at the forum, sponsored by Personhood USA, an anti-abortion group, and Champion the Vote, a Christian voter mobilization effort.\Answering questions from a three-person panel in a packed ballroom at the Greenville Hilton, the participating candidates all said they believe life begins at conception. They vowed to fight federal funding for abortion and challenge the courts on the issue.\""Liberty can't be protected if we don't protect life itself,"" said Paul, an obstetrician/gynecologist.\A spokeswoman for Romney said he wasn't able to attend the forum because of a scheduling conflict. Organizers of the forum said, with former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman out of the race, Romney is the only remaining candidate who didn't sign the Personhood USA pledge.\In Spartanburg, Romney aimed most of his criticism at President Obama, saying he has ""failed at almost every dimension,"" but he took a swipe at Gingrich in the process.\""I was disappointed over the last couple of weeks to see one of my opponents attacking free enterprise just like the president was. That's not the role of the Republican Party,"" he said.\Romney also criticized Gingrich for claiming to have created ""millions of jobs"" as a congressman. ""Government doesn't create jobs. It's the private sector that creates jobs,"" he said.\His 15-minute stump speech included an endorsement from South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis and a howdy from NASCAR legend and Spartanburg native David Pearson.\""We've got everybody from Barack Obama and MoveOn.org to Newt Gingrich attacking us because we believe in free enterprise,"" Loftis told the crowd gathered under a live oak tree outside Wofford's Andrews Field House.\""Mitt Romney has been a success in free enterprise, and we're going to take those skills to the White House.""\Romney's speech appealed to Heath Dobson of Greer. ""Very presidential,"" he said. ""I noticed he didn't use a teleprompter. He spoke from the heart.""\""He's doing it for the country and for his grandkids,"" the 64-year-old retired environmental engineer said. ""He's got 16 grandkids, and I'm worried about my eight grandkids if something doesn't happen in this country and get it straightened out.""\Not everyone is convinced.\""I just don't hear any of them telling me what's best for this country,"" said Ginger Davis, 50, of Spartanburg. ""I hear a lot of, well, we're trying to pick the best man to beat Obama. That doesn't do much for me.""\One of the early signs that the frontrunner was growing worried about Gingrich's popularity came in a Greenville robocall Tuesday night featuring an Arizona border sheriff ripping Gingrich on illegal immigration.\He followed with two new advertisements Wednesday calling Gingrich ""undisciplined"" and an ""unreliable leader.""\""I think the likelihood seems to be that Romney will win,"" said Clemson University alumni distinguished professor of political science William Lasser. ""My question is, there's still a lot of opposition to Romney.""\The anti-Romney factions may have a difficult time getting behind him as their favorites drop out of the race, Lasser said.\""They're either lukewarm on Romney or have real concerns about Romney,"" he said. ""So I think the trend has been anybody but Mitt.""\Santorum in Laurens\Gingrich was also taking fire from Santorum, who, while answering questions from voters at the Capitol Theatre in Laurens, made reference to a television commercial that Gingrich filmed with then-Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The commercial shows Gingrich and Pelosi sitting on a couch and calling for government action on climate change.\""The only person I sat on the couch with was my wife,"" Santorum said. ""I don't sit on the couch and advocate for the government to get involved in climate change.""\Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg pointed to comments by the former Massachusetts governor that he doesn't support cap-and-trade legislation and believes scientists don't know what's causing climate change. She also noted that Santorum endorsed Romney for president in 2008 as the ""clear conservative candidate.""\A spokesmen for Gingrich couldn't be reached immediately.\Santorum dismissed Gingrich's performance at a televised debate in Myrtle Beach Monday night that has drawn rave reviews from conservative radio talk show hosts.\""You know, debate performances where you throw out one liners are not going to win the presidency,"" Santorum told GreenvilleOnline.com. ""What you have to have is solid ideas and responsible policies, and we do and he doesn't.""\The former Pennsylvania senator urged about 100 who came to hear him to vote their conscience without worrying about who's the most electable.\Voters complain all the time that Washington politicians have compromised their values, Santorum said in closing remarks. ""Well, don't compromise. Stand up for your values.""\Santorum said that's what South Carolina Republicans did in 1980 when they set aside calls to back a moderate over ""this cowboy from California who's way too conservative.""\""And South Carolina voted for Reagan before Reagan was the Reagan we now remember.""\Perry in Greer\Perry showed no signs of giving up on his candidacy in the face of single-digit poll numbers in a state in which he once campaigned as a frontrunner.\Speaking to a group of supporters in the back dining room of the Southern Thymes Cafe, he largely ignored his Republican rivals except to say that he believed the GOP doesn't need a moderate conservative candidate to compete in the general election against President Obama.\""We need that bright contrast,"" Perry told the supporters. ""We don't need a lighter version of Obama.""\Perry discussed the economy and job creation and was particularly critical of reports Wednesday that the Obama administration had blocked permits for the Keystone XL Pipeline that will pump tar sands from Canada to refineries along the Gulf Coast.\Perry said the pipeline will create jobs and prevent Canada's oil from going to China. Opponents argue that the pipeline is harmful to the environment and that the oil will be shipped overseas.\Perry spent much of his two-hour visit homing in on the topic of the military and service to the country. Along with Perry on his campaign was Medal of Honor recipient Mike Thornton, a Spartanburg-area native now living in Texas who earned the prestigious honor as a U.S. Navy Seal saving the life of an officer in Vietnam.\ID_Code: BS-301190018"

Block watercraft
\
I would like to comment on a recent article in The Post and Courier concerning a business that wants to run a personal watercraft business out of the Ashley Marina and direct these craft up the Ashley River away from the harbor.
\
As a taxpaying resident on the Ashley River, who purchased property because of the tranquility and peacefulness of the river, continually loud personal-watercraft traffic would be a nuisance, as well as a disruption to the peaceful aquatic and wildlife community that thrives in this area.
\
Should we sacrifice one more wonderful and historic part of Charleston for ""Myrtle Beach creep""?
\
It's a sad day for the residents of Charleston and the Ashley River when some guys from Florida bring in these personal watercraft so that hundreds of customers a day can ""experience Charleston.""
\
That is not the way Charleston should be presented and it is an insult to our history and those working to preserve Charleston's heritage and the beautiful Lowcountry.

Doctor was 'giant'
\
Dr. Rawling Pratt-Thomas -- P.T. as he was known -- spoke with a strong positive voice, always on the subject, usually with the hint of a smile on his face and often with a twist of humor.
\
He had a certain effect on me so that in his presence, either as part of a group he was speaking to or alone, I felt proud to be a doctor and proud of my medical associations in Charleston.
\
I have a vivid memory I would like to share involving P.T. that occurred 50 years ago.
\
At that time, I was a new radiologist at Roper Hospital. The department was on the ground floor of a large old house next to Roper Hospital, with my office opening onto Calhoun Street. The MUSC pathology department was on the first floor of the MUSC complex. It, too, opened onto Calhoun Street.
\
One day, I responded to a knock on my door, and there was P.T., standing near the sidewalk in his autopsy gown holding a sealed box emitting the worst stench I have ever experienced. (There is nothing worse than the odor of rotting human flesh.)
\
He was in the midst of an autopsy, attempting to rule out a gunshot murder. He asked me to X-ray the box of body parts for a bullet and also asked me what I thought he should charge for the autopsy. I do not remember the figure I blurted out, but Blue Cross would not have paid for much of it.
\
Now, here was P.T., a senior pathologist and probably the head of the department at the time, doing the worst type of job you can imagine, but with a sense of humor and with the consideration and humility to remain outside on the sidewalk while I ruled out a bullet.
\
I had finished training at a university where the head of pathology was a Nobel Prize winner, but to me, Rawling Pratt-Thomas, M.D., was the giant.

Worth the wait
\
In mid-September 2007, my 39-year wait to meet Sen. John McCain came to an end at the Citadel field house in Charleston.
\
In June 1968, 1 was assigned to the 6485th Air Evacuation unit at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. On June 29, I was one of nine crew members selected for a secret mission.
\
We were to be the first American aircraft and crew to fly into Hanoi, North Vietnam, to pick up three released POWs and fly them to freedom.
\
Our crew included three flight nurses, two medical technicians, two flight stewards, a pilot, co-pilot, navigator and an engineer. I was the engineer. The aircraft was an Air Force C-118 (DC-6) transport aircraft.
\
We left Clark at approximately 7:30 a.m. on June 29, arriving at an air base in northern Thailand just after lunch time. After landing, the aircraft was positioned near the end of a runway at a remote part of the base. An Air Force colonel boarded and briefed the crew about our mission.
\
A Navy four-star admiral's son was to be released along with two other POWs as soon as possible. We were to refuel, and be ready to launch within two hours. We were ready as ordered and anxious to depart for Hanoi. No orders were received that afternoon. Later in the day, the same colonel returned. A problem had come up, and we would have to wait until the next day.
\
The following day, we were briefed again. The admiral's son refused to be released early. The crew all wondered why a POW would refuse early release. Being military we were aware of the Military Code of Conduct, which included accepting no favors from the enemy if captured. However, we all agreed that if we were a POW, we would gladly accept an early release. It made us proud knowing a Navy officer had the nerve and courage to refuse favors from the enemy in order to be released early.
\
One of our flight nurses summed up our feelings best, ""I don't know what this Navy lieutenant looks like, but with his guts and courage, I sure would like to have him as my husband.""
\
The moment we learned for sure a Navy lieutenant did in fact refuse early release, he became our hero.
\
This is important: It is not because Lt. McCain was a POW that makes him a hero. It is because of what he did as a POW that makes Lt. McCain a hero. He is a hero because he was the first and only POW who refused to come home early.
\
The next day, our crew was released from our secret mission and another crew replaced us, flew to Hanoi, picked up the three POWs, and returned them to freedom.
\
For 39 years, I waited to meet this great American hero. In September 2007, my wait was over. The short personal visit with Sen. McCain was worth the wait.

More sober fashion
\
Responding to the fifth anniversary of the Department of Homeland Security, a March 27 Post and Courier editorial titled ""Five years old and struggling"" acknowledges that there have been no 9/11-style terrorist attacks since it was established. By that measure the department has been a success.
\
The editorial ignores the department's successes and instead goes looking for ""continuing problems,"" from our handling of new technology to the development of an entry-exit system at our ports of entry. But no one expects ambitious new programs using new technologies to be problem-free.
\
It is a sign of success, not failure, that while the department is working the kinks out of programs that we must locate glitches and delay implementation until they're fixed. That is a normal part of any move from design to application.
\
We acted responsibly last year by briefly postponing implementation of certain virtual-fencing and requiring further testing for radiation-portal technology.
\
When it comes to an entry/
\
exit system, we've made real progress in detecting dangerous people through fingerprinting. We must build on that success without restricting the flow of commerce and trade. There is no overnight solution, but we are clearly on our way.
\
We take seriously our responsibility to protect America and its people. We trust that in the future your editorial page will take its own responsibility seriously to discuss our efforts in a more sober fashion.

IOP smoking ban
\
I would like to encourage the residents and businesses of the Isle of Palms to ask our elected city council to adopt the non-smoking ordinances now in force in Charleston, Mount Pleasant and Sullivan's Island.
\
As the premier beach destination in this area, we should work to promote a healthy and family-oriented environment. I know many residents who choose to dine and seek entertainment off the island because of the lack of an ordinance.
\
Some IOP restaurants do offer non-smoking, I applaud them and will patronize them when possible, but a uniform ordinance for the entire area would be a welcome change.

Sustainable power
\
On March 27, The Post and Courier reported that Santee Cooper announced that its proposed 600-megawatt Pee Dee coal-fired power plant will cost $1.25 billion, up from its
\
original estimate of $998 million.
\
This equates to $2.08 million per megawatt of electricity generated, an estimate that, the article stated, was low compared to other coal-fired plants. For example, Duke Power's 800-megawatt plant near Charlotte will cost $3 million per megawatt.
\
Neither projection includes the cost of carbon pollution, which will be added when Congress approves new climate-change legislation. All three presidential candidates have endorsed a ""cap and trade"" program that will substantially raise the price of coal-based electricity.
\
Interestingly, on the same day, USA Today published an article stating that Southern California Edison plans to spend $875 million to put 250-megawatts of solar energy on 100 buildings in the greater-Los Angeles area at a cost of $3.5 million per megawatt of electricity generated. This is only slightly higher than the full cost of electricity from coal.
\
The California solar energy system will cover 65-million square feet and supply enough power to serve about 162,000 homes.
\
South Carolina's climate makes it an excellent place to diversify our power production by adding a solar component. South Carolina is also one of the most promising locations in the United States for an offshore wind farm. The ""Cape Wind"" project, which calls for the installation of 130 wind turbines off the coast of Cape Cod, will generate 420 megawatts of power at a cost of around $1 billion or $2.4 million per megawatt of electricity generated. Offshore wind is not a pipe dream. Denmark currently generates 20 percent of its power from offshore wind.
\
Despite South Carolina's opportunity to generate power from solar and wind, our two state utilities, Santee Cooper and SCANA (SCE&G's parent company) continually dismiss these alternative energy sources as being prohibitively expensive, which is clearly not the case.
\
The costs of the new coal-fired plant will consistently increase over coming decades, while the cost of solar panels and wind turbines will surely decrease significantly as their use proliferates, competition increases and technological advances improve efficiency.
\
With respect to pollution, there is no contest between coal and renewables. Solar and wind do not spew millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and do not pollute rivers and fish with mercury and the air with ozone, sulfur compounds and other contaminants.
\
South Carolina utilities should stop obstructing this needed transition to an energy future that is free of the costs and pollution of fossil fuels. South Carolina has the chance to lead the nation along a new and better path toward sustainability. We owe it to our children and grandchildren.

Whom to blame?
\
Americans have their heads buried in the sand. Someone once said this makes your butt a bigger target.
\
There are enemies who want to take over the world, but America is in their way. These enemies are radical Muslims, who cannot be reasoned with. They will do anything to reach their goal of world domination. They include Osama bin-Laden, who has sworn to kill four million Americans with a single blow.
\
Please, read the book ""Because They Hate,"" and just maybe, you will see our true enemies.
\
As the great Roman and Greek empires fell from within, we may follow their self-
\
destruction if we do not wake up. We have politicians and news media more interested in tearing down America than protecting it. Politicians will either have our military run from our enemies or do nothing when they attack us.
\
When we run, as we did in Beirut in 1983 during the Reagan presidency after the bombing of the Marine barracks, or do nothing as we did when attacked during the Clinton years, we strengthen our enemies' resolve.
\
After the bomb goes off, whom will we blame?
\
Will it be Congress, which is more interested in steriods use by athletes than protecting our borders; the ACLU, which fights for constitutional rights of terrorists; The New York Times, which is quick to reveal our secrets on fighting terrorists; or our local media, which is more interested in Hollywood than reporting what is going on in the radical Muslim world?

"
26,"
In a small room at a state government lab in Columbia, chemists talk with pride about their state-of-the-art equipment to measure mercury in human blood.
\
Pointing at a box the size of a microwave, they say they've had this $250,000 blood scanner for three years thanks to a federal anti- terrorism program.
\
They say the scanner is so advanced it can break blood samples down to the atomic level, just what the state needs to measure mercury levels in people.
\
So how many tests for the public has the state Department of Health and Environmental Control run through its expensive scanner?
\
One.
\
South Carolina has a serious mercury problem. More than 1,747 miles of river have fish with high levels of mercury. Some fish are so tainted that if they were sold in stores, the Food and Drug Administration could order a national recall.
\
Not only does mercury build up in fish tissue, it accumulates in the bodies of people who eat these fish, silently destroying cells and causing a host of problems including birth defects and heart problems. When The Post and Courier recently tested 41 people who eat freshwater fish from mercury hot spots, it found that 17 had mercury levels higher than a federal safety benchmark.
\
But the rarely used blood scanner in DHEC's lab is just one example of the state's anemic efforts to understand mercury's impact on South Carolinians,
\
especially those who depend on fish to supplement their diets. The state also hasn't studied whether mercury levels are rising or falling, or the economic impact of having contaminated fish in nearly every major coastal river and lake, interviews with health officials reveal. And critics question the state's moves to reduce mercury pollution in the first place.
\
Earlier this year, DHEC could have forced power plants to take more aggressive steps to cut mercury emissions. Instead, the agency launched a new ""cap-and-trade"" program that allows power companies to make millions of dollars by selling mercury pollution ""credits,"" or use the credits themselves to delay installing cleanup equipment. Utilities say the program gives them more flexibility; conservation groups call the program a government giveaway.
\
State regulators say that tight budgets and other constraints make studies difficult to do, and that they walk a tough regulatory tightrope balancing the health needs of the public with the needs of industries and people they serve.
\
But considering mercury's toxicity and potential to harm the public, the state should be doing much more, said Chester Sansbury, retired assistant chief of DHEC's Bureau of Water.
\
""They can take a more aggressive stance,"" he said. ""The industries will fight them because they want to save money. But industries ought to do more, and DHEC can require them to do more.""
\
Fish get tested
\
Though DHEC has done little to examine mercury's effects on people, agency employees work hard to measure levels in fish.
\
Every year, two DHEC biologists, Chad Altman and Will Dillman, travel with their aluminum boat to fishing spots across the state, stunning fish with special electrodes and bringing their catch back to a squat, concrete-block aquatic biology lab next to DHEC's headquarters in Columbia.
\
There, they fillet the fish and put them in blenders, sometimes running seven blenders at a time. Next they freeze the samples with dry ice and send them to DHEC's chemistry lab several miles away to measure how much mercury is in the fish. Based on these results, DHEC issues advisories warning people not to eat certain species on various rivers, or to eat only so many fish per week or month.
\
Butch Younginer helped start the program in the early 1970s. He retired last year but came back to work part time. ""The three of us standing here, along with some outreach support, make up the entire mercury advisory program,"" he said. Together, they do about 1,800 tests a year, each test costing about $101 in manpower and materials. They also distribute roughly 50,000 fish advisory booklets across the state.
\
The program almost went belly-up in the 1980s because of budget cutbacks, Younginer said. Then North Carolina scientists found high levels of mercury in fish in the Waccamaw River, which snakes through both states. Those findings pressured South Carolina officials into resurrecting the fish-testing program, he said.
\
This happened at a pivotal time. For reasons that scientists still don't understand, mercury levels began to rise in South Carolina and other parts of the country. ""We weren't seeing mercury, then suddenly after 1990-91, we started seeing mercury everywhere on the coastal plain,"" Younginer said.
\
Since then, Younginer's team has collected an enormous amount of data on mercury pollution and fish. But because of limited time and resources, the agency hasn't taken an in-depth look at whether mercury levels are rising or falling and at which locations, or at whether local industries might be creating mercury hot spots.
\
Younginer said he has ""a gut feeling"" that mercury levels have leveled off during the past few years after rising sharply in the 1990s. He said he would like to do more analysis of his team's data, as well as measure other toxins. But even today, his mercury advisory program doesn't have a solid spot in the agency's budget. ""We beg, borrow and steal to find the money to do what we can,"" he said, ""and I personally think that we have done an excellent job.""
\
What about people?
\
Younginer's unit sends the fish samples in small vials to a special room on the third floor of DHEC's chemistry lab in northwest Columbia. There, chemists measure amounts of mercury in parts per million, while taking precautions to make sure they aren't contaminated by the poison.
\
""But the real story about mercury is on the clinical side,"" said Beth Baird, a DHEC
\
chemist who works on the first floor in another lab that tests human blood for mercury, lead and other toxic metals.
\
The agency received its $250,000
\
blood scanner in 2004 as part of a federal
\
counterterrorism program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
\
""It's top-of-the-line,"" Baird said of the new machine. Jim Sexton, another chemist, nodded and said the scanner could be a tremendous tool to monitor mercury levels in residents' blood. Right now, Baird and Sexton said, if someone wants his or her blood tested, a physician has to request it. They said running a test costs less than $20.
\
So far, the only test they've done on a member of the public was for a doctor on Hilton Head Island who ate a lot of sushi and wanted to know if he had high
\
mercury levels in his blood. They also tested each other out of curiosity.
\
Though DHEC has barely used this expensive scanner to test for mercury in human blood, it recently acquired a second scanner. During a recent visit, the machine sat in the hallway, waiting to be set up.
\
Why has DHEC done so few tests for the public?
\
The main purpose of the equipment is to help South Carolina prepare for chemical terrorism attacks, said John Reddic of DHEC's Bureau of Laboratories. He said the state is ""moving from limitations for use only from chemical terrorism to full use,"" including tests for the general population. He said the agency is reviewing an official process for doctors interested in submitting samples. He added, ""By law, DHEC cannot compete with private, non- governmental labs but can respond upon request of a physician or to any perceived threat to the health of the population or environment.""
\
""That's flabbergasting,"" said Blan
\
Holman, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center. ""If they've got the equipment to test people and made a decision not to use it in any meaningful way, it's borderline scandalous.""
\
A growing list of states and cities have begun testing people for mercury in recent years. In 2005, researchers in Wisconsin measured mercury in more than 2,000 people to better understand exposure levels and fish consumption patterns. Florida, Louisiana and New York City also have done extensive tests. Among other things, these studies found that frequent fish-eaters had the highest levels of mercury in their bodies.
\
Can the problem be reversed?
\
Sansbury, the retired DHEC water official, said he had a difficult time persuading his peers and state lawmakers to take a greater interest in mercury.
\
If he could create a wish list, he would have the state study mercury's effects on people and wildlife, as well as whether mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants and industries are landing nearby and creating mercury hot spots.
\
""Other than fish advisory notices, mercury contamination wasn't getting much attention at all,"" said Sansbury, who is now state coordinator for Republicans for Environmental Protection.
\
That's too bad, he said, because scientists recently found that reducing
\
mercury pollution can have relatively dramatic effects.
\
In south Florida, for instance, tighter regulations on medical and municipal waste incinerators, a major source of mercury emissions, reduced mercury pollution by 93 percent in the 1990s. In that same period, Florida researchers found that mercury levels in largemouth bass decreased by as much as 75 percent.
\
A more recent study by Canadian and American scientists concluded that if mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants and other industries were reduced, mercury levels in fish would drop within a decade and fewer people's health would be at risk.
\
***
\
Back on the first floor of DHEC's lab, the agency's chemists are excited about the possibility of testing people for mercury someday.
\
""Oh man, I would love it if doctors start calling us,"" said Baird, one of the chemists. She said she would especially like to see the tests used on children and pregnant women. ""We've done the environmental side on mercury and fish. Let's start working on people. That's the real story.""

MERCURY TESTS
\
The Post and Courier sought people who eat fish from two mercury hot spots in South Carolina and tested their hair for mercury. Here are their stories.
\
Thomas Faulkner, 5.4 ppm
\
The fading sign on the old wooden porch says, ""Here lives one great fisherman, and his best catch ever."" Spend a few minutes on the porch planks with Thomas Faulkner and you get the feeling that he's told a few fish stories. He points to his gag gift - a miniature paddle with a hole in the paddle part. Next to it is his ""brim buster"" contraption and a container with ""Edisto Cricket Box"" written on the bottom.
\
Faulkner brags that he eats more fish from the Edisto and its swamps than most anyone. ""We caught 220 pounds of catfish the last time we went out,"" he says. He caught a 67-pounder on his 80th birthday last year. Then he says, ""There's nothing better than proof,"" and fishes out a photo of himself standing next to a catfish the size of a small hog.
\
Rodney Creel, 0.5 ppm
\
Rodney Creel, 20, lives on a bluff above the Edisto River. Like his family members, his skin is tea-colored, the color of the river itself. ""I'm Indian,"" he says. Edisto Indian. He and his family have lived on the river's fish forever. ""I eat as much as I can.""
\
Edisto Indians aren't officially recognized by the federal government, and he jokes that this is too bad because then they could get ""some of that casino money."" He doesn't worry too much about mercury in fish, he said, but then again, you never know. His test comes in just a tad higher than the typical level for someone who eats a lot of fish, but lower than the EPA's safety benchmark.
\
Wilbur Fipps, 8.49 ppm
\
Wilbur Fipps survived the World War II battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He's 81 now and still works hard with his hands. He does decorative masonry. It's outdoor work, creative, and it keeps him active.
\
He's lean, with a handshake as hard as the brick he lays. He's proud that he's held on to his strength and ability.
\
In his spare time, he likes to fish. The rivers of South Carolina's Pee Dee region just across the border from his Tabor City, N.C., home are among his favorite fishing spots. He takes joy in the nature, the solitude and the fish he loves to catch and eat. He's done it his entire life.
\
He never really thought about the toxic mercury waste falling on the area's farms, forests and waterways from the smokestacks of coal- burning plants. He paid little attention to the warnings he'd heard about limiting fish consumption.
\
Now, he knows the fish have poisoned him. A recent test of his hair revealed highly elevated levels of mercury in his body, the highest in the tests the newspaper conducted.
\
He's not aware of any symptoms of the neurotoxin - memory loss, shakiness, heart problems. After all, he's 81. How can he tell? ""I'm doing well, I think.""
\
But he's not eating the fish now.
\
""I don't deliberately do anything to ruin my health.""
\
WHAT OUR TESTS SHOWED
\
The Post and Courier collected hair from 41 people who eat fish from two mercury hot spots and sent samples to a certified lab. Results showed:
\
24 had higher than normal mercury levels
\
for frequent fish eaters.
\
17 of these had mercury levels higher than the federal safety benchmark.
\
6 would rank among the highest 1 percent in a national study.
\
17 had normal or low levels of mercury,
\
including three who ate few fish.
\
SAFE TO EAT OR NOT?
\
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
\
says fish should not have mercury levels more than 1 part per million. Here's a list of seafood and typical levels of mercury. The closer to 1 part per million, the
\
more dangerous the fish.

To Wofford College professor Cissy Fowler, a Republican like U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis speaking out about global warming is a bold move, one that offered an ""incredible"" opportunity for students in Wofford's first-year environmental studies program.
\
Speaking live to South Carolina college students Wednesday from Washington as part of a ""Campus-to-Congress Video Dialogue,"" Inglis, R-S.C., incorporated what he said are traditional conservative views on free enterprise and accountability into a proposed plan of action to combat carbon emissions.
\
The event was part of the 2009 National Teach-In on Global Warming, which is focused on the recommendations from The Presidential Climate Action Project. The PCAP convened in 2007 to produce a 100-day action plan for the incoming president and Congress, highlighted by reducing carbon emissions by 40 percent by the year 2020.
\
The University of South Carolina Upstate also participated in the dialogue, as well as Furman, Lander and Clemson universities.
\
Inglis' proposal, outlined in a recent op-ed piece in the New York Times that he co-authored, calls for the elimination of a payroll tax (FICA), which amounts to 12.4 percent on the first $102,000 of an individual's gross income. Under the plan, Inglis said, the government would then implement a substantial carbon tax, which would raise the price of utilities such as natural gas and electricity.
\
""That's not something that's going to go over too well with people,"" Inglis told the students, ""but, if you have money in your pocket with the elimination of the payroll tax, now you've got a way to pay it.
\
""So you're freeing up taxation on something you want more of, income, and (imposing) a tax on something you want less of, carbon.""
\
Inglis said a carbon tax would level the playing field and enable alternative-technologies such as nuclear, wind and solar to compete, with fair competition making them economically viable.
\
The Wofford students watched Inglis' video as part of a ""linked learning community"" of students in environmental humanities and environmental social science - the first two classes in Wofford's environmental studies major that began this semester.
\
Fowler, who teaches the Monday-Wednesday combined class with professor John Lane, said U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Jim DeMint, R-S.C., also were invited to participate in the dialogue, but only Inglis accepted.
\
When Wofford student Randolph Smith asked Inglis how he intends to push aside bipartisan politics for the welfare of the environment, Inglis said the key was ""collaboration"" instead of ""compromise.""

29,"STAFF WRITER\Although it's not nearly as dramatic as what he saw in Greenland last summer, there is ample evidence that the Earth is getting warmer at its coldest spot, in Antarctica, U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis told Greenville County high school students in a phone call from the southern hemisphere Friday.\""Some detractors say the science isn't settled,"" the Greenville Republican said from Christ Church, New Zealand, a day after leaving the icy continent. ""There have been ups and downs (in temperature), but it's on this trend line that has gone dramatically up.""\A former skeptic of global warming, Inglis told students at Greenville and Riverside high schools that he was convinced by studies done on the mile-thick ice layers in Antarctica that leave a record of the planet's climate going back thousands of years.\""What you see is a fairly constant fluctuation (in carbon-dioxide levels) and then you get to the Industrial Revolution and it starts climbing,"" he said in response to a question asked by Carrie McCleneghan, a student in Fanya Paouris' marine science class at Greenville High. ""And it climbs substantially.""\Inglis was part of a delegation from the House Science and Technology Committee on the trip to check progress on National Science Foundation projects in the U.S. Antarctic Program.\The group also inspected a new South Pole Station just two weeks before its grand opening, as well as a new $19.2 million South Pole Telescope that is being used to study ""dark"" energy, forces that may help explain gravitational effects.\He had originally planned to call from the McMurdo Research Station in Antarctica a day earlier but decided to hold off until Friday because there wasn't sufficient Internet bandwidth to run the slide show of photos he took on the trip from there.\It was Inglis' second trip to the bottom of the world. This time, he joined his son Robert, who is spending five months there working for a contractor.\As in his first trip two years ago, Inglis made it all the way to the South Pole itself -- and sent photos of him and his son standing next to it as proof.\""We walked around the world really quickly,"" he said of the few steps it took to circle the Earth's southernmost point.\Inglis also fielded questions on government spending on the environment and national energy policy, saying he supports a carbon tax as a way to control pollutants that contribute to global warming."

Pope Francis has provided a remarkable encyclical on ""care for our common home,"" the Earth.
\
He called climate change a ""global problem with grave implications"" and described our response to date as woefully inadequate. He called for aggressive efforts to reduce reliance on greenhouse-emitting fossil fuels and to promote cleaner and renewable sources of energy.
\
The pope also offered a broad overview of how human actions are affecting the planet, and particularly the lives of the poorest among us, who are likely to suffer the most from a changing climate and environmental deterioration.
\
This comes before a major international meeting in Paris in December when the world's leaders are to draft the next international climate change treaty.
\
The unique contribution that Pope Francis made to this debate was to add a strong moral dimension to the prevailing scientific and economic discussions of climate change and the environment.
\
The pope was right to call for a more ethical, sustainable development that can meet our economic needs while also protecting the environment. He was wrong, however, to fault reliance on economic incentives as a way to deal with climate change.
\
Most climate experts favor either a tax on carbon emissions or reliance on a market system for trading carbon permits, with a cap that declines over time. Both mechanisms seek to put a substantial price on carbon emissions as an effective way to change individual and corporate behavior in a market economy.
\
Pope Francis argues that markets often fail to bring out the best in us, and he is right about that. Yet moral injunctions alone cannot move societies toward a low-carbon future.
\
Markets might just do that. The higher price of carbon-based fuels should discourage their use, promote the search for alternatives, and stimulate energy efficiency and conservation. Such policies rely on market mechanisms that conservatives applaud, which makes bipartisan cooperation possible.
\
Moreover, the Citizens Climate Lobby and others promote a revenue-neutral carbon tax with no net increase in taxes. Such a policy can be used in conjunction with actions such as setting national renewable energy goals, offering financial incentives for switching to non-carbon energy technologies, and establishing new regulatory standards.
\
As is the case with most public problems, we can agree on the need to do something without necessarily agreeing on which policy alternatives are likely to work best or be cheapest. However, it is imperative to recognize the seriousness of the problem.
\
In the U.S., the Obama administration is committed to adoption of a strong international treaty at the Paris meeting. Consistent with these goals, it has raised fuel efficiency standards, supported renewable fuels and moved ahead with the EPA's Clean Power Plan. That plan will lower carbon emissions from existing coal-fired power plants and promote alternative fuels.
\
Some states, most notably California, are setting ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions. California is aiming for 50 percent reliance on renewable energy by 2030. Unfortunately, many other states are doing little to change directions.
\
Recent surveys show that an overwhelming majority of the American public now supports action on climate change. They agree with Pope Francis. These polls indicate that political leaders can indeed garner public backing for tackling climate change.

BOSTON (AP) -- A conservative congressman from South Carolina whose change of heart on climate change drew the wrath of fellow Republicans and helped cost him re-election has been named the 2015 recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.
\
Bob Inglis will receive the award from President Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, during a May 3 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.
\
The award is presented annually to public servants who have made courageous decisions of conscience without regard for the personal or professional consequences. It is named for Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ""Profiles in Courage,"" which recounts the stories of eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled stands for unpopular positions.
\
""This is tremendously meaningful because I read 'Profiles in Courage' ... and remember forming the conclusion that that's how I want to be,"" Inglis said Monday.
\
Inglis, who served in Congress from 1993 to 1998 and from 2005 to 2010, was a member of the House Science Committee and ranking member of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee. He initially opposed efforts to address climate change.
\
But after interactions with scientists and discussions with his five children, Inglis called on the U.S. to confront the issue and began advocating for a carbon tax to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels.
\
""In reversing his own position and breaking with his party to acknowledge the realities of a changing climate and its threat to human progress, he displayed the courage to keep an open mind and uphold his responsibilities as a leader and citizen at the expense of his own political career,"" Schlossberg said in a statement.
\
The change of heart was gradual, Inglis said.
\
He remembers a conversation with his son, then 18.
\
""When my son was voting for the first time in 2004, he said, 'Dad, I'll vote for you, but you have to clean up your act on the environment,'"" Inglis said.
\
Inglis went to Antarctica and saw the evidence of climate change in ice core drilling samples. He met a climate scientist in Australia who integrated his love of the Great Barrier Reef with his faith in God.
\
There were several factors that led to his political defeat in 2010, but there is no doubt that rejecting the conservative position on climate change was pivotal.
\
""The most enduring heresy that really stuck in the craw of conservatives was just saying climate change was real, let's do something about it,"" he said.
\
Inglis is now executive director of the Energy & Enterprise Initiative at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, which encourages conservatives to accept the reality of climate change and to promote free enterprise innovations.
\
And just as President Kennedy inspired all Americans to come together and win the Space Race, Inglis said, he wants to inspire Americans of all political stripes to employ their ingenuity and spirit to tackle climate change.
\
""I hope this is a moment for conservatives to be inspired,"" he said.
\
Previous winners include Presidents George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford and U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

The notion is almost surreal -- rows on rows of mammoth propellers, each blade taller than a football field is long, whirling offshore just above the horizon.
\
The chances of seeing a wind farm in the ocean off South Carolina might be just that fantastic, even though it's getting a good hard look.
\
The cost of fitting the sea with wind turbines is too much to be worthwhile in the Southeast, where only winter winds approach the sustained strength needed to make a profit. The prospect of an intense hurricane devastating that investment is too real. Environmentalists worry about the impact of even this relatively benign power source on species like migrating birds along the busy Eastern flyway.
\
Other ""green power"" or renewable energy sources are a safer bet if a federal or state ""carbon tax,"" ""carbon credits"" or similar laws are passed.
\
A carbon tax is a charge for using carbon dioxide-emitting fuels - -
\
making energy such as gasoline, oil or coal more expensive and putting the revenue, ideally, into developing alternative energy sources like solar or fuel cells. Carbon credits are essentially
\
free passes to use a certain amount of carbon fuels, earned by conserving energy, developing or using other fuels or through donations.
\
There's new emphasis worldwide on using wind power because of new technology, an ever-escalating demand for power and international agreements on developing renewable energy. In the United States, the interest has been goaded by the prospect of the widely expected tax.
\
A handful of projects on land are in operation or under construction around the United States. The controversial Cape Wind project off Massachusetts is laboring its way through building the first offshore project in the United States, a $900 million expanse of 130 wind turbines along 25 square miles off Cape Cod.
\
Yet SCANA Corp. and Santee Cooper utilities are among those who came away from this year's Southeast Regional Offshore Wind Power Symposium with no plans to do any more than look on as other companies and countries take the lead producing electricity from the offshore breeze.
\
""It's on our radar screen. Right now, it doesn't make sense for us or, probably, our state,"" SCANA spokesman Robin Montgomery said.
\
""It's another one of those options we're looking at,"" said Laura Varn of Santee Cooper. But the cost and reliability are big questions. In the end, Santee Cooper will look at ""what's the best decision for our customers, for the environment and for our energy.""
\
Nicholas Rigas, director of the South Carolina Institute for Energy Studies, which helped put on the symposium, was disappointed, but said he thinks wind power has a future here, particularly if a carbon tax or government subsidy makes it more cost competitive. The state could also become a manufacturer of wind farm products, he said.
\
""I'm not giving up on this thing. I think it's a viable resource for South Carolina,"" Rigas said, adding, ""I think the utility companies are going to drag their feet on this, just like they are on net metering here in the South. I think it's going to take a grassroots effort.""
\
Net metering is a fledgling program in some states that allows people or businesses who generate their own electricity, for example through solar power, to feed that back into the power grid.
\
Bill Bulpitt, research engineer for Georgia Tech's Strategic Energy Institute, took part in a feasibility study of wind power off the Georgia coast that also hit the economics wall.
\
""It's feasible, for sure. It's just, how much do you want to spend? The quandary utilities in the Southeast are in is people want low rates and won't pay more for renewable energy. I believe in renewables, but in some cases there have to be draconian measures taken"" before they will be used, he said.

BOSTON (AP) -- Former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on Sunday for reversing his position on climate change despite the predictable political fallout that helped cost the South Carolina Republican his seat in Congress.
\
Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, presented the award to Inglis on Sunday at the JFK Library in Boston.
\
""My grandfather's legacy is kept alive by Bob's courageous decision to sacrifice his political career to demand action on the issue that will shape life on Earth for generations to come,"" said Schlossberg, son of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg.
\
Inglis, a member of the House Science Committee and ranking member of its Energy and Environment Subcommittee, had opposed legislation on climate change, but said he changed his mind after briefings from scientists and encouragement from his five children.
\
He advocated for a carbon tax to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and was defeated in the 2010 primary for re-election to the 4th Congressional District seat he had held twice, from 1993-1998 and 2005-2010.
\
""When is America going to rise to the challenge on climate? Well, I think it's soon. I think it's before the decade is out,"" Inglis said in remarks for the ceremony, an allusion to JFK's 1960s call to send astronauts to the moon.
\
""I think we're going to come together and get this done because I believe that a pricing of carbon dioxide will be like someone said of the financial crisis, 'It's amazing how the impossible went to the inevitable without ever passing through the probable,'"" Inglis said.
\
The annual award to public servants is named for Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book about U.S. senators who took unpopular stands for principle. A bipartisan committee selects the recipients, who recently have included former President George H.W. Bush and former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona.

As we enter a new year, one would hope that the Obama administration made a new year's resolution of allowing Congress to do its job and not allowing unelected bureaucrats to regulate through administrative fiat. However, it seems this year will be full of even more federal overreach and this administration making up the rules as it goes.
\
Over the past few years, we have seen the Environmental Protection Agency repeatedly take unprecedented action by forcing reckless, unlawful and job-killing rules on consumers, families and businesses. Sadly, what it claims is an effort to better our environment is simply an overzealous plan that will severely hurt our economy by cutting jobs and driving up utility rates.
\
The EPA at this point should stand for the Eliminate Prosperity Agency because that's exactly what it's doing.
\
As a nation, we should be encouraging businesses to thrive rather than force them to shut down due to outrageous compliance costs. Driving up utility costs will only hurt our families. Electricity shouldn't become an expensive luxury, not in a country as plentiful as ours.
\
EPA regulations such as the Waters of the US (WOTUS) rule, Section 111(d) Rule, Section 111(b) Rule and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards contain illegal and unfounded regulations that will bankrupt our economy.
\
In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with a number of states, including South Carolina, by rejecting the proposed rules that regulate how power plants cut mercury emissions and other air pollutants. The court said the EPA must reconsider the rules because it didn't take into account industry costs before deciding to adopt them.
\
This was a major win in the lengthy battle against this administration as it continues to show zero regard for the wallets of families across the country.
\
The WOTUS rule specifically is extremely frightening. It would greatly expand the scope and boundless definition of ""Waters of the U.S."" In fact, we could really consider it LOTUS, ""Lands of the U.S."", as this would be a land grab.
\
It would result in small roadside ditches on private property falling under these burdensome federal regulations. Even further, this expansion would bring many small ponds on family farms, water features on golf courses and stormwater systems under scrutiny. It's not rocket science; drainage ditches aren't navigable waters.
\
This is why I have joined with attorneys general from across the nation on multiple occasions to fight back against the federal government's ridiculous overreach. Luckily, we've seen victories along the way, such as the nationwide stay granted against the implementation of the WOTUS rule.
\
The EPA may think it can circumvent the law; however, attorneys general stand ready to act when necessary to protect the integrity of our nation and defend the rule of law.
\
The best of intentions can also carry unintended consequences. I agree that the environment must be properly protected through sound regulation and laws passed through constitutional processes. Still, these regulations or laws must balance between practical steps to keep it clean, allowing businesses to operate and expand while also protecting consumers.
\
We have seen this administration force countless rules through executive fiat that are unconstitutional and unlawful. The cause for this is simply that the president knows ideas, such as a carbon tax, are terrible ideas. This is why he has waited until the end of his administration to introduce them.
\
Even a ""moderate"" carbon tax of roughly $25 per ton would reduce the income of a family of four by $1,900 per year and cause gasoline prices to rise about 50 cents per gallon. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that because lower-income Americans pay a greater percentage of their income toward energy costs, the impact on them would be even greater -- equivalent to a new 10 percent income tax.
\
At the end of his presidency, with nothing left to lose politically, Barack Obama is throwing the Constitution out the window and implementing rules and regulations that would have devastating effects on our economy.
\
This is yet again an example of the Obama administration's disregard for the rule of law and the well-being of the American people.
\
Along with my fellow attorneys general, I'm committed to fighting these actions every step of the way in order to prevent unconstitutional overreaches by unelected bureaucrats from disrupting our way of life and family budgets.

The state's chief environmental board should agree today to hold its own hearing on a coal-burning power plant, given the controversy surrounding the Santee-Cooper project. The air-quality permit issued by the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control has been challenged by a number of environmental groups in the state.
\
DHEC staff issued the permit despite objections raised by the state Department of Natural Resources. DNR cited the potential hazards to the environment from the power plant and urged permits to be withheld until completion of a broad environmental analysis.
\
The air-quality permit is the first in a series that Santee Cooper, a quasi-state agency, will be required to obtain before construction can begin on the $1.2 billion power plant planned for Florence County. Santee Cooper says the plant is needed to supply future energy needs largely related to growth on the Grand Strand.
\
Environmental groups, including the Coastal Conservation League, the S.C. Wildlife Federation and the Sierra Club, object to the mercury levels that the plant will produce. They also cite the likelihood of new federal restrictions on coal-burning plants, because of emissions that may contribute to global warming. The state's League of Women Voters also has appealed the permit.
\
DHEC staff contends that the plant would meet all current air-quality requirements and notes that the permit includes provisions that will allow the agency to impose further conditions as warranted by future limits on power-plant emissions.
\
Environmentalists have raised substantive questions about the proposal, including the potential expense of a carbon tax that many believe will be approved under the Obama administration. But the essential question is whether the Santee-Cooper plant will pose a hazard to South Carolina's health and environment.
\
The issues raised during the public debate over the coal-burning plant should be of keen interest to the state's primary environmental policy makers. The DHEC board should welcome the opportunity to hear the appeal by the state's conservation community.

A cadre of environmental watchdogs and lobbying groups urged Santee Cooper and government regulators Thursday to scrap plans for a proposed $1 billion plant in Florence County, saying the utility should follow the lead of other power producers that are pulling the plug on coal-fired generators.
\
In response, state-owned Santee Cooper said coal is its only fuel option for the time being and that opponents of the project do not fully appreciate what is driving the need for more electricity.
\
The organized opposition includes the Coastal Conservation League, the Sierra Club, the South Carolina Wildlife Federation and the Southern Environmental Law Center. They said South Carolina can conserve enough power and derive enough ""green"" electricity to offset the need for the Pee Dee plant, referring to a study released last month by the state's 20 electricity cooperatives.
\
""The fastest, cheapest, cleanest power is not coal. It's something else: It's efficiency and conservation,"" said Blan Holman, senior attorney with the Charlottesville, Va.-based Southern Environmental Law Center. ""A lot of things point now to this being a really out-of-date idea.""
\
Also, the groups noted that in the years since Santee Cooper decided to build the coal plant, lawmakers have gotten closer to passing a tax on carbon emissions. That would require the utility to pay a mandated fee based on how much carbon dioxide the new generator emits.
\
Santee Cooper provides power to about 40 percent of the state. It has said it desperately needs more generating capacity to meet growing customer demand and that a coal-fired plant is the ""only viable option"" until it can fire up a new nuclear reactor in 2016.
\
The utility considered emissions, alternative fuels and a potential carbon tax in reaching that decision, said spokeswoman Laura Varn.
\
""These organizations are really ignoring the facts,"" Varn said. ""If the facts aren't heeded, we could really end up with brown-outs and outages.""
\
The utility also said it has beefed up its conservation efforts and spending on research to cut pollution.
\
Government regulators and utilities nationwide have been scrapping plans for coal plants, citing concerns about emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and mercury, a neurotoxin.
\
Earlier this month, Rod Bremby, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, overturned the recommendations of his staff in denying a long-awaited permit request for a new coal plant.
\
In May, Raleigh-based Progress Energy, which serves parts of the Pee Dee region, pledged not to propose any new coal-burning plants for the next two years. And in June, Charlotte-based Duke Energy Corp., which serves part of the Upstate, snuffed plans for one of two coal-burning plants it had proposed for Western North Carolina.
\
In a study released this month, South Carolina's electric cooperatives said residents can reduce their energy use by one- third in the next decade and produce ""green"" power equal to the output of a medium-sized coal-burning plant, enough to power 30,000 homes.
\
South Carolina ranked fifth overall in increased U.S. carbon dioxide emissions between 1990 and 2003, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The proposed Pee Dee plant would boost the output by about 10 percent.
\
The state Department of Health and Environmental Control granted Santee Cooper preliminary approval for the generator last month. Federal agencies also must sign off on the plant after studying its environmental impact.
\
At least two of the groups that were protesting the project in Columbia on Thursday have threatened to sue Santee Cooper and the state over the plans.

38,"Presidential candidate John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman, visited Clemson University on Wednesday evening to share his campaign platform and encourage students to get involved in the 2020 election.\The event was hosted by the Clemson Undergraduate Student Government, which hopes to bring additional candidates to campus in the coming months, representative Zach Pate said.\""With so many candidates to vote for, just this room alone can influence the election,"" Pate said in reference to the South Carolina primary. ""The vote margins are so slim that a few hundred people can decide who wins this state and eventually who becomes the Democratic nominee.""\In July 2017, Delaney became the first Democrat to announce his candidacy in what has since become a crowded field.\Here are a few key takeaways from his speech.\Delaney said he is ""not foolish enough to think we agree with each other on everything,"" but that the central issue of his campaign is turning a divided nation toward a common sense of purpose.\To achieve that goal, he said he wants to create an optional, year-long national service program for students after they graduate from high school. Students could choose between community service work, military service or working on infrastructure projects.\Despite emphasizing the need for bipartisan legislation, Delaney said he would not compromise on issues such as women's reproductive freedom and LGBTQ rights.\Delaney said he wants to see the government, private sector and non-profit sector develop a national strategy around addressing artificial intelligence and how it will reshape the workforce.\He also shared concerns about human biases translating into programming biases in new technology.\""I worry that those things will get programmed and hard-coded into these machines and then we'll never change them,"" he said.\Delaney said issues around technology are what will shape the future.\""What you and I just talked about here for five minutes, to say it is 10 million times more important than what Michael Cohen testified about today is an understatement,"" Delaney said.\Although he is not opposed to the Green New Deal being proposed by Democrats, he does not believe universal healthcare should be wrapped into the same package.\Delaney said he wants to see a carbon tax bill and investments in clean energy research and weather resilient infrastructure. He said that the country has a history of innovating its way out of problems and that ""moonshot-style"" innovation would be necessary for the environment.\""We are also leaving you and our kids debts you can't repay,"" Delaney said of climate change and the U.S. economy.\Drawing on a question from one of the 2016 presidential debates, a student asked Delaney whether he could compliment President Donald Trump's administration on something. Delaney pointed to North Korea.\""Do I think it was a bad idea to engage?,"" Delaney said. ""Some people in my party say, 'Well, you shouldn't be meeting with him.' That's ridiculous.""\Delaney said he worries Trump will cut ""a terrible deal,"" but he said it is in the interest of humanity to try and solve the problems there.\Delaney said he was recently asked how it felt to be a white man running in a Democratic primary, ""where it feels like the party is looking for something maybe different.""\He said that if he had been running 30 years ago, being a white man would have given him an advantage, so it is ""the way it should be"" today with the party now celebrating diversity.\John Delaney shakes hands with Clemson University student Zachary Pate after Pate introduced him to the crowd in Brackett Hall at Clemson University Wednesday.\SABRINA SCHAEFFER/Staff\CREDIT: Mollie R.

I am sorry that Paul M. Clements misunderstood my WPA article, but he is entirely right. The government should not be involved except to sanction the project. I wrote previously that ""The people in power could also ask U.S. billionaires, millionaires and other citizens who have some money to spare to donate money so that WPA workers could be paid."" Instead of that, a patriotic philanthropist could start a foundation similar to the Gates Foundation. That foundation could be run by a person with business sense like Bill and Melinda Gates.
\
The project that I suggested is expansive and expensive, but vital. How many lives have been devastated and how many businesses ruined or delayed by the 2008 floods and wildfires? How much money has been spent by state and federal governments to repair the damage? How much tax revenue has been lost to states and the federal government because businesses are not operating and their employees not working in those areas? How much tax revenue has been lost because farms have been flooded or destroyed by drought, and the farmers have lost the income from the crops? If the reader wants to see some of the costs to our government, check Wikipedia's article on the 2008 floods in the Midwest. Our environment has been so harmed that we will continue to have droughts and floods, and Americans need to be protected from these disasters. We Americans must realize that, because we live in a democracy, we are the government. The people in Washington, D.C., in Columbia and other government offices are public servants. If you believe in the idea that I described, write to these public servants and write to television stations, radio stations and newspapers.

Carbon tax supporter Thomas Friedman ridiculed Gov. Rick Perry's ""rejecting the science of climate change."" Former EPA Administrator Carol Martha Browner, however, classified last year's BP oil spill (some 206 million gallons) as the worst environmental disaster the U.S. had faced. Friedman and Browner apparently disagreed over the primacy of environmental crises. Perhaps man-made climate change did not weigh first among Ms. Browner's worst disasters because it has not been a clear and present danger.
\
Man-made pollution of coastal waters and harbors, however, has been a clear and present danger since 1972. Stormwater runoff pours over 27 billion (not million) gallons a year of untreated sewage into New York Harbor alone. The District of Columbia itself discharges 3.2 billion gallons of untreated sewage into its nearby waters each year. They are not alone.
\
Untreated runoffs plague many waterways at home and abroad. Runoffs, whether from toilets or parking lots, include varying amounts of toxic chemicals, heavy metals, exotic pharmaceuticals and biological disease hazards.
\
What has been the response to this clear and present ecological disaster? A 2004 settlement with federal environmental officials requires Washington, D.C., to build a $1.4 billion underground stormwater storage system during the next 20 years. The relative lack of urgency contrasts poorly with the relentless push for global cap and trade or tax schemes.
\
The reason for Friedman's harping may not be obvious. In 2009, Friedman described his evident dismay with the enviable lifestyle of ordinary American workers:
\
"" ... more and more people can now see how we live, aspire to our lifestyle and even take our jobs so they can live how we live. So ...by 2050, ...many more will live like ""Americans"" -- with American-size homes, American-size cars, eating American-size Big Macs.""
\
Careless turns can be onto one-way streets, Mr. Friedman.

The coal plant that Santee Cooper wants to build on the Great Pee Dee River is no longer just an expensive, polluting idea. The plant has become a symbol of how different Santee Cooper is compared to privately owned utilities.
\
One might guess this contrast is flattering to state-owned Santee Cooper. In fact, the opposite is true. Duke and Progress Energy, although owned by private investors, have abandoned new coal plants in South Carolina. And both have proposed programs to boost energy conservation and efficiency.
\
The initiatives are related. Programs that reduce electrical demand also reduce the need for new polluting power plants.
\
If demand reduction and efficiency upgrades were not a dependable and inexpensive way to produce power, Duke and Progress wouldn't pursue them. Neither would South Carolina's electrical cooperatives, which commissioned a study showing that efficiency upgrades in their service areas could produce most of the power promised by Santee Cooper's plant. Extended to Santee Cooper's total service area, that conservation could displace need for the plant entirely.
\
Is Santee Cooper taking notice? Not yet. It continues to chug along with a 1,320-megawatt coal plant comprised of two units that will supposedly cost about a billion dollars each. In reality, the units will cost far more. Rising concrete and steel prices have boosted the price of a single unit in North Carolina past $2 billion.
\
And that's before the balloon payment. From Wall Street to Main Street, everyone knows that some form of carbon controls are coming - controls that will exact a cost. According to the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, this plant would emit some 11.6 million tons of carbon dioxide every year. With a middle-range carbon tax of $15 per ton, this coal plant will cost ratepayers $174 million more per year.
\
But Hindenburg-sized balloon payments are not the only problem. DHEC wants to let the plant belch 138 pounds of mercury every year. That sounds like a little, but mercury is so toxic that it's usually measured in ounces - not pounds. Mercury in fish gets into the people who eat them. Babies and breast-fed infants and children exposed to mercury are at risk for lowered intelligence and learning disabilities.
\
South Carolina already has one of the country's worst mercury problems. Our entire coast and all our major rivers and lakes have health advisories due to high mercury levels in fish. Recent testing of citizens in the Pee Dee region showed mercury levels eight times higher than EPA health standards.
\
Given all this, how can Santee Cooper claim that this plant will be one of the cleanest ""in the country""? It can't. The Intermountain coal unit in Utah will emit one-fourth as much mercury as the Pee Dee plant. Similarly, while the Pee Dee plant will emit 7,489 tons per year of sulfur dioxide - a substance that forms fine particle pollution that aggravates existing heart and lung diseases, particularly for children and the elderly - other plants produce half as much. Likewise, the Pee Dee plant will emit 3,495 tons of nitric oxides (NOx), which react with other compounds to form ozone smog, a pollutant that is linked to asthma and lung disease. Its removal rate (59 percent to 74 percent) is far less than other plants (90 percent to 95 percent).
\
This plant is not the ""least-dirty"" option available, and no coal plant could be called ""clean."" Every day it will slurp millions of gallons of water from the stressed Pee Dee River and ingest a mile-long train's worth of coal stripped from Appalachian mountaintops. What comes out the other end will fill hundreds of acres of ash ponds and landfills.
\
In light of the plant's serious effects and growing costs, the time has come for Santee Cooper to pursue Plan B: an aggressive efficiency and conservation project that will delay the need for this plant or displace it entirely.
\
Privately owned utilities have launched these initiatives already. Our state-owned utility should do the same. Alternatively, it should explain why it cannot keep up with the private sector to provide us with reliable power without salvaging our health and environment, not to mention our budget.
\
We all want to keep the lights on, but some ideas are brighter than others. Santee Cooper has better options than coal. It just hasn't looked at them.

Immediately after Thursday's first debate among Democratic presidential hopefuls, the eight candidates and their supporters were invited to the ""spin room,"" an attractive conference room on South Carolina State's campus, where they could talk with reporters and others about how the debate went.
\
On Friday, the walls of the spin room spread to the state line.
\
All eight Democratic contenders remained in the Palmetto State and made assorted campaign stops to offer their take on the previous night and to talk up some issues that didn't get much air time during the 90-minute debate, such as education, housing, crime and economic development.
\
While the candidates spread out to most every corner of the state, they converged back in Columbia for the state party's Jefferson-Jackson dinner, followed by the far less formal fish fry sponsored by U.S. 6th District Rep. and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.
\
The fish fry offered the candidates a brief chance at addressing party activists, and they plan to wrap up their intensive Palmetto State blitzes today, when the state party holds its convention. Here are some snapshots of the day's campaigning:
\
Coffee with that photo op?
\
Former U.S. Sen. John Edwards stood behind the counter of Jack's Cafe on George Street on Friday morning and pretended to take orders from a room full of supporters dining on waffles and hash browns.
\
""All right,"" he said. ""What do you all want?""
\
It was clear from the reaction that topping the menu was just a moment of time or a photo with the presidential candidate and his wife, Elizabeth.
\
Undecided college students, representatives from special- interest groups and folks looking for a photo op with their babies lined up to greet the South Carolina native who won the state's Democratic primary in 2004 and hopes to again next year.
\
College of Charleston student Seaton Brown, who had a final in 20 minutes, brought his books with him to study and eat waffles while waiting to meet the senator. ""Are you really studying?"" Edwards asked. Brown said he was, but wanted a chance to meet the candidate. ""Honestly, I'm here because I don't know who I'm voting for,"" he said.
\
Anil Purohit, a fourth-year medical student at MUSC introduced himself to Edwards to talk about health care. ""It's a mess,"" said Purohit, who works as a student director at a free medical clinic in Mount Pleasant and has seen people die because they don't have insurance. Purohit said he's still undecided, but he was impressed that
\
Edwards actually has a plan to offer universal health care, if elected.
\
Talking about housing
\
Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd met with about nine housing advocates at the St. Julian Devine Community Center on Charleston's Eastside, as about as many members of the press watched.
\
Dodd listened to their concerns about how rising insurance and land costs are making it more difficult to provide affordable housing in the Lowcountry.
\
Debby Waid said the Humanities Foundation runs a 40-unit complex on King Street for lower-income elderly residents and has seen its insurance bill rise from $50,000 to $100,000 in a year. ""If this continues, you're going to see these rental properties go into foreclosure,"" she said.
\
Dodd noted that 65 percent
\
of the nation lives near the
\
coastline, so the insurance problem here ""really screams out for some answers."" Dodd said he supports community grants and Housing and Urban Development programs to build more housing, ""but there are larger issues here,"" such as increasing home ownership. Dodd said he also is interested in predatory lending practices that can lead to foreclosure, sometimes devaluing an entire city block.
\
He also talked about his plan for improving fuel efficiency in cars and passing a corporate carbon tax to raise money for new energy research and to encourage conservation.
\
As for health care, Dodd noted neither Republicans nor Democrats alone have the answer. ""What's lacking is the political leadership in bringing people together,"" he said. ""Americans can handle the truth. The problem is they don't think the political leadership wants to tell them the truth about what needs to be done.""
\
A big crowd at Burke
\
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama dropped by Burke High School not long after classes got out Friday to speak to an enthusiastic crowd of about 1,500. He praised South Carolina State University's handling of the debate and said, ""I think people are getting a sense of what is at stake.""
\
He touched on topics that got short shrift Thursday, saying America's great challenges include fixing a broken health-care system, an education system that still leaves too many children behind, a lack of a policy for dealing with energy and climate change. ""We have a set of challenges right now that is as great as any in America in a generation,"" he said.
\
Obama opened the floor for questions and said his campaign didn't arrange the questioners ahead of time. The first one, retired teacher Joyce Moore, simply said, ""Obama! Obama! You the man!"" Obama said he liked that, joking, ""I don't want all the questions to be that tough.""
\
Hannah Goss of North Charleston asked him about the environment, and Obama said he would push for a cap on emissions and for more fuel-efficient cars and more study into alternative fuels, such as cellulosic ethanol.
\
When asked about taxes, he said he would repeal the cuts for the wealthiest Americans, partly because the country needs to stop borrowing so much money from China and other countries. ""That's mortgaging our children's and our grandchildren's future, and that's irresponsible,"" he said.
\
He said if President Bush vetoes the supplemental funding bill that sets a deadline for getting troops out of Iraq, ""we are only 16 votes away (from overriding that veto), and we've got to ratchet up the pressure to make sure we get those 16 votes.""
\
James White, a student concerns specialist at Burke, said he hasn't made up his mind who to vote for, ""but I'm very highly impressed by Barack Obama.""
\
Hillary savors her twang
\
Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday she sees her sometimes Southern accent as a virtue.
\
""I think America is ready for a multilingual president,"" Clinton said during a campaign stop at a charter school in Greenville.
\
The New York senator --
\
who said she's been thinking about critics who have suggested that she tried to put on a fake Southern accent in Selma, Ala. -- noted that she's split her life between Arkansas, Illinois and the East Coast.
\
Clinton added a Southern lilt to her voice last week when addressing a civil rights group in New York City headed by the Rev. Al Sharpton. On Monday, dealing with a microphone glitch at a fundraiser for young donors, she quoted former slave and underground railroad leader Harriet Tubman. The two episodes prompted some ribbing in the media.
\
Clinton is a linguistic polyglot -- a Chicago native turned New York resident who works in Washington and spent two decades living in Arkansas when her husband, Bill Clinton, was governor.
\
But observers have long noted her tendency to speak Southern primarily in front of black audiences, as she did with Sharpton last week and at a civil rights commemoration in Selma in March.
\
All the Democrats are courting black voters, who made up almost 50 percent of the state's Democratic primary turnout in 2004.
\
Richardson's no rock star
\
New Mexico Gov. Bill Rich
\
ardson made his debut campaign stop in South Carolina Thursday and spent Friday in a whirlwind of media interviews, meet-and- greets and stops at various functions.
\
With just a couple of visits to the state since January, Richardson has some ground to cover to get more name recognition and get the facts of his record out in this important primary state.
\
""I am not as polished as the other candidates,"" he said from a chair at the Democratic Party headquarters in Columbia, nursing a sore back from Thursday's primary.
\
""I am not a rock star, but I've got a solid record,"" he said. ""I have got serious experience. I get things done.""
\
Richardson is a former congressman, an ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of Energy under President Clinton. A staunch supporter of the Second Amendment, he said he believes he is the party's moderate candidate.
\
As president, Richardson said his top domestic priorities would be health care and education. He'd like to see universal pre- school, full-day kindergarten and a minimum wage of $40,000 for teachers. The money, in part, could come from what's being spent now on the war in Iraq, he said.
\
McCain goes for the grits
\
U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., tried to grab some headlines as Democrats stormed the state Thursday. After stops across South Carolina for his official announcement tour, McCain took off for the next leg in Iowa.
\
Before he did, however, McCain, while finishing a second bowl of shrimp and grits, gave The Post and Courier some perspective about why he believes South Carolinians should trust him with the presidency.
\
Across the country, McCain said, ""There are common values and common views, I think, on a lot of issues. Overall, I think, there is more commonality, particularly among Republicans, than there are differences.""
\
McCain said he believes the state's major universities could help the country make headway on research into alternative fuel sources and play a notable role in the development of a national energy plan.
\
""I think there's a lot of work that could be done here in South Carolina between alternative energy and nuclear power,"" McCain said.
\
He also knows enough, being from off, that it's best not to get involved in certain fights. So is it Carolina or Clemson?
\
""I refuse to take sides in that particular conflict,"" he said.

43,"COLUMBIA -- By the time the proposal to raise South Carolina's gas tax by seven cents over five years hit the Senate floor in May 2005, Sen. Hugh Leatherman felt confident he had the votes to get it passed.\Leatherman, a Florence Republican and arguably the most powerful lawmaker in the Statehouse at the time, held the posts of Senate majority leader and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\Also pushing for the tax hike was Sen. John Land, leader of Senate Democrats.\But even with their support, the proposal was crushed by threats of a filibuster and opposition by Senate conservatives, as well as by House leaders and then-Gov. Mark Sanford.\Two weeks after the bill's demise, Leatherman had resigned as majority leader.\The defeat has served since as a warning to lawmakers who think about raising the state's fuel tax, which was last increased in 1987.\""That was the point we started falling backwards,"" Land, who retired last year, told GreenvilleOnline.com. ""Had that bill passed, we would not be in the situation we are in now.""\Leatherman, who remains chairman of the Finance Committee and has served in the Senate since 1981, said he isn't sure he would initiate an increase in the tax again or support it.\""It depends on the environment we're in at that particular time,"" he said.\The situation South Carolina is in, as Land calls it, is a network of crumbling and unsafe roads.\A task force created by the state Department of Transportation Board estimates it will take $29 billion over 20 years to bring the state's 41,000 miles of roads and more than 8,000 bridges up to adequate condition.\A coalition of business groups has asked lawmakers to approve $6 billion over 10 years to pay for road and bridge needs.\State officials say they have little additional resources to put a dent in the state's backlog of road and bridge work. The agency operates an annual budget of about $1.4 billion, almost all of it federal money or gas tax revenue.\The state operates the fourth-largest state-maintained road system in the nation with one of the lowest fuel taxes.\Nonetheless, opposition to increasing the fuel tax is stiff.\Gov. Nikki Haley has threatened to veto any increase, meaning it would take a two-thirds vote of legislators in both chambers to survive.\""I think it's off the charts, at least this year,"" said Bill Ross, executive director of the South Carolina Alliance to Fix Our Roads. ""I think the political realities of a motor vehicle user fee increase, it's not going to happen, probably not while she's governor.""\Sen. Yancey McGill, a Williamsburg County Democrat who was in the Senate when Leatherman last pushed for a gas tax increase, said he thinks the Senate might pass such an increase but the House might not and the governor would veto it if the House did pass an increase.\""The bottom line is, if the governor is not going to support it, then why should there be a major effort to try and get it passed?"" he asked.\In 2005, gas averaged $2.30 a gallon, unemployment was at 6.8 percent in South Carolina and the Great Recession was still at least two years away.\The state Department of Transportation was finishing up an ambitious construction program, 27 in seven, which sought to build a host of new projects around the state in seven years that would normally take 27 years to complete.\The construction was financed through borrowing. The Department of Transportation had a backlog then of billions of dollars in road and bridge needs.\In another year, then-DOT Director Elizabeth Mabry would ask lawmakers for $1 billion more in revenue per year to fix the state's roads.\Leatherman was aware of the maintenance shortfall and began studying plans for a gas tax increase. It wasn't a new idea for the Pee Dee Republican, who had served as floor leader in the Senate for the last successful raising of the tax in 1987 under a cooperative Gov. Carroll Campbell.\Under the 2005 proposal, the state's 16.8 cents per gallon tax would have increased by two cents by December 2006 or sooner if the average price of gas dipped below $2 a gallon.\Thereafter, prices would go up one penny a year for five years.\The added tax would have raised an estimated $197 million, its supporters said then, for maintenance projects ranging from widening and straightening secondary roads to adding or improving road shoulders.\But conservatives argued increasing the tax wasn't justified.\State revenues were growing. In fact, the Legislature that year had $142 million in supplemental cash.\Then-Sen. Greg Ryberg, an Aiken Republican, called the notion of raising the gas tax ""absurd"" when state revenues were growing by 5 or 6 percent.\""The conservatives said 'we're not going to have it. You're facing a filibuster and we're not going to give up on the filibuster,'"" said former Sen. David Thomas, a Fountain Inn Republican and one of those who opposed the increase.\""The House members were saying no to it also. And that played into it. What we were picking up from them, if my memory is correct, is they were saying, 'Pass it over, make my day.'""\Land said he wasn't surprised Leatherman was willing to push the issue even with conservative members of his party opposed to it.\""That did not surprise me because over the 36 years that Sen. Leatherman and I served together, I always saw him willing to step out and step forward on legislative issues that he felt would definitely make South Carolina a better place to live,"" he said.\""He has that strength of leadership and is willing to stand up for what he believes.""\Leatherman said he thought he had enough of the Senate's 46 votes when the issue hit the floor to shut down any filibuster attempts.\He said he soon realized the votes weren't there.\""I had been directly told, and I'm not going to talk about who told me, that there were 28 votes for it in the Senate,"" Leatherman said. ""Of course, when we got to the floor we found out that was not correct.""\Land said the opposition included lawmakers who vowed not to support any type of tax increase.\""I don't know whether they realized the roads they drove on to Columbia to make their proclamations were built with tax dollars,"" he said.\Leatherman said the opposition of House leaders and the governor had some impact as they always do in high-profile legislation.\""I guess some of our members say, 'Why do it if you can't get it through the House or it will be vetoed,'"" he said. ""That's always an issue.""\The tax defeat gave ammunition to some of his critics who wanted a change in direction for the Senate's Republicans. Two weeks later, Leatherman announced he was stepping down as majority leader, a post he had held for five years.\""Certainly that did have an impact,"" Land said of the tax defeat.\Sen. Harvey Peeler, who was elected to succeed Leatherman as majority leader and still holds that post, said he opposed increasing the tax.\""The need for funding is still there,"" he said. ""But the desire to raise the fuel tax is not there. It wasn't then and it's not now.""\Leatherman said he doesn't think about the political cost he bore for the gas tax fight or any other issues.\""I never think about things like that,"" he said. ""I really don't. I'm going to do what I think is good for this state. Those who think whatever they think can do whatever they want to.""\Ross and others who are searching for increased money to improve the state's roads say it will have to come from somewhere other than the gas tax.\House Speaker Bobby Harrell, Peeler and others are supporting the redirection of the state's sales tax revenue on vehicles to the Department of Transportation and road maintenance, about $100 million a year. Currently about $80 million of that goes into the state's General Fund and $20 million is spent on education.\Democrats argue that plans to redirect any revenue takes money away from agencies without replacing it. Sen. Nikki Setzler, leader of Senate Democrats, is proposing a plan to issue bonds so the state can borrow money for road and water improvements.\Some legislators are studying a plan by Virginia Gov. Bob McConnell, who is proposing a swap in his state of the gas tax for a .7 cent increase in the sales tax.\A business coalition has suggested a combination plan that would use money from the state's Capital Reserve Fund, a percentage of new money in the General Fund and redirecting all vehicle-related fees not already going to the Department of Transportation to apply to roads.\Dana Beach, executive director of the Coastal Conservation League, has proposed shutting down the State Transportation Infrastructure Bank, and redirecting the approximately $120 million in annual revenue to the Department of Transportation, though most of it would be used to meet the bank's bond obligations. A number of lawmakers are supporting that plan.\Haley has proposed using money, up to $77 million, from any surplus this year, plus $10 million from the Capital Reserve Fund and redirecting about $4 million in other money.\Ross said the competing proposals have him feeling optimistic some money will be approved, though it may be less than the 2005 gas tax increase proposed by Leatherman.\""There's a lot of talk and I feel positive about it,"" he said. ""I think we're going to see some things happen. It's just what is it?""\Lt Gov. Glenn McConnell, who served as Senate president pro tempore when Leatherman pushed for the gas tax in 2005, doesn't think any hike in the gas tax should be considered a non-starter for lawmakers.\""The roads are deteriorating very quickly,"" he said. ""We're falling further and further behind and we just can't continue to turn our head from it. That's why I don't think it's a closed subject.""\Land said South Carolina once enjoyed a reputation of having the finest roads in the nation.\""We're in a hole now that is going to really cost us to get out of,"" he said. ""We just got behind and we'll never catch up now.""\He said Leatherman's 2005 push for an increase in the gas tax was a ""turning point in our roads' history.""\""Had he gotten his way, we would be in a very enviable position compared to other states with our roads and our attractiveness to business and economic development."""
44,"It is no secret that South Carolina sorely needs additional revenue to upgrade and then maintain its massive system of state-maintained roads and highways. It's also widely known that this state has not increased its 16.75 cents per gallon gasoline tax since 1987.\Unfortunately, in that environment, Gov. Nikki Haley has proposed an executive budget for the coming fiscal year that still falls well short of state transportation funding needs, and does not include an increase in the gasoline tax. Haley's budget proposal does include an increase in highway funding, but the $90 million she's proposing is a drop in the bucket of the $450 million in additional funding needed next year alone to meet the daunting needs that South Carolina faces.\Haley is not alone. Obviously a gasoline tax that has been the same for more than 25 years indicates a Legislature that is too resistant to increasing -- or even maintaining -- the revenue needed to keep our state's roads in adequate condition.\No doubt, some of the state's road problems come from the fact that more than 60 percent of the road miles in South Carolina are state maintained; the national average is less than 20 percent. Yet the state's gasoline tax is among the nation's lowest and in the 25 years since it has been at the current level the buying power of that 16-cents-per-gallon tax has diminished to less than 8 cents per gallon when inflation is factored in, according to a recent report by the South Carolina Transportation Infrastructure Task Force.\In addition, the spending power of the gasoline tax is diminishing over time because less tax is being collected as fuel economy improves for vehicles and drivers buy less fuel to travel greater distances.\Haley should promote and lawmakers should pass a gasoline tax increase that helps bridge the state's huge highway maintenance funding gap.\A gasoline tax increase would not bridge the entire gap, but it is a sensible short-term step to help meet some state highway needs. Consider that up to 40 percent of the gasoline tax is paid by out-of-state residents who are here on vacation or passing through the state, and the impact on state residents already is somewhat mitigated.\At the same time, the task force recommended a more diverse funding system. Given the diminishing returns on fuel taxes, that is the proper course to take for the long term.\Other revenue sources suggested in the report include: raising driver's license fees, raising vehicle registration fees and raising the sales tax cap on vehicles, which currently is $300. All of those options deserve to be explored as well to help meet long-term road funding needs.\And the needs are acute. According to the study by the task force, South Carolina needs about $30 billion in additional revenue over the next 20 years to upgrade its state-maintained road system to a ""C"" rating. Even doubling the state's gas tax, which would represent a dramatic increase, would not meet that need.\Fixing this state's transportation nightmare is an urgent problem. South Carolina's roads are woefully out of date in some areas, and state DOT engineers give the entire system a failing grade. Roads that are under-built for the traffic loads they carry will only continue to deteriorate as the population increases and, along with it, traffic loads.\If the state's infrastructure continues to decline, economic development could be hurt. Employers want safe, modern and well-maintained infrastructure for their employees and to bring their goods to market. Residents will not be attracted to a region that cannot provide a safe network of roads to get to and from work and leisure activities.\Higher taxes are not an ideal solution. However, in a state that has not had a gasoline tax increase in more than two decades, the idea deserves consideration. That's especially true given the dire condition of our state's highway system.\Haley should be encouraging lawmakers to consider such an increase as well as other potential funding sources for increased highway funding. If there is concern over how the added revenue would be managed, then lawmakers also should continue to explore further reform to the state Department of Transportation to insert more accountability into its processes. Both issues need to be addressed in order to have the best chance at providing this state with a good-quality, well-maintained highway system."
45,"The Upstate of South Carolina has had no shortage of accolades lately -- from economic potential and business friendliness to community revival and cultural achievements, we are widely recognized as an enviable, growing region.\One facet you won't see getting gold stars, however, is our network of roads -- and that's why the South Carolina House recently approved House Bill 3516, which proposes increasing the gas tax by 10 cents in two-cent increments over five years, by a vote of 97-18. Particular thanks goes to the leadership of House Ways and Means Chairman Brian White and the rest of the Upstate supporters of the bill.\It's no surprise to anyone who's driven our roads that they are among America's poorest. According to the South Carolina Alliance to Fix Our Roads, only 18 percent of our lane miles are considered ""good"" and our roadway fatalities are among the highest in the nation.\It's simple enough to notice the potholes and lament the state of our highways, but the effects of this situation don't stop once our cars do: transportation and infrastructure are critical to economic competitiveness and job growth, as evidenced by a recent press conference with Michelin North America President Pete Selleck and several business leaders urging our legislators to adopt HB 3516.\Efficient infrastructure and affordable transportation can be the leading determinants in site selection and business expansion. In these areas South Carolina lags woefully behind our neighbors, who outspend us in road repair and achieve economic growth to show for it.\We have a thriving business community and a population that's growing faster than 80 percent of our peers, but our infrastructure has not kept up. South Carolinians lose 18 million hours in traffic congestion and more than 900 lives on our highways annually, not to mention the money spent in vehicular damages, maintenance and accident-related medical expenses.\It is incumbent on our leaders in the Senate to enact this legislation so we that we can invest in infrastructure to support this state's talented workforce and high quality of life. Already ahead in business incentives, regulatory environment and innovation, South Carolina requires substantial strides in its infrastructure to remain economically competitive and desirable.\We are confident this bill is a simple, stable solution for South Carolina's roads and, in the end, its economic health. A strength of this legislation is the multiple streams of revenue it proposes for road repair: electric car user fees and vehicle registration costs will go towards these improvements, and out-of-state visitors will contribute each time they fill up their tanks here.\Our state's current highway funding comes primarily from the 16.75 cents per gallon motor fuel user fee, which has not changed since 1987 and is the second-lowest gas tax in the nation. Since these revenues do not keep pace with inflation or the age of our roads and bridges, our spending per lane mile is two-thirds lower than the regional average. The result is dangerously poor roadways.\South Carolina struggles with some of the direst driving conditions in the nation, but we aren't alone in our quest to change that. Just last year, New Jersey's gas tax increased by 23 cents per gallon, and in February, the Indiana House voted to raise their gas tax from 18 to 28 cents per gallon, with annual increases a possibility, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.\The funds raised by HB 3516 would go into a Department of Transportation trust, but would benefit all of us. More than half of South Carolina's lane miles are ""poor,"" costing the average Upstate driver $1,248 in wear and tear per year; this proposal would improve existing roads but increase most driver's annual gas expenses by just $50. Every dollar raised would go toward existing roads rather than any potential new projects; the drivability and safety issues we see currently are the ones this proposal would address.\Moreover, at least 30 percent of the revenue generated by the proposal would come from out-of-state drivers, allowing them to support both our economy and our roads while they enjoy all our state offers. Sharing the expense of road repairs with everyone who uses them makes perfect sense to us, and is likely why many of the state's trucking companies and associations are among the vast coalition of support for HB 3516. We as a state see its necessity and are happy to contribute; this proposal lets those who use our roads support their upkeep.\South Carolina is primed for continued economic growth now more than ever; without the support of our legislature on critical infrastructure issues, however, we will hit a roadblock. I hope to see House Bill 3516 become law because it aligns with the goals of the Upstate SC Alliance goals and our partners: it moves business here.\More than that, it keeps our citizens safe, encourages future economic development, makes tourism and trade smoother, and simply makes sense. HB 3516 is a forward-thinking proposal whose framework provides a sustainable, dedicated source of funding to support our highway infrastructure.\While it won't fix all our state's infrastructure problems, this bill will move us forward in patching up the pressing roadway issues we have. The proof is in the pavement, and now's the time to invest in it.\guest column\John Lummus is president & CEO of the Upstate SC Alliance, a public/private regional economic development organization formed in 2000 to market the Upstate for business investment globally."

WASHINGTON - States sick of paying more in federal gasoline taxes than they get in highway funds vowed Tuesday to shelve partisan differences, pool their strength and force changes that will achieve a return rate of up to 95 percent.
\
""We're speaking for about 60 percent of the population of the United States,"" Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said at a ""donor state"" rally on Capitol Hill. ""We are here to achieve equity and fairness and to make sure now means now.""
\
More than 20 states from Florida to California pay more in gas taxes than they get back in highway funds.
\
South Carolina's rate of return from 1992 to 1996 averaged 71 cents on the dollar, worst in the nation, according to Federal Highway Administration statistics.
\
""South Carolina is tired of being the runt pig,"" said Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C.
\
Added 1st District Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.: ""The most American of all themes is simple fairness.""
\
Simple is not a word that fits well with this year's battle over reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.
\
ISTEA, as the measure is known, is the authorizing legislation for federal highway, highway safety and transit programs that expired at the end of fiscal 1997.
\
Several proposals have been floated as replacements; the two leading contenders are bills by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Rules and Administration Committee and a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee.
\
The two are on a collision course, according to S.C. Transportation Commission Chairman Buck Limehouse, because Shuster's addresses donor-state needs with special project funds, while Warner's bumps the return rate up to ""a true"" 95 percent.
\
Shuster's supporters include Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., the only member of South Carolina's congressional delegation who serves on the key House panel.
\
Clyburn, who did not attend the rally, believes needs such as a replacement for the Cooper River bridges can be accomplished with a lower increase in the funding formula and extra ""demonstration project"" funds.
\
Limehouse, Sanford, Inglis and others contend the state is better off in the long term with a higher return rate.
\
""(Clyburn's) trying to do it the old way,"" Limehouse said. ""That's not good for South Carolina or anyone else.""
\
Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, said support is building among donor state lawmakers, who number 260 in the House.
\
""Two hundred and sixty votes is a powerful coalition,"" he said.
\
Gov. David Beasley also hailed the bipartisan group, noting, ""When you've got Democrats and Republicans working together, it's got to be good.""

South Carolina's return on federal highway dollars has improved significantly in recent years, but still lags behind what the state sends to Washington. The current 90.5 percent return could rise to more than 95 percent under a highway bill now being drafted, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham. The lack of adequate state highway funding makes an upward revision particularly important.
\
Sen. Graham reports the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works is working on a bill that would increase South Carolina's return to 95 percent by 2009. Over the next six years, the state would receive $3.8 billion, or $1.1 billion more than in the previous six, he says.
\
The goal of getting 100 percent will be difficult to achieve as long as other states ""are getting their full share plus 10 percent of ours,"" the senator says. It is an unhappy irony that many of the states that benefit at the expense of donor states such as South Carolina are comparatively wealthy.
\
South Carolina's road funding plight is compounded by the Legislature's unwillingness to discuss an increase in the state gas tax, much less enact one. The current gas tax is among the lowest in the nation and doesn't produce sufficient revenue even to maintain existing roads. It is a virtual certainty that a gas tax increase won't be enacted in an election year.
\
Sen. Graham's comments in reference to the need for a greater return on federal gas taxes could be equally applied to the argument for more state revenues: ""Motorists are finding themselves stuck in traffic and some of our roads have become more dangerous because they are being over utilized. I'm afraid if we aren't able to get more money into our road system, it could hurt our economic development efforts and hurt the quality of life for our citizens.""
\
While Sen. Graham and his colleagues on the delegation work for a more equitable return of federal gas taxes, the state Legislature should at least begin examining the sufficiency of current state revenues for transportation. More federal dollars, while very welcome, won't be sufficient to solve all of the state's longstanding transportation problems.
\
At last estimate, the state needs an additional $38 billion over the next 20 years. DOT's financial problems are so severe that the department has virtually abandoned its resurfacing program for secondary roads. Local governments are taking care of about 10 percent of resurfacing needs with C-funds, a department spokesman tells us.
\
""We are delighted that Congress is looking to increase the funding level,"" said Michael Covington, DOT director of governmental affairs. While more federal funds will help, the state road-funding shortfall ""won't go away until it is dealt with at the state level.""
\
Without the addition of more state resources, our secondary road system, in particular, may deteriorate to a point where acceptable standards for motorist safety can't be met.

COLUMBIA -- Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the General Assembly, constitutional officers and my fellow South Carolinians:
\
Tonight, we have come together to discuss the state of South Carolina - the success we have enjoyed and the challenges we face. But we must first acknowledge, as we do every year, that without the selfless sacrifice of our men and women in uniform who have dedicated their lives to protecting our freedoms, this night would not be possible.
\
So now, please join me as we pay tribute to those who gave the last full measure of devotion in the service of their state and country:
\
-- Captain James E. Chaffin III, West Columbia
\
-- Staff Sergeant Girard ""Jerry"" Gass, Jr., Huger
\
-- Deputy Sheriff Joseph ""Joe"" Matuskovic, Summerville
\
-- Investigator Holmes N. Smith, Jr., Sumter
\
-- Patrolman First Class Robert Blajszczak, Summerville
\
-- Laurent ""Larry"" Britton, Charleston
\
-- Lieutenant John M. Burns, Myrtle Beach
\
-- Firefighter Paramedic Kellen A. Fleming, Chesnee
\
On behalf of all South Carolinians, to their families, know we will never forget.
\
Many of you enjoyed the festivities of last week. We want to thank you for making it a special time for our family and the state. We are thankful that Michael has been home from deployment for over a year now. He continues to be very involved with Youth Challenge, advocating for adoptive children, and managing the mansion grounds, all while keeping a smile on his face. Please help me thank the coolest First Gentleman ever, Michael Haley.
\
And what would Haley Family Fun Night be without two really fun kids. Michael and I realized recently that four years from now, they will have spent half of their childhood in public life. Rena and Nalin continue to take it in stride and make us both proud. They are 16 and 13 years old now. Rena is starting to tour college campuses and Nalin continues to tour basketball courts. Please help me welcome two little ones that make me proud to be their mom, Rena and Nalin.
\
One of my favorite parts of giving this speech each year is being able to recognize some of the people who have helped make South Carolina the special place that it is.
\
When we started our administration four years ago, we thought it was very important to highlight people in our state that make us smile. We will always have challenges in government. But for all of those challenges we have selfless people who, in the name of service and out of love for our great state, give South Carolina a good name.
\
I know there's been a lot of chatter about who Charleston's next mayor will be, but before we get too far down that road, we should take a moment, stop, and appreciate what we have. Here tonight is a man who has built a legacy of service in the Lowcountry and across South Carolina. He has served as the Mayor of Charleston for nearly 40 years and he has helped transform that city into the most popular destination in America, a crown jewel of not just our state, but of our nation.
\
He has decided to step down as mayor, but he will forever be remembered as one of South Carolina's great gentlemen and devoted public servants. I ask that you join me in welcoming Mayor Joe Riley, and thanking him for his lifetime of service to South Carolina.
\
Just a few short weeks ago, we lost a great South Carolinian with the passing of Governor James Edwards. As governor, as Secretary of Energy, and later as the president of MUSC, he spent a huge part of his life serving others and cemented a place in our state's history as a man we can all look up to.
\
But as we all know, it is nearly impossible to be as strong and significant as he was without the support of a loving family.
\
Tonight, I have the great privilege of introducing to you his incredible wife, Mrs. Ann Edwards. Mrs. Edwards asked that I thank you, the Members of the General Assembly, as well as the people of South Carolina, for the tremendous support you gave Governor Edwards during his full life and that you've given her since his passing. Mrs. Edwards, thank you for your service and for sharing your wonderful husband with us. You and your family will forever be appreciated by the citizens of South Carolina.
\
Nobody has represented us with more dignity than Lance Corporal Kyle Carpenter. We were able to have his parents join us for this speech in 2012 when he was recovering from his injuries, but we are thankful to have him here today, safe and healthy.
\
Last year, Michael and I were so proud to attend the ceremony where Kyle was awarded the Medal of Honor for his acts of valor during his deployment in Afghanistan.
\
I would like to take a moment to read a passage from the official citation recognizing his heroic actions.
\
""Lance Corporal Carpenter and a fellow Marine were manning a rooftop security position on the perimeter of Patrol Base Dakota when the enemy initiated a daylight attack with hand grenades, one of which landed inside their sandbagged position. Without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own safety, Lance Corporal Carpenter moved toward the grenade in an attempt to shield his fellow Marine from the deadly blast. When the grenade detonated, his body absorbed the brunt of the blast, severely wounding him, but saving the life of his fellow Marine.""
\
It is rare that you are able to be in the presence of a true American hero, but that is exactly what we have with us today in Kyle Carpenter.
\
Please stand and join me in showing our deepest gratitude for his service to our country and his bravery that has made us all so proud.
\
South Carolina continues to be a major success story when it comes to recruiting jobs to our state. We make it very clear to the companies that choose to invest here that they are joining our South Carolina family. The businesses we are honoring tonight could have invested and moved anywhere in the country, and they chose to join Team South Carolina. We should never take that for granted.
\
Tonight, representatives of a few of those success stories, from all across the world, are here with us. As I introduce them, please hold your applause until the end - and then join me in giving them a warm South Carolina welcome.
\
Please stand when I call your name, and remain standing.

\
Thank you for making South Carolina your home.
\
Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our state is inspiring.
\
Over the last four years I have had the great privilege of travelling far and wide representing our state and her people. What I've learned is that we're not the only ones who love South Carolina.
\
Whether I'm in California or Connecticut, Montreal or Minnesota, the story of South Carolina's success is front and center. Everywhere we go there is excitement - and frankly, not a small amount of envy - over who we are and what we've been able to accomplish. It's a beautiful thing.
\
But last year I got to experience just how far that word is spreading.
\
In November, as many of you know, we travelled to India on a trade mission. India, of course, is the country of my parents' birth. I hadn't been there since I was two years old, so the trip was a special one for me - there are few things more impactful than seeing firsthand, for the first time, your own history.
\
But what was even more amazing to me was the connections I found between South Carolina and that far-off land.
\
I visited a workforce training center at Rayat-Bahra University in Mohali. Hundreds of students turned out for a talk I gave, and they had so many questions about South Carolina. But they didn't just know about South Carolina because we have an Indian-American governor. The skill development center at their university is modeled after ICAR in Greenville. Their school has signed an agreement with Clemson University to expand cooperation and allow their students to share in our educational opportunities, and vice-versa.
\
Everywhere I went in India - from students to business leaders to government officials - they knew what was going on in South Carolina.
\
Our state is getting noticed across the country and the world, and we're getting noticed for our triumphs, not our controversies. I couldn't be more excited. Or more proud.
\
Together we have built an environment where businesses can and will and want to grow. It is an environment that has enabled Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental and now Giti to manufacture tires in our state, with our workers. It has led international giants like GE and BMW and Toray to say yes, we want to call South Carolina home. It has created a better life for our people, a brighter future for our children.
\
We've worked hard to build a world-class, world-renowned business climate. And we must fight to keep it.
\
Any truly objective review of South Carolina's business landscape notes the benefit we get from the minimal role unions play in our state. In 2013 we had the third lowest percentage of union workers in America, with just 3.7 percent of South Carolina workers choosing to join a union.
\
I cannot express to you the extent to which this is a game-changer when we are trying to bring new businesses to our state. We have a reputation - internationally - for being a state that doesn't want unions because we don't need unions. And it is a reputation that matters.
\
Now, that reputation, and even more importantly, a South Carolina company, are under attack. And they are under attack by an organization that has proven it cares nothing for South Carolina or our workers.
\
Boeing's story - how they came here, their magnificent progress in Charleston since 2009, their commitment to their workers and to our communities - is one that certainly need not be told here. We all know it. We're all proud of it.
\
But in light of the fact that the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, one of the largest labor unions in the world, is gearing up to try and unionize the Charleston plant, their South Carolina story bears repeating.
\
In stark contrast to Boeing, which has invested billions of dollars and the future of what may be their most important project in the people of South Carolina, the IAM has never believed in us.
\
First, they flatly, publicly stated that South Carolina workers do not have the necessary skills to build airplanes. Our workers have proven them wrong, but no matter what the IAM says today or tomorrow, we should never forget what they really think about our state.
\
And then they sued us. They tried to shut us down.
\
So every time you hear a Seattle-union boss carry on about how he has the best interests of the Boeing workers in Charleston at heart, remember this: if it was up to that same union boss, there would be no Boeing workers in Charleston.
\
The truth is the IAM cares about one thing and one thing only - its own power. And the successes of Boeing in South Carolina, and more so, the successes of the non-union workers who populate its ranks, are a threat to the IAM.
\
Like bullies do, the union bosses will try to cover-up those truths and crush those threats. But we have beaten back the IAM before, and with the support of those of us in this room, and the good people all across South Carolina, I have every confidence that the Boeing workers in Charleston will see this play for exactly what it is and reject this union power grab.
\
While Boeing and the 787 Dreamliners rolling off the Charleston assembly line are an example of what real workforce training success can look like, we don't have those same stories everywhere in South Carolina.
\
I have challenged my entire Cabinet to get creative about how we put people back to work.
\
Whether placing employment offices in our prisons, as we did in Manning last year, so that offenders come out from behind the fence with a job, or moving families from welfare-to-work - we are about workforce programs that meet the real needs of real people.
\
Think about the single mom struggling to make ends meet that can't afford to pay for the training she needs. Think about the young man who just graduated college in liberal arts and can't seem to find a job. Think about the father of four whose ability to move up in his company is capped out. They all need opportunities. They all deserve a better life.
\
We are going to help them get there through a new initiative called SUCCEED South Carolina.
\
We have always offered training programs through readySC to train people who want to work in places like BMW, Boeing, and Continental. It's been tremendously successful, but we're going to expand it.
\
We will now begin working with other companies, companies of different sizes and in different industries, companies already in South Carolina, to create programs that will lead to a job.
\
The best part? If that single mom wants to get started, we'll pay for her training. And when she gets the job we've trained her for, which she will, she'll pay us back and pay it forward.
\
This new initiative will not only help those citizens who want to be retrained but also assist our smaller companies, those that represent 97 percent of our employers, by helping them get the workers they need to keep moving, and keep growing.
\
The economic gains we have made since the end of the Great Recession are no secret to anyone in this room, but it is not enough for us to simply celebrate them. We must keep driving on. The tens of thousands of new jobs announced in South Carolina don't mean anything if it's not our people who are filling them. The massive drop in our unemployment rate over the last five years is amazing, but we must recognize there are still thousands out of work.
\
We can address these issues. We can make sure that, as a state, we are serving the single mom, the twenty-two year old graduate, the capped-out father - and that we are serving them well. We can make sure that any business - small, medium, or large - has a willing and well-trained stable of South Carolinians ready to fill all the jobs they can create. And we can make sure that South Carolina is a state not just of tremendous growth, but of real, true opportunity, for each and every one of our citizens.
\
The journey to that place of opportunity doesn't start with any of the three people just mentioned. No, like most things, it starts with their children. It starts with how we educate all our children.
\
Last year, I stood at this podium and asked a very simple question: are we willing to look South Carolina's children in the eye and tell them that their future will be largely determined by the circumstances of their birth and not the endeavors of their life.
\
And by your actions, you answered, resoundingly, ""no.""
\
I thank you for that. And, more importantly, years from now, the children of South Carolina will thank you for it. For the changes we made are real.
\
We invested in teachers. We invested in technology. We invested in reading. And, for the first time in our history, we acknowledged that it costs more to teach those children mired in poverty than those born into a secure economic situation.
\
We changed the face of South Carolina.
\
But as we said last year, this was not a silver bullet. The investment we made must be ongoing, it must continue, and it must touch every school district.
\
So in our budget we have doubled down on our investment in technology. We have expanded our commitment to reading coaches. We have devoted more to professional development, so our teachers are better equipped to teach in today's world.
\
And we've proposed a new initiative that will help our rural schools get, and keep, the kind of highly qualified teachers their students deserve.
\
First, if a student graduating high school is willing to spend eight years teaching in their underserved home district after college, we will pay for up to four years of tuition at a state school.
\
Second, if a teacher who has graduated from college and is burdened by student loans commits to teach in a rural district, we will contribute to their student loan repayment.
\
Third, if a teacher has less than five years' experience and begins teaching in an eligible district, he or she will receive a pay bump, advancing his or her salary to the level of a teacher five years further down the road.
\
Finally, if a teacher wants to attend graduate school at a state college or university, we will cover the cost of that education, again in exchange for a commitment to teach in a rural or underserved district.
\
And all of this will be done without spending a single new tax dollar.
\
These options aren't just available to new teachers. They are available to all teachers. We want that shining star teaching in Lexington to decide it's time to take on a new challenge and teach in Denmark. Because nothing can ignite a child's desire to learn quite like a great teacher. We need those great teachers going to our rural schools, touching our most at risk students, and we need them staying there. Now, we've given them an added incentive to do just that.
\
Last session you joined our call for reform, recognizing that the education of our children transcended the normal, sometimes foolish, constraints of politics and partisanship. I ask that you do the same this year, that you continue to raise the ceiling of opportunity for every child in South Carolina.
\
The spirit of cooperation, the commitment to moving our state forward that defined our shared efforts on education sadly did not extend to the reform of our ethics laws that South Carolina so desperately needs.
\
Many words have been spoken on this issue and much time wasted in these Chambers with no result. I believe I have said all I need to. You all know exactly where I stand. Reform our ethics laws, restore the public's faith in our government. Let's do it right, and let's do it now.
\
We have also seen our challenges over the last four years, in many cases due to the long-term neglect of some of our agencies. And so we went after that neglect.
\
We strengthened our mental health and drug abuse services. We focused not on dollars spent but services given to our most vulnerable, like those with disabilities. And we strengthened agencies that had been heavily burdened by changing and increasing populations. In every case, we have focused on results for those in greatest need.
\
One agency has been more challenging than most, the Department of Social Services. There is no question there were changes that needed to be made, and to understand just what those changes should look like, we went right to the source: our caseworkers.
\
They told us how painful, how difficult it can be to protect children from their own parents. Their frustrations became my frustrations, and their passion for children fueled our efforts to improve DSS.
\
We have since added caseworkers, changed processes, added second shifts, improved technology, forged partnerships with law enforcement, created new career paths for caseworkers, and so much more.
\
We have changed DSS for the better. It is in a far different place than it was a year ago, but there is also still work to do. We have found the person to lead that charge.
\
Susan Alford was recently quoted as saying ""It's always challenging but we have to do it with openness, with integrity, with humility, and with a lot of determination."" I couldn't have said it better. I have no doubt that for the Department of Social Services, its dedicated employees, and most importantly, the children they serve, there are brighter days ahead.
\
There is an important economic convergence going on in South Carolina today.
\
On one side, we have a growing economy, with more of our people working than ever before, with unemployment down to rates we haven't seen in many years, with people moving from welfare-to-work by the tens of thousands, and with new companies moving in or starting up all the time. It is indeed a great day in South Carolina.
\
How did we get here? There are several factors, including our business-friendly regulatory approach, our right-to-work laws, and our strong economic development and recruitment efforts. But there's also no question that our tax system plays an important part in our economy too.
\
Our economic competitiveness as a state is in really good shape, but the nature of competition is that just when you think you're doing well, your competitors are gaining on you. In order to continue our state's remarkable progress, we must take further steps to improve our standing.
\
We are competing for jobs internationally, nationally, and regionally. Where we stand compared to our neighboring states matters.
\
Some southeastern and southwestern states - Tennessee, Florida, and Texas - have no income tax at all. Georgia's tax is a full percent lower than ours, and just last year North Carolina cut theirs by two full points, to below even that.
\
In that competitive environment, our state's 7% income tax rate stands out and puts us at a disadvantage. In order to keep the ball rolling in our economy, we must bring down our income tax.
\
At the same time, it is widely recognized that we have major infrastructure needs in our state.
\
We have a very real problem with the way our transportation dollars are spent. Our system screams out for reform and restructuring. The condition of our roads and bridges is a statewide concern and yet our dollars are being spent with zero statewide perspective.
\
The current system, with commissioners representing Congressional Districts and selected by local delegations, is the ultimate exercise in parochialism. Instead of fighting for the needs of South Carolina at large, they fight for the needs of their districts, which means they fight each other. I don't necessarily blame them - until we make wholesale changes to the system, doing so is in their best interests.
\
The problem is it is not in South Carolina's best interest. So I will not support more revenue for our roads and bridges until we restructure the Department of Transportation. Simply shipping more money into the current bureaucracy would be like blasting water through a leaky hose. Some of it would reach the right destination, but too much of it would end up in a mess on the ground. I won't do it.
\
That said, deficient roads and highways are an economic issue. That's why we supported $1 billion in new road funds last year, which was the biggest infrastructure investment in a generation. It's why we proposed in our Executive Budget dedicating an additional $61 million in auto sales tax funds entirely to roads. But we know that's not enough. We still have very substantial infrastructure revenue needs that have to be addressed.
\
We have studied every option.
\
Some have advocated raising the state gas tax. Yes, we do have the third-lowest gas tax in America. Gas prices are now down to their lowest level since 2009. Non-South Carolinians who visit our state would pay a portion of the tax. And we would boost the revenue stream that is dedicated to improving our roads and highways.
\
But there are also major problems with it. We have not gotten to where we are as a state, with our strengthening and growing economy, by raising taxes. Quite the opposite. If all we do is increase taxes, whether it's the gas tax, or some other tax, we will hurt our citizens, we will discourage job creators, and we will dampen our economy. As I've said many times, I will veto any straight-up increase in the gas tax. That's just not going to happen while I'm governor. It's the wrong thing for South Carolina.
\
So here's the deal. Let's do three things at once that will be a win-win-win for South Carolina.
\
Let's cut our state income tax rate from 7 percent to 5 percent over the next decade. That's a nearly 30 percent reduction in state income taxes. Nationally, it will take us from 38th in income tax competitiveness to 13th. Regionally, it will put our rate back below those of North Carolina and Georgia. It will be a massive draw for jobs and investment to come to our state.
\
And it will put more money in the pockets of every South Carolinian, letting them keep more of what they earn. It will reward work, savings, and investment - all the things we need to do to make our state stronger and our people more prosperous.
\
Next, let's change the way we spend our infrastructure dollars and get rid of the legislatively elected transportation commission so the condition of South Carolina's roads is no longer driven by short-sighted regionalism and political horse trading, and we stop wasting our tax money.
\
Finally, let's increase the gas tax by ten cents over the next three years, and let's dedicate that money entirely toward improving our roads. That will keep our gas tax below both Georgia and North Carolina, and we can do it without harming our economy, because when coupled with the 30% income tax cut, it still represents one of the largest tax cuts in South Carolina history.
\
Now, I hope everyone listened carefully to what I said. This is a three-part package deal. In order to get my signature on any gas tax increase, we need to restructure the DOT, and we need to cut our state income tax by two percent. If we do all of those things, we will have better roads and a stronger economic engine for our people. That's a win-win.
\
I'd like to personally say thank you to Speaker Jay Lucas for his leadership and his commitment to working with us on this and many other issues going forward. And I'd like to thank Chairman Brian White, Representative Gary Simrill and the other dedicated members of the House Transportation Committee, who have worked for months to find a solution to our crumbling road system.
\
I appreciate the House taking a formative, thorough lead on this issue. We can all agree that our state's Department of Transportation must be reformed in order to bring more jobs to South Carolina, and I look forward to working with both the House and Senate to solve this very real problem this year.
\
Between August of 2013 and this past November I spent my days and nights travelling South Carolina and talking with her people.
\
Campaigns are a lot of things, but above all they are an opportunity. An opportunity to hear from our citizens, who act as our state's conscience. An opportunity to look backwards, at where we were and what we've accomplished. And an opportunity to share a vision for where we want to go.
\
I have heard it said that the election results have given me a mandate. I have thought long and hard about what that might mean.
\
Webster's Dictionary defines the word mandate as ""a command or authorization to act in a particular way on a public issue given by the electorate to its representative."" The way the word has been used since November suggests to me that many think I have been given the authorization to act, effectively given permission to push through the agenda I desire.
\
That is not how I see it. I never saw the election as a referendum on me, but on all of us, on the direction we have taken South Carolina over the last four years. Likewise, I don't view the results as anything but a command, a command by the people of our state to continue along the path we have travelled together since I first took the oath of office as their governor.
\
That path has been one of complete commitment to the economic future of our state, where every action we take is one that makes it easier for our companies to do business, expand, and hire our people.
\
It has been one where we jump at every opportunity to restructure our archaic government so as to better serve our citizens.
\
It has been one where we opened our borders to new businesses and kept them shut to job-killing unions.
\
It has been one where we fight, every day, to give South Carolinians the honest, open government they deserve.
\
It has been one where bickering for bickering's sake between branches of government became a thing of the past.
\
It has been one where we placed the education of our children above our parochial and political self-interests.
\
And it has been one where we put South Carolina back on the map - for all the right reasons.
\
That is the path I believe in. It is the path the people of South Carolina overwhelmingly embraced ten weeks ago. And it is the path I will continue to follow, for if we do, there is no telling the heights to which we can take the state we all love.
\
Thank you, God Bless you, and may He continue to bless the state of South Carolina.

49,"""People who are using electric cars get to ride the roads for free. That doesn't sound fair. Of course, everybody wants somebody else to pay for it.""\Sen. Ray Cleary, Georgetown Republican\COLUMBIA -- In Washington state, all electric vehicles pay an annual fee of $100, while in Virginia, the annual fee for alternative fuel vehicles was recently set at $64.\South Carolina lawmakers are considering fees as well, $60 for hybrids and $120 per year for electric vehicles.\Across the nation, state legislatures are grasping for ways to collect revenue from alternative fuel vehicles, as purchases of the vehicles go up and gas tax collections go down.\Those legislators believe users of the roads should pay for that use and if they cannot pay at the gas pump, they should pay during annual vehicle registration.\""People who are using electric cars get to ride the roads for free,"" said Sen. Ray Cleary, a Georgetown Republican who has pushed the Senate to confront transportation funding. ""That doesn't sound fair. Of course, everybody wants somebody else to pay for it.""\The problem, lawmakers say, is that because the vehicles are powered by alternative fuels, government has an interest in promoting what is good for the environment.\So many states, including South Carolina, offer tax credits for those who purchase or lease vehicles powered by alternative fuels.\In fact, a group of senators has proposed a $1,000 tax credit for those who purchase or lease such vehicles, a bill that was delayed last week so legislators could get more information, including its fiscal impact.\""If we do a credit on one end, and there is no taxing or fee mechanism, then the state is paying someone to not pay for their use of the roads,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harvey Peeler of Gaffney.\""That's why we wanted staff to look into it and research those kinds of questions.""\And all of this comes at a time when the gas tax in South Carolina, which funds the vast majority of the state's infrastructure needs, is decreasing and officials estimate road and bridge repair needs at about $29 billion over 20 years.\According to the state Department of Revenue, gasoline and diesel fuel tax collections went from $558 million in fiscal year 2011-12 to $536 million last year, the latest year figures are available.\Revenue over the past five years has been shaky, with an increase of about $4 million in fiscal year 2012. Fuel tax collections also dipped between 2007-08 and 2008-09. Revenue from fuel taxes didn't increase above the 2007-08 level until 2010-11, according to the Department of Revenue data.\""Most states rely 38 percent on their gasoline tax sales for their roads,"" Cleary said.\""South Carolina relies to the tune of 80 to 90 percent and that's going down. In a few years we're going to get less money because of cars getting 40 to 50 miles per gallon and that's not even counting the cars that might be running on propane, or dishwashing detergent or anything else we can think of.""\And much of what is collected at the pump doesn't go to fund roads or bridges.\According to the state Department of Transportation, in 2012, about $145 million was subtracted from fuel tax revenue for various agencies and local governments, including the Department of Health and Environmental Control, the Department of Agriculture and a state watercraft fund.\Cleary is shepherding a bill on transportation funding that will offer senators a menu of funding choices through amendments, the idea being that the Senate can pick and choose what funding mechanism it can stomach, whether it is increased driver's license fees or indexing the gas tax for inflation. The fees for alternative fuel vehicles are among the choices.\Now increasing the gas tax isn't among the choices on that bill.\Separate legislation to increase the gas tax has been filed, but Gov. Nikki Haley has threatened to veto any such increase.\Instead, Haley has suggested that lawmakers shake the General Fund's ""money tree,"" the difference in annual revenue estimates from first to final projections she says average more than $100 million each year.\Currently, South Carolina taxpayers can earn a tax credit for the purchase or lease of an alternative fuel vehicle equal to 20 percent of what the federal tax credit would be, according to the law, which in most cases doesn't amount to more than $700.\That is why some senators want to increase the credit to $1,000.\However, not many file for credits, perhaps because of confusion.\The federal government phased out its credits and while South Carolina law treats the federal credits as if they always will exist, the wording can confuse people.\For the 2012 fiscal year, according to the Department of Revenue, 39 vehicle owners claimed the alternative vehicle credit, for a total of $112,436, according to agency spokeswoman Samantha Cheek.\Meanwhile, the number of alternative fuel vehicles is growing nationwide.\According to the U.S. Department of Energy, dealers nationwide sold just under 400,000 hybrid electric vehicles in 2012, a dramatic increase from 2004, when fewer than 100,000 of the vehicles were sold.\Other states that have looked at collecting revenue from owners of alternative fueled vehicles, including hybrid electric and all-electric, have come up with a variety of methods.\In Oregon, for example, owners pay $43 annually.\In Washington, electric-powered vehicles pay $100 annually. Vehicles powered by propane and natural gas pay according to their weight, with fees ranging from $45 to $250.\In Iowa, the annual fee is $25 unless the vehicles are five years old or older, in which case the fee is $15.\In Arizona, owners pay a license tax of $4 per $100 assessed value, that being 1 percent of the manufacturer's base retail price. The minimum tax is $5 per year.\And in Louisiana, alternative fuel vehicle owners pay a tax annually of either $120 or 80 percent of the current special fuels tax.\""If these things are going to cut down on the use of gasoline, which is our only source of income for highway construction, we've got to figure a way to generate income for DOT,"" said Sen. Billy O'Dell, a Ware Shoals Republican who is among the sponsors of the tax credit for alternative fueled vehicles.\O'Dell said it's important for the state also to promote the usage of non-fossil fuels, the idea behind tax credits.\""It's going to help the environment as well as make us more self-sufficient in our usage of power,"" he said.\Bill Ross, executive director of the South Carolina Alliance To Fix Our Roads, said lawmakers have to address the issue of vehicles with alternative fuels because their numbers will only increase.\""I don't think you have much choice in the long run,"" he said of fees. ""Because we're going to continue to see more and more alternative vehicles and you're going to see a continued decline in the use of motor fuel.""\""People who are using electric cars get to ride the roads for free. That doesn't sound fair. Of course, everybody wants somebody else to pay for it.""\Sen. Ray Cleary, Georgetown Republican"
50,"CAPITAL BUREAU\tcsmith@greenvillenews.com\COLUMBIA -- Financial problems at the state Department of Transportation are slicing roadwork, and things could get worse later this year, state highway commissioners say.\But a spokesman for Gov. Mark Sanford said there is no sympathy there for the agency. ""This is exactly what happens when you have a state agency that is in effect, accountable to no one,"" Joel Sawyer said.\""We've argued time and time again that DOT ought to be restructured under the executive branch with some true accountability so people know who to blame when things go awry to this degree.""\Highway Commissioner Bob Harrell Sr., who chairs the board's Finance and Administration Committee, said, ""We are in dire straits; there's no question about that."" He added, ""I don't think I've seen it this bad.""\The giant agency's money woes are the result of a combination of factors, including steep increases in the cost of materials used to build roads, flat revenue from the state's gas tax, and lower-than-anticipated federal highway revenues, said Mo Denny, the agency's chief financial officer. The gas tax hasn't been raised since 1987, he said.\""It's tough and getting tougher,"" Denny said.\John Simpkins, a Charleston College of Law professor, said it will be difficult for the agency to convince lawmakers to give it more money, especially an increase in the gas tax.\""It's a hard sell unless they can demonstrate an immediate need for it,"" he said.\""Investing in infrastructure is an easy thing to ignore because it creeps up on you and you don't know it's in a crisis mode sometimes until it's too late. Especially in the current legislative environment where they aren't interested in any revenue-raising measures, this will be a very difficult case to make to the Legislature.""\Denny said DOT has had to cut back on contract lettings for transportation projects.\""We have deferred some lettings based on safety and preservation,"" he said. ""What that says is new road activity will not go for a while. People are going to say, 'When is that going to happen?' That's the question I can't answer at this time.""\Some highway commissioners want help from the Legislature.\But Sawyer, the governor's spokesman, said the agency's spending argues against any increased gas taxes, including its purchase last year of SUVs for top executives and payments to one commissioner of $90,000 over several years to write letters on behalf of Executive Director Betty Mabry.\""The fact that it appears that DOT has squandered boatloads of money, and the knee-jerk reaction is to give them more is baffling,"" he said. ""I'd say $2,300 running boards (for the SUVs) and $90,000 letter writers certainly fit the definition of appearance of squandering.""\Six of the agency's seven board members are appointed by the Legislature. The governor appoints its chairman.\The board is responsible for overseeing a $1.2 billion budget and more than 5,000 employees. Almost all of the agency's revenues come from the federal government and fuel taxes, not state general fund dollars.\Sen. Greg Ryberg, chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee and a candidate for state treasurer, said he is skeptical of the timing because the Senate is about to begin debating the budget. He said no one from the agency has told him DOT is facing financial hard times.\""My frustration is this is a stand-alone agency that has very little oversight from the General Assembly, and it has a huge impact on the economics of South Carolina,"" he said. ""There is a lack of communication between the agency and the General Assembly.""\House Speaker Bobby Harrell Jr., son of the highway commissioner, said he hasn't talked recently with his father about the issue but is aware of the agency's problems.\""It just plain costs more to build roads with higher petroleum prices,"" he said. ""I think it's time for House and Senate leadership and the Governor's Office to sit down with the commissioners and figure out what we need to do to solve the problem.""\Harrell, who authored legislation last year to send some vehicle fees to DOT, said it may be possible to dedicate similar revenue streams, such as the sales tax on cars, to the agency. He said the Legislature could also make a line item in the budget for DOT. He doesn't believe any increase in the gas tax would fly.\DOT Chairman Tee Hooper, a Greenville businessman who was appointed by Sanford last year, predicted difficult times ahead.\""I think the agency is in for a very tough period, cash-flow wise,"" he said. ""I'm concerned that DOT over-committed (to projects) during the last several years, and it's going to come back to be a problem the next 18-24 months.""\Like many state transportation agencies, South Carolina's DOT carries out projects over a span of years. Timing the number and phases of projects is key to making the revenue match the expenses.\Denny, who took over the financial helm of DOT in January, told the board this week the agency's treasury has fluctuated in wide swings this year, from a low of $29 million to a high of $190 million.\Many states, he said, try to keep 60 to 90 days of their cash outlay needs on hand. South Carolina currently has about 30 days' worth but has been as low as a week's worth.\Other states also are going through cash crunches, Denny said, including Virginia, which also has curbed projects.\Denny said he doesn't know how many lettings will be delayed or when the agency can approach its normal work schedule. Priority will be given to projects that need resurfacing for safety reasons or the replacement of bridges ""in dire need.""\He said he isn't so concerned about the agency's cash flow as he is about the period after the current fiscal year. Summer is when contractors generally accelerate their work, he said, and their bills follow.\""I'm getting more concerned about the August-September time frame and then going into next year and the following year,"" he told commissioners. ""It is a real concern. We don't have much flexibility.""\He said the agency may have to slow down and delay its payments to contractors to keep adequate money in the treasury. He said construction payments have been much higher than anticipated, in part because of rising fuel costs.\Harrell Sr. said, ""I think it's time to say to the Legislature, 'Listen guys, you control the money. What do you want us to do?\""We have a group across the street that expects us to run a highway system, and they expect us to run it on 1987 dollars. It's our job to make it known in spades that we can't do that. The time has come when that simply has to change.""\He said the condition of the state's roads demand some change.\""It's tearing people's tires up,"" he said. ""It's knocking alignment out. It's causing wrecks. We have the deadliest secondary roads in the nation and have had since I can remember.

WASHINGTON -- The House on Friday overwhelmingly passed legislation to salvage 2.8 million jobs, mostly in construction, and forestall a sharp increase in interest rates on college loans.
\
The measure cleared the House on a 373-52 vote and Senate approval was expected shortly. The compromise legislation came as lawmakers scurried toward a Fourth of July recess. The bill also aims at shoring up the federal flood insurance program.
\
The bill would spend more than $100 billion on highway and transit programs over two years. And it would also prevent a doubling of interest rates on new student loans, which was scheduled to go into effect Sunday.
\
A deal clearing the way for passage of the bill was reached after Republicans gave up their demands that the bill require approval of the contentious Keystone XL pipeline and Democrats gave way on environment protections.
\
The development came amid a legislative session that has brought considerable scorn to the institution as a ""do-nothing"" Congress.
\
The burst of legislating comes just four months before the November elections, giving lawmakers achievements to show off to voters who have increasingly held Congress in low esteem.
\
""It's a jobs bill,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who led Senate negotiations on the transportation portion of the package. She estimated the bill would save about 1.8 million jobs by keeping aid for highway and transit construction flowing to states and create another 1 million jobs by using federal loan guarantees to leverage private sector investment in infrastructure projects.
\
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., didn't wait for final passage of the measure to claim credit for a share of those jobs. A statement issued Thursday by his office touted the $400 million in transportation aid Montana would receive and the 13,500 highway jobs in his state the money would support.
\
""I worked hard to make sure Montana had a seat at the table and I'm proud that we were able to get the job done for Montana families,"" Baucus said.
\
In the bargaining that led up to an agreement on the package earlier this week, House Republicans gave up their demands that the bill require approval of the contentious Keystone XL oil pipeline and block federal regulation of toxic waste generated by coal-fired power plants. Democrats gave ground on environmental protections and biking, pedestrian and safety programs.
\
""Critical reforms in this legislation consolidate our transportation programs, significantly streamline the bureaucratic project process, encourage private sector participation in building infrastructure and give states more flexibility to spend limited highway ... resources where they are most needed,"" said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
\
The bill consolidates transportation programs and reduces the number of programs by two-thirds. It also revamps rules on environmental studies of the potential impact of highway projects, with an aim toward cutting in half the time it takes to complete construction projects. And the measure contains an array of safety initiatives, including requirements that would make it more likely passengers would survive a tour bus crash.
\
But Democrats and Republicans also found plenty to criticize in the transportation deal.
\
""At least it's not as bad as our Republican colleagues wanted,"" complained Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., who has champion bike and pedestrian programs. ""But make no mistake, it is not a bill to be proud of.""
\
The bill would spend about $100 billion on federal highway programs over two years, but puts off the politically tricky decision on how to pay for them after that. The federal 18.4 cent-a-gallon gasoline and 24.4 cent-a-gallon diesel taxes are no longer enough to pay for current spending on highway and transit programs. And two commissions and an array of private sector experts have said the U.S. should be spending about twice as much or more on its transportation infrastructure as it does now.
\
But Congress and the White House have refused to discuss raising fuel taxes or an alternative long-term source of money. The federal trust funds that pay for highway and transit programs are forecast to be nearly broke by the time the bill expires.
\
""When the bill expires we face a high cliff from which the program could fall,"" said Erich Zimmerman, a policy analyst with Taxpayers for Common Sense.
\
The fuel taxes are not indexed for inflation and haven't been increased since 1993, so their buying power has steadily eroded. Also, cars and trucks today are more fuel efficient and the number of miles driven has flattened, resulting in less gas tax revenue. Since 2008, Congress has three times dipped into the national general treasury to borrow a total of $34.5 billion to keep transportation programs going.
\
Congressional leaders decided to roll the transportation and student loan legislation into a single bill because, in the short term, they were both being paid in part by changes in pension laws.
\
Congressional bargainers reached an agreement earlier this week on the $6 billion college loan portion of that bill that would avert a doubling of interest rates beginning Sunday on federal loans to 7.4 million students. The current 3.4 percent interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans would balloon back to 6.8 percent on Sunday under a cost-saving maneuver contained in a 2007 law.
\
The bill also extends the federal flood insurance program to protect 5.6 million households and businesses. It addresses a shortfall arising from claims after 2005's Hurricane Katrina by reducing insurance subsidies for vacation homes and allowing for increases in premiums.

52,"CAPITAL BUREAU\tcsmith@greenvillenews.com\COLUMBIA -- The state Department of Transportation, already struggling with cash problems, faces a 22 percent drop in revenue beginning next summer, a DOT official told highway commissioners Thursday.\Commissioners said the agency needs more money that can only come from the Legislature, but efforts to get that have failed.\""I think the mindset over there is, 'You're not going to get a damn thing,'"" said a frustrated Commissioner Bobby Jones, who said he has repeatedly tried to persuade legislators of the need for more money. ""It's kind of doom and gloom.""\Mo Denny, the agency's chief financial officer, told commissioners the agency expects to get $1 billion at most during the fiscal year that begins in July 2007, down from an expected $1.286 billion for the fiscal year beginning this July.\Commissioner Bob Harrell Sr., whose son is speaker of the House, said the agency needs a plan to sell legislators next year. Commissioners suggested getting a public relations firm to help.\""We need a vision,"" said Harrell, who chairs the board's finance and administration committee. ""We need a plan to get out of this mess.""\DOT Executive Director Betty Mabry said she intends to share her vision for the agency at the commissioner's next meeting.\""I don't think we have a mess,"" she said. ""We've done a tremendous amount of work. We've hit hard times we've got to get past.""\Steve Benjamin, a board member of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, said lawmakers should take action.\""I think we should do whatever it takes to be sure we have a competitive business environment here, which means we've got to support our transportation infrastructure,"" he said.\Flat fuel-tax revenues, lower-than-expected federal highway funding and higher construction prices caused by the increase in petroleum-based materials have contributed to the agency's money woes, officials have said.\DOT Chairman Tee Hooper said last month he believes another reason is that the agency overcommitted to road projects.\But some lawmakers and officials with the Governor's Office have also been critical of DOT's spending, most recently a $23 million, five-year consultant contract for management services.\They also have noted the past purchase of SUVs for top agency officials and payment to Jones of $90,000 over several years to write letters for Mabry, as examples of questionable spending.\""We don't think it makes sense to give more money to an agency that is accountable to no one,"" said Joel Sawyer, a spokesman for Gov.

WASHINGTON -- Driving onto an Interstate highway? Crossing a bridge on the way into work? Taking a tunnel under a river or bay? Get ready to pay.
\
With Congress unwilling to contemplate an increase in the federal gas tax, motorists are likely to be paying ever more tolls as the government searches for ways to repair and expand the nation's congested highways.
\
Tolling is less efficient and sometimes can seem less fair than the main alternative, gasoline taxes. It can increase traffic on side roads as motorists seek to evade paying. Some tolling authorities -- often quasi-governmental agencies operating outside the public eye -- have been plagued by mismanagement. And some public-private partnerships to build toll roads have drowned in debt because of too-rosy revenue predictions.
\
Tolls are hardly a perfect solution. But to many states and communities, they're the best option available.
\
""It's very hard in this environment for states to add capacity without charging a toll because they can't afford to do it,"" said Joshua Schank, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington think tank. ""They're barely able to maintain what they've got, and there is an urgent need for capacity.""
\
Some changes already are under way
\
In addition to the tolls allowed on Interstates in 15 states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, the U.S. has agreed to pilot toll projects on Interstate 95 in Virginia and North Carolina and on Interstate 70 in Missouri.
\
A commission created by Congress to recommend ways to pay for upkeep of the nation's transportation system predicted in 2009 that the U.S. will face nightmarish congestion unless it spends more. The commission estimated all levels of government were spending a cumulative $137 billion less each year than is necessary to maintain and expand the current system. Without action, there will be a $2 trillion-plus backlog by 2035, it said.
\
It's been nearly two decades since Congress last increased the federal gas and diesel taxes that have historically paid for highways. Meanwhile, the cost of road and bridge construction has gone up and the purchasing power of fuel taxes has declined by more than a third. Revenue is also down because people have been driving less due to the uncertain economy and because cars are becoming more fuel-efficient.
\
Federal and state fuel tax revenues peaked in 2007 at $72.4 billion, then dropped to $68.6 billion in 2010, the most recent year for which data are available. Meanwhile, state toll collections rose from $4.9 billion in 2000 to $8.9 billion in 2010, and locally administered tolls rose from $1.6 billion in 2000 to $2.5 billion in 2009.
\
The trust fund that pays for federal highway programs is forecast to go broke sometime next year, though the House and Senate are trying to negotiate a bill to shore up the funding and overhaul transportation programs. It's unclear whether they'll reach a deal, but if they do, it's likely to contain only a short-term financial fix. That means lawmakers will be back again, scratching for more.
\
Tolling is the easiest near-term way to pay the bills, says Robert Atkinson, who chaired the financing commission. ""If you could allow modest tolling on Interstates, you could raise a lot of money,"" he said.
\
Fifteen states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, that had turnpikes before the 1956 advent of the Interstate system have grandfathered permission to collect tolls on 2,900 miles of the 47,000-mile system. But federal restrictions prevent other states from placing tolls on federal-aid highways except in limited circumstances.
\
States want Congress to increase their ability to charge tolls and to allow them to use the money for a variety of transportation needs -- not just upkeep of the roads where tolls are collected, said Eugene Conti, North Carolina's transportation secretary, at a Senate hearing last month.
\
But states also have a history of slapping tolls on roads traveled by a large share of out-of-state motorists. When Pennsylvania applied to put tolls on Interstate 80, a route favored by truckers, the federal government rejected the plan partly because some of the money raised would have gone to support public transit in Philadelphia, even though the highway doesn't touch the city's metro area. In 2004, Chicago leased its Skyway, an eight-mile road and bridge, to a private toll operator for 99 years in exchange for $1.8 billion that was used to pay off city debt. The resulting toll increases fell heavily on Indiana commuters who use the road to get to jobs in Chicago.
\
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has introduced a bill to give the secretary of transportation oversight of tolling practices. The financing commission made a similar recommendation.
\
What to do about tolling isn't addressed in the highway bill now before Congress because of a standoff earlier this year between senators who favor and oppose easing tolling on Interstate highways. The issue is expected to be revived next year after the retirement of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has led the opposition to greater tolling.
\
One concern is that the Interstate system is aging, which means money must be found to repair and replace the roads.
\
""The roads are out there and we've paid off the mortgage, but that doesn't mean the system is paid for. ... Now the roads are crumbling and we have to upgrade them,"" said Patrick Jones, executive director of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, which represents toll facilities.
\
Some relaxation of the ban is in the works. The Transportation Department has selected the three states -- Virginia, North Carolina and Missouri -- for pilot toll projects.
\
A $2 billion project now under way would add High Occupancy Toll lanes on Interstate 495 in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. The state can't afford to build the lanes on its own, but money raised by a private investment partnership and a $586 million federal loan made the project possible.
\
Motorists who buy an E-ZPass that can be read electronically will be able use the lanes. Toll prices will fluctuate depending on traffic density. If toll lanes are crowded, prices will keep rising until enough motorists decide to remain in the slower lanes. The aim is to give motorists a way to travel quickly, but only if they are willing to pay for it -- an idea that has stirred controversy. Cars with three or more passengers will be able to use the lanes without paying.
\
The administrative costs of tolling are far greater than the gas tax, even when using electronic tolling, said Phineas Baxandall, a senior analyst with the private, consumer-oriented U.S. PIRG.
\
Some tolling agencies could also use ""a dose of sunshine,"" Baxandall said. Because many are quasi-governmental, public disclosure, open meeting and other transparency rules don't always apply, he said. As a result, they frequently operate out of public sight, creating opportunities for corruption or manipulation by industry, he said.
\
A report by the New Jersey comptroller in March said cronyism and mismanagement at the Delaware River Port Authority had wasted millions of dollars. The authority operates four bridges, a ferry and a rail line across the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
\
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey recently raised cash fares on six Interstate bridges and tunnels to $12 for cars. By 2015, it will cost a five-axle truck paying cash $105 to cross between New York and New Jersey, three times as much as for any other bridge or tunnel in the country, according to the American Trucking Association. Bill Baroni, the authority's deputy executive director, told a Senate hearing the fare hikes are necessary to make up for years of neglect and mismanagement.
\
Despite concerns about more and higher tolls, it's difficult for lawmakers to tell state and local governments not to pursue greater tolling when Congress isn't providing a comparable alternative source of funds.
\
Jones, of the tolling industry association, predicted that as traffic congestion worsens, people ""are going to demand, 'We need better roads, we need more efficiency,' and they are going to ask for tolling and direct user fees to build the transportation that they need.""

54,"
The United States has begun diplomatic talks with Iran in hopes of ending that nation's dangerous quest for a nuclear weapon. But the effort is unlikely to succeed unless the U.S. makes some major changes in its own behavior.
\
President Obama has promised ""sanctions that bite"" if Iran fails to abandon nuclear activities as ordered by the United Nations Security Council. China and Russia are critical to this strategy, however, and they appear to oppose harsh sanctions on Iran.
\
One potential brake on Iran's ambitions doesn't require Russian and Chinese cooperation -- keeping the price of oil at or below the current level of around $70 a barrel.
\
Saudi Arabia fears Iran and has large oil reserves. It can help stabilize the price of oil if the Obama administration takes steps to maintain the value of the dollar. Typically, oil prices go up when the dollar goes down. In the last eight months the dollar has steadily lost value and oil prices have risen from $45 to $70 a barrel -- with a predicted price of $90 by year's end.
\
According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran's government needs an export oil price of $90 to $95 a barrel to pay for its spending program, including its nuclear initiative. At lower prices, Iran is forced to make difficult choices. Sanctions aim at the same effect.
\
Stopping the slide of the dollar requires stopping the steep ascent in federal spending. Current spending projections would require a significant tax increase to keep the dollar stable. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman argues that a gas tax could cut oil imports, reduce the deficit and help the environment.
\
Supporting the dollar, however, doesn't depend on a gas tax. It does depend on stopping America's fiscal bleeding. If Washington doesn't shift gears to prevent a further fall in the dollar, the price of oil will continue to rise and more money will go to Iran, Venezuela and other nations with which the U.S. has fundamental differences. Ultimately, it might take military action to stop an Iranian bomb.
\
Maybe halting the dollar's fall won't slow Iran's nuclear program, given the fanaticism of some of its leaders. In any case, Americans face a simple decision: Decrease federal spending plans or increase the risk of a nuclear-armed Iran.
\
The right choice should be obvious.

His age (he'll be 77 in March), a wife and 19 grandchildren are among the factors in his exit. Plus, he represents one of the largest districts in the Legislature, stretching 100 miles from Mount Pleasant to the Grand Strand. It's getting too tough to drive it.
\
Falling asleep at the wheel after an all-nighter at the Statehouse was a wake-up call. He found himself in a wheat field.
\
He said his wife told him, ""Arthur, you really need to hang it up.""
\
Friends say they can't imagine a Charleston political scene without ""Cousin Arthur."" From a career that began in the state House of Representatives in the early 1950s, Ravenel fought to protect the environment, worked to halt expansion of the Port of Charleston and sought to preserve endangered black homesteads in the Lowcountry while at the same timedefending the Confederate flag.
\
The new Cooper River bridge will be named in his honor after Ravenel returned to the Legislature in 1996 on a promise to get the effort moving. It had virtually stalled under a handful of governors.
\
Ravenel tried his own run for governor in 1994, but he lost the GOP nomination to David Beasley.
\
Born in Charleston, Ravenel became a Republican in 1960, four years before Strom Thurmond. At a GOP rally in Walterboro in 1964 for presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, Ravenel broke the news to the 300 people in attendance that Thurmond had joined the Republican Party.
\
""The crowd went wild,"" he said.
\
State Rep. Jim Merrill, R-Daniel Island, called Ravenel his political mentor and said he is one of a kind.
\
""There's only two or three real characters in the Legislature,"" he said. ""The rest of us are in danger of becoming little drones. It's bad when you lose people like Arthur."" Merrill managed Ravenel's gubernatorial bid.
\
Democratic state Sen. Kay Patterson of Columbia was a freshman senator in 1985 and sat next to Ravenel on the Senate's back row.
\
""Arthur would start talking, and I wouldn't know what the hell he was talking about, with his accent,"" Patterson said. ""I hate him to leave the Senate, because I definitely will miss him.""
\
After serving in both the state House and Senate, Ravenel won a seat in Congress in 1986, representing Charleston's 1st Congressional District. During his eight years in Washington, Ravenel seldom introduced legislation and said that as a member of the GOP minority during the 1980s, his main emphasis was on constituent service.
\
But he did go toe-to-toe with other Republicans, threatening to bolt to the Democratic Party if he didn't get a prized seat on the Merchant Marine Committee that an Alaska lawmaker was blocking. After GOP strategist and South Carolina native Lee Atwater intervened, the appointment quickly came through.
\
Friends describe Ravenel's political skills as ""dumb like a fox.""
\
After losing out in the 1994 GOP race for governor, Ravenel came back and ran for an East Cooper seat in the Legislature on a promise to get the bridge replacement project going. He and Mount Pleasant Mayor Harry Hallman came up with the idea of creating a state-run infrastructure bank to help finance major road projects of $100 million or more, projects that the Department of Transportation otherwise couldn't handle.
\
Under the plan, the state created an investment bank funded by state gas-tax money and trucking fees. It gave the state access to almost $1 billion in borrowing power. Money from the bank helped projects in Conway, Hilton Head, York County, Greenville, and it also aided the Cooper River bridge replacement.
\
Local communities had to provide matching funds, but lawmakers backed the plan because of its equal emphasis on statewide needs.
\
""It's been a great success,"" Ravenel said.
\
A political slip came during a pro-Confederate flag rally at the Statehouse in 2000 when Ravenel called the NAACP the ""the National Association for Retarded People,"" angering black lawmakers and causing some to question whether it was right to name the bridge after him.
\
Ravenel apologized only to people with mental and physical conditions and said his mistake was that he mixed up his words because he was thinking of another meeting he was scheduled to attend. Ravenel is the father of a son with Down syndrome.
\
The NAACP is not made up of retarded people, said Ravenel, but he remained defiant. ""No apologies to the NAACP or the national NAACP,"" he said.
\
One reason for Ravenel's exit is that his East Cooper Senate District 34 is about to shift its population center northward into the Grand Strand. When the legislative remap was being done this year, Ravenel voluntarily gave up Republican neighborhoods to help make the districts of Sens. John Kuhn, R-Charleston, and Larry Grooms, R-Berkeley, safer GOP seats.
\
Some names have surfaced as possible successors, but the only Republican to announce is Ray Cleary, a Surfside Beach dentist. Filing for the seat won't open until next spring.
\
Ravenel said he joined the GOP early in his career because ""the Democrats were moving continuously to the left. A lot of folks were getting sick of one-party rule.""
\
After politics, Ravenel said he plans to spend more time traveling and working on his farm in Hell Hole Swamp, northwest of Charleston. He also will monitor his son Thomas' GOP run for the U.S. Senate next year. The younger Ravenel is also a developer.
\
Ravenel has a ton of political stories to tell, but notes that one of his favorites is a conversation he had in 1992 at the Flowertown Festival in Summerville. He was chatting with Thurmond, waiting for U.S. Sen. Fritz Hollings to arrive.
\
Thurmond said, ""Arthur, is there something I can do for you?""
\
Ravenel answered ""When I die, will you say a few nice things at my funeral?""
\
Thurmond, who was about 90 at the time, looked at Ravenel and dead-panned ""Arthur, I'd be happy to do that.""

Terror foretold
\
The 9/11 Commission has finished its report, and the recommendations reported in the media seem eminently sensible. It was heartening to see that a commission representing both parties could put political differences aside to provide a service to the country. The major criticism of both the Clinton and Bush administrations was a lack of imagination. During the course of the commission hearings, some testified that no one could have foretold the manner in which the 9/11 attacks were performed.
\
In ""The Fourth World War,"" a book published in 1992, Alexandre de Marenches noted that terrorism would be the major weapon against us in what he called the Fourth World War, what we now call the war on terrorism.
\
He predicted the major problems would be Libya, Syria, Iran, North Korea and Iraq. He noted the great number of foreign nationals in the United States performing jobs such as driving taxis and noted also that the government had no idea who they were. He also noted American intelligence was defective and ""at the heart of this failure is the inability of the top leadership of the United States government to understand what the intelligence community is reporting -- what it all means.""
\
Finally, he wrote that ""the Americans, until now, have led a relatively charmed and sheltered existence,"" also noting his ""certainty that international terrorism will find its way to their shores."" He envisioned that a taxicab loaded with explosives could be a lethal weapon. The conclusion of his book was the warning that what he called ""the Decent Peoples' Club"" (essentially the NATO nations) must cooperate and share intelligence.
\
All one had to do was read a book, and the above information was there. I have been astonished for some time that our government and intelligence agencies could not ""connect the dots"" as De Marenches did over a decade ago. We must demand more imagination from our leaders, and they should be accountable if they don't demonstrate that imagination; not only in the war on terrorism but also for the burgeoning national debt, Medicare, Social Security and preserving a decent environment for our grandchildren.
\
A final note: De Marenches is French.

Liberal bias
\
As a concerned American, serving in the military in Iraq, I am compelled to speak out on the issue of liberal bias in the mainstream media. Despite the fact that the country is evenly divided, Democrat and Republican, the vast majority of network newscasters and major newspaper editors identify themselves as Democrats. This often lends itself to a subtle but very real slant to the left in story selection and news presentation.
\
Liberals, whose beliefs are validated, refuse to acknowledge this, but more centrist observers are aware of the bias. Conservatives have, therefore, to the indignation of the left, turned to talk radio and Fox News. While neither side has a monopoly on the truth, conservatives are at least more honest that their preferred medium is a counterbalance to the inherent unfairness in the mainstream media.
\
Another related matter of concern is the effect of the leftist culture of Hollywood and the entertainment industry in general, country music excluded. Consider that in the Soviet model of communism, artists and entertainers were to be among the privileged class. In my opinion, many ""stars"" have been seduced into an elitist mindset that they, like the Bolsheviks, should not be subject to the same sacrifices as the common people. An example would be Barbra Streisand's advice to Californians about energy conservation that she had no intention of practicing herself.
\
Being a ""star"" does not necessarily mean someone is a deeply intelligent thinker. I remember during the Cold War, folk singer Joan Baez saying that if the Russians landed on the beach, she would greet them with a cup of tea. Obviously it is up to the common sense people to protect her kind from enslavement or death.
\
Unfortunately, President Bush has made some military miscalculations and political mistakes as to the premise for the war in Iraq. For that there is no excuse and he must be held accountable. Morally, however, most soldiers agree with the need for a global war on terrorism and in helping the Iraqi people.
\
Many of us are, therefore, offended by Al Franken, Sean Penn, Whoopi Goldberg and others of their ilk. Even more contemptible is Michael Moore, whose presentation of a series of partial truths in ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" combined with his dubious assumptions of presidential motives, amounts to nothing less than bearing false witness. Moore says that Americans are the dumbest people on the planet? He is apparently counting on that by trying to use this propaganda to manipulate the electorate.
\
Whereas these people certainly have the right to passionately oppose the president politically, they are hypocrites. Why is their moral outrage not focused against Islamic terrorists who murder Americans and peaceful Muslims alike? Perhaps these people could use their star power to rally the civilized world to support us American soldiers in winning this war so that we can return home to share in the freedom that they already enjoy.

No rate increase
\
Help! We the people of McClellanville and others in northern Charleston County are being held hostage. We are hostage to a for- profit, private company that has governmental authority to impose a monopoly on us.
\
SCE&G was ""given"" a long, narrow stretch of northern Charleston County as part of their service area. It serves this area with a long, single, dead-end line. The result is a ridiculously poor level of service with long and frequent outages, as well as repeated spikes and dimming. Since moving into my new home in November of last year, we have had a number of outages, including an eight-hour outage on the coldest night of the year and a 14-hour outage on July 4 and 5. The frequent spikes and dimming contribute to short life spans for electric motors in appliances and other equipment.
\
I know what you are thinking; it must be too difficult to serve this remote town. Apparently not. Berkeley Electric Cooperative serves all the area around the town, most of which is very remote, with a looped system. Their customers suffer far fewer outages and less spikes and dimming. Why doesn't SCE&G just let BEC serve this area? The answer is that SCE&G is a private, for-profit company that does not want to give up any service area, reducing profit.
\
Weren't the service districts created by our government to ensure the citizens would be given the best possible service? Apparently not. It seems to have just given a private company the right to an area with no threat of competition and, therefore, no motivation to improve service. The only check in the system is that SCE&G has to ask the Public Service Commission for permission to raise rates as it is currently doing.
\
We as a community are asking the commissioners of the PSC to deny the rate increase and demand that SCE&G work with BEC to improve its level of service, even if it means buying power, or sharing territories. We are also asking others dissatisfied with their service not only to speak out but also to start keeping a detailed log of all flickers, dims, spikes and outages. These problems could be damaging your home. Not only do you have the right to better service, you have the right to be compensated for damage caused by flaws in their system.

Market parking
\
Greetings from Charleston, S.C., voted the most polite city. We are as polite to each other as we are to the visitors. Of course we are! Perhaps we need to re-examine our title. You be the judge.
\
I have been a merchant in the Charleston Market for almost 29 years. We have had many wonderful people who have worked and sold their products there. We worked together for mutual benefits. Times change.
\
A major problem has arisen. The problem is parking around the market, the metered spaces and the loading zone. I know when I mention handicapped parking I hit a sore spot. It has taken many years to secure this privilege, and we certainly do not wish to lose it because of a few who abuse it. However, certain people use this privilege to unload their merchandise and then remain parked there all day, thus disallowing others the ability to unload conveniently.
\
Let me inject that there are some people who truly need this service. They have problems that require this privilege. Some block the needy ones out.
\
We have other parking problems, too. There are those who feed the meter all day and no one else can get close enough to unload without double parking or walking extra distance.
\
In case you are wondering, yes, I have a handicap tag. I had polio as a child. Since I have gotten older I, too, have had to use one. However, I am very fortunate to have a husband who takes me to the market, unloads me, and then returns later in the day to load my merchandise and take me home. One little problem, a van with a handicapped placard has my area blocked. Where is the owner? In a shop a block away or at a table half a building away?
\
What can be done? The golden rule would be nice. Have we forgotten to consider others? Perhaps the city might consider making the whole area a loading zone with restrictions. That way at least all people would have the availability of use of the area. Help.

Drivers are at fault
\
On July 17, The Post and Courier ran a letter written by the president of the S.C. Transportation Policy and Research Council about the condition of S.C. roads and the need for funding to improve these roads. As the founder and chair of the Concerned Citizens of Highway 162, I have heard this argument many times before.
\
But how can you determine whether the cause of an accident is the road or the driver?
\
According to the S.C. Department of Public Safety, in 2002 there were a total of over 107,000 accidents in South Carolina. Of those, 97,462 (91 percent) were determined to be caused by the driver. Less than 1 percent of South Carolina's accidents were determined to be caused by the roadway. Other causes involved non-motorists (0.7 percent), the environment (5.2 percent) and vehicle malfunction (2 percent).
\
The president of the S.C. Transportation Policy and Research Council should know these statistics. An additional gas tax for the purposes of improving road safety is unnecessary. Our roads aren't the main cause of accidents in South Carolina. According to the S.C. DPS, our drivers are.
\
I mostly hear the safety argument always followed by someone associated with the S.C. Department of Transportation saying roads have to be four-laned to be safer. Why does the emphasis always have to be on construction?
\
Repeatedly, residents along Highway 162 have begged DOT to make our road safer by lowering and enforcing the speed limit, putting in a stop light, adding a turning lane, etc. -- to no avail. These methods are known to work, and don't cost a lot. Certainly not enough for a new gas tax.

Bush party line
\
I am writing in response to the July 20 letter concerning the ""self-absorbed, whining, Bush-haters."" The state of America's economy, health care and the funding of our children's education the writer describes as part of our self-absorption is President Bush's job.
\
The fact that President Bush is sending more than $100 billion in aid to Iraq instead of using those funds to bolster our economy, finance our health care and fund the education of our children shows that he is not doing a very good job at all.
\
Say what you will about our president freeing millions of souls from oppressive regimes, but, if you would do a little research, you would find that our initial reaction to 9/11 was to go after the responsible terrorist cells, not capture Saddam Hussein and create a free Iraq. We had no reason to be in Iraq. There was nothing about 9/ 11 to suggest Saddam.
\
Nothing about 9/11 concerned weapons of mass destruction. There are many oppressive regimes in this world. Is the writer saying that post Iraq (if we should ever see the light of day and get out of that country), America should set its sights on ""freeing"" North Korea, Iran, etc. It is not America's job to be the world's police force. America is not the new Rome. Thank God for those ""broad shots"" the writer says these ""whiners"" take at the Bush administration. It is our right as Americans to have a free and open dialogue concerning issues that affect all Americans.
\
And, yes, our lives as Americans are not good enough due to the policies of President Bush and his administration's free and easy way of donating billions to countries like Iraq. I would much rather those American ""whiners"" reveal what's wrong with our government and its current path than blindly follow the party line and President Bush while he espouses his ""Christian"" values simply to influence votes.

Parents' responsibility
\
I would suggest to Rep. Chip Limehouse that his call for legislation mandating background checks for retail employees, as discussed in the July 25 Post and Courier, is grandstanding at best, particularly since there have only been two incidents of apparent molestation over four years in a Wal-Mart chain of over 25,000 employees.
\
What we do need are background checks on the parents who allow their children free rein in these stores and do not have the decency or intelligence to properly supervise them.
\
I can't begin to tell you how many times I've been in a retail store and watched children run amok while their parents choose to ignore their behavior and do not even have the decency to appreciate that everyone in the store does not take kindly to their ranting, raving children.
\
This kind of behavior occurs a lot more than twice over a four- year period, and I do not see why any costs associated with this grandstanding legislation should be costs that I, as a consumer, must pay for. Stop with the legislation and let parents do the job they are supposed to.

Treatment vs. prison
\
Your front-page article ""6.9M Americans behind bars, on probation or parole"" noted that ""many states, faced with budget deficits, have passed new, less strict sentencing laws in an attempt to reduce the number of inmates.""
\
What was left unstated is the fact that a good many of these 6.9 million current and former inmates cost the taxpayers billions of dollars per year. This is, for the most part, a total waste of money and results in really dangerous criminals (murderers, rapists, armed robbers) being released back into society prior to the completion of their court-mandated sentences.
\
Most ""drug-dependent"" criminals pose no threat to society other than the manner in which they obtain their illegal drugs. If these sick individuals were treated for their addiction, rather than incarcerated, our prison population would be reduced significantly. Any person with an illegal drug dependency should be able to obtain that drug from some sort of medical facility, either at cost, or based on one's income. Such a policy (treating drug dependency as a medical problem rather than a criminal offense) would, in a relatively short time, virtually eliminate the illegal drug trade; stop the pay-off of public officials by illegal drug traffickers; greatly reduce illegal drug-related crime; and, most importantly, greatly lower the numbers of our massive prison population.
\
The most disturbing aspect is that our political leaders know very well that the imprisonment of drug users is counterproductive. Politicians, however, will not address this reality because it will result in their losing their next election. As long as the voting public demands incarceration, rather than treatment, for illegal drug users, the politicians will permit the current sorry situation to continue; the related taxes will continue to increase; and addicted inmates released back into their communities without any realistic legal means of supporting themselves -- most likely by stealing from their ""neighbors."" Politicians taking issue with any of the views expressed here will be given the opportunity to debate this issue in a public forum.

It would be hard to overstate the importance of electing members to the General Assembly who will support Gov. Mark Sanford's reorganization plan and the Senate rules changes that will make restructuring possible next session. Voters should select lawmakers committed to a reform agenda that will streamline government by strengthening the Cabinet system. Greater accountability and efficiency hangs in the balance.
\
Senate
\
Our choices for the contested tri-county Senate seats:
\
LARRY GROOMS, a Republican senator from District 37, is a strong supporter of restructuring, and his collegiality should be useful in achieving Senate support.
\
A small businessman, he believes that improved educational opportunities are vital and that a two-cent sales tax proposal could offer both property tax relief and more funding equity for public education statewide.
\
District 37 includes portions of four Lowcountry counties, and contains some of the most important conservation areas in the state, including the ACE Basin and Beidler Forest. He pledges his support for their protection and his Senate committee has a key role in that important goal.
\
GLENN McCONNELL has been the governor's strongest ally in the Senate, and can be expected to use his authority as President Pro Tem and his profound knowledge of Senate procedure to get the rules changes necessary to advance the governor's agenda.
\
He incorporated most of the governor's restructuring plan in a comprehensive bill blocked by a few senators last session and would return to that campaign early next session.
\
A lawyer and businessman, the GOP senator from District 41 supports tort reform, and has been a powerful ally of preserving the state's natural environment. His commitment to reform was tested in the overhaul of the Public Service Commission. His perseverance was key to passage of a comprehensive bill that will provide greater protections for consumers.
\
MAURICE WASHINGTON would bring a fresh perspective to the Senate and should be elected to the District 42 seat. Running as an Independent, he supports economic development and views infrastructure improvements and job creation as keys to fighting poverty. He supports restructuring and cutting the state income tax. He also backs tort reform.
\
The former Charleston city councilman has demonstrated his leadership as chairman of the S.C. State University Board of Trustees, helping to turn its troubled finances around and bringing in new leadership. That experience should help him hit the ground running in Columbia.
\
CHIP CAMPSEN, a Republican and former House member running in District 43, correctly describes the current framework of state government as ""dysfunctional,"" with the governor controlling only about 20 percent of its operations.
\
As former legislative liaison for Gov. Sanford, Mr. Campsen worked to advance his agenda in the Statehouse. He can be expected to do the same in the Senate.
\
Mr. Campsen proved himself in the House as a champion of the environment, sponsoring two vitally important pieces of conservation- related legislation.
\
A lawyer, Mr. Campsen supports tort reform and would like to see more lottery money directed to K-12. Most importantly, he will be a strong supporter of the governor's efforts at reducing waste and duplication.
\
WILLIAM MESCHER, a Republican representing District 44, is former director of the state's Santee Cooper utility.
\
He supports government restructuring and has proved his ability to take a practical look at government and recommend solutions, regardless of their popularity.
\
He sponsored a bill, for example, to eliminate the second medical school, recognizing that this state can ill afford such costly duplication. Similarly, he says the Department of Transportation, which he describes as ""bankrupt,"" needs greater resources and believes a gas tax increase is the only solution.
\
He backs the governor's tort reform and school choice proposals and is particularly proud of his efforts in the Senate to secure all- day kindergarten for early childhood education.
\
House
\
There are contests for only six of the tri-county House seats. Our choices are:
\
GEORGE BAILEY, the incumbent in Dorchester County's District 97, was first elected in 1984. His switch to the GOP this year has provoked Democratic challenges to his credibility. Most haven't stuck. Rep. Bailey acknowledged he allowed a decades-old mistake in his Legislative Manual biography to go uncorrected.
\
Rep. Bailey is a firm ally of Gov. Sanford and his Contract for Change and believes tort reform legislation is an important goal. A contractor, Rep. Bailey cites as one of his accomplishments the strengthened statewide building code. A future goals is to make building inspectors more accountable. During his 18 years of service, Rep. Bailey has proven to be one of the most accessible members of the House, with a strong focus on constituent service.
\
JOSEPH JEFFERSON, a Democrat, is a solid choice to fill a vacant seat in Berkeley's District 102. A retired federal employee who worked in personnel at the Navy Shipyard, his government experience includes congressional staff work, service on the Berkeley County School Board and as a county magistrate. He also is a former state highway commissioner.
\
Improvement in the state's educational system is Mr. Jefferson's prime concern. He wants to see more lottery money put in elementary, middle and high school programs and more teacher aides in the classrooms. He also pledges to work closely with the state Department of Commerce to get more jobs in the upper portion of Berkeley County.
\
CHARLES SMITH, a Georgetown attorney, is active in community affairs and an impressive, articulate contender for the District 108 seat.
\
A Republican, Mr. Smith would be among Gov. Sanford's staunchest allies, describing him as ""a wonderful breath of fresh air in Columbia."" He said he wants to work with the governor to improve state government and already has signed on to the Sanford Contract for Change. Mr. Smith cites government reorganization as the most important issue that will be before the Legislature.
\
The attorney also recognizes the need for tort reform, contending there should be serious penalties for frivolous pleadings. He is a supporter of wetlands protections.
\
SETH WHIPPER, an attorney, is the Democratic incumbent in House Seat 113, Mr. Whipper is a thoughtful member of the House Judiciary Committee who impresses with his studious look at legislation and his willingness to consider all sides of an issue. That willingness resulted in his own change of heart on the way judges are selected. Mr. Whipper said his earlier view that they should be elected has now been modified to a belief that it is the screening process that needs revision. Mr. Whipper has been active legislatively and is most proud of his role in the passage of a predatory lending law. He also was instrumental in legislation that allows retired teachers to draw their retirement and salary if they are willing to teach in areas of particular need.
\
WALLACE SCARBOROUGH, a Republican, is seeking his third term from District 115. An insurance executive, he has paid particular attention to the environment, co-sponsoring the Conservation Bank legislation and working on behalf of the dolphin protection bill. He supports an environmental grand jury, opposes mega-hog farms and helped secure Morris Island lighthouse funds.
\
Mr. Scarborough, who is chairman of the House Banking subcommittee, cites his role in the approval of the Powerball multi- state lottery for South Carolina, which has produced significant additional funds for education. He favors school choice and charter schools, and feels strongly about the need for tort reform.
\
CHARLIE SMITH, a Democrat and the owner of a Charleston real estate service, is trying a second time for the seat from District 119. Mr. Smith, a former vice chairman of the Miami Shore (Fla.) planning board, has an intense interest in government, particularly in its reform.
\
Gov. Sanford is pressing to complete the restructuring started under Gov. Carroll Campbell, and Mr. Smith agrees with the governor on the need for a strong executive.
\
We believe Mr. Smith would be generally less divisive and more supportive than the incumbent of the kind of major government overhaul still needed. He says he is ""ready to work across the aisle with the governor to get the important work of the state done."" Give him a chance.

CORRECTION 6/2/96: The profile of Republican House district 115
\
candidate Bill Klauber in Saturday's Post and Courier contained some
\
incorrect information. Klauber worked 10 years in private industry before
\
becoming a teacher at Trident Tech. Also, his wife, not Klauber, sits on
\
the Roper Lowcountry Medical Associates Board, which is why he said he
\
could not take a public position on the MUSC-Columbia/HCA lease.
\
A political newcomer says he's a better choice than the incumbent in the battle for state House District 115 on James Island.
\
Incumbent Lynn Seithel faces a GOP primary challenge from fellow James Island resident Bill Klauber, a clam farmer and technical college teacher.
\
No Democrats are running for the district, which includes Folly Beach.
\
Klauber
\
Klauber worked 10 years as an industrial engineer for Bosch, but left to go teach at Trident Technical College when his wife's medical practice became prosperous.
\
He wants to go to Columbia as a citizen-legislator and says there are numerous issues he wants to address in the Statehouse and locally. Among them are the environment, education, filling vacant businesses on Folly Road and boosting the Port of Charleston.
\
Improving water quality standards is one area he favors. ""No wetlands (means) no seafood and, I might add, no restaurants selling seafood in this district,"" he said when he announced his candidacy at Bushy's Restaurant.
\
As a lawmaker, he said he would be involved in ""cold calling"" businesspeople to try to get them to fill the vacant building space on Folly Road, which is being left open even as construction is going on.
\
He also said the S.C. education system needs to get back to basics, but with special emphasis on computers. He said even with the extra cost it would be worth it in the long run to educate South Carolina school children to handle the career demands of the next century.
\
He favors keeping the low-level nuclear waste dump at Barnwell open only to South Carolina- generated waste.
\
Seithel
\
Seithel, the Republican whip for the Charleston County delegation, said she wants another term to continue building on her support of tax relief, welfare reform and truth-in-sentencing.
\
She was perhaps best-known for leading the fight to get the Legislature to investigate the proposed lease agreement between the Medical University of South Carolina and Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.
\
She voted against it last week, saying it would give Columbia/ HCA a monopoly on pricing of services that can't be obtained in other parts of the state. She also was concerned about the future of state employees at MUSC, whose jobs might be in jeopardy if drastic cost-cutting occurs.
\
Seithel also was one of the few members of the Charleston County legislative delegation to publicly condemn the planned toll road and expressway across John's Island to Kiawah and Seabrook islands, citing heavy resident opposition.
\
""Even though it wasn't in my district, I knew what it is like over there,"" she said, adding that more than 2,000 residents were opposed and the road would have led to large-scale intrusion into wetlands.
\
She also got passed a bill that would allow the fines imposed for cruelty to animals to go to all local humane societies that help in prosecuting cases. Previously the money went solely to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, she said.
\
Seithel favors closing the Barnwell dump.
\
Klauber questions for Seithel
\
You say you are for property tax reform. But last year, you voted against the Republican-crafted property tax reduction plan when you voted against the final appropriations budget. Why?
\
Seithel said she is for property tax relief, but she voted against the final budget plan because the budget changed in conference committee and increased state spending by $110 million. It also reopened the low-level hazardous waste dump at Barnwell.
\
You voted against the House plan to reduce car and vehicle property taxes for all S.C. drivers by increasing the gas tax a penny. Why?
\
Seithel said she is against tax increases and Gov. David Beasley says he would veto an increase in the gas tax. ""As a fiscal conservative I support the governor on that issue,"" she said.
\
Seithel questions for Klauber
\
Education improvement and fighting crime have been my top two priorities. What are yours?
\
Economics and education. Klauber says South Carolina is growing, but James Island and Folly Beach are receding. Says we need to stop megastores and focus on small-business development. Education must return to the basics.
\
I support a two-thirds supermajority before any tax increase can be passed at any level of government. Do you?
\
Klauber supports supermajorities and ballot referendums on taxes at the state level. Says the Statehouse should not tell James Island and Folly Beach how to run local government.

A plan needed
\
Even God has only one set of rules for everyone. That example appears to be lost on the state Office of Coastal Resource Management (OCRM).
\
There are 26 homes/lots on the northeast end of Sullivan's Island from Station 28 1/2 to Breach Inlet. Twenty-one have rock walls, sandbags or vertical seawalls. Five have no protection from storm-driven tides.
\
We have been ordered to remove the ribbon of small rocks from under the footprint of our home. The rocks which are covered with sand and vegetation provide protection for our home and in no way interfere with the public use of the beach. This property has been in our family since the '50s. We have put our hearts and souls into our home, hosting uncountable family celebrations for decades.
\
When we purchased a permit to restore after Hurricane Hugo we assumed that permit meant we would be afforded all the liberties implied, certainly the right to protect our home from disaster.
\
Instead, the beachfront laws were written to favor removal of the first line of homes on the beach. In fact, one of the boldly stated goals is ""to begin a gradual retreat from the shoreline."" Furthermore, the Blue Ribbon Committee Report of 1987 states that homeowners on the beachfront should not expect to be in their homes more than 30 years. Astonishing isn't it?
\
We are weary from decades of legal battles. Sullivan's Island and her residents need a hero.
\
Surely there is someone in authority who can declare a moratorium on the insanity, demand a fresh look and rewrite the law to apply evenly.
\
Either come up with a plan/design to allow homeowners the right to protect our homes on our own property at our own expense or require every rock, every vertical seawall and every sandbag to be removed including the huge rock wall abutting and protecting the Breach Inlet Bridge.

Amazing group
\
Meals On Wheels of Summerville celebrated its 29th year of service to the community on June 28. Since 1989 I have had the privilege of being part of this amazing group of dedicated individuals who devote their time and talents to making Meals On Wheels operate effectively.
\
Board members, volunteers, administrative personnel and cooks focus on our mission to deliver hot, nutritious, noon-day meals to our neighbors who are homebound, isolated or incapacitated. Each weekday we volunteers provide social contact to recipients who at times may not see another person that day.
\
During the past 29 years, Meals On Wheels has served over 3,000 recipients. Currently we are serving 170 at a cost of $84 per month or about $1,000 per year per recipient. Meals On Wheels receives no government funds and over half of its annual income is from individuals, businesses, churches and civic clubs.
\
According to a recent audit, 87 percent of our resources are spent on the program. We utilize the Lowcountry Food Bank to help keep food costs down. The other way to keep our costs down is using in-kind donations of fresh vegetables from individuals and the Plant-A-Row for the Hungry program, which is run by master gardeners of our area at the Summerville Farmers Market on Saturdays. The Atlanta Bread Company has graciously provided bread many years.
\
All non-profit programs are struggling due to this unfortunate economic climate. Please consider making a contribution to Meals On Wheels of Summerville knowing that you are helping to feed another human being. Our contact information is: P.O. Box 592 Summerville, S.C. 29484. Phone 873-8224.

Set record straight
\
The members of the Mt. Zion Spiritual Singers and our director, Alfonso Brown, were distressed to read an article about our organization in The Post and Courier on June 10.
\
Asked about the origin of our group, our director said he was inspired to start it to honor and preserve our Lowcountry heritage after attending a concert by the Society for the Preservation of Spirituals.
\
The ensuing remarks about the Spiritual Society, which the writer reports as coming from our director, are in letter and in spirit completely erroneous.
\
He did not say anything remotely like the disparaging and inflammatory statements attributed to him. Those of us who were at the interview are aghast.
\
We immediately communicated our explanation and our regrets to David Smythe, president, and other members of the Spiritual Society. They have been understanding and very cordial about continuing together to encourage our common interest in preserving and promoting our valuable Lowcountry musical heritage.
\
We have set the record straight between our groups, but now in the interest of community unity we take this opportunity to reach the readership as a whole to set the record straight.

Change strategy
\
No one, regardless of political stripe, can deny we as a country need a new paradigm to extricate ourselves from our economic and social catastrophe. We have seen a few modern presidents who were unafraid to take bold, controversial and unpopular measures to remedy systemic and debilitating problems. Teddy Roosevelt and his cousin Franklin are good examples.
\
Sometimes asking questions that appear ""on the edge"" can yield interesting solutions when refined and converted to actionable policy.
\
So, here are some to mull over:
\
--Bow out of NATO, and close bases around the world, saving billions. We are no longer the world's super cop.
\
--Rely more on enhanced intelligence and drones versus boots on the ground.
\
--Continue to invest in superior military technology, but for defense purposes only, not $1.2 trillion pre-emptive wars.
\
--Use the armed forces model for universal health care (lower cost than U.S. average), affordable day care and educational opportunity for all.
\
--Eliminate the distorted income gap spread between top dog and underling. Generals get around 10 times more than privates. CEOs in the private sector get more than 300 times more.
\
--Wean dependence on strategically vulnerable fossil fuel consumption with enhanced incentives for fuel efficiency and a penal gas tax to force change. Use gas tax funds to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and green, efficient, transport systems.
\
--Impose strict immigration policies, fair screening of applicants, troops to seal borders -- a dual illegal immigration and security issue.
\
--Encourage manufacture and export of innovative, high tech products.
\
--Impose selected tariff barriers to revitalize medium to high skill manufacturing.
\
There are probably many more. The ""same old, same old"" won't do the job. Come on, Mr. President, you can do it!

ADHD diagnosis
\
From 6 percent to 9 percent of U.S. children and adolescents are being diagnosed with Attention Deficit (with or without) Hyperactivity Disorder, known as ADHD. Many are forced into taking Ritalin (methylphenidate) or similar amphetamine-type drugs as a treatment.
\
ADHD drugs are said to help because they stimulate the central nervous system and affect neurotransmitters.
\
But as shown in experiments performed many years ago, ADHD drugs like Ritalin remove cholesterol molecules from the brain and other body tissues -- a fact often ignored by health professionals.
\
The removal of cholesterol from body tissues is the reason we see stunted body growth in children taking these drugs.
\
And the removal of cholesterol from brain tissues may be the actual mechanism that causes the child to ""settle down"" in a form of mild depression.
\
Other research shows that lowering the cholesterol content in brain cells and myelin coverings can lead to seizures. This can result in those children being diagnosed as epileptics, to go along with their ADHD diagnosis. These children could have to take an anti-seizure medication like Dilantin (phenytoin) for life, in addition to their ADHD drug.
\

Good for Graham
\
I laughed out loud when I heard that the union representing Boeing workers in Washington state had filed an ethics complaint against Sen. Lindsey Graham because he dared to criticize a federal lawsuit against the aircraft manufacturer.
\
The National Labor Relations Board sued Boeing in April, saying the company's new plant near Charleston was an illegal form of payback against the union for past strikes.
\
Graham's sin, according to the union, is that the senator went on record as saying he thinks it's a frivolous case and a complete waste of taxpayers' money.
\
The audacity!
\
I hate to disappoint the union bosses who concocted this cockamamie charge, but this is still the United States of America. No one owes you a job, and, with a few exceptions, the government has no right to tell a private corporation where it can and can't conduct business.
\
Likewise, Sen. Graham is allowed to voice his opinion about the NLRB's lawsuit.
\
That isn't unethical, as the union so cynically claims. It's simply American.
\
On behalf of South Carolina's small, family businesses, I want to thank Sen. Graham for doing what we asked him to do: Supporting the people of South Carolina.

Good choice
\
The decision to move Principal Robert Grimm from C.E. Williams Middle School to North Charleston High School is one of the better decisions ever made by the Charleston County School Board. The impact Mr. Grimm made on the faculty and students of C.E. was tremendous.
\
During my sixth-grade year under the leadership of a different principal, there were several cases in which everyone in the school was searched for weapons, drugs, etc., as well as countless acts of criminal behavior.
\
When it came time for my seventh grade year to start though, out went the old principal and in came the new. Just the name Robert Grimm made the student body a little uneasy, but soon his name was not the only thing dreaded by misbehaving students.
\
While under Principal Grimm, I was not searched once, and the violence had nearly ceased to exist in the school.
\
I am positive that Mr. Grimm bettered the learning environment not only for the student body but for the educators as well because of his strong disciplinary support given to them. I feel that Mr. Grimm will be an effective leader and a positive change needed for North Charleston High School.

Don't buy it
\
I voted for Nikki Haley. I support and share most of her political views. I do feel, however, that the timing of the release of her book of memoirs is in poor taste.
\
For a governor (or any elected official) to release a book shortly after being elected into her first term of service certainly seems as though a ""cashing in"" may be taking place.
\
Perhaps shortly after leaving office would have been somewhat more palatable rather than shortly after entering office.
\
I suggest that we, her constituents, schedule our purchase of these premature memoirs after she leaves the office in which she has only recently been elected.
\
In this way, perhaps Gov. Haley will continue to view South Carolinians as constituents as opposed to customers.
\
Don't buy the book just yet.

REP. C. DAVID UMPHLETT JR.
\
Umphlett, 65, a Moncks Corner Republican, has served in the House since 2003. Representing District 100 for Berkeley County, he is a member of the House Rules and Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs committees. Umphlett, who attended Clemson University, is the retired vice president for government and consumer affairs for Berkeley Electric Cooperative, Inc. He is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, and served on the Berkeley Soil and Water Conservation District for 14 years, the South Carolina Land Resources Commission for three years, among other public service positions. He is a member of Moncks Corner United Methodist Church and American Legion Post 126.
\
Umphlett and his wife, Carolyn Mitchum, have three children, Rhonda Karen, Janet U. Livingston and William David.
\
Question: What is your top priority this year?
\
Answer: There are several issues that concern me and the people I represent: To find ways to lower taxes for my constituents, to improve the South Carolina road/highway system, to clean up the environment on land, in the air and on the waters of South Carolina.
\
Q: What is the most common complaint your constituents call about? What can you do to alleviate their concerns?
\
A: People who have retired and are on fixed incomes have serious concerns about the amount of taxes that they are paying. Most are asking for ways to still lower the taxes especially for schools when most have no children in school and feel that they should no longer pay for schools.
\
Another concern is our deplorable road conditions. We have to come up with ways to fund building and maintaining our road system better than what has been done in the past. Hopefully, the S.C. Department of Transportation reform will help.
\
A third concern is the need to increase our push for economic development that will bring clean-environment industries into the state, create jobs for our citizens who are unemployed or underemployed and give jobs to South Carolinians. While population growth is good, bringing in so many people from out of state causes us to have to spend excessively for infrastructure due to new housing developments and subdivisions and leaves our own citizens lacking in basic needs.
\
Q: What are your political ambitions?
\
A: To serve my constituents to the best of my ability and be open- minded to all of the questions and concerns that they have. I serve at the pleasure of my constituents because all legislative seats belong to the people, not to one individual. I came to Columbia to be a voice for the people of Berkeley County who elected me and I listen to my constituents. My greatest satisfaction is in knowing that I have heard from enough people back home to make informed and valid decisions on votes.
\
Q: How do you spend your Saturday nights?
\
A: As most people know, I am an avid hunter and fisherman. The weekends are spent managing my wildlife interests, visiting with folks in town, catching up on the latest information concerning my constituents and being involved in church work. On Saturday nights, I am usually at home with my wife relaxing. Occasionally our grandchildren will stay with us. Basically, we just like to relax and unwind from the previous week.
\
Q: What's the most creative way you could propose to generate revenue for the state?
\
A: If we bring in new business through economic development, it will help to increase our revenue with more jobs for our constituents. No one likes to increase taxes, especially me. However, because of the deterioration of our roads and the documented mismanagement of money in the SCDOT, we may have to increase the gas tax in the near future. If this should happen, I would be in favor of a tax between 5 and 6 cents with the money going toward or being used for 100 percent maintenance with a sunset clause after 7 years. I am always willing to listen to alternate suggestions. After all, my family members and I have to pay taxes too and we want to see taxes go down, not up.
\
Q: What is the least effective government agency and how can it be made more effective?
\
A: Several state agencies have come under fire recently. Without repeating their names, work has begun on rectifying their problems. All state agencies need to look at themselves internally and see what they can do to work more efficiently. Adding more employees and increasing their budgets has got to stop. Where possible, employees should be cross-trained in an organization so that duties and responsibilities can continue in case of emergencies. Across-the- board budget cuts are not the most effective way to reduce funding or make the agency more accountable. Each agency should be scrutinized more closely for the best utilization of funds.

"
65,"Lumber pact will\protect environment\As a seven-year World Wildlife Fund member and one who is concerned, on a more local level, with environmental issues such as shortsighted overdevelopment and such, I read with great interest the article announcing the recent lumber pact with Canada (""Endowment result of lumber pact with Canada,"" The Greenville News, Nov. 29).\To me personally, this certainly sounds like a very balanced and well-thought-out movement, and I saw nothing in the article to prompt me to say otherwise. I do plan to research this topic further, however, but as far as I can tell, it should be a ""dramatic step toward protecting the environment,"" just as the article stated. Kudos all around.\James P. Anderson, Simpsonville\Slide to socialism\due to moral code\A recent letter writer argued that America is moving toward socialism. I agree 100 percent. However, one needs to understand why we are moving ever toward collectivism. The answer lies in America's philosophy.\Philosophy is the foundation of politics. It addresses three primary subjects: 1) The nature of the universe, 2) How we acquire knowledge about the universe, and 3) How we are to live in the universe. In other words, it deals with metaphysics, epistemology and morality. It is mainly the third area of philosophy that has brought us to the point of socialism.\The predominant moral view of America is one of duty. That is, good is defined in terms of duty. It is no longer defined in terms of the individual's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In fact, the individual is now but a cog in the machinery of the collective. His value is defined in terms of what he can do for some ""greater good."" The idea that the greatest good is what he can do for himself is frowned on. The notion that he has a right to exist for his own sake is anathema.\Both parties subscribe to the same moral code. One party preaches duty to the state, while the other party preaches duty to the oppressed masses. Each leads to greater and greater collectivism.\Until America reclaims its moral roots, which lie in placing value on the individual for his own sake, we will continue the path to slavery, otherwise known as socialism.\Vincent Bost, Laurens\Secondhand smoke\not greatest threat\It would be wonderful to believe that the vociferous opponents of secondhand smoke all drive high-mpg, low toxic emission vehicles, but I would not bet on it.\One person who highly approved of the anti-smoking law passed for Greenville, among other areas, compared second-smoke to radiation contact. She should do some research. The 1940s gave our nation -- our ozone layer -- 100 above-ground atom bomb tests, and we presently have diagnostic tests done that pinpoint problems via clunky machines that expose us all to humongous amounts of radiation, as we do battle to defer the inevitable.\The sales psychologists no longer have need for the cattle prods. Spin has expertly woven all of our extreme fears into the fabric of our lives.\I do not fear smoke, firsthand or secondhand. My fear is that this year our world might be having a ""going out of orbit sale.""\Mary Nilsson, Taylors\Be responsible when\dealing with animals\Once again, another heart-breaking animal cruelty story is in the news, this time in Travelers Rest. What appalls me is that some people see nothing wrong with hoarding 70 animals that cannot be taken care of properly, chaining animals or penning them for their entire lives. When does it end? How many animals does someone have to abuse and neglect for something to be done?\I think that anyone who has been ticketed, fined, jailed, etc. for animal cruelty should never be allowed to own an animal again. Please, if you cannot afford an animal, do not get one. They can become expensive with food, housing and vet costs. If you do not have the means to take care of an animal, do it a favor and leave it be. You are doing no good to any animal by taking it from one bad situation and putting it into another.\If you want to help animals in our community, you can do the following. Have all your animals spayed and neutered to prevent even more overpopulation of unwanted animals, report any abuse to your local animal control officer, volunteer with a rescue group, foster a rescue animal, never chain your dog and never buy an animal from anywhere but your local shelter!\Maybe if we have more responsible pet guardians, we would not have these animal cruelty cases! Let's prevent animal cruelty together!\Amy Scholtes, Taylors\STORYCHAT\Here's a sampling of what readers are saying. Join the discussion by visiting our online forums at GreenvilleOnline.com.\About the recent editorial, ""Roads need improvement"":\+ ""We pay enough property taxes in the state of S.C. to take care of roads and then some.""\-- REBEL1\+ ""SCDOT gets its revenue mostly from a gas tax of 16 cents per gallon, which has not been adjusted since 1987, so the purchasing power of that money has continued to erode over the years.""\-- cml\+ ""There are road maintenance needs for sure.

66,"Patrick Haddon, a well-known Greenville County Republican who was reprimanded by the state Ethics Commission in 2014, and veteran firefighter Bill Addis, who owes $4,570 in county taxes, are competing in Tuesday's GOP primary for the state House District 19 seat.\Haddon, a 41-year-old business owner, is a former chairman of the Greenville County Republican Party. He has taken out a $100,000 loan and contributed $25,000 of his own money to finance his campaign to take conservative ""Greenville values"" to the Statehouse in Columbia.\Addis, 47, has been a firefighter for 28 years and is chairman of the Duncan Chapel Fire District Commission. He described himself as an inexperienced politician who is ""super conservative.""\Addis, who has raised less than a $1,000 for his campaign, said Haddon is seeking to ""buy"" the District 19 seat. He called attention to the ethics violation that Haddon admitted to involving repairs that were made to his pickup and a utility trailer at a Greenville County sewer and fire district maintenance shop while he was serving on the agency's board.\Records show that Addis owes nearly $678 in county taxes on three vehicles for 2018 and 2019. He also owes $3,892 in county taxes going back to 2009 on two parcels where he said he used to operate fireworks stands, records show.\Addis said the only county taxes that he owes are this year's year levy on a 2006 Hummer. He says the other tax charges listed in county records are erroneous.\""I'll straighten that out,"" he said in an interview Friday.\The winner of Tuesday's primary will face Democrat Carrie Counton in an Aug. 20 special election for the District 19 seat, which represents a swath of western Greenville County. Counton ran unsuccessfully for the same seat last year.\The special election will be the final step in a series of political moves that began last November when William Timmons gave up his state Senate seat after being elected to Congress. Dwight Loftis vacated the District 19 seat after winning a special election in March to replace Timmons in the state Senate.\Haddon said he served on the Parker Sewer and Fire District board from 2003 to 2015.\According to a Sept. 24, 2014, state Ethics Commission consent order, Haddon had repairs made to his personal pickup and a utility trailer on three occasions in 2011 and 2012 at the district's maintenance shop. Haddon assisted the district's maintenance supervisor and mechanic in making the repairs and also provided the parts and materials that were used, according to the order.\Before becoming a board member, Haddon worked as a mechanic at the district maintenance shop, according to the consent order. He said it was a common practice for mechanics to work on private vehicles in the shop on breaks or after hours, according to the order.\Haddon admitted that he violated a state law prohibiting a public official from using his position for personal gain, according to the order. He received a public reprimand from the ethics commission and was ordered to pay a $1,000 administrative fee.\""No tax money was expended for anything that I did,"" Haddon said in an interview. ""I paid my fine and apologized, and that was it.""\He said the district also revised its maintenance-shop policies to comply with state law.\Three other Parker Sewer and Fire District board members received reprimands from the ethics commission in September and October of 2014 for similar violations involving work that was done on their vehicles at the district maintenance shop between 2011 and 2013, records show. They were ordered to pay a total of $3,000 in administrative fees.\Greenville County Republican Party Chairman Nate Leupp said he doesn't see the ethics infraction that Haddon committed as a major problem.\""When you look at what actually happened, it doesn't really seem to be anything concerning in the least bit,"" Leupp said.\Haddon, who is married and has three children, previously ran for the state Senate District 6 seat in 2008. He lost in the Republican primary to former Sen. Mike Fair.\After serving as chairman of the South Carolina Young Republicans, Haddon led the Greenville County Republican Party from 2009 to 2011.\He worked as interim director of the Greenville County Disabilities and Special Needs Board for three months in 2012 until the Greenville County Council disbanded the board.\""It was a very difficult time. They had a lot of bad issues going on over there,"" Haddon said. ""They had two deaths of clients before I came. They were running a massive deficit.""\Haddon said he helped the agency get back on the right track.\John Warren, a Greenville businessman and Marine veteran who ran for governor last year, and Loftis have endorsed Haddon in Tuesday's primary.\""I am proud to endorse my friend Patrick Haddon for state representative because he shares our conservative values. He is pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, and will never vote to raise taxes,"" Warren said, according to a post on the Facebook page for Haddon's campaign. ""We need more legislators like Patrick who will fight for us.""\Loftis said Haddon's ""strong commitment to his own family reflects his commitment to supporting the traditional family as the foundation for a stable community and society,"" according to another post on the Facebook page for Haddon's campaign.\Addis, who is married and has four children and seven grandchildren, said he and Loftis are longtime neighbors and that he was ""very disappointed"" that Loftis chose to back his opponent.\Pointing out that Haddon and his wife made separate donations this year totaling $1,200 to Loftis' Senate campaign, Addis said, ""I feel like he paid for his endorsement.""\Loftis and Haddon both denied Addis' allegation.\""I am not for sale,"" said Loftis, who dismissed the remark by Addis as political rhetoric.\Haddon said he and Loftis have known each other for 15 years.\""He knows my conservatism, he knows how family-orientated I am, and so that's why he supports me,"" Haddon said.\Addis said the amount of money that Haddon has in his campaign war chest ""put a sour taste in my mouth.""\""I don't want to feel like I'm buying a seat,"" he said, adding that his campaign has focused on ""shaking hands and talking to people and my character.""\Haddon said the money that he has invested in his campaign shows that he is ""fully committed to this race.""\Haddon and Addis both say that they oppose abortion and strongly support the Second Amendment.\Haddon, who owns an environmental services company in Greenville and a bio-fuel plant in Lugoff, said he believes government officials don't create jobs.\""They just create an environment by which it allows business to thrive, and that is low taxes, fair regulations,"" he said.\Haddon also said he will emphasize the importance of workforce development if elected to represent District 19.\Addis, who works as firefighter in the Parker District, said he would be the only full-time firefighter in the state House of Representatives. He said he wants ""to have a voice"" in revamping South Carolina's financially troubled retirement system for public employees.\Addis also said state officials are not effectively spending money from a higher gas tax to fix South Carolina's crumbling roads. As a result, he said, residents are paying more for gas while also spending money on vehicle repairs.\""We can't win for losing,"" he said.\He also said that state government has enough money to ""give people a little tax break.""\""I think we need someone down there with a little bit of common sense,"" Addis said.\Follow Kirk Brown on Twitter @KirkBrown_AIM\CREDIT: Kirk Brown"

Pet tragedy
\
A baby is born. It is tiny, cute and sweet, but, through no fault of its own, it is unwanted. An injection is given to purposely end the life of this God-given creature. Then it is dumped unceremoniously and eaten by a hungry animal looking for a meal. Then that poor hungry animal (for example, a bald eagle) is slowly and painfully poisoned.
\
This is the result of people not spaying and neutering their pets. This is the result of a society with too many unwanted pets. This is a result of horribly sad and unjust laws regarding the disposal of euthanized creatures. These poor creatures deserve better treatment than being put to death, dumped in a landfill and disrespectfully feasted on.
\
Since we should, but do not yet, have laws mandating pet sterilization, can we not provide some level of respect by requiring the cremation of euthanized animals?
\
Lawmakers, you have the power to make a difference. You have the power to prevent or change this horribly sad ending. Please enact sterilization laws and laws to cremate what should be rare cases of euthanized creatures.
\
Let's provide a little respect for these already sad, tragic and unnecessary deaths.

Fuel efficiency
\
Recently there have been several letters about owners of SUVs and other large vehicles not caring about the environment or being unpatriotic. In general, it is true these vehicles get worse mileage than a sedan.
\
But vehicle miles per gallon is not always the best measure of fuel efficiency. Sometimes, the more appropriate measure is person miles per gallon. Consider a large family of seven, such as mine.
\
We could drive our large vehicle that holds us all and gets about 16 miles per gallon on a trip, or we could take two vehicles that get 26 miles per gallon each for the same trip. With the large vehicle, a 300-mile trip takes 18.75 gallons of gas. With the ""more fuel efficient choice"" of two cars, the same trip takes 23.08 gallons of gas. We always look for the best mileage vehicle we can find, but it has to hold us all. So maybe the people who think they know everything about others' driving habits should think twice.
\
On a related issue, the DOT has made a strong case that it needs more funding for road maintenance and repair because of higher costs for repairs and flat revenues as motorists reduce driving due to higher gas prices. The Post and Courier seems to recommend a hike in the gas tax.
\
This logic is flawed economically. If higher gas prices have caused motorists to cut back, resulting in flat revenue, hiking the price with a higher tax could cause motorists to cut back more, further reducing revenue. As higher prices hold up over time, motorists will look to more fuel-efficient models such as hybrids, resulting in ever lower use of gasoline and lower revenue from taxes. The better and fairer solution would be to collect tolls on roads that need repairs badly so that those who use them and cause the wear pay the costs. Nobody likes tolls, but they are a better answer than higher gas taxes.

Irresponsible idea
\
Some of our state representatives are promoting offshore drilling as a potential source of fuel and revenue for South Carolina. The bar graph in the June 30 Post and Courier shows a small chance of finding natural gas off our coast. Oil is even less likely to be found. Continued dependence on fossil fuels is not wise.
\
Common sense tells us conservation and exploration of alternative fuels are our best answers to the fuel problem with its concomitant environmental disasters.
\
Aside from the foolhardy endangerment of our coast and the total disregard for the damage fossil fuels cause worldwide, why would our representatives consider an action that is on a par with buying a lotto ticket?
\
I intend to contact the S.C. Senate through the Legislature online and let them know what I think of this irresponsible, shortsighted idea.

What is wrong?
\
The Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina is once again walking a tightrope. Its ""Standing Committee,"" supported by its two bishops, is basically saying that if you don't agree that homosexual behavior is sinful and that two such committed individuals cannot be ""blessed,"" then they are not really welcome in the Body of Christ.
\
Homosexuality has been part of our culture since the beginning of time. It is not a matter of choice. Why the church doesn't try to help homosexuals live committed monogamous lives, welcome them into the ""family,"" and involve them in the work of the Gospel is a mystery to me. They are not turned away in the wider community.
\
Words like destructive, divisive, disappointing, dumb, degrading and demeaning, swim through my mind as I try to equate what my fellow clergy and bishops have done. We are not a club. We are not perfect. We don't have all the answers to complicated questions such as have been raised.
\
But we are expected to hold out the hand of Christ to all who walk the walk and to accept differences that don't hurt other people. Homosexual behavior is one way some people express their love. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with us? That may be the real question.
\
My prayer is that we can come back together with new love, knowledge and understanding.

More boat ramps
\
Neither Charleston County Council nor Mount Pleasant Town Council has come to the aid of the boating public in the East Cooper community.
\
There are two boat ramps, Shem Creek and Remley's Point, that are so crowded, people are parking their vehicles on side roads, in the Moultrie Shopping Center and on the Moultrie Middle School grounds. Property values are so high now, it's almost too late to do something about added parking.
\
With the new Cooper River Bridge, there will be more people moving in, more boats and problems at these two boat landings. We need help.

"
68,"Gov. Henry McMaster describes positions taken by his Democratic opponent, state Rep. James Smith, as ""extreme.""\Smith questions whether McMaster is moving the state forward and if McMaster is the right choice for the future.\On Thursday in Greenville, they meet for their last televised debate before voters make their choice in the Nov. 6 election.\Here are 10 issues of importance to voters in the Upstate and where each candidate stands:\McMaster earlier this year signed an executive order directing state agencies to be sure their policies and procedures protect faith-based organizations such as Miracle Hill Ministries, a Greenville foster care agency that caters to Christian families and does not place foster children with gay couples or non-Christian families because of the organization's religious views.\McMaster's stance is opposed by Smith, who said he would not have signed the order. Smith has argued that in addition to protecting religious freedoms, the state also must work to prevent discrimination.\On Tuesday, the Anti-Defamation League wrote to federal officials asking that they deny a waiver request that McMaster submitted. ADL officials called the practice of denying the applications of non-Christian foster parents ""immoral.""\Brian Symmes, the governor's spokesman, countered that the group's concerns were ""unfounded.""\""The issue is the constitutionally protected religious beliefs of all South Carolinians, regardless of their faith,"" Symmes wrote. ""The governor would fight just as hard on behalf of Miracle Hill if they were a Jewish organization, a Muslim organization or an organization of any other faith. We need more organizations engaged in finding foster care home for children, not less.""\McMaster has worked to defund Planned Parenthood, an organization that has endorsed Smith, who is pro-choice. The governor signed an executive order in July to remove Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from the list of approved Medicaid providers for any service because they also provide abortions, but a federal judge in August temporarily halted that order.\Smith has argued against anti-abortion legislation in the House and this year spoke against a vote in the Senate that would have banned almost all abortions. The bill ultimately was defeated by a Democratic filibuster. Smith has said if elected governor he would be a ""brick wall"" against any attempt to roll back the rights of women or restrict their access to their health care.\Smith, a decorated war veteran, said he wants to close the so-called ""Charleston loophole,"" the three-day time period for federal background checks for gun purchases after which stores can sell weapons if not stopped by the FBI. The federal agency could not find the proper records that would have disqualified Dylann Roof from buying his gun during that three-day window in 2015.\Roof went on to kill nine parishioners at a Charleston church, including a state senator who was their pastor.\Some lawmakers want to lengthen the three-day period or hold gun sales until the background checks are complete, however long that takes. No proposal has thus far passed the Legislature.\McMaster has said the problem is more about the system's ""failure of technology,"" which he said could be improved.\Endorsed by the National Rifle Association, McMaster supports a bill allowing gun owners to carry their firearms without a concealed weapons permit, something Smith opposes.\Smith would sign legislation to ban bump stocks and trigger cranks, according to his website, as well as a bill requiring universal background checks to include sales at gun shows, bills restricting the retail sales of military-style assault weapons and to make it a crime to threaten use of a weapon on school grounds.\In the most recent legislative session McMaster asked lawmakers to reduce by 1 percent the personal income tax rates in all tax brackets over five years, but the plan failed to advance. McMaster has opposed any tax increases, even vetoing a roads bill last year that included an increase in the gas tax and new or increased fees. The Legislature overrode that veto.\Smith argued in the most recent debate that lawmakers should eliminate some of the exemptions for the state sales tax. McMaster said removing any exemption would effectively amount to a tax increase.\McMaster accused Smith repeatedly of raising taxes, prompting Smith to use a quip made famous by Ronald Reagan: ""There you go again.""\Smith said he supports ""pro-growth tax initiatives"" and opposes ""job-killing tariffs,"" a reference to the trade actions of President Donald Trump, a close ally of McMaster.\Smith has said he supports a 2percent raise for teachers and would as governor support raising the pay above the Southeastern average. He also supports using surplus funds this year for teacher and state employee bonuses.\McMaster has agreed that there is a teacher crisis but said during the most recent debate that the state has other crises, as well. He said economic development that could be accelerated by tax cuts would bring more money into the state for education needs.\Both candidates say they want to bring high-paying jobs to the Palmetto State. McMaster, in fact, labels that as his top priority and says that more than 20,000 jobs have been announced since he became governor last year. But Smith said that figure is misleading because the labor participation rate, the number of people working or actively seeking work, has continued to drop under McMaster and currently stands at 57.3percent.\According to Smith's campaign, the state was eighth-worst in the nation for labor participation when he took office and is now tied with Alabama for third worst. Smith said that many have given up looking for work in the state.\Smith wants to improve the state's workforce development system by creating scholarships and increasing partnerships between businesses and colleges. In the last debate McMaster said the state's workforce development efforts are the best in the nation.\Smith said as governor he would expand Medicaid in the state, a move he said would create 40,000 jobs and bring $2 billion to the state. McMaster opposes such expansion, arguing the state cannot afford its eventual share of the costs.\Smith also wants to increase the therapy reimbursement rates for treatment of autistic children and to address the shortage of rural physicians, noting 11 of the state's 46 counties have no OB-GYN.\McMaster supports loosening restrictions on nurse practitioners and expanding telemedicine.\Both men support improving the state's infrastructure but differ on how to go about it. McMaster vetoed a roads bill that ultimately passed the Legislature last year that will spend billions of dollars on road and bridge improvements over the next decade.\McMaster said he supports completion of Interstate 73 to the Grand Strand and the I-526 extension across James and Johns islands.\Smith said if elected governor he will sign ""meaningful"" legislation to further improve roads and bridges and to repair old and unsafe water pipes.\Smith said he wants to work with lawmakers to come up with a school funding reform plan that addresses current inequities. The current system, he said, ""disenfranchises our poor and rural districts and leads to a system of 'haves' and 'have-nots.'"" Smith also wants to boost infrastructure and technology funding to change the ""Corridor of Shame,"" home to poorly developed education and economic development systems in the eastern part of the state, to the ""Corridor of Opportunity.""\McMaster wants to consolidate smaller school districts to improve funding efficiency. He also wants to improve economic development in poorer districts, a move he argues will eventually improve the schools there because of improved tax bases. He argues that is a better solution than ""simply sending more money from Columbia.""\Both say they oppose oil drilling and exploration off South Carolina's coast. Both also favor studying how best to address future flooding events in the state after devastating floods in 2015 and following Hurricane Florence this year.\Smith was the primary sponsor of a bipartisan bill to remove the cap on solar power, which failed to pass this year. He said if elected he will develop a comprehensive energy policy that protects the environment and consumers against ""bullying greed of big utilities.""\McMaster wants South Carolina Electric & Gas Company to stop charging consumers $37 million per month for an abandoned nuclear plant project that the utility and Santee Cooper, the state-owned utility, jointly spent $9 billion on. He wants ratepayers to get a refund of money already paid, and he wants Santee Cooper sold to protect ratepayers from $4.3 billion in debt incurred from the nuclear project.\James Smith, left, and Gov. Henry McMaster come to Greenville today.\File\CREDIT: Tim Smith"

What achieved?
\
So what has our state Legislature accomplished this year?
\
Well, let's see.
\
Legislators passed an enormous tax increase on cigarettes. Thankfully, the bill was vetoed and the House sustained it, though some might say this was bad since it was all earmarked for health care. Right?
\
Consider this: Just a part of that new tax (only $1 million) was for new marketing programs in the Department of Agriculture -- for tobacco grown in South Carolina, perhaps. Anyhow, this bump in revenue, if history provides an example, might not have lasted a year -- the bump from the tax shift in 2006 didn't -- and would definitely have led to even higher taxes and spending. Unless checked, as many know, bureaucracies always grow and this one grows like Topsy.
\
Indeed, state spending has grown by more than 42 percent over the past three years.
\
Last year, the Legislature spent over $1 billion dollars in new revenue. Now, we are told there is not enough money to pay for the school buses we were promised, not enough to properly fund the operating expenses of our schools, funding we were promised as part of the tax shift, and not enough to fund the prison system. The prison funding is so short that our detention officers now need to add open rebellion to their concerns.
\
However, legislators still have money for a legislative slush fund known as the ""Competitive Grants Program.""

Special thanks to all of the folks who made it out to Green Drinks Charleston on Wednesday, June 11. Visitors to Mixson in North Charleston were treated to live jazz, tours of Mixson properties and beer from a local brewer.
\
It was a wonderful evening to enjoy some time outdoors. For those of you unfamiliar with Green Drinks or Mixson, here is a little background:
\
Green Drinks is a dynamic group of people from around the Lowcountry who meet once a month to socialize, meet friends, grab a bite to eat or enjoy a cocktail all while discussing environmental and community issues and ideas.
\
We come from many different walks of life, but share a love of the environment and embracing this beautiful city we call home. Green Drinks, originally founded in London in 1989, now fosters over 300 chapters around the world. Our Charleston chapter is one of the fastest growing in the country.
\
The award winning I'On Group is developing Mixson -- a sustainable ""urbanist"" community in North Charleston, which is one of the largest such projects in the country.
\
With rising transportation costs, traffic volume, and out-of-control sprawl, these types of neighborhoods reconnect residents. It is important to note that projects like this are also beneficial because they are built in proximity to schools, restaurants and shopping.
\
Green Drinks applauds the efforts of individuals and organizations that are working very hard to preserve our natural environment here in the Lowcountry.
\
We encourage you to check out a Green Drinks meeting or lecture sometime -- the next is on July 9. Meanwhile, you can find out more about us at www.greendrinks.org.

Real change
\
Willing suspension of disbelief: Hillary first used these words against Gen. David Petraeus, but we all are being asked to do this in relation to the Barack Obama nomination.
\
First, Obama was nominated by the typical back room dealing that has always taken place in the Democratic Party and two major states have been disenfranchised, overriding the will of the people. Now, Obama is being touted as a ""new beginning"" and ""a new face for the whole world.""
\
Being a former Democrat, I can only say that the party line has morphed way beyond the Camelot persona and that we the people are now being asked to willingly suspend our disbelief and to liken Obama to the second coming.
\
Like President Bush and like Sen. John McCain, Obama is only a man. In deciding which man and party to vote for next, I ask myself whether I'm better off now than I was, say, 40 years ago when the Democrats began to take God out of our schools and to replace him with teaching about sex.
\
We all know the result. Our precious asset, our children, now know a lot about sex and are dropping out of school without critical skills needed to lead productive lives for our country. I believe that we have wasted many more dollars on education than we will ever spend in Iraq. Then there's the oil situation, which the Democrats have severely affected by not allowing any drilling or nuclear options.
\
Then, there's the Federal Reserve. The Democrats won't allow two (soon to be three) Federal Reserve board vacancies -- of a total of seven -- to be filled so that our country can have the input of more brilliant people to help get our country out of this financial mess.
\
We definitely need change in this country, but why not go for real change? Why not demand term limits for Congress so that we can start getting new people with new ideas who really want to devote themselves to solving our country's problems on a regular basis in accordance with our Constitution?

Commuter service
\
How is a commuter service considered a success if it requires my tax money for a subsidy. Are we trying to encourage people to live farther from work and thus contribute to the decline of our inner cities?
\
The idea of many people sharing a ride to work on a bus is wonderful if it makes economic sense for everyone and not just the commuters.
\
For the benefit of those who slept through the first day of Economics 101, state and federal subsidies are not free.
\
There is still no such thing as a free lunch.
\
This program does not benefit the poor or disenfranchised who have no other means of transportation. It simply takes money from the general population to provide a cheaper ride to work for a few.
\
Keeping cars off the road is certainly a benefit. However, higher gas prices will eventually solve that problem. Perhaps one day our neighborhood teenagers will even use the ""free"" school bus that takes them exactly where they want to go at exactly the right time instead of using their pick-up trucks as they do now.

We are 'Big Oil'
\
Who is ""Big Oil""? I've heard a lot of complaints about the obscene profits made by Big Oil, as if it was some entity unto itself or a small group.
\
I have heard Democratic calls for a windfall profits tax or, in the case of Hillary Clinton, a call for confiscating Big Oil's profits for government use.
\
It may come as a surprise, but, if you have a pension plan, 401k, IRA or just buy insurance, you are a benefactor of the obscene profits of Big Oil.
\
If you have some kind of investment, it will be your returns that are taxed or confiscated. Only a very small percentage -- less than 2 percent -- of profits go to high-end investors as individuals. So if the Democrats have their way, it will be the little guys who suffer the most because we are the least able to shelter or defer government levies on our profits.
\
Big Oil (that would be us), earns a measly 8 percent return on investment. That's not a bad profit for a relatively safe investment but not a very good profit for a risky investment. Are speculators making a big profit?
\
Maybe, but they could end up taking a bath because they have committed to paying $135 per barrel of oil.
\
We have already started to reduce our consumption, 4 percent in just one month because of the current price. The oil companies may have to reduce prices just to get you to buy gas. If they have to slash prices below production costs, they lose, and we gain. We see this all the time in rigid production systems.
\
I personally don't care what they charge for gas as long as when I put the nozzle in my tank and pull the handle the gas flows. How much of that gas I use will be determined in part by how much it costs.
\
My spending habits will also send a signal to the car manufacturers, letting them know mileage is becoming a larger determinant in my future car purchases.
\
Gimmicks such as gas tax rebates or controls on price will only distort the buying habits of our citizens. It sends a message that big cars are OK, which is just the opposite message some politicians claim they want to send.
\
Let gas go for market prices and we will all adjust. Even the environmentalists may very well be happy with the outcome.

70,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
71,"
Rep. Bobby Harrell has shown himself to be a hard-working, even- handed leader as chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee. The state can expect him to show those same solid qualities as the new Speaker of the House.
\
House members gave the Charleston Republican a near unanimous endorsement for his nomination after other candidates withdrew from the race. His election to succeed Rep. David Wilkins is recognition of Mr. Harrell's solid legislative record and leadership abilities.
\
Rep. Harrell has been chairman of the House budget committee for six years, including three particularly difficult years in which the state's tax revenues faltered. He insisted on holding the line on taxes, and sought stopgap measures to meet the revenue shortfall. He supported quick repayment of a deficit incurred during those years and the incremental return of money borrowed from trust funds.
\
His unwillingness to move as quickly on trust fund repayment as Gov. Mark Sanford would like has contributed to friction between the two. It is to be hoped they can reach an accommodation before the next legislative session, stressing their common goals, including improved government accountability. Completing the task of government restructuring should be at the top of both agendas next session.
\
While most of Rep. Harrell's recent energies have been focused on gaining consensus on the state budget, he took the legislative lead as House majority leader in the late '90s to achieve an important reform of public education. It took more than a single session to overcome institutional opposition to the Education Accountability Act, but its ultimate success in 1998 was largely due to Mr. Harrell's advocacy and persistence.
\
This year, he offered a solid plan for funding overdue Department of Transportation maintenance projects without an increase in the gas tax. That bill unfortunately stalled in the Senate following an ill-considered amendment, but the House version serves as an example of his practical approach to problems and his careful preparation of solutions.
\
During his years in the House, his strong support of economic development hasn't precluded work on behalf of the environment. Last year, for example, he played a key role in gaining full funding to the state Conservation Bank.
\
Rep. Harrell, personable and slow to criticize, has built a legislative career on building consensus and close attention to legislative detail that will serve him well as Speaker of the House.

72,"BUSINESS WRITER\PIEDMONT -- A proposal by Vulcan Materials to expand its rock quarry has nearby residents fearing damage to their homes, wells and the surrounding environment.\Vulcan is asking the Greenville County Council to rezone 106.2 acres it owns off Brown Road so that its Lakeside plant can be expanded.\The request is expected to be discussed by the council's public works committee in July.\Roger Dunlap, Vulcan's regional vice president and general manager, said expanding the quarry would extend its life by at least 20 or 30 years.\He said the quarry has been in operation for 50 years and rarely had a complaint from residents. Thus, ""we just did not expect these concerns.""\Mike McCall, who lives in the area, said the blasting being done at Vulcan now already ""shakes our houses, the dishes in the cabinet, the windows and the foundation.""\""If they move closer, there's no way they're going to tell me that the blasting and the vibrations are not going to get worse,"" he said.\LeNora McCraw, another resident, said the expansion would put her home of 43 years within 700 feet of the blasting, and ""that's just too close for comfort.""\Dunlap said most quarry activities are ""tightly regulated, and the blasting is tightly regulated.""\""All of our blasting is monitored with seismographs, so that while someone might feel some vibration, the vibration is well within the limits that might damage some structures.""\Dunlap said if the quarry expands and the blasting or other quarry activities damage wells, ""the company will repair the situation. We are working on how to provide them that assurance.""\McCraw said she and other residents are also against the allotment of $400,000 in state gas tax funds to re-route Brown Road. They've been trying to get that road improved or another one built from State 153 to Piedmont Highway to ease traffic concerns.\Brown Road used to be a dead-end road, McCall said. He said when the Southern Connector was put in, State 153 was extended to meet Brown Road. Since then, traffic has increased on the road that wasn't designed to handle that many vehicles, especially the big truck traffic.\The Greenville County Legislative Transportation Committee voted in February to give Vulcan $400,000 to move the road so the quarry can be expanded. County engineer Judy Workeotter said at that time the entire project would cost about $1.8 million.\Dunlap said he was ""surprised to learn that residents are not pleased with the new road.\""Brown Road as it is now is very dangerous and Vulcan is paying most of the cost for the new road. We felt like the neighbors would be delighted,"" he said.\Dunlap said the new road will be a public road."
73,"By Lynne Lucas \STAFF WRITER \llucasgreenvillenews.com \SIMPSONVILLE -- Left-turn lanes, a traffic signal and school-front road widening have been approved for the intersection of Scuffletown and Jonesville roads, where Bell's Crossing Elementary has reached a construction milestone. \The intersection improvements, targeted for completion by the time the school is set to open in August, could ease the minds of residents and parents concerned that the inevitable rise in vehicles will create traffic problems and safety risks. \About $$@$!750,000 -- a combination of federal, state and school district funds -- has been allotted for the intersection improvements, said Jeff Hilderbran, president of CoTransCo., the design and construction management firm overseeing the project. \The funds were approved by the Greenville County Transportation Committee, a group appointed by the Legislature to dole out state gas-tax revenue locally, he said. \The project includes left-turn lanes in all four directions and bus and car lanes in front of the school, Hildebrand said. \The August deadline is ""aggressive,"" but safety is an issue, he said. \""We want to make sure that (it's) safe,"" he said. ""That's a dangerous intersection right now. You add another God knows how many cars ..."" \News of the improvements cheered Rachel Farr, a parent who lives in the nearby Sparrows Point subdivision. Her excitement over having a school so close has been tempered by fears of accidents and traffic jams. \""That makes me feel a lot better about traffic woes,"" said Farr, whose son will be ready for kindergarten in August of 2003. \""It's always a headache taking your kid to school, but it helps if there are things that help you with that process."" \An evergreen tree has been placed atop the incompleted school.

74,"South Carolina would need $29.3 billion over 20 years just to bring roads up to a ""good"" service level with the largest chunks going to expanding capacity and improving pavement condition, state Transportation Secretary Robert St. Onge said in Mauldin.\He warned that tough decisions could lie ahead and that the new ""inland port"" in Greer could increase local truck traffic as the area develops with warehouses and other business.\St. Onge was brought to Mauldin City Hall as part of a series presented by the chambers of commerce in Mauldin, Simpsonville and Fountain Inn. He oversees more than 41,400 miles of state-maintained road, the fourth-largest highway network in the nation.\Congestion is a growing problem with one of the state's worst points on Interstate 385 at State 417, St. Onge said. Traffic jams cost $397 million in lost productivity statewide in 2011, up from $345 million in 2005, he said.\St. Onge said that he would like to transfer some of the state's lesser-traveled roads to local officials. They include a cemetery road in Saluda County and a road that serves a single church in Florence County, he said.\""It's so low priority for me that I can't get to it,"" he said. ""But I can't pass that on ... until we get some legislation.""\The push to turn over local roads could include Shaver Drive in Mauldin, said Mayor Dennis Raines.\""You wouldn't want to get a gift that's broken,"" Raines said in an interview. ""But if the state came in and gave us the funding to bring that road up to standards, we'd probably be OK in maintaining it.""\St. Onge told the gathering of elected officials and community leaders that given the condition of the state's roads, his job is to ""carefully manage the decline of the state highway system."" That means ""no collapsed bridges, take the worst congestion and fix it, maintain the freight network,"" he said.\South Carolina's gas tax of 16.75 cents per gallon is fourth lowest in the nation, he said.\""If you're in a no-new-taxes environment, that means you're going to have to take from something else and put it on your road system,"" St. Onge said. ""And that's tough.""\State Rep. Garry Smith, R-Simpsonville, said the proposed House budget includes $60million for bridges and $44million toward roads that comes from the sales tax on motor vehicles. The savings comes from reducing the size of government by 500 employees, he said.\""It's a step in the right direction,"" Smith said. ""It's nowhere where we need to be.""\The state's road needs come as the General Assembly sets aside $300million to deepen the Port of Charleston, an economic engine that more than 700 companies across the state use for imports and exports, St. Onge said.\The concern, he said, is that the port deepening won't matter if boxes can't get off the wharf onto Interstate 26.\""We'll be great on the water side potentially and be broke on the land side if we're not careful,"" St. Onge said.\The needs also come as the Ports Authority and Norfolk Southern Railroad work on a public-private partnership to build an inland port in Greer. It will stand at the confluence of where the rail coming out of the Port of Charleston meets the east-west rail that runs parallel to Interstate 85, St. Onge said.\St. Onge predicted that the inland port will mean more traffic from trucks traveling locally as the area develops.\""The advertisement is that it will take 50,000 trucks off the road,"" he said.

""Well, what's a few dead ducks?"" -- J.R. Ewing
\
Answer: ""A few dead ducks"" are nature's way of reminding us that oil and water don't mix.
\
J.R.'s leading question, from the final season of ""Dallas,"" was his way of dismissing brother Bobby's lament about ""pollution in the Gulf"" from a tanker-on-tanker collision that spilled lots of Ewing Oil rival WestStar's cargo.
\
Almost two decades later, similar arguments are flowing as freely as the real-life ""pollution in the Gulf"" from a huge April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion.
\
Some folks echo quintessential greedy Texas oil man J.R.
\
More folks sound like socially (and environmentally) conscious Texas oil man Bobby.
\
But this isn't ""Dallas.""
\
And even J.R. would have to admit that BP's toxic mess will produce more than a few dead ducks -- and other wildlife fatalities.
\
Considerable concern rightly focuses on the consequences for Gulf Coast beaches and marshes from Texas to Florida -- and beyond? Plenty of buck-passing, finger-pointing and empty assurances are gushing across the political spectrum.
\
Saturday brought initially encouraging, but later discouraging, news about what The Associated Press called a ""long shot"" mission to use a 100-ton ""containment dome"" to shut off the crude flood.
\
Yet even if that or some other modern marvel stopped the black-gold bleeding today, devastating damage has already been inflicted by the daily dose of 200,000 or so gallons of black gold that has spurted forth from 5,000 feet beneath the water's surface.
\
The icky stuff we can't see includes hail-size ""gobs"" accumulating along the sea floor and other oily by-products scattered at assorted depths.
\
Tiny sea critters are eating that poison. Bigger sea critters are eating them. The dreaded ""loop current"" could drift oil our way, all the way around Florida into the Atlantic.
\
Ponder the food-chain implications for our own kind.
\
However, those denizens of the deep -- and the 11 men killed by this accident -- won't be this man-made disaster's only casualties.
\
It also has seriously wounded the ""drill, baby, drill"" mantra.
\
At least the calamity should enlighten South Carolinians. Offshore drilling wouldn't just be a bad business move for us on the environmental front. It would be a bad business move on the economic front for a state that depends heavily on tourists attracted by our relatively pristine coast.
\
Eventually, though, rising gas prices will again pump up the ""drill, baby, drill"" volume.
\
A longtime pal of mine happens to be a genuine (not a TV) Texas oil man who's more of a Bobby than a J.R. -- though not nearly as good-looking as either. He explained by phone Thursday from the Lone Star State that even if we shut down offshore production in the Gulf, that would necessitate ""bringing in more ships,"" which would bring more risks of tanker spills.
\
He also pointed out that despite the uncertainty about this tragedy's ultimate impact, you can count on this:
\
We're going to keep demanding an ever-rising tide of oil.
\
Sure, we'll talk about cutting back our consumption. We've been talking that talk since 1973.
\
But while ""drill, baby, drill"" has been the recent chant, our lead-footed, driving credo has long been ""burn, baby, burn"" -- as in gasoline.
\
So we'll keep going deep for oil -- and deeper into dependence on foreign sources of it.
\
And as my buddy put it, despite ""incredible"" technological advances, when you go hunting for oil from a mile underwater, it's not just a high-stakes but a high-risk enterprise: ""You're drilling into the crust of the earth where there's a lot of mystery.""
\
There's no mystery, though, about how much our oil gluttony imperils our national security, economy, environment and seafood platters.
\
Our insatiable thirst for cheap gas imposes a steep long-term price.
\
So does our reluctance to go ""nuke, baby, nuke.""
\
And in a nation rapidly going broke, the pressing puzzle is no longer whether taxes will go up.
\
It's which taxes will go up.
\
So why not boost our gas tax enough to lower our oil appetite -- and protect our ability to satisfy seafood appetites?
\
OK, so that would elevate the price of just about everything.
\
Hey, so would the increasingly touted value added tax.
\
And as those Gulf ""gobs"" are trying to tell us, we can't forever have our gas guzzlers and eat our oysters, too.

76,"There's no mistaking Rick Tate's political philosophy.\""I am a Reagan conservative. Most definitely,"" Tate said. ""I will stand by those words.""\Tate, 58, of 320 Woodfield, Easley, is one of three candidates seeking the GOP nomination for state House District 5 seat in the June 10 primary. The other candidates are Neal Collins and Harley Staton. Incumbent Rep. Phil Owens has decided not to run.\Tate defines Reagan principals as limited government, individual freedom, free market capitalism, free market competition, and a faith in the wisdom and vision of the founding fathers.\His goal would be to apply those principles at the state level if elected.\The state Legislature needs to stop its practice of approving budget provisos that authorizes it to shortchange local communities the tax money due them, he said.\""My first piece of legislation ... would be to repeal the law that lets them do that,"" he said.\""The state must go back to fully funding like they are supposed to. They are shorting Pickens County between $3million and $31/2million a year. That (shortfall) is going to fall to the taxpayers, the property owners of Pickens County (have) to pick up the slack,"" Tate said.\He was referring the Local Government Fund, a pot of money set up in 1991 to standardize how local governments receive their due in tax revenues from seven sources: banks, beer, wine, gasoline, motor transport, alcohol (mini bottle) and income taxes.\The total amount was set at 4.5 percent of the previous year's state general fund budget.\But in the last five fiscal years -- 2010-14 -- local governments have been shorted a total of $252.5million, according to the Municipal Association of South Carolina.\""I will not vote for a budget that does not fully fund Pickens County,"" he said.\Deteriorating roads and finding the money to repair them is another issue important to Pickens County, he said.\""What we have is not a revenue problem, what we have is a spending problem and a priority problem,"" Tate said. ""The state does not need to raise taxes to increase revenues to fix roads. We've got the money to fix roads.""\He said the state's priority on road spending should be reversed. He said the state is spending significantly more money on new projects than on road maintenance, such as resurfacing.\""That's upside down,"" Tate said. ""We need to stop any kind of new construction until we get the roads we have up to at least good condition.""\He wants cities and counties to take over much of the road maintenance but only if they can keep the 16 cents per gallon gas tax to pay for the work.\Another issue on the minds of voters, he said, is Second Amendment gun rights.\People have the right to protect themselves by obtaining concealed weapon permits and carrying their weapons with them, Tate said. He added that he opposes gun free zones where guns are not allowed in public places.\He said he is willing to compromise and negotiate on the issue to eliminate as many gun free zones in public spaces.\""I know people are going to be real jumpy about schools. ... but I would like to eliminate as many gun free zones as possible because ... CWP (concealed weapon permit) holders have the same safety records as police officers with their guns.""\He opposes tax incentives to ""bribe"" companies to relocate to the state, saying that practice is unfair to native South Carolina businesses. The best way to attract business and industry to eliminate the corporate tax and reform the state income tax, he said.\""The best way to increase tax revenues is to cut taxes,"" he said, citing a Reagan principle. ""If you do away with the corporate tax you benefit the companies that are here, plus you make it a more business friendly environment to attract new business.""\He also advocates school choice, saying free market competition, improves product, cuts costs and promotes innovation.\He said he knows he needs to persuade citizens and fellow lawmakers to adopt the Reagan principles.\""All I can do is go to the people to make the case.""\LEARN MORE\Visit votericktate.com."
77,"Infrastructure is a hot topic these days. From the Palmetto State's headline-grabbing debate over raising the gas tax to improve roads to a national emphasis on improving infrastructure, it seems everyone is interested in the systems that most people take for granted.\But not all infrastructure systems are created equal. You probably notice every pothole on your way to work, yet how often do you stop to think about the complexity of our wastewater treatment system? Just because an infrastructure system is out of sight, doesn't mean it should be out of mind.\Few systems fit the ""out of sight, out of mind"" model better than a modern sewage system. Not everyone drives, but pretty much everyone does flush. And until something breaks, sending hundreds or thousands of gallons of untreated waste into rivers or lakes, or backs up into your house, does the public ever think about what happened to the water that magically exited their households.\We at Renewable Water Resources (ReWa) cannot and will not take our wastewater infrastructure for granted. We are working on several projects now to improve the capacity of our system. One such project is Dig Greenville, a $46 million wastewater conveyance project that will feature a roughly one-mile long gravity sewer tunnel that will be 100 feet below ground spanning across downtown Greenville from Hudson Street to Cleveland Park. This tunnel will be created using a special drill that will bore underneath downtown Greenville for 36 months. The project is designed to meet Greenville County's sewage basin needs for the next 100 years.\Dig Greenville is more than just a big drill boring under one of the nation's leading downtown areas. It is needed because the current system for the Reedy River Basin, which affects Greenville all the way to Travelers Rest, is nearing capacity. If nothing is done, economic development is threatened because no additional wastewater flow can be added to the sewer lines. While the project is a long-term fix, Dig Greenville will also meet immediate needs by providing an increased buffer against sewer surcharges due to inflow and infiltration during rain events.\ReWa is charged with ensuring our system can always handle the needs of a growing population. That is why we support legislation such as the Water Infrastructure Flexibility Act, which would provide local communities with increased flexibility when complying with Clean Water Act requirements for updates to water infrastructure projects. Consider these facts, from the American Society of Civil Engineers' (ASCE) 2017 Infrastructure Report Card:\The Environmental Protection Agency estimates $271 billion will be needed for wastewater infrastructure over the next 25 years\Water and wastewater services receive less than 5 percent of the funds the federal government earmarks for all major infrastructure categories\Local governments rely on funding from a mix of sources, primarily in the form of sewer rates and dedicated fees such as those for stormwater or watershed restoration, local taxes, grants, and federal money.\The following excerpt from the ASCE's 2017 report card accurately describes the situation we face in the Upstate: ""As cities continue to experience population growth, particularly in the South and West, new housing developments are constructed, and rural households switch from septic systems to public sewers, pressure on existing centralized systems and treatment plant infrastructure will require billions of dollars in new investment to meet federal regulatory requirements.""\The ASCE gives the sewer infrastructure in our nation a D+ on its 2017 report card, and while the organization did not provide information specific to South Carolina, ReWa is committed to maintaining our wastewater infrastructure at a much higher level: the level that our customers have come to expect and deserve.\While all of the current and planned projects require considerable investment, we cannot afford to be ""penny wise and pound foolish"", as the old saying goes. We have to continue to make the investments necessary to keeping our wastewater system working efficiently. ReWa's upcoming five year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) estimates around $300 million will be needed to fund infrastructure improvements and future capacity needs.\ReWa serves more than 400,000 industrial, commercial and residential customers throughout parts of five Upstate counties with one goal: To promote a cleaner environment and protect the public health and water quality of the Upstate waterways while providing and developing the necessary sewer infrastructure to support our growing needs.\As we move forward with these projects to ensure we can meet our goal for generations to come, we appreciate your understanding the complexity of this undertaking, and hope that you appreciate the miracle that happens every time you flush!\Graham W. Rich is the chief executive officer of Renewable Water Resources (ReWa), whose mission is to improve our community's quality of life by transforming wastewater into renewable resources using responsible and innovative solutions.\graham W.

78,"
For the third consecutive time, John's Island Republican Chris Cannon is trying to oust incumbent Curtis Inabinett from his House District 116 seat.
\
Inabinett, a Democrat who represents rural parts of Charleston and Colleton counties, said he wants to continue working with other lawmakers to make public education a priority and make sure there is a fair tax structure and a clean environment.
\
He also said he wants to continue helping citizens in his district cut through bureaucratic red tape to solve community problems.
\
Inabinett said he wants to be realistic about what he tells people he can accomplish if he is re- elected.
\
""You think you can go up there and change the world, but it doesn't always happen that way,"" he said. ""There are a lot of unforeseen issues you become involved in.""
\
Inabinett said he's the best candidate because he has been involved, and remains involved, in many issues that directly affect people in District 116.""
\
Cannon said it's time for someone to go to Columbia who will represent the entire district.
\
He contends that Inabinett ignores the northern portion of the district that includes John's Island and the resort communities of Kiawah and Seabrook islands.
\
The northern part is like a suburb of Charleston, and the southern part is very rural, so it's a mixed bag and it's difficult to handle, he said.
\
Cannon said voters should elect him because the district is highly overlooked.
\
""The rural areas get pretty much neglected, and Inabinett neglects the northern part of the district. Inabinett seems like he has no involvement in John's Island and Wadmalaw,"" Cannon said.
\
For Cannon, there are two major problems in the district: bridges and growth.
\
It's absurd to still have two obsolete swing bridges on the Stono River, he said, and there are several smaller bridges in the district that also need to be re- placed.
\
Plans to replace both the Stono bridges are under way.
\
""I consider bridge replacement a top priority in this district. As far as funding for bridges, I'm not at all opposed to tolls. I think there is a toll mania, and it's excessive. I'm definitely in favor of raising the gas tax to fund new bridges,"" he said.
\
""South Carolina and Georgia have some of the lowest gasoline prices and a couple extra pennies to raise a few million dollars won't be much of a burden.""
\
At the same time, Charleston's urban area is quickly progressing south along U.S. Highway 17.
\
""John's Island and the U.S. Highway 17 corridor near Ravenel are growing rapidly, and this needs to be addressed. It's growing tremendously and it's going to look like the Savannah Highway corridor and Highway 17 in Mount Pleasant,"" he said
\
Cannon calls himself a ""strong conservationist and environmentalist.""
\
""I feel we have a relatively pristine area, and we need to do everything to protect that,"" Cannon said.
\
Inabinett, meanwhile, wants the opportunity to continue the work he has started.
\
""I'm one of those who worked to get full-day kindergarten, something a lot of people don't know,"" he said.
\
Inabinett said he and state Sen. McKinley Washington, D-Ravenel, worked with Charleston County to acquire property for a recreational facility near R.D. Schroder Middle School in Hollywood.
\
He introduced legislation in the last session that mandates constitutional amendments be made available to the general public in advance of elections. It passed both houses.
\
He also introduced a bill that would take out of the constitution language about interracial marriages. CHRIS CANNON

79,"Retired judge Gary E. Clary of Central is confident a three-pronged approach -- education, infrastructure and economic development, each supporting the other -- is what Pickens County and the rest of the state needs to prosper.\Clary, 66, of 111 Hammock Court, is seeking the GOP nomination for the state House District 3 seat in the June 10 primary. His opponent is Ed Harris of Clemson. The winner will face Libertarian candidate Travis McCurry in the Nov. 4 general election.\He is a retired Circuit Court judge who earned a BA in history from Clemson and a Juris Doctorate from the University of South Carolina. After law school he worked in Washington, D.C., as minority counsel of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Internal Security and as a legislative assistant for the late U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond. He now is involved in mediation and arbitration.\To accomplish his legislative goals, Clary said he would go to Columbia with the attitude of respect and a willingness to listen.\""You can't go to Columbia with the attitude that you are going to be against everything and for nothing and expect to get anything done,"" he said. ""I want to be someone who is regarded as reasonable, serious about situations. And to listen to other people. It's not just my idea or my way. We've got to have a consensus in order to pass anything.""\The state needs an educational system that prepares students not only for colleges and technical schools, but also ensures they finish high school with the training and education they need to be productive citizens, he said.\""If we've got an educated, well-trained work force then we are going to be able to continue to attract the high-caliber and high-quality industry that we've been attracting over the last couple of decades,"" Clary said.\But businesses and industries will be disinclined to locate or expand in a state with failing infrastructure, he said.\""It doesn't take a lot to figure out that our infrastructure is falling apart,"" Clary said. ""Our roads and bridges need a lot of attention and a lot of repair.""\Repairing roads and bridges will cost billions and Clary does not believe Gov. Nikki Haley's solution to pay for road work through the state general fund will work.\He said most estimates are that the state would need to spend $29billion over the next 20 years to bring roads and bridges up to standard.\""Paying for it $100million, $200million at a time (from the general fund) -- the math doesn't add up for the 20-year period,"" he said.\Lawmakers need to devise a way to generate the money needed for infrastructure work, he said.\""The most logical is we need to look closely at our gas tax, we need to look at ... taxes on vehicles, we need to look at fees on driver's licenses and various things like this,"" he said. ""I don't think there is any one thing that is going to fix it, I think it's going to take a number of things to do that.""\""This is not something that is going to go away. And it's not something that is going to get better. Roads are going to have to have attention and care each and every year because we are looking at decades of neglect that put us where we are right now.""\One way to fund education and infrastructure, both of which are key to economic development, is to find ""efficiencies"" that save money, he said.\""I think that our government has to operate effectively and efficiently,"" Clary said. ""In order to do that we need to be very careful with the way we spend our money and look at each and every program that comes before the Legislature and each and every department of government and make sure we are getting the bang for the buck we should be getting.""\The state can create an environment favorable to business and industrial growth if it adequately funds education and infrastructure, he said. That, in turn, brings more tax dollars which can be used to pay for education and roads and bridges, he said.\""We've got to continue to be aggressive in trying to attract these unknown companies that can come in here and offer employment for the people of our state.""\Clary said he's always had a desire to be in public service.\""I can think of no better place to serve than if I would fortunate enough to be elected by the citizens of District 3 to be their representative,"" he said. ""I would provide them with strong, serious leadership that they expect and that I would use every bit of knowledge I have to solve the very serious problems that face our state.""\LEARN MORE\Visit claryforhouse.com."
80,"Congress OKs aid for auto park roads, interstate connector to Grand Strand\By Tim Smith\STAFF_WRITER\tcsmith@greenvillenews.com\COLUMBIA -- A federal highway funding bill passed by the House on Friday would send nearly $3 billion to South Carolina over six years, including more than $40 million for Upstate transportation projects.\The bill would pay $6.8 million to build roads in Clemson University's International Center for Automotive Research, $3.6 million to improve West Georgia Road near Simpsonville, and $1 million for a combined bus and train station in Greenville.\President Bush is expected to sign the bill.\The bill includes $81 million toward the state's portion of the proposed Interstate 73 that will connect Detroit and Myrtle Beach and $16 million for a bridge across Lake Marion that is opposed by Gov. Mark Sanford.\The money is part of a $286.4 billion surface transportation bill that also increases the share of federal gas tax dollars South Carolina can keep. By 2008, officials said, the bill would return to the state 92 percent of the federal gas taxes generated here, up from 90.5 percent now.\""The funding for these projects will improve our infrastructure and make South Carolina more competitive while also improving safety and our quality of life,"" said U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of Greenville, who helped work out a compromise between the House and Senate versions of the bill.\""The highway bill is very good news for motorists in South Carolina,"" said U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham. ""It truly moves the ball forward in our efforts to build new roads while maintaining and improving the ones we currently have.""\The $2.9 billion is an increase of about 28 percent over the amount the state currently receives, according to the offices of Graham and DeMint.\The bill would also pay for a safety program aimed at rural roads, funding improvements such as rumble strips, wider lanes, guard rails and more and better signs.\South Carolina's back roads are the deadliest in the country behind only Arizona and Florida, a national nonprofit research group has reported. The fatality rate on the state's secondary roads is five times that of other types of roads.\The state has been hampered in its funding of improvements for secondary roads, which total about 25,000 miles in South Carolina, because they are not eligible for federal aid. DeMint filed legislation to give the state more flexibility in its use of highway money. The safety improvements funded by Friday's bills can be used on any public road.\""This bill accomplishes one of my top goals for the year by giving our state more control over our highway dollars,"" DeMint said. ""But much more needs to be done. I hope that the next reauthorization (bill) will address serious reforms and give states full control over their highways.""\In addition to the three Greenville County projects, the bill would also fund three Spartanburg County projects: $6.8 million for improvements to State 9; $800,000 for the Brockman-McClimon interchange, which would help construct an additional I-85 airport interchange; and $800,000 for the Hub City Connector, a Spartanburg stretch of the statewide Palmetto Trail for pedestrians and cyclists.\Also funded would be $11.6 million for the Palmetto Parkway in Aiken, $3.7 million for the I-385 interchange for State 14 in Laurens County, $3.6 million for the extension of Wells Highway in Oconee County, $400,000 to replace the Milford Road Bridge and $212,000 to replace the Murphy Road East Bridge, both in Anderson County.\The bill would also pay for $2.2 million in improvements to Frontage Road in Laurens and $188,000 for improvements to Murphy Road West in Anderson County.\""That's good news for those projects,"" said Tee Hooper of Greenville, who chairs the state Department of Transportation Commission. ""Any additional dollars will be a plus.""\The I-73 work in South Carolina is expected to cost more than $2 billion. The project has been designated a ""Corridor of Regional and National Significance,"" a label that will make it easier for the state to get I-73 funds in the future, said U.S. Rep.

The S.C. Senate 34 race features a matchup between an old-time country politician and the Senate's only party independent for the seat representing Mount Pleasant and East Cooper in Columbia.
\
Former Republican U.S. Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr. is the heavy favorite against independent Greg Smith in the District 34 race.
\
Ravenel, who at age 69 is attempting a political comeback, has an advantage in that the coastal district - covering an area from Mount Pleasant to Murrells Inlet - is overwhelmingly Republican and formed the heart of his old seat in Congress.
\
But Smith, a Democrat-turned-independent from Murrells Inlet, is out to prove a point: that it is wrong to draw Statehouse districts based on race.
\
Smith, who is white, won a precedent- setting victory last month when a panel of federal judges agreed with his lawsuit and ruled his district was one of nine Statehouse districts gerrymandered last year solely to create more black-majority seats in the Legislature.
\
The court ordered a remap and new elections in those districts by next year, meaning the winner of the District 34 race could end up running a new campaign in less than 12 months.
\
The remap is also sure to affect the current District 34 boundaries, which encompass 75,000 people from Mount Pleasant, Sullivan's Island, the Isle of Palms, McClellanville, Pawleys Islands and Murrells Inlet.
\
Ravenel
\
Ravenel has lived a traveling show of South Carolina politics. He previously served in the S.C. House of Representatives from 1953- 58, then served in the state Senate from 1981-86, when he won Charleston's seat in Congress.
\
His congressional accomplishments on the national scene were few. He introduced mainly trade-related legislation, and was able to get only one bill passed - naming the Ralph Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston.
\
He says he was in the minority Republican Party those years and spent most of his time in constituent service. He adds that he fought for every pro-environment and pro-defense bill.
\
After eight years in Congress he left to run an unsuccessful campaign for governor, losing the Republican nomination to David Beasley in a runoff. Appointed by Beasley in 1995 to head up the troubled Charleston Naval Base Redevelopment Authority, he was widely praised for calming the authority's personality conflicts and getting redevelopment back on track.
\
Ravenel says he wants back in politics because he has the time, the personality and the party affiliation to get things done. Most notable about his qualifications, he says, is that, ""I get along with everybody.""
\
His top priority is a Cooper River bridge replacement. Ravenel envisions uniting all the officials and lawmakers from the areas encompassing the state's top five road problems into one legislative force.
\
Although he doesn't have specifics on how to fund the bridge, Ravenel says the first step is auditing the state Transportation Department and then getting all lawmakers speaking as one voice.
\
""I'm going to tackle the problem of replacing the bridges,"" he said, ""before some terrible tragedy happens."" Ravenel and members of his family haven't used the old John P. Grace Memorial Bridge in two years.
\
One trend he'd like to see reversed is addressing the 10 percent of the state's gas tax that doesn't go to roads. It goes to the state's general fund.
\
He also says recruiting jobs to the Georgetown area is the largest business need. He backs making the state superintendent of education a cabinet position, supports the Confederate flag staying above the Statehouse, and favors sending the flag issue to a statewide referendum during an election year.
\
Ravenel questioned why anyone would want to elect a nonparty- aligned candidate like Smith. ""They don't run anything. Who is he going to go to?""
\
He opposes raising the 65-mph speed limit on the interstates.
\
Smith
\
Smith, a former newspaper man, also has been active in South Carolina politics. He previously served on Georgetown County Council before being elected to the Senate in 1992 as a Democrat.
\
He quit the party to become an independent after senior senators carved up his district and threatened his political future, leaving him only 23 percent of his old district.
\
Smith says he won passage for several major pieces of legislation, including a law requiring mandatory arrests in cases of spousal domestic violence.
\
He was on the subcommittee that helped write the welfare reform bill that put time limits on benefits. He also worked on stiffening the environmental regulations in the hog farm bill.
\
""Basically we went in 180 degrees and made it a more strict measure rather than a more lax measure, like when it started off,"" he said. ""I sponsored 25 bills that became law, so I feel like I was active.""
\
Smith is the only independent in the Senate, which he said is a plus when challenging something as unfair as racial gerrymandering.
\
""It is my position that only an independent could bring that court case,"" he said. ""Racial gerrymandering is really a party process.""
\
Smith said he also helped eliminate what essentially amounted to free hospital care for legislators at the Medical University of South Carolina.
\
Previously the hospital had to waive deductibles and co-payments for legislators who got treatment, which meant they didn't have to pay anything over their insurance.
\
If re-elected he, too, wants to tackle the district's road problems and make teachers accountable for student test scores, a notion that was defeated in the Statehouse last year.
\
Smith said it might pass if teachers and administrators were first invited to give their thoughts.
\
He favors increasing the speed limit on the interstates, but wants it connected to reduced insurance rates, mandatory driver education classes, raising the state's legal driving age to 17 and longer supervision before a license is given to a teen-ager.
\
He wants to bring the Confederate flag down from the Dome, voting for the compromise to place it in a monument on the Statehouse grounds.
\
Both men also have been endorsed by the S.C. Sierra Club, based on their environmental voting records. Officials described the mutual endorsement as an environmental ""win-win.""

82,"
COLUMBIA -- Legislators will launch an inquiry into why the state Department of Transportation went broke and had to turn to the federal government to bail the agency out and save highway construction jobs.
\
Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Larry Grooms, R-Bonneau, said Thursday he will convene a panel of legislators on Sept. 1 to review the situation surrounding the department decision to ask the federal government for a $52 million cash advance.
\
Grooms said cronyism may have crept into the Transportation Department's process for deciding what road and bridge projects to approve. His allegation came about the same time Thursday that the department's governing commission almost indefinitely delayed efforts to begin construction of controversial Interstate 73.
\
The commission narrowly defeated a proposal to back off from seeking a loan to pay for I-73 construction, among other projects, after concerns were raised about the department's ability to pay for it. The vote derailed an attempt to quash the project.
\
Grooms' call for a legislative fact-finding mission comes four years after major mismanagement at the agency led to a head-to-toe overhaul amid allegations that South Carolina roads were being built based on political clout rather than actual need.
\
""I've got contractors, DOT employees, former employees who are telling me their perspectives,"" Grooms said. ""I am in the process of separating fact and fiction.""
\
Meanwhile, the cash-strapped agency announced it will defer $24 million in construction projects through September to catch up on its bills. The projects are secondary road resurfacing, road markings and a fence repair. None are in Berkeley, Charleston or Dorchester counties.
\
The Post and Courier first revealed the agency's cash flow troubles last week. Transportation officials say construction during the summer peak season outstripped the agency's ability to pay contractors for their work within the typical 30-day window. Some contractors and subcontractors told the newspaper they were facing grave situations if they weren't paid, despite the Transportation Department's efforts to make sure no companies were put out of business as a result of the cash flow problems.
\
The agency also fell more than $12 million behind making payments in recent months on major construction loans to the state Transportation Infrastructure Bank.
\
With Gov. Nikki Haley's blessing, the Transportation department secured the $52 million from the federal government. The money is for a year's worth of reimbursements to the state for major construction projects that the federal government usually would have paid out over the next 12 months.
\
At fault for the cash crunch are projects finishing ahead of schedule and the diminishing buying power of the state's 16 cents gasoline tax, set in 1987. The state's gas tax is fourth lowest in the nation.
\
What's more, the governor's Transportation Secretary Robert St. Onge said the agency's eagerness to update and repair the state's roads and bridges was too aggressive and outpaced the short-term resources. Going forward, he said he wants to build a cash reserve of about $60 million. The agency's engineering and finance officials also will work more closely to manage project estimates.
\
For a long-term resolution, St. Onge said the agency is putting together recommendations to take to Haley and the Legislature about a new way to pay for road and bridge construction and repair, to ease the agency's reliance on the fuel tax.
\
Commissioner Sarah Nuckles of Rock Hill blames poor planning for the cash crunch. She has advocated for two years that the agency take precautionary steps to avoid late payments to contractors.
\
Nuckles said the agency should abandon its plans to borrow $344 million, more than $100 million of which would be used to pay for I-73 to connect Interstate 95 to the Grand Strand. She said taking out that bond would eat up as much as $35 million of the agency's annual cash flow into the future.
\
The decision should be placed with the Legislature and the governor, not the commission, Nuckles said. She said powerful legislators pressured the commission into approving the bond.
\
Nuckles also noted that the federal government is toying with the idea of reducing the cash it sends back to South Carolina by $200 million a year. The Transportation department's annual budget is currently $1.1 billion, including about $440 million in state funds.
\
Commissioner John Edwards of Travelers Rest said the $344 million loan should wait for a time when the state's financial house is in order.
\
""I think in this financial environment we're going to have to do a lot of things to get the faith of the people of South Carolina back on our side,"" Edwards said.
\
Commission Chairman Danny Isaac of Myrtle Beach cast the tie-breaking vote to keep the I-73 plans on the books. He scolded Nuckles during the meeting for speaking out publicly about the agency's financial problems.
\
Isaac, who participated in the meeting by conference call, blamed the economy, not agency management for the cash crunch. He challenged Nuckles' facts on the situation, but did not provide specifics.
\
""To go to the media and show the disparity of your personal opinions is counter productive,"" Isaac said. ""... It's an absolute insult. Verify your facts. That's all I ask.""
\
Isaac, who represents the 1st District, has not returned phone calls from The Post and Courier on the situation.
\
Nuckles reported being bullied by fellow commissioners. She said after Thursday's meeting, one whispered in her ear: ""You don't deserve to be a commissioner.""

LEGISLATIVE INQUIRY
\
THE ISSUE: The state Department of Transportation faced a significant cash flow crunch that resulted in late payments to contractors and the agency falling behind on its construction loans. Transportation officials turned to the federal government to provide $52 million in cash reimbursements in one lump sum this week rather than spread out over the next 12 months.
\
THE PROBLEM: Contractors and subcontractors report that the late payments put their businesses in jeopardy. Allegations also persist that the agency is slipping back into its old ways of bowing to pressure from powerful lawmakers to build roads in their districts, rather than according to state needs.
\
WHAT'S NEXT: Sen. Larry Grooms, R-Bonneau, will convene a panel of legislators on Sept. 1 to investigate. Transportation officials are adjusting internal practices to better estimate cash balances and build a reserve. The agency is developing recommendations to ease the state's reliance on fuel taxes to build roads and bridges.

83,"
WASHINGTON - Of all the lines in Washington, only one has caught the eye of U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C.
\
It is the line of newly elected Republicans jockeying for a spot on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where legislation soon will be considered to revamp the nation's laws and funding formulas dealing with all federal surface transportation programs.
\
Clyburn wryly notes, ""They don't want on that committee for their health.""
\
No, what they want is a say on the iced tea, or, more accurately, ISTEA, the ""Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.""
\
The bill is important to South Carolina because there may be a chance to grab funds to put toward replacing the Cooper River bridges, and because there may be a chance to revise the formula under which states receive a return on gas taxes paid to the federal government.
\
Since 1956, South Carolina has received an average of 80 cents in highway funds for every gas tax dollar sent to Washington, though the figure dropped to 52 cents two years ago.
\
That was an anomaly, however, caused in part by a special allocation of $60 million received by the state a year earlier to widen I-85 in Greenville to six lanes.
\
Still, no one's happy about getting 80 cents on the dollar, and officials from South Carolina and other ""donor states"" are hopeful about working out a more equitable deal this year.
\
The optimism may be wishful thinking, however, judging by the political line-up.
\
In the House, Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster is a Republican from Pennsylvania, a state that gets more than it gives.
\
""I don't think you're going to see Bud Shuster let a bill come out of that committee that's going to take anything away from Pennsylvania,"" said Clyburn, South Carolina's only representative on the panel.
\
In the Senate, legislation will emerge from the Environment and Public Works Committee, where the chairman is Republican John Chafee of Rhode Island, another receiver state.
\
Still, momentum has been building among congressmen from states that have been short-changed under the current system.
\
The momentum has taken form in several alternative pieces of legislation, the most notable being the ""Streamlined Transportation Efficiency Program for the 21st Century (STEP-21)"" and the ""Transportation Empowerment Act.""
\
Under Step-21, each state would receive at least a 95 percent return on its contribution to the federal highway trust fund.
\
Under the empowerment act, responsibility for almost all federal highway programs would be turned over to the states.
\
As well, federal fuel tax collections for the highway trust fund would be phased down from 14 cents per gallon to 2 cents per gallon.
\
This ""devolution"" approach is strongly favored by Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., an original co-sponsor of the bill.
\
""We send a dollar to Washington, and it comes back in tatters because bureaucrats and regulators and other states have all taken a piece along the way,"" Inglis says.
\
First District Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., adds, ""I would love that conceptually and philosophically. But it's politically impossible.""
\
Sanford last year introduced a bill that would revamp the formula so that states would receive a 100 percent return on the money they send to Washington.
\
The battle will be joined next month when various House and Senate committees start reviewing the legislation.
\
While Inglis and Sanford already have picked sides, Clyburn, Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., and others in the congressional delegation still are weighing their options.
\
Clyburn, for one, is working behind the scenes in hopes of resurrecting the once-popular highway demonstration project program.
\
The funds for such projects have dried up in recent years due to the federal government's cash-flow problems and amid criticism that highway demonstration projects were nothing more than pork.
\
Sanford in particular says demonstration projects were handed out ""to buy off"" lawmakers from donor states unhappy about the overall funding formula.
\
But Clyburn says no bill will pass this year that looks ""anything like the legislation proposed by Inglis or Sanford.""
\
On the other hand, Clyburn believes that if key players like Chafee and Shuster feel pressure mounting, they might be forced to find a way to appease the donor state rebellion.
\
And while that may not result in a change in funding formulas, it could translate to a chunk of cash that could be spent on South Carolina's bridge and highway projects.
\
The rub, as usual, is funding, and even Clyburn concedes, ""I don't know where the money is going to come from.""
\
Noteworthy is that the original ISTEA legislation contained 539 designated highway projects.
\
A review of the bill by the Congressional Research Service observes that the demonstration projects ""were viewed as essential expressions of congressional priorities by supporters and as pork barrel items by opponents.""
\
""Hence they were, and remain, a controversial feature of the legislation,"" says the Service, the research arm of Congress.
\
As for the Clinton administration, S.C. Transportation Commission Chairman Buck Limehouse notes incoming Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater is from Arkansas, a donor state.
\
He notes with chagrin, however, that the administration seems content with the status quo.
\
Limehouse feels South Carolina would do best by persuading the feds to turn highway programs over to the state. The optimal fallback position is Step-21, he said.
\
Whatever happens, Limehouse feels South Carolina - with one of the most senior delegations in the nation - should emerge in better shape than it is now.
\
""We have a very strong delegation,"" he said. ""We should be able to affect the outcome of that legislation."" HIGHWAY FUNDS GLOSSARY
\
ISTEA: The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. It is the authorizing legislation for federal highway, highway safety and transit programs that expires at the end of fiscal 1997.
\
STEP-21: The Streamlined Transportation Efficiency Program for the 21st Century. This alternative proposal, backed by 21 states, requires that each state must receive at least a 95 percent return on its contribution to the federal highway trust fund.
\
The Transportation Empowerment Act: Another proposal that would turn over control of almost all federal highway programs to the states. Federal fuel tax collections for the highway trust fund would be phased down from the current 14 cents per gallon to 2 cents per gallon.
\
Donor State: a state (South Carolina is one) that pays more in gas taxes than it receives back in highway funds. The number of donor states varies by year.
\
Receiver State: one that gets more than it gives.
\
Devolution: bureaucratic jargon that means control of highway programs would shift from Washington down to the states.

Henry McMaster and John Warren tried to shape the labels they're wearing and the ones they've attached to the other.\With less than a week to go before Republican voters decide whether they want McMaster or Warren as their nominee for governor, they must also decide if they want an incumbent who has spent his career in politics or an outsider and political novice.\""I am proud to be a government outsider,"" said Warren, outlining his skills in the military and the business world that he said would help him as governor.\But McMaster countered that the governor's office ""is not a place for on-the-job training.""\He lectured Warren about talking about ""bullying lawmakers,"" the key leaders with whom he would have to foster working relationships.\""The government is not the military,"" said McMaster, adding that he had a record of accomplishments as an elected official.\The theme of the rookie government outsider versus the career politician continued throughout the debate just as it has echoed on a campaign trail elongated by Tuesday's runoff.\McMaster has repeatedly likened himself to an experienced coach, telling the public that they shouldn't replace a coach who is winning with a rookie.\Warren, a Greenville businessman and former Marine, has proudly worn the label of outsider, a conservative he believes can bring reforms to the Statehouse, battle corruption and bring business-like sense to state government.\While McMaster has reached into the White House for an endorsement by President Donald Trump, Warren is using the endorsement of a star of Duck Dynasty.\Warren was endorsed last week by Catherine Templeton, who once branded herself as the ultimate outsider who would take a ""buzzsaw"" to the status quo, even though she once led two state agencies.\""John Warren is an outsider. He's a successful businessman,"" she said. ""He doesn't owe anybody anything or need anything from anyone. We voted for Donald Trump because he was going to drain the swamp and clean it up. That's why I'm with John Warren. Henry McMaster is not Donald Trump.""\Warren framed the issue Wednesday evening as a new conservative reform movement versus ""failed leadership.""\He ticked off a series of problems, from $4 billion in public money lost in the failed nuclear project in Fairfield County, to the state's standing as last in the nation in education to crumbling roads and over-taxation to corruption.\Warren pointed out that the man McMaster reveres, Trump, was an outsider when he ran for president.\""Trump had no government experience,"" Warren said. ""We need someone like Donald Trump to go to Columbia and drain the swamp.""\McMaster argued that Trump, who has endorsed him and plans to come to South Carolina Monday to campaign for him, ""has been involved in politics for decades.""\""You're a good man, but you're not Donald Trump,"" said McMaster, sparking loud applause from the audience at the Newberry Opera House.\When asked about tax cuts, Warren charged that McMaster has been governor for a year without any tax cuts being enacted. McMaster responded by saying he had fought the increase in the gas tax, believing there was sufficient funds without any tax hike.\""We need to change the coach,"" said Warren, poking at McMaster's repeated phrase.\McMaster suggested several issues with the way Warren is approaching the governor's office because of his inexperience, including talking about all the problems he saw.\""If you can't be positive, you shouldn't be governor,"" he said.\He also said that Warren was talking about ""bullying lawmakers,"" which he said would be a counter-productive approach when governors need a good working relationship with the General Assembly and its leaders.\""Politics is an art of addition,"" he said, ""not subtraction.""\Warren said he would not work with some ""bad apples"" in the Legislature, including Senate President Pro Tempore High Leatherman, a Florence Republican often described as the most powerful leader in the General Assembly.\Warren said he would work to find and fund a candidate to oppose Leatherman and others, an approach tried unsuccessfully by former Gov. Nikki Haley.\McMaster said he supported Leatherman when he was right and opposed him when he was wrong.\Warren replied that McMaster had a chance to oppose Leatherman by siding with his election opponent several years ago but McMaster sided with Leatherman.\Warren has repeatedly questioned McMaster's ties to a longtime political consultant, Richard Quinn, the central figure in an ongoing Statehouse corruption probe that has netted several current or former lawmakers.\""We're not winning,"" Warren said. ""Political cronies are winning.""\McMaster repeatedly pointed out issues he said Warren does not fully understand because of his inexperience, such as Warren's charge that the state's highway agency lacks a 10-year strategic plan, which the governor said is not true.\At one point, Warren said had he been governor, the state's failed nuclear project and the massive loss of ratepayers' money would not have happened.\McMaster said Warren would have had to be governor 20 years ago because the laws that enabled the fiasco to occur were passed more than a decade ago.\McMaster said it was he who battled to find the documents and have them made public that told the story of what happened, and he said he would veto any bill that continues to make ratepayers pay for the failed project.\""This most important thing we need to do is have experience in the chief executive office,"" McMaster said. ""There's no real time for a learning curve, and the governorship is not the place for on-the-job training.""\Warren noted that only he has not taken any money from any of the utilities involved in the nuclear fiasco.\But both the outsider and the incumbent agree on several areas.\Both men oppose expanding Medicaid, oppose offshore drilling, and oppose changing the state's Heritage Act, which protects Confederate monuments.\They also say they both support Trump, though McMaster said he was the first statewide official in any state to endorse Trump while Warren supported U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz at the time.\Warren notes that McMaster initially supported U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, someone he said true conservatives opposed.\McMaster countered, ""I supported Donald Trump when it counted.""\Warren responded by noting that while Trump has widespread support in South Carolina, if all of those supporters also supported McMaster, ""We wouldn't be on this stage tonight.""\Asked if he sought a visit from Trump because he was worried about his race with Warren, McMaster replied that he was not worried.\He pointed out that the state's economy was booming, an environment that can improve the state's education system.\""Our state is going right to the top,"" he said. ""We're winning.""\More coverage\Visit Greenville Online.com for your guide to the runoffs.\Warren, McMaster woo voters in Anderson, 1AA\Republican gubernatorial candidates John Warren and Gov.

87,"Amongst industrialized countries there is a direct relationship between the price of gas and the average size of vehicles driven. It should be no surprise that the United States, with the lowest-price gas, has the biggest vehicles. With the cost of crude oil the same in all countries and refining costs similar, the difference in gas prices is attributable to gas taxes.\Enlightened countries use the gas tax to reduce dependence on imported oil and to help fund superior educational and medical delivery systems -- the U.S. scores last on all measures of academic achievement and medical care.\Why can't we handle this ""no brainer?"" Our dysfunctional, overly combative two-party political system is the answer. Most Democrats do not support higher gas taxes, seeing them as regressive. Many Republicans are afraid of giving the Democrats political leverage if they support raising gas taxes, while other Republicans just don't want to see so much new money going to the federal government where they have no confidence it will be spent correctly and will just lead to ""bigger government.""\Maybe some enlightened states can end-run this stalemate by joining up to raise gas taxes on the state level -- this is already happening in California and certain Northeastern states, but the magnitude of the increases is not sufficient to change vehicle driving habits or capable of funding solutions to major health and education problems.\Here, in South Carolina, we have some of the lowest gas taxes in the country, an over-reliance on gas-guzzling pickup trucks and one of the worst records in the country for graduating kids from high school. Add it up -- higher gas taxes could be good long-term for the state and the country.\Harry Roegner,Salem\U.S. government is poor at prioritizing\I noticed a pair of interesting and somewhat related articles on Aug. 5.\Page 10A: ""Companies hoping to exploit Earth's heat as energy source.""\Page 16A: ""NASA craft sets out for Mars.""\Now when I say ""somewhat related,"" I am referring to tax dollars spent versus potential return on investment.\On the one hand, the article states, an investment of $800 million to $1 billion could potentially produce electricity by 2050 equaling the combined output of all 104 nuclear power plants in the United States. This energy resource is said to be clean, quiet and virtually inexhaustible with nearly zero impact on climate or the environment.\On the other hand, NASA has just sent a robotic geological probe on a 10-month voyage to Mars in search of an answer to that question which keeps us all awake at night, i.e., ""Is the Martian polar region capable of supporting microbial life?""\Wow! Is that a ""giant leap for mankind, or what?"" All this for the bargain basement price tag of only $420 million. And, if history is any teacher, the odds are 1 in 3 of a successful landing.\Most of us understand the meaning of the word priorities. When we don't have unlimited resources in our daily lives, we find it necessary to carefully select those things which are most important and those that can be moved to the ""nice to have but can't really afford"" ledger. Don't we all wish our government would do likewise?\It was the late, great Sen. Everett Dirksen who once said, ""A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.""\Marvin Hambleton, Easley\Sen. Graham has an excellent record\Sen. Lindsey Graham and I may not agree on all things which have come up, but for the most part his voting record is excellent.\For those who are critical of Sen. Graham, I suggest that his total record be reviewed, and consider what we had for some 40 years prior to Sen. Graham with the entrenched Democrat towing the party line.\There have been several letters and articles in the newspaper about Sen. Graham being ""booed"" at the state convention. I was on the front row and did not hear it. I think that has been overblown by those who wish to complain about Sen. Graham.\Edward Britt, Easley\Liberal arts degrees are important, too\In a recent editorial praising the state's plan to award more lucrative scholarships to students who major in math, science and related fields, you purport to entertain doubts about the plan's equity, stating, ""Are students who major in math and science truly more valuable to society than liberal arts majors, social workers, teachers and artists?""\I took the question to the rhetorical, and I take the answer to be ""no."" It is patently unfair to do this, and unwise. Entirely apart from whether 18-year-olds are ready to commit to a major, much less a career path, before they enter college, looms the larger question of what constitutes effective preparation for a knowledge-based economy.\The best way for South Carolina to be competitive -- and to retain and attract talent -- is to provide a rigorous and well-rounded academic experience for every student at every level of study. Many skills benefit a diverse economy, but a college education should be accessible and fairly funded for everyone who wants it, regardless of future major or career. For most students a liberal arts education is an excellent choice. This education includes study of the arts, the humanities, and yes, mathematics and the sciences. It provides a historical, cultural and global perspective, and with that comes the confidence, innovation and flexibility to adjust quickly and creatively to economic, political and cultural change.\Teach every student how to read, write and think critically and effectively; fund higher education fairly for those who choose it; and South Carolina will have the human resources to meet the future with great expectation.\Anne Leen, Greenville\Power at all costs drives state, nation\Re: The Greenville News article of this date regarding Rep. Converse Chellis ""election"" to fill Thomas Ravenel's unexpired term as state treasurer.\I fully support Gov. Mark Sanford's comment of ""a mockery"" in regard to this latest ""good ol' boy"" action by our ""lawmakers.""\The governor's additional remarks in regard to the legislative body's lack of diligence and careful consideration of the candidate and issues are also right on the mark. House Speaker Bobby Harrell's and Senate Majority Leader Harvey Peeler's feelings that the governor's comments were ""disappointing"" and ""unfortunate"" are indicative of the attitude of the ""good ol' boys.""\Peeler's desire that the governor show a little more leadership is laughable. How do you lead a group that has a goal of maintaining power at all costs rather than fulfilling the needs of the people of South Carolina?\Our state Legislature is a mirror image of the national Democratic Party -- their goals are to oppose the president and governor, respectively, in any attempt to meet the needs of the nation or state. Party power and personal greed now drive our politics, and we only have politicians, not statesmen. William A. Wilson, Taylors\We must reverse our atmospheric impact\Let's clear the air, so to speak, about some issues of global warming. First, the population of humans on the planet has no direct effect on global warming. Humans are blamed because we are the only beings that routinely burn things for our purposes. This burning converts fuel into a gas, primarily carbon dioxide, and adds it to the air. Now it turns out that burning plant matter like wood or grain doesn't change the balance of carbon dioxide in the air. This is because a log or a pile of grass produces the same amount of carbon dioxide if it is burned or allowed to rot on the ground (note: rotting also converts the material to carbon dioxide).\The problem is that a few hundred years ago man started digging up material from the ground, like coal and oil, and burning it. This took the so-called fossil fuels (carbon) out of basically permanent storage, and changed these into gases that were added to the atmosphere. We are now finding that this is significantly changing the balance of gases that make up the atmosphere.\This is alarming because other records show that the Earth's average temperature follows the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, more carbon dioxide -- higher temperature.\We need to stop suspecting that the issue of global warning was created as a political ploy or a means for some to take money from others. We created this concern with our intellect -- we need to use our intellect to best address it.\Mike Hackenberg, Piedmont"
88,"Road design called big factor in wrecks by Upstate drivers\Feds say wider pavement can cut deaths 22 percent\By Ron Barnett\STAFF_WRITER\rbarnett@greenvillenews.com\You can drive up and down a narrow country road in the Upstate every day of your life and not have a problem.\But when something does go wrong, the shoulders can be unforgiving.\Sandra Kemp, who lives in the Sandy Flat community, said 50-year-old secondary roads in her area, such as Fews Bridge Road, have become shortcuts for speeders, endangering the lives of people traveling and living along them.\""I think it's too narrow for the traffic it carries ... plus it's got some bad curves on it and you see cars flying down the wrong side of the road coming around the curve,"" she said. ""I think it's a dangerous road, especially for as many school children as drives it.""\There's no question that bad drivers are the biggest reason South Carolina has the third-highest traffic fatality rate in the nation, experts say.\But roadway design was ""an important factor"" in one-third of the accidents that killed 1,529 people on South Carolina roads between 1999 and 2003, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. And widening narrow two-lane roads could reduce fatal accidents by 22 percent, according to the group.\""To say South Carolina has some infrastructure problems is to put it mildly,"" says a report released this week by Governing Magazine called Grading the States 2005.\""The state's roads are the most underfunded in the land and, partially as a result, the fatality rate is the nation's third-highest per mile,"" the report concludes.\This is not news to state and federal legislators. Some of them are hammering out plans to try to put more money into roads -- particularly into the state's 25,000 miles of secondary roads.\There's no easy route to finding the money, though.\""I agree that the roads are in terrible shape and we need to do something about it,"" said state Sen. Ralph Anderson, D-Greenville, although he offered no specific plan to address the problem.\But he said Gov. Mark Sanford's proposal to reduce the state income tax is ill-timed considering needs such as road improvements.\Re-direct funds\Republican Bobby Harrell, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has introduced a bill that he says would re-direct $80 million to $90 million a year into secondary road construction from driver's license fees, vehicle registration fees and other fees that now go into the general fund.\He would phase that in over five years at $15 million per year. If things go according to his plan, the items the money had been paying for would be covered by growth in the tax base.\""It's not painless,"" he said. ""But before anybody starts talking about our tax structure you need to have money going where it belongs.""\U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-Greenville, introduced legislation this week that would give states more authority to decide how to spend federal highway money.\Now the state can't spend any of the approximately $500 million a year it gets in federal road money for secondary roads. The bill would allow spending some of the money on secondary roads as long as it's for safety improvements.\""With South Carolina's needs being so great and our funding resources so limited, the state desperately requires the flexibility to allocate available funding from any source toward our greatest needs,"" DeMint said in a statement released by his office.\Proposal welcomed\Michael Covington, director of government affairs for the South Carolina Department of Transportation, said he welcomes DeMint's proposal, although using some of the federal money for secondary roads would mean taking it from bigger road projects.\The department now widens two-lane roads by four feet when it repaves them, to create ""a more forgiving driving environment,"" he said. But the state discontinued its resurfacing program four years ago because of lack of money.\""That's our biggest crisis right now,"" he said.\When money has been available for road improvements, highway deaths have decreased in South Carolina, said Katherine Barrett, project editor for Governing Magazine, which released the Grading the States report.\The death rate on South Carolina's interstate highways is lower than the national average, officials said, in part because of median dividers and other safety improvements.\Part of the cause\Part of the reason the state is in such a road funding fix is that it takes responsibility for a much larger share of roads than other states, where local governments control more roads, Barrett said.\South Carolina has proportionately fewer miles of two-lane roads than the national average -- 45 percent compared to 55 percent, according to The Road Information Program, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit transportation research group.\But the 25,000 miles under state control -- enough to reach around the globe -- stretches the money thin, Barrett said.\Even if the plans proposed by Harrell and DeMint become law, the state would still be billions of dollars short in bringing its sprawling secondary road system up to date, the DOT's Covington said.\A recently completed study shows a need for $59.7 billion in highway improvements over the next 20 years, he said. At the current rate, the state would have $19.3 billion to meet those needs, he said.\State Rep. Rex Rice, R-Easley, has introduced a bill that would impose a ""petroleum franchise fee"" on all suppliers of motor fuels sold and delivered within South Carolina. The fee would be 5 percent of the retail value at the pump but not more than seven cents a gallon.\South Carolina's 16-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax was sixth lowest in the nation in a 2004 report by the Federation of Tax Administrators.\The state relies on the gas tax, which hasn't been raised since 1987, for 89 percent of its recurring transportation dollars, compared with 49 percent for other states in the region, according to the Grading the States report.\People such as Sandra Cline, who lives in rural northern Greenville County, believe the state already has enough money to do a better job on roads.\""I think they can afford it,"" she said. ""I think that they don't do their budget correctly.""\Improvement needed\She sees plenty of need for safety improvements.\""There's a lot of dump trucks running these back roads. A lot of high shoulders. They're tight,"" she said. ""You have to be extremely careful if you're passing a dump truck because he's hitting the yellow line. It could be very dangerous.""\A big part of the problem is poor planning, said Bob Christmus, who lives in the Blue Ridge area. New housing developments are feeding more and more traffic into the two-lane roads, with more subdivisions still being added to the same unimproved roads, he said.\""They don't look at what's happening in the county to get the infrastructure there before they build these huge developments,"" he said.\Not everyone is against a tax increase for roads, though. Chris Stafford of Blue Ridge said he'd be willing to pay more if it would improve safety.\Many of the wrecks on Upstate roads happen when people run off the edge of the road and lose control, said Trooper Dan Marsceau, a spokesman for the state Highway Patrol. But the leading cause of such accidents is driver inattention, not road conditions, he said.\""Our duty by law is to pay attention,"" he said. ""The law expects us to keep the vehicle between the center line and the edge of the roadway and to keep it under control.""\NARROW ROADS RAISE CONCERNS\""I think they're too narrow for dump trucks, tractor trailers and even cars to pass each other on.""\Sandra Cline, Blue Ridge\""I agree that the roads are in terrible shape, and we need to do something about it.""\State Sen.

Net-metering
\
As energy costs rise and wars are fought in part over energy resources, it is time for our state to join the rest of the nation
\
in supporting those who are willing to invest in solar and other renewable energy technologies.
\
One low-cost program that reduces the cost of solar energy generation is for public electrical utilities to offer net-metering to their customers. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, net- metering programs offered in more than 35 states serve as an important incentive for consumer investment in renewable energy generation.
\
Net-metering enables customers to use their own generation to offset their consumption over a billing period by allowing their electric meters to turn backwards when they generate electricity in excess of their demand.
\
This offset means that customers receive retail prices for the excess electricity they generate. Unfortunately, South Carolina is not one of the states that offers net-metering. Currently, the S.C. Public Service Commission (SCPSC) is receiving written comments to determine whether folks want to have the choice to invest in solar generation with net-metering opportunities. I cannot imagine any South Carolinian who would not want that choice.
\
The current proposal offered by most of the S.C. public electrical utilities allows for non-residential electrical customers to generate electricity, but it does not appear to offer that option for residential electrical customers.
\
North Carolina, for example, allows residential and non- residential customers to sell solar generated power back to the grid.
\
Please join me in urging
\
SCPSC to offer net-metering to residential customers by providing your written comments to the SCPSC no later than Feb. 1.
\
All written comments should reference S.C. Public Service Commission Docket 2005-385-E Order No. 2006-680.

\
The mission of the John Ancrum SPCA is to ensure that every domestic animal is protected and to provide an environment that reflects love, provides activity and nourishes the animals in our care. We are building a state of the art animal shelter that will allow us to increase adoptions while housing animals in a better environment. The new shelter should be ready by November. We are relying on the support of the Lowcountry to help build the facility. We are fortunate to live in a community of individuals, and community and businesses leaders who recognize the need for such a facility and support our mission.

God's messenger
\
According to a Jan. 3 article in The Post and Courier, Pat Robertson is talking to God again.
\
What is it that God finds
\
so appealing about Pat Robertson that he once again picks him as his messenger to deliver warnings of disaster to America?
\
He now tells us that God communicated to him that millions of Americans will die in terrorist attacks on major cities in this country in 2007.
\
Perhaps God wants to move people to smaller cities and is using Pat to get the job done, or, more likely, Pat has completely lost his mind.
\
Is it not time for Mr. Robertson to go away and leave us alone? I think that is long overdue.

Renewable energy
\
After reading The Post and Courier article ""Power from the people?"", my first angry reaction was that, contrary to the opinion expressed in the article, I for one do care about renewable energy and I will pay $36 per year for green power.
\
After my anger subsided, I re-read the article to see if I had understood correctly that ""South Carolinians do not appear to be all that interested in renewable energy."" Knowing the commitment of local organizations like the Robert Lunz chapter of the Sierra Club and the Coastal Conservation League, I felt that this blanket statement about environmental groups and individual citizens could not be true. As for myself, I knew nothing about the poorly attended public hearings the article was talking about, wherever they were. No one had invited me. No one had asked my opinion.
\
My opinion is that we must start to obtain more of our energy from renewable sources. I am not a contractor or an engineer. I can't say that I understand the technicalities of solar panels or net metering. But must every citizen have an in-depth understanding of the ins and outs of renewable energy before he or she can request -- or demand -- of our legislators and public utilities that they make it feasible to obtain more of our energy from renewable sources?
\
The Post and Courier states, ""More than 20 states have passed laws setting thresholds for when a certain percentage of their electricity must come from renewable sources."" And further, ""Legislatures in 40 other states have required utilities to practice net metering, but South Carolina lawmakers have not yet addressed the issue."" Santee Cooper cites that one major reason why homes here are not allowed to feed power back into the grid is that this ""can be hazardous to line workers.""
\
Have these other states lost many line workers in the process?
\
I believe that South Carolinians do want to obtain energy from renewable sources rather than using up non-renewable fossil fuel, much of which comes from the Middle East. Responsible government and industrial leadership should be leading the way in making this happen.

Unions are answer
\
After reading a recent letter to the editor I could not resist responding to the letter writer. Her letter was referring to the Charleston County School bus drivers employed by First Student voting to unionize. I agree with the writer that all of their problems are not solved by voting for a union.
\
But this was a first step to getting their problems solved, because now the company will listen when they speak in one collective voice. I certainly understand the workers' reactions after hearing the results of the election. This was the third vote, and now they will finally have a voice at work.
\
My union, the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 610, which represents the CARTA bus drivers, tried to unionize this group twice.
\
The freedom of workers to join together in unions and bargain collectively is a fundamental human right that U.S. labor law guarantees in principle. But when workers seek to exercise this right today, they nearly always run into a buzzsaw of employer tactics designed to suppress workers' rights to form or join a union.
\
Workers in particular and society as a whole pay a huge price for the widespread denial of the freedom to form unions. This price is measured, in part, by the suppression of wages, enormous and widening gaps in the distribution of income and wealth, weakening of the safety net, decline in civic and political participation, unchecked corporate power and harm to the quality of life.
\
The worst casualty is democracy in the workplace and the entire society.
\
So to the school bus drivers, jump for joy and praise the Lord, because you will now have a voice at work and all of conditions of employment in writing, and that's called a ""contract."" Unions are the answer to improving the standard of living for workers.

Workers' protection
\
I would like to respond to the letter to the editor, ""Unions not answer."" The school bus drivers had two previous union elections in which the union lost.
\
This time, the drivers realized that management would not improve their situation. South Carolina is a ""fire at will"" state, meaning that you can be fired for any reason at all.
\
A union contract is the only protection against at-will employment. South Carolina wages are much lower than the rest of the country, and South Carolina has one of the lowest numbers of union members in the country.
\
Workers organize to gain respect on the job, better wages and benefits, and as a counterbalance to the unchecked power of employers. A union gives workers a voice in improving the quality of products and services. When workers win better wages and benefits and a voice on the job, we end up with stronger communities. After learning of the union victory the other day, a mom told me she hoped this would also improve conditions on the bus, as most drivers put up with unruly children because they are afraid to complain because they might get fired.
\
In states with high unionization, there is less poverty, fewer high school dropouts, less teenage pregnancy and more per pupil spending. That sounds like a good thing to me. We have a contract when we buy a house or car, when we marry, and even when we get a credit card, so why not a contract where we work?
\
We pride ourselves on our freedoms in this country, our democracy and our due process, so why take them away at the workplace? In recent years, we have seen a decline in union membership in this country. At the same time, the middle class has lost ground and the gap between the rich and poor has continued to widen.
\
The middle class is struggling while CEOs are making outrageous salaries and perks. Unions protect workers in this country and make sure the working people are getting what they need to survive.
\
I am sorry that the letter writer had a bad experience from management as a result of a union organizing attempt at a firm on Wall Street a number of years ago.
\
As she stated, the $5 million the company once spent to fight the union could have been invested and put to good use and created $10 million of good will and happy employees.

Good luck to the school bus drivers.

Assure insurance
\
I read in the paper several weeks ago where S.C. Farm Bureau cancelled homeowner insurance in the coastal area.
\
Then Nationwide followed. Now Allstate is doing the same.
\
Where in the world are our elected reps? Why are they letting these companies get away with this? Where are the people who are hired, not elected, to watch over the insurance industry?
\
If the insurance companies won't sell us homeowner insurance, don't let them sell anything in this state. Someone should stand up for the people of Charleston and the coastal community. Insurance companies make a ton of money on auto insurance. I hope Gov. Sanford can do something about the insurance situation in this state.
\
I also read in the paper that Mount Pleasant Mayor Harry Hallman was asking for $5 million to widen Highway 17 from 41 to the Isle of Palms Connector.
\
I'm wondering why they haven't considered widening it about 10 miles further down Highway 17 North. We have the high school, the airport, soon the hospital, soon a Wal-Mart shopping center, probably over 6,000 homes and a big shopping center with offices, stores, etc. Maybe our mayor (who is doing a good job) could ask for $10 million.

Warming inevitable
\
As a part-time resident of Folly Beach, I read with interest two readers' letters taking issue with the positions of Fred Singer and Debra Saunders on global warming. Prior to my retirement two years ago from the federal government, I spent over 10 years in technical research on this issue. From my experience I reached the conclusion that most people have an oversimplified view of this complex and highly politicized topic.
\
One must first recognize that energy drives the economies of the industrial world. The rising cost of energy in recent decades has led to many improvements in efficiency, although there are practical limits that must be recognized. Second, as the standard of living rises worldwide, more energy will be needed, particularly if the world population continues to grow. Third, except for nuclear power, fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) will continue to be the most economical sources of energy. Wind, solar, and biomass can offset only a small percentage of demand for energy from these sources.
\
If you accept these facts, you will recognize that despite good intentions, attempts to have a significant effect on greenhouse-gas emissions, at least in the long term, is a pipe dream (no pun intended).
\
About all we can do is try to slow the increases that will inevitably occur, try to determine what future changes in the environment will result, and do our best to learn how to make the necessary adjustments to live with these changes.

Endangered freedom
\
I am opposed to the smoking of tobacco. I do not allow smoking in my home or business and it galls when smokers discard cigarette butts on my properties.
\
I avoid smoky environs. A few months ago I ceased doing business with a contractor because he and all of his employees are smokers and they took frequent smoke breaks while charging by the hour for their work.
\
After having read the above you might very well believe that I would agree with the soon to be proposed city of Charleston smoking ban and also those that have been enacted or might be enacted by other governmental bodies -- and you would be wrong.
\
While being personally opposed to smoking I would never presume to take away from another person or business the liberty of choosing to or not to smoke or allow others to do so on their premises.
\
I believe that we are living in the twilight time of liberty in this country and that the current rash of smoking bans is but one of many symptoms of the pathogen of tyranny infecting the body politic. It is acts of petty tyranny which open the door for gross tyranny. George Orwell, in his classic political novel ""1984,"" did an outstanding job of predicting and describing the petty and gross tyranny which we are beginning to experience. Without choice, of what value are any other liberties?

We save nothing
\
Reading a Dec. 25 article from The Associated Press regarding Waikiki's eroding beaches reminds me of one closer to home that's not as famous or crowded, but gets an equal amount of wasted efforts just the same. How is pumping in sand, and wasting millions of dollars to do so going to ""save"" Folly Beach? It's a tiny stretch of land that the Atlantic pounds constantly. What makes us so arrogant as to think we can stop this natural (and assisted) process of erosion?
\
Eventually, the configuration of Folly Beach will alter and may disappear altogether no matter what efforts are taken to thwart change.
\
After all, we learn about this likely action to be factual from history, geography and science teachers in grade school; we're taught lessons about Pangaea and how the continents continue to drift.
\
Unless we can figure out a way to stop the earth from churning and spewing magma, along with its rotation to halt the continents, and the moon's gravitational pull to still the oceans, the coasts will erode and the face of the earth will don new features.
\
Earth is not a person with feelings and emotions. Earth doesn't care that communities reside so close to its waters, along its fault lines, on top of its mountains, or at the bases of its volcanoes. Earth doesn't care that people are sentimental because it doesn't care that we even exist.
\
I realize the ineffectual ""saving"" of Folly Beach won't stop in my lifetime, if ever.
\
Mankind increasingly persists at seeing itself as Earth's savior and controller.
\
I wholeheartedly agree with a previous writer's sentiments. Humans are spoiled. Unfortunately, I've become a misanthrope as a result.

On sunny weekends when no one is working there, the Half-Moon Outfitters distribution center in North Charleston produces power for South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. instead of using it.
\
""We were the first 'net metering account' on SCE&G's system,"" said Beezer Molten, president and owner of the retailer that caters to kayakers, backpackers, hikers and other outdoor-sports enthusiasts. ""Our meter runs backwards on those weekends.""
\
The 9,800-square-foot distribution center, built in an old grocery store on East Montague Avenue, produces 14 percent of its power from two rows of solar panels atop the roof.
\
It is a model of energy efficiency, so much so that it was the first structure in South Carolina to capture the U.S. Green Building Council's highest Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design designation. That was in 2007.
\
The building incorporates not only energy-efficient bulbs but motion sensors that turn lights on and off. It also harnesses natural sunlight and shade for heating and cooling. Stormwater is collected for flushing toilets and irrigating native plants.
\
The warehouse also is equipped with low-flow water fixtures, a reflective white roof, extra attic insulation, salvaged building materials, and desktops made of compressed sunflower seed husks.
\
The building is so energy-efficient, it cost 6 cents per square foot for electricity compared to 37 cents per square foot for Half-Moon's store in Mount Pleasant in July. Heating and air use less energy than the lights, Molten said.
\
Because of the east-west configuration of the building, large windows on the east and south capture the winter sun and specially installed awnings block out the summer's most penetrating rays.
\
Molten expects the extra money he invested in the energy-efficient features will be recouped by 2014 through savings.
\
""Given that our stores are centered around the outdoors, we want to do what we can to help the environment,"" said Molten, an avid outdoor enthusiast. ""It's just the right thing to do.""

92,"Lower prices, energy crisis make alternative power more attractive\By Jason Zacher\ENVIRONMENTAL_WRITER\jzacher@greenvillenews.com\ARDEN, N.C. -- Ske Boniske hasn't paid a power bill in 10 years, but his lights still work at night, his house is cool in summer and he has plenty of hot water.\Boniske and his wife, Kitty, took themselves off the power grid 10 years ago -- the grid now called ""antiquated"" by federal officials -- and have had uninterrupted power ever since. They are among thousands of people nationwide drawing power from the sun.\It took a sizable up-front payment to go solar, but apart from a few lifestyle changes, like not draining the batteries watching what they call ""junk TV,"" the Boniskes have hardly missed a beat.\""It wasn't that big of a lifestyle adjustment,"" he said. ""Now, my wife just put me on the Atkins diet. That was a big adjustment.""\When the lights went out earlier this month for 50 million people in the Northeast and Midwest, an antiquated power grid was blamed. The Electric Policy Research Institute has estimated that fixing the nation's interconnected power grid will cost $100 billion -- or $355 for every man, woman or child in the United States. Solar enthusiasts are hoping people will use that number as a wake-up call for more decentralized, and environmentally friendly, power generation.\There are a number of obstacles keeping solar power from sweeping the country. Money is at the top of the list. Boniske said it adds 10 to 15 percent to the cost of building a new home. Estimates from the U.S. Department of Energy put the price between $16,000 and $40,000, depending on the size of the home and its energy efficiency.\That cost can be off-set with tax incentives and other laws that exist in a majority of states. South Carolina is one of 20 states that don't offer incentives for solar energy, according to the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy.\South Carolina stands in contrast to North Carolina, which offers a tax credit of 35 percent of the cost of the system, which can be applied toward income tax.\According to the N.C. Department of Revenue, that state gave 206 people a total of $734,008 in tax incentives from April 2002 to March 2003. From April 2001 to March 2002, 50 people divided $53,261 in solar energy credits.\""There's a payback over a period of years by not paying for commercial power, but there are no state incentives here,"" said D'Juana Wilson, with South Carolina's energy office.\Cutting the cord\A typical solar power system works like the one the Boniskes' have. The solar panels on his roof charge a bank of 32 golf cart batteries which could give him enough power up to 10 days if the panels suddenly stopped working. In Boniske's experience, the batteries are good for about 10 years and cost $170 each.\He switches his compact fluorescent lights off when he enters and leaves rooms, and uses solar tubing -- a kind of high-powered skylight that looks like a light fixture -- in closets and bathrooms. The only real change is one of attitude, he said. Living with solar power means being conscious about how much energy he uses.\""When school groups tour the home, I have to leave the television on so they know we can have a TV without being connected to the power company,"" he said.\But the Boniskes have added several innovations to their home to keep their power draw down. For air conditioning, they take in air from a hill behind the house and cool it by pumping the air six feet below the garage. Boniske said that is enough to keep his home in the mid-70s when it is 95 degrees outdoors.\He also has 110-volt appliances, uses propane to run his dryer and stove and uses the propane as a backup for his solar hot water heater in the winter.\""You couldn't do this if you had teenagers,"" he added.\Traditional ""cut""\Some who cut the cord leave themselves a little safety blanket. Stephen Morrison, 30, of Mountain Rest in Oconee County, runs his home and business off solar power, but still draws some electricity from the Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative for the large power tools for his custom woodworking business.\Morrison and his wife Chanda, 32, pay about $30 a month in electricity to run their home and a second large building that houses their two businesses. The solar panels produce enough power for their home, but not quite enough to run both.\""We're not trying to be isolationists or Unabombers,"" he said. ""We just took a look at our place in the world and are trying to reduce our impact.""\There are two advantages to using the grid as a backup. First, the Morrisons can draw from Blue Ridge if their solar power goes out and vice versa. And they have negotiated a deal where Blue Ridge will buy back their unused electricity. It took a little effort for the utility and the Morrisons to work out the deal, but they are expecting a credit soon that will cover about three months of their electric bills.\""If there's ever a problem with the solar stuff, we'll barely even know it,"" he said. ""Conversely, if the power goes out on the grid, we'll barely even know it.""\High costs\The biggest barrier for everyone considering solar energy is the high price, according to solar owners and the state energy office. But the cost has been going down.\Each watt of solar energy costs at least $6 to install, as of this month, according to Solarbuzz, a company that tracks solar pricing. That's down four-fold from the $27 per watt 20 years ago.\A typical home needs a 2- to 4-kilowatt system, according to the state energy office, and again, the size depends on a number of factors, including the energy efficiency of the home, the number of people living there and what appliances are used. A 4-kilowatt system would cost $33,200 according to the state.\""If you're talking a 40- to 60-year payback, you're not going to do it if you want to save money,"" said Bob Kosak, director of York Technical College's Energy Resource Center in Rock Hill.\Many states give tax breaks or other incentives for solar, but one incentive that costs states nothing, solar advocates say, is passing a ""net metering"" rule.\For people with solar and traditional power, the unused solar power flows back through the power grid. Net metering laws require electric utilities to pay for that power at about the same rate consumers pay for power.\Without net metering laws, people like the Morrisons have to negotiate special deals. The Morrisons pay about 8 cents per kilowatt hour for Blue Ridge's power and get 3 cents selling it back.\Thirty-eight states, including Georgia, have net metering laws. South Carolina doesn't have such a law, but the Greenville Sierra Club recently started a petition for the state legislature to pass one.\""It's a chicken and the egg argument,"" Kosak said. ""If we sell millions of them, the cost will come down, but if the costs are so high, how do we get people to buy millions of them?""\Cheaper options\For those who can't plunk down tens of thousands of dollars to switch over to solar power, there is one option that can cut their power bills -- using the sun just to heat their water. For a family of four, the state energy office estimates half of the power bill is from heating water.\Kosak said if a homeowner adds a solar water-heating system to his home when buying a new home or refinancing, the cost will add $15 a month to the mortgage. He also said a homeowner could save $30 to $40 a month on what they would pay for power or gas.\""It saves you money from day one,"" he said.\Ske Boniske and Stephen Morrison said they didn't go solar to save money. Like many other solar enthusiasts, they're in it so they're not drawing power from coal or nuclear power plants.\Boniske looked up at his solar panels and said, ""The only energy crisis in this nation is that we're not doing this.""\'Jason Zacher covers the environment and can be reached at 298-4272.\+ For more on solar energy systems and the government's Million Solar Roofs initiative, go to GreenvilleOnline.com and click on News.\He lets the sun shine in\Cutline: OWEN RILEY JR / Staff\Solar showplace: Ske Boniske's home near Arden, N.C., is powered by solar cells, behind him.

93,"A good piece of legislation can be judged on one simple question: Does this help the people of South Carolina? There is no doubt that after hours of conversation, research and careful debate, the S.C. Energy Freedom Act does exactly that. Building on the success of previous legislation, notably Act 236, this bill creates a sustainable future for solar in South Carolina.\Solar has become a major player in South Carolina's energy industry. When asked four years ago, I predicted that with Act 236, South Carolina would install 300 megawatts of solar generation by 2020. In 2019, we are already at 650 megawatts. This success has been gratifying and comes after years of operating in a yo-yo policy environment.\One critical policy is net metering, a straightforward policy to give solar customers fair credit for the excess electricity they generate and send back to the grid for local use. Net metering caps were put in place to control South Carolina's level of solar growth, ensuring that usage did not balloon too quickly. However, as with any industry, overly restrictive regulations have hampered growth. The caps have caused many companies to limit their investments and created uncertainty for the thousands of workers in the solar industry.\A recent report showed that South Carolina's solar workforce grew 5 percent in 2018, totaling nearly 3,000 jobs. While the increase shows strength, we still rank 25th in the nation, whereas solar employment has grown at a rate six times faster than the overall U.S. economy between 2013-18.\As an employer in the industry, expansion has proven difficult under the current limits on how many customers can count on net metering. How do I invest in new equipment or hire additional employees when I know our capacity cap is just a month away? How are my employees supposed to feel secure in their ability to provide for their families if these caps are restricting our ability to grow?\Solar is also extremely popular with South Carolina voters. A recent poll found that an overwhelming number of voters believe customers should have the choice to install solar.\Given the growing demand for clean energy, and the increasing role it is playing in South Carolina's economy, the solar industry simply needs stable policies with limited government restriction in order to continue its growth.\This challenging environment is now being recognized by those outside of the solar industry. The solar industry has come together with electric utilities, the environmental community and legislators to support the SC Energy Freedom Act to help the people of South Carolina address these issues.\This compromise brings all stakeholders together and hopefully begins a larger energy conversation throughout our state.\After receiving unanimous support in the S.C. House, I ask our senators to consider urgently moving this piece of legislation through the South Carolina Senate and toward a long-term solution.\In the 1970s, I saw our nation struggle as oil prices quadrupled. I knew then that something needed to be done, and at the age of 22 I started Sunstore Solar Energy Solutions. For decades, I have advocated for solar policies that would benefit our state and its people. Now, we are on the cusp of something great with the S.C. Energy Freedom Act.\The solar industry is simply asking for a fair chance to provide options for all South Carolinians.\I know that this legislation is what we need, and look forward to our state senators coming together and doing what is best for the citizens of South Carolina.\Bruce Wood has been a solar advocate in South Carolina since 1976, when he opened one of the first solar companies in South Carolina.\Your Turn\Bruce Wood\Guest columnist"

The notion is almost surreal -- rows on rows of mammoth propellers, each blade taller than a football field is long, whirling offshore just above the horizon.
\
The chances of seeing a wind farm in the ocean off South Carolina might be just that fantastic, even though it's getting a good hard look.
\
The cost of fitting the sea with wind turbines is too much to be worthwhile in the Southeast, where only winter winds approach the sustained strength needed to make a profit. The prospect of an intense hurricane devastating that investment is too real. Environmentalists worry about the impact of even this relatively benign power source on species like migrating birds along the busy Eastern flyway.
\
Other ""green power"" or renewable energy sources are a safer bet if a federal or state ""carbon tax,"" ""carbon credits"" or similar laws are passed.
\
A carbon tax is a charge for using carbon dioxide-emitting fuels - -
\
making energy such as gasoline, oil or coal more expensive and putting the revenue, ideally, into developing alternative energy sources like solar or fuel cells. Carbon credits are essentially
\
free passes to use a certain amount of carbon fuels, earned by conserving energy, developing or using other fuels or through donations.
\
There's new emphasis worldwide on using wind power because of new technology, an ever-escalating demand for power and international agreements on developing renewable energy. In the United States, the interest has been goaded by the prospect of the widely expected tax.
\
A handful of projects on land are in operation or under construction around the United States. The controversial Cape Wind project off Massachusetts is laboring its way through building the first offshore project in the United States, a $900 million expanse of 130 wind turbines along 25 square miles off Cape Cod.
\
Yet SCANA Corp. and Santee Cooper utilities are among those who came away from this year's Southeast Regional Offshore Wind Power Symposium with no plans to do any more than look on as other companies and countries take the lead producing electricity from the offshore breeze.
\
""It's on our radar screen. Right now, it doesn't make sense for us or, probably, our state,"" SCANA spokesman Robin Montgomery said.
\
""It's another one of those options we're looking at,"" said Laura Varn of Santee Cooper. But the cost and reliability are big questions. In the end, Santee Cooper will look at ""what's the best decision for our customers, for the environment and for our energy.""
\
Nicholas Rigas, director of the South Carolina Institute for Energy Studies, which helped put on the symposium, was disappointed, but said he thinks wind power has a future here, particularly if a carbon tax or government subsidy makes it more cost competitive. The state could also become a manufacturer of wind farm products, he said.
\
""I'm not giving up on this thing. I think it's a viable resource for South Carolina,"" Rigas said, adding, ""I think the utility companies are going to drag their feet on this, just like they are on net metering here in the South. I think it's going to take a grassroots effort.""
\
Net metering is a fledgling program in some states that allows people or businesses who generate their own electricity, for example through solar power, to feed that back into the power grid.
\
Bill Bulpitt, research engineer for Georgia Tech's Strategic Energy Institute, took part in a feasibility study of wind power off the Georgia coast that also hit the economics wall.
\
""It's feasible, for sure. It's just, how much do you want to spend? The quandary utilities in the Southeast are in is people want low rates and won't pay more for renewable energy. I believe in renewables, but in some cases there have to be draconian measures taken"" before they will be used, he said.

Julian and Teri Levin are revolutionaries of a sort here in the Lowcountry.
\
Instead of using standard wood framing for the walls and roof of the new house they are having built on Daniel Island, they decided to use a different material: Styrofoam.
\
About 8 inches thick, the Styrofoam is sandwiched between two pressboards and secured with an epoxy that makes the large panel capable of providing structural support.
\
This structural insulated panel system will cut the Levins' energy bills in half, according to industry data.
\
That means the Levins, in their small way, will demand less from coal- and gas-fired power plants and contribute less to the consequent degradation of the environment.
\
We spend 90 percent of our time inside, authors Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins write in their book, ""Natural Capitalism."" Buildings use one-third of the total energy we produce, two-thirds of our electricity and one-quarter of all harvested wood, and their construction requires 3 billion tons of raw materials every year.
\
What's more, the authors write, ""The massive inefficiencies that are causing environmental degradation almost always cost more than the measures that would reverse them.""
\
For most of human history, buildings merely provided shelter. Today, they slowly are being transformed from a passive architectural necessity to an active ecological participant. Instead of just keeping the natural environment out, some buildings now interact with the environment and, according to a growing number of architects, enhance lives.
\
Julian Levin, who plans to retire in July from his position as commander of the 437th medical group at the Charleston Air Force Base, is encouraged by the promises of green building. The Levins hired David and Amy Hill, who run The Verdi Group, a firm that specializes in sustainable design and green architecture.
\
David Hill speaks freely about native species, rainwater collection, space efficiencies, low-emissivity glass, insulation's R- value, rapidly renewable materials (such as bamboo and cork), gray water systems, off-gassing, passive solar heating, photovoltaics and net metering. But he knows that the eyes of most people will glaze over when confronted with green vocabulary, so he keeps the pitch for homebuyers simple.
\
""It will last longer, you'll feel better in it, your utility bills will be cut in half and we'll build it for the same price,"" he says.
\
Julian Levin was ready to do what his budget would allow. He says he considered solar and gray water systems. Gray water is used tap water that is treated and reused, generally for flushing toilets and watering lawns. However, Levin decided to limit the project to the structural insulated panels, which, according to his builder, added about 15 percent to the total cost. Levin isn't worried about the extra expense, though. He figures he'll recover it within five years. After that, it's all gravy, he says.
\
Levin's builder, Gene Seprish of Passailaigue Homes, says green options appeared on the radar screen only recently. ""Customer and builder awareness is up tremendously from 10 years ago,"" he says, and new leads seem to be doubling every year. Although, he says, the panel system has made headway in just 1 percent of the construction market today, Seprish is certain that will change dramatically over the next few years.
\
So is the Rev. Burt Keller, pastor of Circular Congregational Church. Keller is presiding over the church's first building project since 1890. But for Keller, the project is about more than responsible building, it's about education, ensuring an indigenous presence in Charleston and promoting the mission of the church.
\
""If there is going to be a genuine reformation from the ground up, it's going to be the recovery of the world of matter and a friendship with science that will lead the church forward,"" he says.
\
Besides overseeing the construction of a green building, Keller intends to gradually replant the churchyard with native plant species. Learning to use, and not abuse, the Earth is an incremental process, he says. ""It's the little gestures ... that come from sensitive people determined to do something in our present culture that may change things.""
\
Stephen Cofer-Shabica, a member of the church, is the coordinator of the project. When it was decided to add a new building to the church campus, making it green was a no-brainer, he says. ""We've been talking green for years.""
\
Cofer-Shabica, an oceanographer by trade, has direct experience with global warming and its effects. Thirty-five years after completing his graduate research in Antarctica, the glacier he studied has completely collapsed.
\
Circular's new building will have a green roof, geothermal system for heating and cooling and a rainwater collection system. The church engaged a prominent Raleigh-based architect, Frank Harmon, to design the solution. A normal roof will reach temperatures of 150 degrees in summer, he says, but a green roof will reach only about 100 degrees, reducing the necessity to cool the inside of the structure.
\
The flora that covers it will absorb carbon dioxide (the leading contributor to global warming), emit oxygen and capture rainwater, reducing the runoff that carries pollutants to rivers and ocean, Harmon says. The roof garden also will provide aesthetic value in the form of a peaceful respite for the building's users, and it will last twice as long as a traditional roof.
\
""We're not ideologues. We're doing this to make a pleasant living environment,"" he says. ""If you create a building that people don't love, what's the use?""
\
The new 3,000-square-foot building will cost the church $750,000, says Cofer-Shabica.
\
The geothermal system, a network of pipes and pumps that carries water 100 feet under the earth, where temperatures remain at a constant 50 degrees, will cost $15,000.
\
More than $1 million was raised by the 350-member congregation to pay for the project, says Cofer-Shabica.
\
""But what you can't really measure in terms of cost is the philosophical value to the people in the congregation,"" he says. ""It's in line with our beliefs in terms of how you should be living.""

Two strong men
\
Adam Parker's recent article outlines the challenges facing our Episcopal diocese and the national church. Bishop Mark Lawrence is a small man in stature, but extremely large in spiritual and intellectual maturity.
\
In 1961, I, along with other recruits from Parris Island, was unloaded at Camp Geiger for combat training. On entering the barracks a very large recruit was acting like he was the leader and started bullying other recruits.
\
His mistake was that he bumped into a very short recruit from Louisiana. A brief argument was stopped by our gunnery sergeant who said, ""Put on the gloves."" Having boxed in college, I figured this small recruit was going to be killed by the giant bully.
\
A fair right and a left smack in the jaw of the bully put him on the deck and it took several minutes to restrain this small man from killing the bully.
\
It turns out the small recruit was the lightweight Golden Glove champion of Louisiana.
\
In the spirit world Mark Lawrence is a giant of a man. While I don't doubt the sincerity of those who oppose him, I would urge them to pray long and hard for God's wisdom. It is important to pray daily for Bishop Lawrence, Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori and the House of Bishops.

A better idea
\
Berkeley Electric is proposing to spend $10 million to $16 million to construct a 115 KV transmission line through the woods or over the river to provide better service to the part of McClellanville that receives power from their cooperative.
\
This is my proposal: Take, say, $12 million of those dollars and add them to your fund to weatherize houses and to subsidize local wind and solar projects. Net metering would provide power to the local houses and businesses without the trauma to the environment that high power lines risk. Significantly reducing demand would serve us much better that bringing in vastly more power.
\
We live down river from Berkeley's power plants, and already we can't eat fish from the rivers because of arsenic and other heavy metals that come from coal-fired power plants. We need to be able to breathe the air and to drink the water. We can learn to use less energy.

Programs for gifted and talented children are being cut from many public school curriculums. PSA was created to address the needs of these kids who learn differently, so they get the attention and challenging curriculum that will enable them to excel using their gifts.
\
Parental involvement is essential in schools like this, especially since there is no school-funded transportation and parents are responsible for ensuring attendance. Charter schools in general are governed by administrators and parents. The letter writer's contention that parents are not involved and are not ""the driving force behind their kids' public education"" is inaccurate. Rather, most charter schools exist because parents were concerned about their children's education.
\
Five of the 10 schools listed on the S.C. Public Charter School website are virtual schools where admission is mostly open. Others, like PSA, have admission via lottery selection. This method is an ""open-door policy"" that the writer feels is lacking.
\
Until the South Carolina public school system finds a way to meet the needs of our children's education, I encourage parents to actively seek alternative education sources, such as charter schools, to ensure that the education provided to their children is the best possible choice for them.

Protesters
\
During Nancy Pelosi's attendance at a fundraiser at Fish Restaurant Sept. 25, Tea Party protesters marched in front of the restaurant, and also threw manure at the establishment.
\
Is it part of good old American values to pitch manure? Or is throwing manure a metaphor for Tea Party politics?

Campus expansion
\
Andrew Sorenson, Ph.D, the immediate past president of the University of South Carolina, supports expanding the undergraduate medical class at the School of Medicine at USC by expanding a campus in Greenville. There is a current and a projected shortage of physicians -- especially those who will care for our aging population. But I don't feel the proposal will have the desired impact on the country's dysfunctional and expensive health care delivery system.
\
Increasing undergraduate medical school slots per se will not solve the workforce issue. It could possibly exacerbate the maldistribution of physicians as the inevitable increase in the cost of medical schools associated with expansion leads graduates to seek higher-paying specialties rather than much needed specialties of primary care.
\
The Center for Workforce Studies of the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) presented in March 2010 a report on ""Physician Workforce and GME Trends"" that indicated that by 2014 there will be a 34 percent increase in undergraduate medical education slots compared to 2002. However, it takes three to seven years at a minimum after medical school to train a qualified physician, and that involves graduate medical education (GME).
\
We can expect less than 1 percent growth, if any, in graduate medical education slots annually unless federal funding is increased. Medicare funds GME, and Medicare is less than healthy, while financially stressed hospitals are less than likely to offer GME opportunities.
\
The other reality is that physicians tend to locate in the geographic areas of post graduate (GME) training. We could find our state funding undergrad med students to solve the doctor shortage of another state.
\
A new medical school is already under way in the Upstate of South Carolina. The new class associated with the Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine is expected to begin soon in Spartanburg. How many medical schools can our state afford -- especially with no place to train the graduates of those schools?

Mixed messages
\
The statement that many politicians and leaders routinely make -- ""America is a Christian nation"" -- deserves questioning. What do those words mean and what message do they send to Americans of other religions? This state is filled with countless variations of self-proclaimed Christians. Yet the primary precepts attributed to Christ -- love, mercy, justice, peace and forgiveness -- seem to have been lost in translation. ""God bless America,"" a favorite ending to many political speeches, has become just another cliche. It would be refreshing to hear a candidate conclude with ""I'll do my very best to serve all of you.""
\
Apparently, political ideology, partisanship and religious zealotry have become more important than making cooperative decisions for the greater good; individual and group power more important than working toward a common goal; acquisition of wealth more important than conservation and sustainability of resources. We desperately need leaders who brainstorm, who will work diligently and who have sincerity of purpose and personal integrity.
\
If the money spent on political campaigns was instead used to fund essential programs or infrastructure projects or to pay down state and national debt, some of our problems would quietly resolve. It is a travesty that due to a Supreme Court decision, political war chests can now be filled to the brim by unidentified corporations and unions and non-profits. Sadly, the practice of influencing and buying votes has become routine. So much for the principle of democracy that we are trying to spread throughout the world.
\
Finally, I request political candidates not to disappoint us with worn-out rhetoric and promises that cannot be guaranteed. Too many times, deeds haven't matched up with promises.

Hotel expansions
\
Re the Sept. 26 editorial titled ""Local hotel growing pains"":
\
I recently moved here from New York City and have worked in the hotel industry in Europe and America for over 25 years.
\
I'm following your features on a possible hotel industry expansion with great interest. I empathize with concerns of hoteliers in Charleston over their market share but suggest that other economic factors may be in play.
\
I have seen the same reaction numerous times in cities with similar business and cultural profiles.
\
In every case, an increased choice of accommodation has led to growth in overall guest numbers and has allowed that destination to grow its profile and popularity.
\
Charleston may be at risk to sell itself short by not opening up to new hotel types and a wider market segmentation which will attract more guests. Can Charleston support 610 more hotel rooms? Of course, it translates to a maximum of 1,220 people, bringing their business to our city.
\
Charleston can support this modest expansion. Consider the benefit to the city in the opportunity to receive co-marketing funds from brands new to this market and the training and human resource support needed by these brands to ensure their service levels and standard. Yes, the influx of new hotels may initially create more competition for existing operators. But competition is the best assurance for hotels to feature high quality service, and it pushes hotel owners to invest the capital necessary.
\
I am confident that well-managed growth in hotel capacity will bring more visitors to Charleston and result in discretionary spending that will help merchants, the city and hospitality industries.

Teacher evaluations
\
In an old Dennis the Menace comic strip, Dennis claims to have taught his dog Ruff to whistle. OK, Dennis concedes, Ruff didn't learn very well, but that doesn't mean Dennis wasn't a great teacher. Sure it's funny, but Dennis has a point.
\
If the school board bases teacher evaluation on student test scores -- that is, on what students do rather than on what teachers do -- will they take into account the number of days the students miss class? What about the number of times students don't do their homework? Will the board control for students who don't get adequate sleep, don't eat right, or take drugs? Teachers can't control any of these variables, yet they can all affect test scores.
\
Do we evaluate coaches on their won/lost record? Yes. But unlike coaches, teachers don't get to recruit their students. They do the best they can with anybody who shows up in their classroom. So let's drop the sports analogies and stick with the classroom.
\
Sure, evaluate teachers on what they do -- but not on what somebody else does or doesn't do.

Murkowski's game
\
Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was unable to accept the idea of giving up her seemingly anointed status in Congress so she has decided to run as a write-in candidate.
\
This could result in a number of votes lost for Miller (the Republican primary winner) and could very well lead to a Democrat winning the Senate seat from Alaska.
\
Such self-serving, myopic attitudes by elected officials have much to do with the sad shape the country is in.
\
Apparently Ms. Murkowski would gladly risk putting another rubber stamp of the Obama agenda in office in hopes of retaining the seat she feels entitled to.
\
Of course, she is not unique in her lust for power and perks. She's simply part of a generation that is stealing the wealth and well-being of future generations in order to satisfy their own immediate selfish desires.
\
Shame on the shameless!

'Welfare of living'
\
Keep electing ""family values"" ideologue Republicans to office and let's see if South Carolina can be No. 1 in the number of people without health insurance (656,00 with no Medicaid), unemployment, high-school dropouts, worst roads and bridges and the lowest taxes.
\
Those ""family values"" folks are pro-life except when it comes to the welfare of living men, women and children of this state.

"
97,"After keeping a climate study secret for nearly two years, South Carolina's wildlife agency publicly released the report in the spring of 2013 amid criticism that it had bottled up the information for political reasons.\The study called on the wildlife department to take a leadership role in addressing a variety of climate-related problems — ranging from the invasion of exotic wildlife to extensive flooding — that were expected as temperatures increase, rains fall harder and seas rise.\But the wildlife department report wasn't the only study to call for action on climate in South Carolina. Five years earlier, a special task force appointed by Gov. Mark Sanford recommended more than 50 ways to stop rising greenhouse gas pollution from worsening global warming.\Today, those reports remain on the shelf in a state where residents are increasingly feeling the uncomfortable effects of climate change. Criticized by powerful electric utilities and political appointees, the studies never resulted in a comprehensive state climate strategy to guide South Carolina leaders as the globe warms.\Unlike North Carolina, South Carolina's failure to develop a comprehensive climate plan means the state has no overall effort to cut greenhouse gas pollution, limit sprawl or educate the public on how to adapt to the changing climate. And while the state has made strides in encouraging the use of solar power, the future of solar expansion in South Carolina remains unresolved.\Why is this important? Powerful changes to the landscape are rippling across South Carolina.\Rising seas, in part the result of warmer water and melting glaciers, are flooding coastal property in Charleston and sending salty water farther up rivers near Georgetown, threatening to spread disease.\Four hurricanes and a major flood in the past five years, suspected to be linked to global warming, have swamped South Carolina, killing more than 30 people, pushing toxins into yards and causing billions of dollars in damage. Nichols, a tiny town in eastern South Carolina, has been flooded so frequently it resembles a ghost town.\Heavy rains, a sign of the Earth's changing climate, have flooded crops in rural communities at key harvest times, causing state financial bailouts to farmers. Between those times of intense precipitation, extended periods of dry weather have put a strain on groundwater that Aiken-area residents need for drinking.\At the same time, increasingly hot summers are making life miserable, if not outright dangerous, for inner city residents who can't afford to run air conditioning.\""We are vulnerable,"" said former Department of Natural Resources chief John Frampton, who was forced out as director more than a year before the wildlife agency's climate report was finally released. ""We happen to have one of the most valuable environmental habitats of any state on the East Coast. Absolutely we ought to be looking at that. Why not?""\Hamilton Davis, a former energy director at the Coastal Conservation League, said South Carolina leaders aren't thinking enough about addressing climate change on a broad-scale.\""We are not having that conversation in South Carolina today because there is no vision, no expectation that is driving this,"" said Davis, now an executive with a solar energy company. ""What we're doing is a little bit ad hoc and kind of piecemeal.""\Ideally, a climate action strategy would include two key components: a comprehensive initiative to cut greenhouse emissions and an effort to systematically respond to climate-related changes in South Carolina communities, said Trish Jerman, a former state Energy Office official who has tracked climate issues for more than 20 years.\Some question whether a small state like South Carolina could have much impact in reducing global greenhouse gas pollution that is causing the Earth to warm. But boosters of a statewide plan say the effort would show leadership, and it would dovetail with efforts by other states to cut emissions.\For now, rather than attacking climate change head-on, South Carolina leaders are taking disjointed steps and often are reacting to the looming crisis, critics say.\In some cases, South Carolina leaders have even approved or pushed for rules that could encourage development along flood-prone beaches and rivers. Rollbacks in beachfront protection regulations are among them.\Meanwhile, at the local level, some cities that have attempted to address climate change are struggling to carry out their own climate plans without support from the state or federal governments.\Davis said the state should pay attention to North Carolina's efforts.\North Carolina's comprehensive climate strategy, put in place by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper about two years ago, includes goals to put thousands of zero emission vehicles on the road, reduce energy use in state offices, cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 2005 levels and brace for the effects of climate change in North Carolina communities. Cooper also formed a climate commission to make sure the comprehensive effort to address climate change stays on course.\South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican and booster of President Donald Trump, is cool to the idea of a statewide climate plan, saying it could create more bureaucracy.\""No, there isn't any climate plan in South Carolina, but there also doesn't need to be one,"" McMaster spokesman Brian Symmes said. ""It's incumbent upon individuals, state agencies, and businesses to do what they can to be good stewards of the environment. Between regulations handed down by the feds, and the free market's demand for businesses to be environmentally conscious, private industry is more than capable of adapting to a 21st century economy without imposing more regulations.""\McMaster's office said the governor has done plenty. He recently signed a bill to help the solar industry, formed the state Floodwater Commission and supports investing $9.3 million in cleaner-running school buses and public buses, his supporters say. McMaster has proposed hiring a chief resilience officer, who would coordinate responses to ""future crises as they arise.""\The way things looked 13 years ago, it appeared South Carolina was on track to develop an aggressive, statewide climate strategy. That's when Gov. Sanford formed a 28-member commission to study how rising global temperatures were affecting the state — and what South Carolina could do about it.\Sanford, a maverick Republican and a moderate on environmental issues, said at the time he had seen the effects of climate change on his Beaufort County farm, where pine trees were dying from encroaching salt water and the roots of dead hardwood trees lay exposed in areas flooded by rising sea levels.\The executive order that founded the committee said global warming could hurt the state's economy and its quality of life, while costing the state government money.\Sanford then persuaded scientists, government officials, business people, farmers, politicians, utility executives and environmentalists to serve on his Climate, Energy and Commerce Advisory Committee.\The commission's formation, however, drew almost immediate criticism from the state Chamber of Commerce, which said addressing climate change should be handled at the national level.\Then, as the commission began meeting regularly to discuss climate, it became increasingly evident that two of South Carolina's biggest utilities, SCE&G and state-owned Santee Cooper, didn't like the direction the committee was taking in addressing global warming, some committee members said. Eastern South Carolina's Progress Energy, now a part of Duke Energy, also was uncomfortable with some of the discussions, records show.\Retired state Energy Office chief John Clark, a member of Sanford's climate task force, said it was clear that utilities with seats on the committee didn't want the state taking aggressive action on climate change.\""They actively opposed any requirements for utilities to incorporate renewable energy into the electric utility generation mix,"" Clark said, noting that Duke Energy was the only utility willing to seriously discuss action.\Records obtained by The State show that utilities with representatives on Sanford's climate commission favored using nuclear power over renewable energy to attack greenhouse gas pollution — a stance that later haunted SCE&G and Santee Cooper.\In 2017, the companies drew the public's wrath for bungling the V.C. Summer nuclear construction project. The decision to quit the project, which followed years of raising rates to pay for two new reactors northwest of Columbia, ultimately led to the acquisition of a weakened SCE&G by Virginia utility giant Dominion Energy. The companies had spent $9 billion when they walked away.\In an Aug. 28, 2008, letter to climate committee chairman Ben Hagood, then a Republican state representative from Charleston, SCE&G chief executive Kevin Marsh said he could not endorse the entire climate study because some proposals ""could have negative consequences for SCE&G's customers and on South Carolina's economic competitiveness.""\The climate committee eventually hammered out a report that called for reducing greenhouse gases in South Carolina by 5% below 1990 levels, a modest goal compared to other states. The goal could be achieved in South Carolina by the target date of 2020 if the state would adopt more than 50 different recommendations, the study said.\Sanford's plan, however, never got very far in the Legislature because power companies let politicians know they were uncomfortable with it, Clark said.\Hagood, who retired from the Legislature the same year the Sanford climate report was released, said recommendations from the governor's committee didn't gain much traction with his colleagues or Sanford.\""I don't think there was the political will to do much at the time,"" he said.\Clark lays part of the blame on Sanford, who he said didn't pound the table to get key recommendations approved by the Legislature.\""He went from being proactively supporting this to being neutral,"" Clark said\Sanford said the climate task force was never intended to be the final say on climate.\The idea was to acknowledge the problem and begin discussing it ""in the hope that, by doing so, more people will begin to address the obvious,"" said Sanford, who also served in Congress and briefly challenged Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination for president.\Dominion Energy declined comment on past SCE&G participation in the Sanford climate panel. But the company said it is committed to addressing climate change with reduced carbon emissions. The company also said it has seen a substantial increase in solar power use in its South Carolina service territory.\Santee Cooper also declined comment on its participation in the Sanford committee and on whether the state needs an overall climate plan. The company did say it has closed two coal plants and plans to shutter a third one to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which should contribute to a 30% decrease in carbon dioxide pollution by Santee Cooper, as compared to 2015. The company says it has shifted its reliance on coal from 77% in 2008 to 46% today.\No state agency contacted by The State newspaper has been keeping track of whether any recommendations in the Sanford report have been adopted, but South Carolina has taken some steps that could help lower carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.\The state has adopted two solar friendly laws since 2014 that industry boosters say have helped sun power grow in South Carolina. Energy efficiency also has become more of an emphasis in South Carolina since 2008 as the public has demanded ways to lower some of the nation's highest electricity bills.\But the solar issue remains unresolved in South Carolina, with battles ahead over pricing that could determine whether solar lives or dies in the long-run. And many of the Sanford report's cornerstone recommendations remain unaddressed by the S.C. Legislature, former state Energy Office executives Clark and Jerman said.\Among those recommendations was a requirement that utilities rely on renewable energy to supply 5% of the power they generate and distribute. The proposal — called a renewable portfolio standard, or RPS — was similar to what has been required in other states, including North Carolina.\""North Carolina is one of the only states that has an RPS in the Southeast, but a lot of others — like us — have done more of a piecemeal approach,"" said Tyson Grinstead, a government affairs representative of the Sunrun solar company. Grinstead said the solar industry is working to expand without a renewable portfolio standard, ""but it would be a good thing if South Carolina wanted to do it.""\Today, less than 1% of the energy produced in South Carolina comes from wind and solar, according to the S.C. Office of Regulatory Staff. Most renewable energy sources are from hydroelectric energy produced by dams, about 2.3%. In comparison, about 95% of the energy produced in South Carolina comes from coal, nuclear and natural gas.\One of the most important parts of the Sanford climate report was a recommendation that the state update the plan every five years. Jerman, the former energy office official, said that was never done.\Clark and fellow Sanford commission panel member Stephen Smith, director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said South Carolina could have met the goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels if state leaders had closely followed recommendations.\""You not only would have hit the target, you would have exceeded the target,"" Smith said. ""There is a certain momentum that takes hold in states that adopt these things.""\South Carolina's carbon dioxide emissions reached a 30-year peak in 2004, at 87 million metric tons, federal statistics show. Since that time, they have dropped to 69 million metric tons, in part because of federal efforts to cut greenhouse gas pollution and increased reliance on natural gas.\Still, carbon dioxide emissions in South Carolina have not dropped to 5% below 1990 levels, as recommended by the Sanford climate committee, according to statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\South Carolina generates more carbon dioxide pollution than 23 states and roughly the same amount as countries such as Austria, Greece and Israel, according to the Center for Climate Strategies, a Washington, D.C., group that helped with the Sanford climate report.\By failing to embrace the climate report and keep it updated, the state has missed an opportunity to aggressively address climate change, the Southern Alliance's Smith said. A comprehensive state climate strategy, like the one in North Carolina, is overdue, Smith said.\""You would set an aspirational target that is aligning the arrows of state government,"" Smith said. ""You look at what Roy Cooper's doing, and there are so many departments and so many agencies (involved). If you can get the power of government in alignment, you can do a lot of good.""\The 2013 Department of Natural Resources report, commissioned under then-agency chief Frampton, presented a chilling assessment about the looming effects of climate change on wildlife and the landscape.\Written by an 18-member study group that included biologists and veteran agency officials, the study said South Carolina should brace for an invasion of exotic wildlife and a loss of native species as temperatures warm and sea levels rise. Warmer temperatures would mean animals, such as Asian swamp eels and other non-native species that have taken hold in Florida, could migrate north to South Carolina, the study said. It warned that some species of fish would dwindle as oxygen levels declined and hotter seawater killed the tiny food sources they thrive on.\In addition to the effects on wildlife, the report warned that rising seas and increased flooding would cause troubles for people living along the coast and rivers of South Carolina. The predictions are similar to what's happening in Charleston, Nichols and other areas today.\To tackle these and other future problems, the report said the Department of Natural Resources should take a lead role in educating the public about the threats of global warming and increase climate-related scientific research. It recommended acquiring land to protect habitat, adopting strategies to deal with the effects of climate change on agency properties, developing partnerships with other agencies and ""leading by example.""\But the draft study ran into trouble in the summer of 2011 that kept it out of the public eye for nearly two years — and likely chilled the agency's enthusiasm for addressing climate change since that time.\At a board meeting in Edisto Beach, a remote coastal community well away from the spotlight of the agency's Columbia headquarters, then-board members Caroline Rhodes and Cary Chastain took issue with the report's findings.\""You don't want to falsely build a case and scare people,"" Chastain said during the meeting. He could not be reached for comment for this story.\Later that year, Rhodes — appointed as board chairman by Gov. Nikki Haley after Haley took office in 2011 — led the charge to oust Frampton as Department of Natural Resources director, which deep sixed the climate report. Haley had been elected on a pro-business agenda, raising questions about her commitment to environmental issues. Haley had nothing to do with Frampton's departure, her office said at the time. But it was never clear why he was pushed out.\The report remained hidden, out of the public eye, until The State newspaper reported in 2013 that the study had not been released. The DNR then released the report and sought public comments.\Since then, the DNR has used some individual recommendations in the report, but it has not established a specific climate action plan, said Robert Boyles, the agency's recently appointed director.\With state and federal guidance lacking, some of South Carolina's cities, including Columbia, have announced their own efforts to tackle climate change through plans to use more renewable energy and rely on cleaner burning cars and trucks. Some of the effort comes in response to President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas pollution that is driving up temperatures and causing sea level rise.\Columbia has established a goal of the city relying 100% on clean and renewable energy during the next 16 years.\Major initiatives tackled by the city include building a solar farm to help power Columbia's wastewater treatment plant, one of the largest users of energy in the city. The city also is updating its water meter system, which will reduce leaks, and it has a systematic plan to take polluting, city-owned vehicles off the road.\But the city isn't moving fast enough, say some people who are following the city's efforts. Columbia hasn't completed 42 of the 67 climate goals it has established, according to the city's website.\""The pledge is not the hard thing,"" said Penny Cothran, an organizer with the Sierra Club in South Carolina.\""The hard thing is delivering on the pledge.""\The city has plenty of work to do if it wants to reach the clean and renewable energy goal by 2036. Part of that is persuading Dominion Energy and state electric cooperatives to provide the clean and renewable energy Columbia wants, Cothran said.\University of South Carolina professor Lori Ziolkowski, chair of the city's Climate Protection Action Committee, said that, overall, the city's plan isn't aggressive enough.\Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, a one-time president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said he's pleased with the city's efforts, particularly since little leadership on climate is occurring at the federal and state levels. The city is planning to roll out updates to its climate plan this month.\Many of the city's climate goals are still underway, he said. One major effort is restoring a hydroelectric plant that was knocked out during a historic flood that swamped the city in 2015. When that work is completed, the hydro's 10 megawatt production should be enough to provide energy for 10,000 homes, the mayor said.\Benjamin acknowledged Columbia still has challenges.\""There are a number of cities across the state that are doing some things, and across the country, but it's difficult with a lack of state leadership or federal leadership,"" Benjamin said, noting that ""we're not giving up.""\Cothran, an organizer with the Sierra Club in South Carolina, said that while she'd like the city to move faster, Columbia's efforts are appreciated. Columbia is the only city in South Carolina to commit to the Sierra Club's ""Ready for 100"" campaign, the program to use 100% renewable energy by 2036, Cothran said.\Perhaps the closest things to active, statewide climate plans are the state's energy plan and one produced in 2019 through Gov. McMaster's office. But neither look comprehensively at a wide range of climate issues, critics say.\The governor's Floodwater Commission report, compiled by a group that includes business people, university professors and state government officials, offers recommendations on how to control flooding caused by rising sea levels and more frequent storms. Among other things, the Floodwater Commission report says the state should protect wetlands, look for environmentally sensitive ways to keep salt marshes from eroding and protect power lines and electrical generating stations.\Critics say the report, which exceeds 600 pages, is heavy on background and also includes questionable recommendations.\The report doesn't say much about other impacts from climate change, such as the threat of increasing forest fires, the advance of disease-carrying insects due to hot weather or how heat is affecting the poor. It also doesn't focus on what South Carolina can do to reduce carbon emissions that are among the leading causes of climate change.\Chaired by a former hazardous waste industry lobbyist, the commission included recommendations in its report that would allow for an increase in development near lakes and rivers, instead of moving development away from potentially flood-prone areas.\The study says the state should consider establishing experimental artificial reefs to limit beach erosion, while building more lakes and channelizing rivers to attack flood problems. In one case, the study suggests developing a lake in rural Marion County, where the small community of Nichols is located.\""I certainly would not describe it as a plan addressing climate change, at all,"" said Barry Beasley, a retired DNR biologist who is among a group of scientists critical of the Floodwater Commission report.\""Climate change is a much bigger issue than flooding.""\CREDIT: Sammy Fretwell"
